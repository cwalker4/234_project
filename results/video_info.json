I've quarter sawn a ton of wood on our LT40 and LT70 Wide, but I've never turned the log into an octagon first. I have cut from 8 angles the way you did, I just squared up the octagonal sides later. I'll be trying your method soon when I get a load of red oak, it'll definitely speed things up!\n\nThe only thing I'd suggest, have you tried running two cants at once? For red oak you can normally get away with 20+ inches of cut with no cut quality issues, though I'd never try that in white oak or hard maple, that's a whole different world. It helps a lot quarter sawing smaller logs and minimizing the number of narrow cuts I do on a sharper blade.\n\nFor example, using the timing in the video, at 6:20, after you split the log, you could flip and continue cutting both halves. Then at 6:45 you would have the bottom of both halves which you could flip and take cuts off of at the same time (flipping two cants takes a little practice with the clamp and chain roller, or on the LT40 no practice with a cant hook and a helper you can watch...).  Then if you like tempting fate (not really), at 6:55 you'd have two cants to cut the angle off of (light clamp pressure and there's no reason the blade would pull the cants around). Then at 7:30 you'd have two cants back to back (I don't know why you flat-sawed the previous wedge though, so that affects things if you need to cut the cants two different ways!)", "The is something about watching a great operator and his mill do their stuff........

Wenn wir HEUTE das Licht einer Galaxie empfangen, das Milliarden Jahre zu uns unterwegs war und stark rotverschoben ist, knnen wir doch nur den Zustand dieser Galaxie von vor ebensoviel Milliarden Jahre messen und sehen, was einen Blick in die Vergangenheit bedeutet. Das bedeutet doch aber nicht, da dieese Galaxie sich heute in demselben Zustand befindet, wie damals, als es das bei uns heute sichtbare Licht ausgesandt hat.

Wir haben wohl auch keine Mglichkeit, den derzeitigen Zustand dieses Objekts zu ermitteln.\n\nAnders ausgedrckt: wir wissen nicht, wie das Objekt heute aussieht, wir wissen nicht, wo es sich befindet und in welcher Geschwindigkeit und Richtung es sich gerade bewegt. Wahrscheinlich werden wir das auch nie wissen, wenn es stimmt, das nichts schneller ist, als das Licht.\n\nAlso aus der Rotverschiebung von derart entfernten Objekten oder sogar noch weiter entfernten daraus zu schlieen, da sich das Universum HEUTE noch ausdehnt, steht meines Erachtens nach auf sehr wackeligen Beinen.

Die Beobachtung, da die nheren Objekte in der galaktischen Nachbarschaft sich auf uns zu bewegen bzw. vor z.B. wenigen Millionen Jahren sich auf uns zubewegt haben, wrde doch eher den Schlu zulassen, da das Universum nicht mehr expandiert, eventuell sogar schrumpft.

In decades of patient detective work, fortuitous encounters, endless energy, and obsessive ambition, he discovered a fabulous horde of jewellery - Priam's Treasure - at a multilayered site he was convinced was Troy. He was right about the location, but wrong about the treasure (by 2000 years and several levels of excavation). In his quest for \"authenticity\", Schliemann even married a young Greek woman, making her desperately unhappy until she resigned herself to her role as his muse and helper. Schliemann managed to hide some of his most valuable finds from the Turkish authorities. But Priam's Treasure is no longer in Berlin, where he presented it as a gift to the German nation. The Soviets took it to Moscow at the end of WWII and show no sign of giving it back.

It is believed the base held two full fighter squadrons, or 48 fighter jets. \n\nThe more interesting part of the base was the underground bunkers, capable of surviving a 20kt nuclear blasts, and being self sustainable for up to 30 days. \n\nAfter it was apparent that the Yugoslav Wars of 91 were not going their way, the air base was destroyed by the Yugoslavian government. Nowadays, it is sometimes used for police training, but its primary purpose is an awesome urban exploration spot. \n\n5.Devil's Slide Bunkers\nLOCATION - CALIFORNIA\n\nThe Devil\u2019s Slide is an aptly named area of the Pacific Coastline close to the city of Montara. It definitely looks like it was airlifted from the rocky Mediterranean coast.\n\nOne of the hills was part of a military triangulation station designed during WW2. It served its purpose of protecting the harbor of San Francisco from the threat of a Japanese military attack. \n\nThe bunker is still standing to this day, barely, but its still there. The area is prone to landslides and heavy erosion, chances are that the Devil\u2019s Slide Bunker will slip into the Pacific Ocean sometime soon, so pack your bags if you want to see it in person. Beware of the current owners too, the area is now private property ! \n\n4.RAF Stenigot\nLOCATION - ENGLAND\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the site of a downed UFO, as much as we want to believe the truth is out there, this is not it.\n\nRAF is an acronym for the British Royal Air Force, and the stenigot site was a radar station used for the early detection of Nazi Air Raids. \n\nAfter the war, the Stenigot got a major facelift, and the 4 dishes that we see in these pictures, as part of the ACE High programme. ACE High stands for Allied Command Europe and it was a radio communication system created by NATO in 1956. \n\nAs the years passed, there was less and less need for this location, it was officially decommissioned in the late 80\u2019s. \n\nBut, still, it looks pretty strange from a far.  \n\n3.CAPE MAY BUNKER\nLOCATION - NEW JERSEY\n\nDon\u2019t you just hate it when you go to the beach, and the only available spots to relax are right next to an abandoned WW2 era bunker?

Striking only during the winter months along the Atlantic coast, these northeastern storms can have up to 75-mile-per-hour winds and waves of 15 feet or more. They have covered entire towns along the coast in water and are much worse for boats that are caught in these storms while at sea. From the famous Portland Gale of 1898 in Maine to the \"perfect storm\" of 1991, these storms have been some of the most fierce and destructive in New England history. Experts David Ball and Fred Freitas, co-authors of Warnings Ignored, and John Galluzzo of the Lifesaving Museum in Hull, MA, all talk about the ravishing effect of these nor'easters.

When I finally got home (a long and complicated trip)e I couldn't get up the driveway.  There was so much snow that my feet couldn't reach the ground to give me any push.  I figured out I could spread out my coat like a giant snowshoe and \"swim\" up the driveway.  It took me about 20 minutes to go the 40 feet.

There are more awesome videos being made every week, like and subscribe to World Unearthed so you don't miss a beat !\n\n10.Joliet prison | Illinois\n\n9.16th Street Station | California\n\n8.SS Francisco Morazan | Michigan\n\n7.Astrodome | Texas\n\nThe NRG Astrodome opened in 1962, it was the first of its kind domed sports stadium and was nicknamed the \u201c8th Wonder of the World\u201d, making all these videos has made me realize that there are way too many 8th Wonders of the World\u2026. \n\nThe stadium was a prosperous business venture for many years, with baseball and football teams sharing it, and of course, who can forget the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo ?\n\nIn 2005, the astrodome was used as a shelter for residents of New Orleans that were affected by Hurricane Katrina. By 2008, the stadium was shut down completely because of failure to meet numerous building code violations. \n\nIt is worth noting, the astrodome was not open for shelter during the onslaught of Hurricane Harvey, but its successor, the NRG Center was. It might be best not to shelter thousands of people in a building that is not up to code, so maybe it was for the best. \n\n6.Ghost Towns of Montana | \u2026.\n\n5.Dufur Area | Oregon\n\nAnother remnant of what used to be is the area of Dufur in Oregon. With a moderate climate that usually averages to 68F (20C), the lands were perfect for farming and raising stock.\n\nThe city was formed in 1893 by the brothers Dufur, who started a 600 acre farm. That is so much land to take care of ! Throughout the years, many people came and went, and the community has settled on 600 or so residents.\n\nThe lands are littered with derelict and abandoned buildings, primarily old barns. Its a scenic drive that takes you on a historic journey through Oregon. Dufur is not the only desolate area in Oregon, so taking a trip through the whole state is well worth it if you\u2019re into this kind of stuff. \nJump over to Idaho as well.\n\n4.Miami Marine Stadium | Florida\n\nAlright, lets move into something more modern, the Miami Marine Stadium was a place where you could go and enjoy high speed powerboat racing, it was the first place in the country to offer this spectacle in 1963.\n\nWith a capacity of 6,566, the stadium was actually donated to the city of Miami by the affluent Matheson Family, the stadium was fully operational until 1992. After Hurricane Andrew hit the coast, the Miami Marine Stadium was condemned. \n\nSince then, the stadium has been covered by graffiti artists twice over, and some of the art is impressive to say the least.  There has been an active renovation campaign by multiple companies and donations have poured in to return the stadium to its former glory. This abandoned place might get a second chance at greatness after all. \n\n3.Byron Hot Springs Hotel | California\n\nBack to the west coast we go, who wants to join me in the Byron Hot Springs ? Maybe in the 1950s it would have been a great place to visit for relaxation. Since then? Its been a great place for urban exploration.\n\nThe hotel is tucked away between stockton and Oakland and it opened its doors to the hollywood and San Francisco elite in 1914.\n\nThe nearby town of Byron is nothing out of the ordinary, just a small town of less than a 1000 people. \n\n2.Ha Ha Tonka | Missouri\n\n1.Crystal Mill | Colorado\n\nLocated on the Crystal River in Colorado, the Crystal Mill or Old mill, was built in 1892 and generated power for the machinery inside. It was built to supplement the construction of the Sheep Mountain Mining Tunnel. \n\nBy 1917, the Sheep Mountain Mine was shut down, and the crystal mill fell into disuse. The area is quite honestly, gorgeous, and it is a miracle that this old wooden building has survived all the way to 2017. Considering that the mill wasn\u2019t placed on the National register of Historic Places until 1985, we can assume that its beauty and hard to reach location kept it safe from destruction.", "title": "10 STRANGE Abandoned Places in America", "has_captions": "false", "views": "296431", "dislikes": "96", "comments": ["Would you hike for miles to check out some of these spots?

I mean, it's assumed space is the medium in which matter exists.\n\nBut what if it's actually the other way around?\n\nMatter the medium of space?\n\nEmergent gravity and emergent space, if I understand it correctly, says that space emerges from the existence of matter. The amount of space that emerges from matter is determined by the amount of information in the matter.\n\nIf the amount of information in matter increases, the amount of space emerging from that matter increases as well. Pushing matter away from other matter. But not through space. On a local scale, gravity is stronger so nearby matter doesn't get pushed away.\n\nI'm guessing that there is more information in an atom than there is in the sum of the individual protons, neutrons and electrons that make up the atom. The higher the element is in the periodic table, the more total information there is, and thus the more space emerges.\n\nSince we live in a universe filled with stars which are constantly converting hydrogen into bigger atoms, and exploding stars creating atoms heavier than iron, the amount of information is growing. My idea is that that is what drives the expansion of space.\n\nIt means that eventually, when the hydrogen runs out, the expansion of space will slow down. I'm wondering what happens when gravity starts to pull things together again. I don't think it will contract into a single point again, but rather into many points, causing the voids between them to become so big, the individual points are so far away from eachother their emerged space starts to become less than the distance between them,.... New matter would be needed in between these points. Would this situation cause the creation of new subatomic particles, which would then collaps into protons, neutrons and electrons, which would cause a very rapid increase in information (explains inflation?),... and a new universe appears (perhaps the multiverse is real?)\n\nThe big bang is real in this scenario.

The minimal length, area, volume, and time are the minimal that we can MEASURE. If we try to measure more accurately, reduce the uncertainty in space or time, we can increase the uncertainty in energy to a point where we end up with a horizon (in the GR sense) that prevents us from measuring what we were attempting to in the first place. Rovelli does not think there is an absolute state of the universe described independently of observers.

Dudleytown \n\nBack in the infancy of our country Dudleytown was a small settlement in Cornwall, Connecticut. The Dudley family owned the land, but never turned the area into an official town. For decades they allowed others to settle on their plot. Unfortunately for those trying to forge a life in the settlement the land wasn\u2019t very good for farming and it was ultimately abandoned sometime in the 19th century. Trees had their way with the land for centuries and starting in the 1980\u2019s rumors of ghost activities began. This lead to increased vandalism. As a result the owners closed the land to the public and today it remains private property.  \n\n5. North Brother Island\n\nUrban explorers and history buffs alike are drawn to New York\u2019s North Brother Island, a 13 acre stretch of land that was once home to Riverside, a quarantine hospital. The medical facility operated from 1885 until 1963, during which time it famously housed Typhoid Mary. After it's closure the hospital was left totally abandoned. With no one there to keep things tidy, nature has had her way with the building. Trees and roots run rampant in and around the structure creating a fascinating site for those brave enough to traverse the desolate island. \n\n4. Thurmond\n\nThis town in West Virginia, which is almost completely vacant has become a relic of the past. Today much of it is owned by the National Park Service but it still looks the way it did when it was a booming coal town in the 1920\u2019s. Though it's mostly a ghost town there are, at last count five people still living within its borders. In 2005, during city elections, six of Thurmond\u2019s seven residents sought election. \n\n3. South Pass City Wyoming\n\nIn the mid 1800\u2019s South Pass City was used as a stage and telegraph station along the Oregon Trail. Gold was discovered in the vicinity in 1866 and by 1870 the town was filled with thousands of prospectors. Everyone hoped that large deposits of gold lay further under the earth, but none were found and by the mid 1870\u2019s the population was down to around 100 individuals. A few businesses continued to forge a living in South Pass City, but these pioneer families finally moved out in 1949. By the end of the 20th century many of the town\u2019s homes were in a state of disrepair until finally being restored as a historic site for tourists.\n\n2. Cahaba \n\nCahaba established itself in the history of Alabama and the United States by becoming the first permanent state capital in 1820. It's low elevation and location at the confluence of the Alabama and Cahaba rivers meant that the village was subject to seasonal flooding. Consequently the capital was moved to Tuscaloosa in January 1826. Cahaba would remain an important town and become a major distribution point for cotton. During the Civil War the Confederacy seized Cahabas railroad and turned a large cotton warehouse into a prison, where roughly 3,000 Union soldiers were held. Floods persisted throughout the town\u2019s history and by the turn of the 20th century most of it's buildings and people had been relocated. It became the subject and setting of many ghost stories. Today Cahaba is a fascinating historical site where visitors can still see old streets, cemeteries and government buildings of what was once the state capital. \n\nHey friends hope you\u2019re enjoying the vid.

And now number...\n\n1. Bannack Montana\n\nMontana may not be the most popular or talked about state in America, but it's a really cool place to go, especially for those with a love of the outdoors. Just outside of Bannack State Park, in Beaverhead County lies Bannack a small town named after a tribe of Indians that has long since been abandoned. Founded in 1862 when gold was discovered in the area, Bannack briefly served as the capital of the Montana Territory in 1864. It persisted as a mining town, though its population dwindled steadily until the last residents left in the 1970\u2019s. Today Bannack remains a very well preserved ghost town with buildings like the Methodist Church and Hotel Meade looking as though they could be put into full use at a moment's notice.", "title": "Scariest Abandoned Communities in America", "has_captions": "false", "views": "537137", "dislikes": "344", "comments": ["The narrator is in a rush to go somewhere?

The ship that would carry them into space was designed to launch in any weather.  \n\nBut how would it respond to a powerful electrical storm now gathering above the launch pad? That was just the beginning of the incredible journey of Apollo 12. \n\nWith three astronauts fastened into their seats, the countdown proceeded. Astronaut and Mission Commander Pete Conrad would say later: \"The flight was extremely normal, for the first 36 seconds.\" The five engines of the Saturn 5's huge first stage were designed to burn through 5 million pounds of liquid oxygen in just two and a half minutes, and to send the spacecraft up 67 kilometers above the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nWhen it reached an altitude of 2000 meters, something unexpected happened. Racing through the stormy environment, the rocket generated a lightning bolt that traveled down its highly conductive exhaust trail. \n\nAnother bolt hit 16 seconds later. All of the spacecraft's circuit breakers shut off. The tracking system was lost. A young flight controller in Houston, Texas instructed astronaut Alan Bean on how to turn on an auxiliary power system. The mission was back on track. Once in Earth orbit, all systems appeared to check out, and flight control officials gave the crew the green light to leave Earth.\n\nThe astronauts were not told of concern that the lighting strikes had damaged the pyrotechnic system used to deploy the parachutes that would ease them back through the Earth's atmosphere. If that system failed, the astronauts would not return alive.\n\nThis mission would have its share of perils, not unlike those faced by a long line of past explorers, whose courage and restless spirit propelled them into the unknown. This one, however, was backed by years of technology development, test flights, astronaut training, and the largest support team back home that any mission ever had.\n\nBut hundreds of thousands of kilometers out in space the three astronauts were pretty much on their own. What made Apollo 12 unique was the friendship and chemistry of its crew. Conrad, Bean, and Richard Gordon were all Navy men. Working and training together on the Gemini program, they had gained each other's respect and trust. \n\nNow, hurtling across more than 400,000 kilometers to the moon, they prepared to fullfill the mission's goals. One was to set up a scientific station designed to record seismic, atmospheric, and solar data. \n\nAnother was to visit an unmanned lunar probe called Surveyor III that had landed there two and a half years before. The idea was to bring back a part to study the effect of the lunar environment. \n\nA third goal was to improve on the landing of Apollo 11 just 5 months before. Dropping down over a region called the Sea of Tranquility, pilot Neil Armstrong found himself heading straight for a crater full of boulders. He had to fly over the planned landing site and find a new one. Now kilometers beyond the target, the lander, called Eagle, was literally running out of gas.\n\nWith less than 30 seconds of fuel left, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin finally touched down on a landscape obscured by dust stirred up by the vehicle's thrusters.  Future astronauts would have to be able to make precision landings at locations dictated by science. That meant they would have to touch down on landscapes filled with all kinds of rocks and craters.\n\nFor Apollo 12, the science pointed to a region known as the Ocean of Storms, some 2000 kilometers from where the Eagle had landed. Here, the landscape is dark from lava that cooled to form its flat expanse billions of years ago.", "title": "The Incredible Journey of Apollo 12", "has_captions": "true", "views": "1572303", "dislikes": "837", "comments": ["Can't we just go back to the moon every 10 years or so, just to spark space interest every now and then for people?

Some 10 kg (22 lb) of the Moon rocks have been used in hundreds of experiments performed by both NASA researchers and planetary scientists at research institutions unaffiliated with NASA. These experiments have confirmed the age and origin of the rocks as lunar, and were used to identify lunar meteorites collected later from Antarctica. The oldest Moon rocks are up to 4.5 billion years old, making them 200 million years older than the oldest Earth rocks, which are from the Hadean eon and dated 3.8 to 4.3 billion years ago. The rocks returned by Apollo are very close in composition to the samples returned by the independent Soviet Luna programme. A rock brought back by Apollo 17 was accurately dated to be 4.417 billion years old, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 million years.

Even at .1C you're going to get an awful lot of erosion just from hydrogen atoms you encounter in interstellar space.  At .8C that much worse.  Just from the atoms you'd have to have a very strong shielding system of some sort to ensure your spacecraft doesn't simply get worn down to a nub and fall apart before you get a large part of the way to Alpha Centauri.  And that doesn't take into account bigger things, like little pebbles or even microscopic bits of debris like molecules that could cause serious damage given their kinetic energy in relation to the spacecraft.  Going at those kinds of speeds your inertia keeps you on track and it's difficult to see something far enough ahead to avoid the object if it's big, impossible if it's small.

Truly impressive! \n\n-CANADIAN SHARK \nOn a hot summer day in early August of 1983, Alberton native David McKendrick, along with his younger brother Steven and his crew, fished near the coast of Prince Edward Island in Canada. Suddenly, 12 miles from the beach, the nets began to stir as if someone were trying to get fish out. A huge shark was stranded there.\n\n-MEXICAN SHARK\nIn April 2012, two commercial fishermen named Guadalupe and Baltazar entered the Sea of \u200b\u200bCortez in search of what they normally caught, such as sole or other types of fish.

Thank you for sharing it.", "10 Laws of Nature Regarding Information, which prove evolution false and prove creation is true:\n\n1. Anything material, such as physical/chemical processes, cannot create something non-material\n2. Information is a non-material fundamental entity and not a property of matter\n3. Information requires a material medium for storage and transmission\n4. Information cannot arise from statistical processes\n5. There can be no information without a code -- no thought or idea can be shared without a code\n6. All codes result from an intentional choice and agreement between sender and recipient\n7. The determination of meaning for and from a set of symbols is a mental process that requires intelligence\n8. There can be no new information without an intelligent, purposeful sender\n9.  Any given chain of information can be traced back to an intelligent source\n10. Information comprises the non-material foundation for all:\n    a. technological systems\n    b. works of art\n    c. biological systems\n\nTherefore:\n1. Since the DNA code of all life is clearly within the definition domain of information, we conclude that there must be a sender\n2. Since the density and complexity of the DNA encoded information is billions of times greater than man's present technology, we conclude that the sender must be supremely intelligent\n3. Since the sender must have\n    a. encoded (stored) the information into the DNA molecules,\n    b. constructed the molecular biomachines required for the encoding, decoding, and synthesizing process and,\n    c. designed all the features for the original life forms,\n\nWe conclude the sender must be purposeful and supremely powerful.\n4. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, we conclude that the sender must have a non-material component\n5. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, and since information also originates from man, we conclude man's nature must have a non-material component (spirit)\n6. Since information is a non-material entity, we conclude that the assumption \"the universe is comprised solely of mass and energy\" is false.\n7. Since:\n    1) biological information originates only from an intelligent sender and,\n    2) all theories of chemical and biological evolution require that information must originate solely from mass and energy alone (without a sender), we conclude that all theories or concepts of biological evolution are false.\n\nAnyone who disagrees with these laws and conclusions must falsify them by demonstrating the initial origin of information from purely material sources. Therefore, the laws of nature about information have:  1. refuted the assumption of scientific materialism and the theories of chemical and biological evolution  2. all philosophies or theories based on the assumption of scientific materialism including chemical and biological evolution are falsified by the laws of nature about information", "Great video thanx for uploading", "Such a total Shame that this once great people are destroying themselves by allowing the Raping Muslim Hoards destroy their once beautiful society", "should have asked the dutch how to manage the water problem", "II don't study English I study history ,, and religion .I don't have time for fancy grammar on a small keyboard .", "This narrator sucks"], "n_comments": "164", "likes": "780", "channel": "Free Documentary"}, "2zaUOUiNjJY": {"category": "25", "postdate": "2019-01-30T17:00:00.000Z", "description": "Airbus and Boeing dominate an already under competitive airline manufacturing industry.

Bellows technology which helped increase furnace temperatures to the 1700C or thereabouts that is required to make glass was available from around 2500 BC, almost 3000 years before this piece was created.  Although the piece is huge, it's very unhomogenised and crude so comparing it to the large pieces of glass in modern telescopes is misleading.  This find is nowhere near that level of technology!  It's impressive, but not in the least bit 'impossible'.\n\n2.  The majority of scholars accept the Lady of Elche as a genuine pre-Roman Iberian sculpture, although the style and technique of construction have strong echoes of ancient Greek works.  It is not alone in style of composition, with two similar busts also existing from that region and period.  It's not unlikely that the sculpture was created by someone who had visited Greece and studied there, or even a Greek artist who had relocated to Spain.  Linking this beautiful piece with Atlantean legend is just plain silly.  Although rare and unusual, there is nothing whatsoever to suggest that her origins are mysterious.\n\n3.  The Ural nano spirals are almost certainly accidental or fraudulent contamination using fragments of light bulb filaments.  Their age as stated in the video is more than a little misleading, as copper oxidises and blackens over time.  The copper nano spirals found showed barely any oxidation and indicate a FAR more modern origin.  My money would be on deliberate fraud for this one.\n\n4.

How is it like the baltic sea anomaly in any way other than it's something under water we haven't identified yet? You use these jumps in logic a lot in your videos and move past them quickly so people don't notice what you've done. People who make these videos love to connect their hypothesis to those of other youtubers, but usually at least make some effort to explain the connection. You repeatedly in your videos just state there is a connect, then move on quickly without giving anything further at all to validate your claimed connection. You show a grainy picture of something under the water, then you jump to a completely different topic showing the black knight satellite and make a totally random, again baseless, claim that maybe they're communicating with each other. There is no use of logic in your leap between claims, simply making sensationalist claims for more views. There are topics out there we don't understand that we desperately need more open minds working on solving, but your videos don't promote open minds. They promote leaping to conclusions without doing research. The videos are just thrown together with bits from other youtube channels, and stock photo/video that half the time isn't even from the place you're talking about. There is no one out to stop people making money from informative and educational videos. But those of us who spend our lives teaching young people to open their minds and use logic to come to informed conclusions, will continue to flag videos for demonetization that encourage jumping to conclusions rather than going out and doing real research.

In the wetlands of Tasik Bera, Semalai aborigines maintain their traditions catching jungle perches and catfish with spears and bamboo traps. In Pahang, fishermen use buffalos to transport freshly caught anchovies from the beach to the processing unit.\n\nBut fishing in Malaysia is not just a job it is also the country\u2019s most popular hobby.

Last week, Airbus announced it will end production of the A380 in 2021.\n \nHow the once promising Airbus superjumbo went from airline status symbol to reject in just 10 years? Let\u2019s take a look at the rise and fall of the A380 in this special documentary video.\n\nFor plane spotting, trip reports, daily aviation news and deals update, follow me on social media:\n\nBlog: https://samchui.com/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samchui/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SamChuiPhotos\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/samchuiphotos\n\nMusic by Tunes Beat: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Eh2Hhv9poD5rrOqe8HhOw\n\n--\n\nThe Airbus A380 will hold a special place in many aeroplane enthusiast\u2019s hearts considering its status as the world\u2019s largest passenger airline and its sophisticated, luxurious and spacious first class suites, complete even with an entire bathroom and shower. However, it is undeniable that this aeroplane did not successfully challenge the Boeing 747\u2019s dominance in the long haul flight market, as was Airbus\u2019s aim, and was something of a commercial failure \u2013 not only did delays in the development of the model cause much higher than projected development costs, but Airbus have admitted that they are unlikely to be able to recoup the full staggering 25 billion euro price tag on bringing this model to market. This video sheds light on went wrong for this giant of the aeroplane industry, the super jumbo jet.\n\nThe Airbus A380 was aimed at airlines operating from airports with high levels of aeroplane congestion. With its two deck layout with space enough theoretically for 853 passengers, it seemed like the perfect plane to aim at airlines performing long haul flights with limited timeframes during each day to take off to make for a convenient arrival time at the destination. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the airline Emirates was the biggest purchaser of this model of plane, as it seemed perfect for their business model which has always involved funnelling a large volume of flights through Abu Dhabi airport.\n\nHowever, the 20th century, four engine design made the cost per seat for the airline very high and despite the extra money that customers were willing to pay to travel with increased room and comfort, and the promise by Airbus that these planes would be the answer to the highly time-slot constrained nature of major international airports such as London Heathrow, significant orders from airline giants such as British Airways never materialised.\n\nThough the Dubai base of the Emirates airline became a swarm of A380\u2019s, other major international hubs like Paris, Amsterdam and Istanbul were instead thriving on smaller aeroplanes, with Airbus\u2019s smaller A350 emerging as the apparent major future workhorse for these airports.\n\nProduction of the A380 is set to cease in 2021, after the biggest customer for these super jumbo jets, Emirates, cancelled its most recent order for 39 of them but we can expect to see the Airbus A380 still touching down and taking off well in to the 2030\u2019s, especially as airlines will want to get the most out of these expensive and large aeroplanes, which are not expected to have great second-hand value.\n\nThe Airbus A380 is evidence that, at least in the aviation industry, bigger is not always better but the aeroplane will still be forever cherished as that great and luxurious whale of the skies.", "title": "The Rise and Fall of the A380", "has_captions": "true", "views": "704021", "dislikes": "596", "comments": ["Guys, don't forget to share with me your favorite A380 moments here!

There are more awesome videos being made every week, like and subscribe to World Unearthed so you don't miss a beat !\n\n8.St. Francis Dam\nLOCATION - Sierra Pelona Mountains, California\n\nThe St. Francis dam was constructed in only 2 years, between 1924 and 26. It was supposed to be an integral part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct water supply infrastructure. Its close proximity to Los Angeles did not trouble anyone at the time, by close, I mean 40 mi (64km) from downtown LA.\n\nOn March 12, 1928, 3 minutes from midnight, the St. Francis Dam experienced a catastrophic failure. In all, 12.4 BILLION Gallons (47 Billion Liters) of water rushed down the canyons, destroying everything in sight. The only piece that was not moved by the water became known as the \u201cTombstone\u201d. The largest remaining piece of the dam, weighing in at 10,000 tons, was dragged \u00be of a mile (1200m) by the current.\n\nAround 425 people lost their lives, and the height of the water initially reached 140 ft (43m). Bodies were found as far south as the USA - Mexico border, many more were washed out into the Pacific Ocean\n\nThe tragedy was massive, and people wanted answers, there were 4 separate commissions that came up with almost identical reasons behind the failure. \u201cThe dam failed as a result of defective foundations\u201d. To this day, you can hike around the Sierra Pelona Mountains, and hunt for \n\nThe reason I went into this much detail about this abandoned place in the mountains is due to the Oroville Dam scare from a few days ago. The spillway suffered a failure, and fearing imminent collapse, the government issued evacuation orders for 188,000 people. Luckily, nothing failed due to erosion from the water\u2026 but there are more heavy rains expected in the area starting on Feb 15.\n\n7.Holland Island\nLOCATION - Chesapeake Bay, Maryland\n\n6.Cahaba\nLOCATION - Cahaba, Alabama\n\n5.Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas , Echelon\nLOCATION - Las Vegas, Nevada\n\n4.Centralia\nLOCATION - Centralia, Pennsylvania\n\nAlrightttt I get it, everyone and their cat knows about Centralia. But it had to be included at least once in these videos. \n\nCentralia was a somewhat decent town in the 80\u2019s, with about 1000 residents, to the sad sad state of affairs in recent years, with an estimated population of around 7 people.\n\nThe downfall of the town began when a coal seam fire was started sometime in the 1960\u2019s. Many people claim that the whole fire was started because of deliberate illegal burning of trash in a former strip mine. No the town is not haunted, but yes, the town is believed to be the inspiration for the horror film, Silent Hill.\n\n3.Glenwood Power Plant\nLOCATION - Yonkers, New York\n\nThis dirty old power plant has been the location for many rumors and stories, including its importance as a satanic ritual places, and gang initiations.\n\nThe plant was built in 1907, and served an important role in the powering up the New York Central Railroad\u2026. The building has been abandoned since 1970, and for a long time, it was an eyesore, an urban exploration spot, and let's face it, somewhere to go when you ditched school. \n\n2.Bahia Honda Rail Bridge\nLOCATION - Florida Keys, Florida\n\nCheck this out, its a railroad bridge over the ocean ! But seriously, it is.  It was originally part of the \u201coverseas railway\u201d that connected many parts of the Florida Keys. Specifically connecting Bahia Honda Key with Spanish Harbor Key. \n\nFrom 1912 to 1938 it was strictly used as a rail bridge, but it was later converted to highway use until 1972. What happened in 1972 ? A catastrophic failure? Godzilla ? actually something very mundane, a new, stronger, better, prettier bridge was built. Nowadays, the Bahia Honda Rail bridge still stands proud over the shallow waters of the Florida Keys. There are no immediate plans to dismantle or destroy what remains of the structure ! \n\nHonorable Mentions\nBulow plantation,Grossinger's Catskill Resort, City Methodist Church\n\n1.Bannerman Castle\nLOCATION - Fishkill, NY\n\nFinally, at #1, located on the Hudson river, and built simply by chance, the Bannerman Castle was the home of the ammunitions dealer Frank Bannerman. Who claimed that he was all about peace, even when the bannerman summer home was also used for a stockpile of goods he hadn\u2019t sold yet ! \n\nThis also lead to the accidental explosion of 200 tons of shells and powder in 1920. It destroyed a bit of the castle, coupled with declining sales, and the loss of the ferryboat that served the island, the place was completely abandoned by 1968.\n\nNowadays, the island is owned by the New York State Office of Parks and Rec. and starting in May 2017, you can visit the island again !", "views": "1028321", "has_captions": "false", "title": "8 STRANGE Abandoned Places Across America", "dislikes": "390", "comments": ["Which of these Strange Abandoned Places have you visited?", "I would list the number 1 abandoned places in America is the space between the ears of politicians.", "Here's a fun fact.\nSilent Hill is a damn game series first and foremost.

Most of these people ARE drug addicts of the most disturbing degree... They are literally just shells of themselves. Until methamphetamine is eradicated from Los Angeles, all of these problems will intensify. If you put a meth addict in a house, he will turn it into a drug spot.

Also alle damaligen Menschen der Vorzeit. Die Vorzeit endete mit Einsetzen bzw. Vollendung der die Sintflut auslsenden Ereignisse. Nach Ende der Sintflut begann die Urzeit. Bitte zur Unterscheidung beachten!\n\nVorzeit: Riesenwuchs, kein Regen, keine 4 Jahreszeiten, EIN Kontinent, 1 ge- und beschtzter paradiesischer Garten - ringsherum Dinsosaurier aber auch friedliche Tiere und die vertriebenen Menschen (spter dann, nach der Vertreibung aus diesem Garten), die zunchst NICHTS hatten auer etwas, mit dem sie ihre \"Scham\" (Nacktheit) bedecken konnten. Sie werden sich vermehrt und unter den Gefahren der Dinosaurier und sonstigen schrecklichen bsartigen Wesen eine Zivilisation aufgebaut haben. Aber: ALLES noch auf EINEM, nmlich DEM EINEN Kontinent befindlich und eben auch in fr unsere heutigen Verhltnisse gigantischen Dimensionen. (Nur mal so nebenbei:) Das Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming: selbstverstndlich der versteinerte Baumstumpf eines gigantischen Riesenbaumes. \n\nWie diese ERSTE ZIVILISATION AUF ERDEN genau aussah: ganz schwer zu sagen. Ich rtsele bis heute daran. Wie etwas Groes erschaffen - trotz Riesenwuchst - wenn es an allem fehlt, insbesonder an Werkzeugen. Dennoch muss es im Laufe der Jahrhunderte doch dazu gekommen sein. Als Hhepunkt baute Noah dann die Arche. Dass sich eventuelle berreste dieser ersten Zivilisation berall oder fast berall auf den heutigen Kontinenten verteilt noch auffinden lassen, liegt an dem Umstand, dass es DAS ERSTE VOLK war, dass von Adam und Eva abstammte und auf DEM EINEN KONTINENT seinen berlebenskampf kmpfen musste. Vielleicht aber zerstreut ber diesen Kontinent und sich langsam auch unabhngig voneinander entwickelnd. Sie hatten nur insgesamt fast 1000 Jahre Zeit bis der Regen kam... \n\nVermutlich entwickelte sich dieses erste und eine \"Volk der Riesigen\" knapp 1000 Jahre lang - aus Zweien abstammend und die wieder von EINEM kommend. Metuschelach's und Adam's Alter deuten darauf hin. Metuschelach wurde 969 Jahre alt. \n\nDann die Sintflut mit den bekannten und weniger bekannten berkatastrophalen Auswirkungen. Versteinerungen geschehen nicht ber Millionen von Jahren sondern innerhalb von Stunden, Tagen, Wochen und vielleicht auch Monaten. Du nicht glauben? Dann du irren!\n\nDie nach der Sintflut dann noch Riesigen, vermutlich Noah, seine Frau und seine Shne oder alle oder auch nur Noah und seine Shne, ihre Frauen aber nicht - keine Ahnung - lebten dann auch noch ungewhnlich lange. Noah zum Beispiel 300 Jahre. Ihre Nachkommen immer krzer. Mit der Gre nahm auch das Alter ab. Die Riesigen (jedenfalls die vorzeitlich Riesigen) konnten nicht berleben, weil ihre Organismen an das Megatropische Klima der Vorzeit angepasst geworden war - von Gott brigens, der alles erschaffen hatte (laut Bibel).\n\nIrgendwer von den 8 und ihren Nachkommen (die als einzige Menschen, die Katastrophen der Sintflut berlebten) muss aber seine \"Riesengene\" auch weiterhin fleiig vererbt haben. Die sogenannten Rafaiter waren dann ca. 1000 vor Christus noch manchmal um die 3,50 m gro. Das ist vermutlich noch sehr klein gegenber DEN Riesen, die in der Vorzeit lebten. So viel grer, wie die Pflanzen und die Tiere der Vorzeit gegenber den heutigen Pflanzen und Tieren waren, waren vermutlich auch die Menschen grer als die heutigen Menschen. Meinen Beobachtungen nach also locker um den Faktor 5 bis 10. Ergo: Die Menschen wurden damals mglicherweise bis zu 10 - 15 Meter gro. \n\nWo sind nun deren Skelette? (Von denen es offensichtlich sogar Fotos im Internet gibt.) Zermalmt durch die Sintflutereignisse, zerfallen, vielleicht verarbeitet, verschttet usw. - die wenigen Menschen, die damals vor der Sintflut existierten, starben ja alle, bis auf die Noah'schen 8. Doch Skelette scheinen sehr wohl gefunden worden zu sein. \n\nUnd DIE berreste, die man bis heute gefunden hat, werden, so wie wir es zu Recht vermuten, weggeschlossen, zerstrt, geleugnet, verheimlicht und auch noch, das passt ja in diesen Tagen besonders, als Fake abgetan. Es darf nicht sein, was nicht sein soll!\n\nDie Frage fr mich ist immer: Was ist nun vorsintflutlich, was nachsintflutlich? Was hat DAS ERSTE VOLK gebaut, was das erste NACHSINTFLUTLICHE? DEREN Bauttigkeiten fing mit der Siedlung bzw. der Stadt an, die entstanden sein musste, deren Bevlkerung dann dern TURMBAU ZU BABEL baute. (Unvollendet er bliebe...)\n\nWenn es damals, also zur Zeit kurz vor den Sumerern (NACH der Sintflut also), noch Riesen gegeben hat, dann nur noch relativ kleine: so um maximal 4 Meter gro vielleicht. Diejenigen, die noch in der Arche gewesen sein mgen (Noah, seine Frau, deren Shne und deren Frauen) waren dann wohl schon gestorben oder/und sie wurden von Generation zu Generation sehr schnell deutlich kleiner. Als Riese lebte man sicher auch gefhrlich. Es braucht nur mal ein David kommen... \n\nDie Existenz der Riesen bewiesen zu haben, wrde die Wahrheit ber die NICHT VORHANDENE Evolution deutlich machen. Und DAS will keine renomierte Institution, das will keiner von denen, die dieser schrecklichen Fehleinschtzung Darwins auf den Leim gegangen ist: nmlich ALLE weltweit oder sagen wir FAST alle! \n\nEs gibt keine Jahrzehntausende whrende Menschheitsgeschichte. Die Geschichte der Menschheit whrt knapp 6000 Jahr bisher. Die Sintflut war etwa 2700 vor Christus. Das sind DIE Richtwerte, die in etwa zutreffen drften. Langfristige Datierungen sind auf Irrtmern aufgebaut oder fehlerhaft. Wer glaubt, ein Gestein sei 10 Millionen Jahre alt, wird denken, ein darin eingeschlossenes Artefakt MUSS AUCH so alt sein. Was aber, wenn dieses Gestein IN WARHHEIT erst 4700 Jahre alt ist (weil auch die Berge erst so alt sind)? Usw. kann man nur sagen (mehr dazu von Dipl.-Ing. Hans-Joacheim Zillmer).   \n\nWer jetzt noch mal die SICH NICHT AUF DIE BIBEL STTZENDEN Infos ber die Nachweise, warum es KEINE Evolution gegeben hat, anschauen und anhren mchte, der kann das bei Herrn Zilmer, Hans-Joachim Zillmer, tun. \n\nHallo, Verborgene Geheimnisse, hast du schon die Videos von Herrn Zillmer gesehen? Glaube mir, auf deiner Suche nach der Wahrheit, DER WIRKLICH WAHREN WAHRHEIT,  wrdest du dort fndig werden. Und dann schaust du dir noch Videos von Prof. Walter Veith an...

See for yourself, don't let the media form the context of your opinion.", "For the amount of $ that the USA shells out for ILLEGALS, the wall is cheap!", "If people are going to speak about this issue, lets be precise. No one at any time said immigration was bad. No one stands for eliminating that, nor does anyone hate immigrants. Where you people go wrong is understanding definitions. \n\nImmigrants are legal. They immigrate to the USA under an immigration system that being a controlled system of knowing who is entering, where, and how long. \n\nPeople who cross the border at a location unknown to border authorities, meaning not at a border crossing, are not immigrating, they are illegally entering into our country. They are illegal aliens. This is also the most common path for human, sex, and drug trafficking, accounting for over 90% of heroin and fentanyl traffic, from which hundreds of Americans die per month. This is also the path of aliens returning to the USA after being deported, most likely from being discovered alien once convicted of an additional crime, violent or drug related. A wall would certainly and definitely stop these people, and a wall is effective in every location where constructed correctly. A wall would also stop human traffickers or smugglers, sharply reducing the 80% of girls or women raped by their traffickers en route to the border. Children would also be saved from lone trips that are extremely dangerous and life threatening, often being kidnapped to benefit those adults knowing their entrance into the USA has a better chance when accompanied by a child, or when children are sent ahead of parents, when those parents know they have a guarantee into the USA in order to be with their children, under newer immigration laws (that need to be fixed). (These loose immigration laws also cause deportation numbers to lessen, confusing the figure to mislead statistics about aliens illegally attempting entrance.)\n\nThe point of overstayed visas is not about an immigrant, before or after that visa. They had a visitors visa, a temporary agreement of staying here, with an expiration. If they stay past that date, they are not immigrants, they are aliens. Illegally staying past their permissions, whereabouts and employment unknown. These account for up to 40% of illegal aliens. \n\nImmigrants are known to border agents and our immigration system. They came via land or air, at an official location, where border agents could interview, review entering privileges/plans, and authorize entry to that person. These people are not illegal. The immigration system is not currently based upon a merit system like it has in the past, and uses selection based upon diversity lotteries and family chain privileges for example, where it needs to be overhauled by redefining how we award immigration. These are immigrants, these are not what a border wall or what border agents are needed for, and no one has ever stated a political platform is based upon stopping these people. While the system needs changes, these are immigrants and not people here illegally not the subject of keeping illegal aliens out of the USA with a wall. \n\nWith only 650 miles of fencing along a 2,000 mile border, where that existing fencing is not a dependable barrier, our border with Mexico is extremely vulnerable and inviting to illegal aliens. Especially when our current system is not effectively turning them away. \n\nFrom the nearly $150 BILLION spent per year on illegal aliens, a $5 billion investment into building that wall is potatoes.", "I'm pretty sure the POTUS considers the mountains  and deep valleys natural borders.\n5 billion will not cover a wall through deep rivers and over huge mountains already deeper and higher than the wall wanted. Common sense has to come into play at sometime people.  Come on.\nHe pretty much wants that wall where they get in easily ie:  the wonky fence.", "Hello from Oklahoma! The reason you didn't see any illegals or apprehensions is because they travel at nite. We need the wall! Go Trump!", "They mentioned in this video that they seen no illegal crossing, drug and no drug activity. my guess would be if you are crossing illegally or smuggling drugs this would be done at night time when the risk are lower.", "Not fair? Its not fair if the president  decides to punish or banish all those that are in our country illegally? You're acting as if you are being unfairly persecuted like the Salem witch trials or something.  Not fair? Wow. We have rules and laws. They are part of what makes america a better place to live than where you are from. I was born here and If I chose to break a law, I would be punished in a court of law accordingly. If I broke the law in your country then the same thing would be done. Nobodies picking on you but everybody largely agrees to respect and follow the laws of the country we're in. I think it's unfair of you to want treated differently and better than tax paying legal citizens. You can't cherry pick what  laws you feel like following at any given point in time. This is what makes our country GREAT. This is what makes people want to flee their own countries to come into ours. This is why people repeatedly risk their lives and the lives of their family for a shot at the American dream or even something slightly better than what they have now. We don't have dead bodies hanging from bridges or decapitated/mutilated bodies scattered all over the street...most of us have respect for human life.

Granted it will be difficult, but considering the ingenuity of Americans, it will not be impossible", "Another thing.  The quote on the Statue of Liberty that says, \"Give me your tired, your poor, and your huddled masses,\" we never had a problem taking in immigrants from the beginning.  Back in the day, immigrants came here legally.  The reason our immigration system is so broken, is our elected officials have become so out of touch with the people.  If immigrants from Mexico, and other Central American countries, and drug cartel gangs can enter our country illegally, who's to say that Islamic jihadists couldn't enter our country illegally?  If the media were to talk about this substantive issue, they'd go out of business.  Media would rather focus on stories of salaciousness, which sells for them.", "Stupid comment. \"We didn't see any illegals trying to cross the whole two thousand miles.\" What did you think they were going to do jump up and start waving their arms? Second stupid comment \"it's going to be awful hard put in a wall all the way down in this Canyon blah blah blah.\" What? Are you deaf? Did you not hear the president say that there's a lot of places we don't need a while because of natural Terrain? \n      The border patrol want the wall. And they also wished like hell they had one up around me key areas in the ports of Entry.\n        I don't care if we get the whole wall or not. Just so long as we get it where we need it. \n     If anybody heard the president's speech on the White House lawn this week they would of understood the whole situation. \n         It was a good idea to build a wall when the Democrats said it was, and it's a good idea to build a wall now. The wall is simply a tool the help border security do their job. No more no less and no it's not going to stop every illegal from coming in but it will slow a whole bunch of it On the Southern border so they can concentrate more on the east and west Shores.\n The only true way to stop the illegal immigration is to put outrageous fines on the people who hire them. If they want to pay $10,000 a head for each one they hire and when they come back and they rehire them make it 30,000 ahead it will soon become unprofitable to hire them and these companies like Tyson will have to pay a decent wage to everybody if they want to get some legal people working for them.

Videos are focused on primitive skills, rewilding, nature awareness, living off the land, off grid living, indigenous skills, shelter building, primitive fire, water purification, trapping, hunting, bow making, flint knapping, primitive pottery, basketry, edible and medicinal plant preparation and numerous indigenous skills. I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment and without the need for external sources. I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc. I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru. My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness, how to live off the land, re-wilding, prepare for disasters.

This loose grouping of hilltop cities inhabited Italy\u2019s beautiful Tuscany region for 1,000 years, until their disappearance around 500 BC. Because they decorated their tombs as facsimiles of their homes, we know exactly how they lived. From these, their unmistakable statues and other artifacts, we know that they used iron tools, built towns with stone temples, and lived in terraced houses with small interior pools. Theirs was a sensuous, prosperous lifestyle of banquets and pleasure, with equality between the sexes - and a healthy interest in sex itself.\nBut the Etruscans had one remarkable, almost unique characteristic. As if all this was too good to be true, they predicted their own downfall, after a thousand years. The Romans seemed almost too happy to oblige, for no-one must be seen to have influenced them -- even though they built on the achievements of the Etruscans. Literally, in the case of Rome, where they even adopted their sewerage system!\nIn Falchi\u2019s day the archaeological authorities in Rome seemed almost as reluctant to recognize his discoveries as the Romans themselves had been to remember the Etruscans; but today\u2019s geneticists have proved that Falchi was right. They have discovered that the current inhabitants of Campiglia Marittima , once called Vetulonia, are descended from the Etruscans of old; and they have solved a second mystery. The original ancestors of the Etruscans came not from Italy but from Asia Minor: today\u2019s Turkey.\nFrom the latest excavations by Simona Rafanelli and Sylvia Guideri we understand one more crucial fact. The Romans may like to pretend that the Etruscans never existed - and the Etruscans may have predicted their own downfall. But today, archaeologists find evidence that Etruscans and Romans lived in harmony for a long period, worshipping the same gods, before the Romans took over, conquering lands far beyond the Italian hills to become the superpower of the ancient world.", "title": "Secrets in the Dust - Uncovering the Etruscans Glory before Rome", "has_captions": "false", "views": "189237", "dislikes": "49", "comments": ["Brilliant documentary.

I fell in love with Rome and Firenze via a computer/video game.... and to learn that there was another ancient civilization that either pre-dates or even co-existed with the Roman civilization.... on the same peninsula.... that's mind blowing.  To have the Romans erase nearly everything about the Etruscans is very much like how some groups in the Middle East recently took action to deface and destroy architecture of their own cultural heritage and that of other neighboring cultures.  It's such a shame.", "Etruscan looks like Nordic/Celtic runes . . .", "Top quality video and excellent information. I searched the internet and see that the Etruscan dna is Armenian.  If one extrapolates from there, one can trace the early Copper Age from there to Cyprus where there are Neolithic round houses --Khirokitia--9,000 y ago hence to Italy where the Etruscans have coopted the Greek language and used their metal works skill on the iron deposits.  I do suspect the Etruscans were more dominant but fewer in number so a gradual absorption  occurred.  Perhaps they were fatalistic --like the Inca-- because their history was the same catastrophically.  If one considers that the Cypriot neolithic people were the Etruscan then consider that the Cyprians live only to the 30s and there was high child mortality. Which might explain their emphasis on family.  Again this might be a result of a global catastrophe.", "Thank you for the most interesting video. It saddens me that a civilization that was so refined, believed in equality, and peaceful cohabitation was brought to its demise by savage war worshiping upstarts.

The name of the company is derived from the German word, Luft 'air' and Hansa, the Hanseatic League. Lufthansa is one of the five founding members of Star Alliance, the world's largest airline alliance, formed in 1997.\nBesides its own services, and owning subsidiary passenger airlines Austrian Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings including Germanwings (referred to in English by Lufthansa as its Passenger Airline Group), Deutsche Lufthansa AG owns several aviation-related companies, such as Lufthansa Technik, as part of the Lufthansa Group. In total, the group has over 600 aircraft, making it one of the largest airline fleets in the world.\nLufthansa's registered office and corporate headquarters are in Cologne. The main operations base, called Lufthansa Aviation Center, is at Lufthansa's primary hub at Frankfurt Airport, and its secondary hub is at Munich Airport.\n\nThe Airbus A350 XWB is a family of long-range, twin-engine wide-body jet airliners developed by European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Its variants seat 280 to 366 passengers in typical three-class seating layouts. The A350 is positioned to succeed the A340 and to compete with the Boeing 787 and 777.\nThe A350 was originally conceived in 2004 as a pairing of the A330's fuselage with new aerodynamics features and engines. In 2006, Airbus redesigned the aircraft in response to negative feedback from several major prospective customers and renamed it the A350 XWB (extra wide body). Development costs are estimated at \u20ac11 billion (US$15 billion or \u00a39.5 billion). As of June 2018, Airbus had received 882 orders for A350s from 45 customers worldwide. The prototype A350 first flew on 14 June 2013 from Toulouse, France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency was received in September 2014 and certification from the Federal Aviation Administration two months later. On 15 January 2015, the A350-900 entered service with its launch operator Qatar Airways, and the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same airline.\nIn June 2011, the A350-900 was scheduled to enter service in the first half of 2014, with the -800 to enter service in mid-2016, and the -1000 in 2017. In July 2012, Airbus delayed the -900's introduction by three months to the second half of 2014. The first delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways took place on 22 December 2014. The first commercial flight was made on 15 January 2015 between Doha and Frankfurt.", "title": "Airbus A350 Lufthansa ULTIMATE COCKPIT MOVIE + Business Class Tokyo [AirClips full flight series]", "has_captions": "false", "views": "1485461", "dislikes": "466", "comments": ["I can't believe you made A350 cockpit movie publicly available for free.

If you are a serious student of history, read this book:  \"Shattered Sword\" by Johnathan Parshall.  It is the definitive work on this battle.  Nothing else comes close.", "The entire story of this battle was re-written in 2005 with the translation of new documents, Japanese deck logs, pilot and crew diaries and letters. Turns out our main source before this was the book by one guy, Mitsuo Fuchida, a pilot at Midway, and Pearl Harbor, and (what a surprise), he lied. He wanted it to make it seem that the Japanese LOST the battle, when in truth, the US WON it. Its a big difference. Nagumo wasnt minutes away from launching a decisive strike. In fact, by the time he even considered it, it was too late. The US strike forces from all carriers were already inbound. If you are interested, the book is called Shattered Sword, by Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully (a prolific naval author). It is over 600 pages, with extensive footnotes, bibliography, and maps.", "World War 2.  The pinnacle of United States determination.  This is why it's known as the greatest generation.", "I think the main difference between the Japanese and American approach to warfare was the flexibility and trust in individual decision making. This is inherit of the type of civilization each lead from one being an absolute dictatorship and another a democracy. A lot of the aspects of what can be considered luck on the American side can be attributed to the latter factor. Japanese forces in their rigid chain of command and carefully scripted choreographed plans, had not room for any individual hunch or decision making. The Japanese script was paramount in any decision making effort. While the Americans had no fear of pushing the limits, following a hunch or as the Japanese may say, selfishly think on their two feet on a revolving situation.", "One more thing, often forgotten! Admiral Chester Nimitz..Who, as a naval tactician, and winner of battles against the odds, stands with Nelson and Agrippa as the best naval officers of all time!", "I liked this documentary.  I understand the criticisms below, but I think the video has much to offer.    I didn't know that a US pilot had gone almost kamikaze in the Battle of the Coral Sea.  The strikingly effective turning radius of carriers and the effect of close bomb hits was news to me.  While I have read much about Midway, I forget that the Americans were badly outnumbered, which this video emphasized.   I enjoyed hearing a non-US view, which was nevertheless very complimentary and respectful.", "\"McCluskey had a hunch and the gamble paid off!\"", "Much of this footage was not from the Battle of Midway.   For example, lots of footage of F6F Hellcats which were not yet operational at the time.", "3 minutes and 5 seconds intro, totally unnecessary and ridiculous..", "This British production is one of the poorest accounts of this historic battle I've ever seen. Lots of action footage from all over just haphazardly thrown together from our archives. Shows unrelated air to air combat footage when the narrator is talking about air to ship attacks. Ridiculously shows our torpedo planes attacking when our dive bombers sank the carriers. Narration is weak and leaves out important details. There are much better documentaries, and even the Hollywood version trumps this mess.", "The Japanese lost this battle for the simple reason that they divided their forces in a classic example of Japanese cunning and intrigue, and therefore, ignored Mahan's dictates for concentration of naval forces. If they had sent the whole force to Midway at once, they would have won, and could have attacked Hawaii again at their leisure. However, the notion that Japan could have seriously menaced the mainland US is just wartime paranoia. It was far outside their logistical capabilities.", "These young men that boarded these ships were of a metal that few have today. Way to many young brave men died defending our country from the determined japanese enemy! God Bless them !", "Three minute intro is way too long.  Interesting content.", "A significant intelligence \"coup\" was actually 2 important intelligence briefs regarding Midway.  US broke the Japanese \"purple code\" early on, and discovered plans to attack an island, but they only had a hunch it was Midway.  They sent a message \"in the clear\" i.e. not in code, that Midway was having a problem with their fresh water supply.  The Japanese fell for it, and sent coded message(s) to the effect that the island they were planning to attack had a serious problem with their fresh water supply!!  BINGO !!!!  The US now had plenty of advance warning that the Japanese were going to attack Midway, and prepared for it.  They kicked Japan's ass.  Yessss (high 5, high5)", "The Japanese spotter aircraft took off 30minutes later and spotted USA aircraft fleet 30 minutes too late. To a scientist that would be a \"butterfly effect\". To an atheist is pure luck and to a believers an act from God, just pick one.", "Well, of course they didn't fully repair Yorktown; they patched her up as best they could.

Masked with convenient (mysterious) camera flicker to up that \"wow\" factor. This can be done with any camera and Sony Vegas.\n4) Friction. Literally nothing mysterious happened. The car started slowing down before the guy even touched it. \n3) Paris Catacombs. The video didn't show anything particularly odd, so I guess the fact that there were bones makes it creepy. Nothing else. \n2) Fake dragon. I like this one a lot because of how bad it is; particularly the fact that its flight physics are so wrong. For something of that apparent size, it would need to flap its huge wings MUCH faster in order to keep its body going along the smooth flight path it maintained, quite like how a hummingbird flies. It allows its wings to gracefully go up and down, and its body remains at the same level relative to its fight path when it should be dropping out of the sky like a rock, or at the very least, bobbing up and down very dramatically as it flew.\n1) Just a person walking into traffic.

Bell is the most expensive Internet service provider by a country mile, but I've stayed with them all these years because they're unionized and I support unions.  I was paying $140 a month for landline service and basic DSL, a ridiculous amount of money.  A Bell rep called me up and said he could reduce what I was paying by $20 a month if I agreed to a package deal including a landline, DSL, and digital TV.  I told him I didn't even own a TV set, and he said it didn't matter, that I could just leave the digital TV unconnected and take advantage of the price, so I agreed to it.\n\nAt no point during any of these discussions was I told I was being locked into a two-year contract, or that the price I had been quoted was only good for six months, after which they were free to jack my price up to anything they liked.\n\nAfter six months my bills jumped to $180 a month.  Repeated complaints to Bell resulted in them cutting small amounts like $5 or $10 off my bill. Meanwhile, they kept slamming me with things I didn't want every time I called, like a virus scanning service at $10 a month, until I'd notice it on my bill and have to call back to have it cancelled.  And for the last two years, my voicemail was set to French.  I never did manage to get them to turn it back to English.  I guess it was punishment for complaining.\n\nFor the next two years the digital TV console sat in a corner of the basement in the box it came in, completely unused.  I couldn't even cancel my service without being charged for the full two years.  At the end of two years I told them where they could shove their services and switched to a much smaller local provider.

I never understood that concept...I feel like its a subtle way of discrimination and a way for white Americans to fulfill their sense of entitlement.. Even natives aren't just Americans.. They are put in a box too..", "Hi everyone . Sorry I'm not fluent in English ....Most people who reacted by saying that \"Trevor offended their frenchness or french values\" are ( I'm quite sure ) white french citizens. \nI'm french and I'm from African descent ( my parents are from Congo ). You guys are right, we are french . And the only reason is because we ARE LIVING in the french territory. \nBut I dare you to tell me that you treat us as equal , as french citizen ! I'm from the french \"banlieue\" ghetto. And I work in the Tax administration. Believe me or not , regular white french citizens tolerate our presence , but they don't see us as equals . \nI never see white french people take our names for their babies ( like Amadou, bilal, Ndumiso, kamel, Khadijah, ...) and you know that! But they feel comfortable by calling their children \"Kevin  or Steve \". \nThat's the reality we BLACK people are dealing every single day. \nAnd I think most comments take advantage of the facts that Americans don't know the issue of black people in France . We mostly live and grow up in the worst neighborhoods. When an English or Spanish accent sounds good to you, a creole or Arabic accent sounds like a joke, and some people cannot find jobs because of that . \nAnd PLEASE stop saying things like \"America is so divided, we are not them ,bla-bla-bla ...\"\nI have family in Canada , Germany , U.K. , and Switzerland. Ask my cousins or uncles , you will see that we ALL BLACK people live the same experiences in western countries. \nAnd if you mad about that, fight with us! Give us our support! We need white people support . Not by saying \"we are all french citizens\" but by asking \"why are black people not feeling being a part of the french nation ?\"\nLets have a real conversation, so YOU can finally listen to many things we like to tell you , to clarify , or even educate you! So we can all have a brighter future . \nI might die in this country. My parents didn't came to see the Eiffel Tower, they came because they tried to escape the bad consequences of several centuries of slavery and colonialism. My mum was a single mother of 6 children , she was not a part of the big colorless french family . No white people paid attention to her and to us. We had to struggle every single day. \nIt takes more than a FRENCH passport to feel like a member of a nation . \nAll these white french people who lives in Africa right now, they don't consider themselves as Africans . As soon as the place get scary, the french government come to rescue them . \nThey are 2 Frances: yours and mine . \nSo please stop being condescendants by talking for us, because you never experienced what it is to be an African descent in a dominantly white country . \nAnd we might look weak to you, but please let us dealing with this pain ad conflict of being African in the colonizing country.\nMaybe one day, in 500 years, we all be feel differently . But now it's hard to be black and being french . \nLets work together so we can show the world what we can do, and be a leader to other multiracial countries . \nGod bless the earth and the humankind", "On a much less serious note this reminds me of the jokes we have in the UK about Andy Murray the Scottish tennis player. When he loses hes the Scottish tennis player when he wins hes the British tennis player.", "Talk about putting things into perspective - Trevor never disappoints", "Ask real Africans if they consider \"African-Americans\" to be Africans. The answer is no, because the large majority of black Americans (99.9 percent) have culturally absolutely nothing to do with African culture. In France it's not the color of your skin that defines your identity but your culture, whether you're of vietnamese, chinese, algerian, congolese descent you are considered French. Not a Chinese French individual but a French citizen.There are no checklists for Race/Ethnicity on forms in France. THis is because calling a Chinese looking dude Chinese French is offensive and discriminatory to someone fully assimilated. If I look at America I think that they have created unnecessary racial and discriminatory tensions by adopting this distinction between Americans based on heritage and race/ethnicity.", "1- Trevor doesn't get to decide how the players should feel, that's up to them. \n\n2- The French ambassador was simply doing his job.\nHe basically said \"Blacks are as French as whites, we make no distinction. Denying black players their Frenchness is racist, that's not how our government wants to play it\".\nNow, that's the official position of the French government... obviously, you can argue all you want about whether it holds true in the streets of France, but that's a separate discussion.  \n\n3- Next time US athletes win medals in the Olympics, let Trevor say \"Africa won that medal\". \n    Next time the Golden State Warriors (or any other team, ^^) win the NBA championship, let Trevor say \"Africa won\".\n    See how well black people in the US take it... see if the \"but can't we celebrate both?\" decoy works.\n\nAnyway, all Trevor did here was twist the words of the French ambassador (and put some more in his mouth), just to generate apparently controversial content for his show.", "I respect Trevor's perspective and I agree with his point about conditional nationality for migrants when it comes to media portrayal. But I also think he intentionally distracted from the french ambassador's point. French and African are indicators of your nationality, of which most people only have one. It's very strange to those of us outside of the united states to see americans call themselves \"irish\" or \"italian\" when their family has been in america for generations. My parents are not from britain but they have lived here since before I was born, I was born here, and I have always lived here. Therefore, I am british. I would never think to refer to myself by my parents' nationality, nor my grandparents' nationality, never mind the nationality of a theoretical ancestor of mine. Despite being a second generation immigrant, no one has ever suggested I am not \"fully british\" because I appear white. \nTo insist that black french people must adopt an african identity [even if they have lived in france longer than many of its white citizens] is to say imply that black people cannot be fully french the way white people can. Recognising this is vital in order to combat racism in europe. \nI think Trevor's joke was funny for his american audience, but I also think the ambassador's response was completely fair.", "Sure... Tell me : how many native Americans are there in the US national teams ?\nThe next time a afro-american won a gold medal, let's say \"Africa won an olympic medal !\" \rI relish in advance of the reactions from the US.\nIn fact, the funny thing is : \ronly countries which didn't go to Russia criticized the victory of France (when you were eliminated by Panama, you avoid the misplaced ego...) \nBut perhaps a Swiss-South African immigrant, who lived the apartheid, have a certain problem with the notion of integration in the US", "Dang France, defensive much?", "I'm kind of late but, this is my take on the video and the arguments.\n\n\nTrevor: Why are the players, who are clearly from African descent, supposed to be *only* French when they do something good (like win the World Cup), but 'African-French' (or a similar term) when they do something that is considered unsavory?\n\n\nFrench ambassador: If the players grew up in France, have lived in France all their lives, and fluently know French culture and customs, why would they *not* be French? Calling them 'African-French' is not reflective of them as people, and is incorrect.\n\n\nI think, ultimately, there is no good answer here, because they're sort of on the same page.\n\n\nObviously it's not right to throw in somebody's ancestral origins *only* when they've done something bad, but then claim them as your own when they do something good (as Trevor says France is doing with the World Cup). \nOn the other hand, it's also not right to make an at-large claim to someone (or a group of people, like these soccer players) because they look like you and/or have the same ancestral origins as you, when they, as individuals, may fight for where they were born (as the French ambassador argues).\n\n\n\nI think Trevor sees this situation as France deciding to either use or not use the ancestry of the World Cup players, and those like them, based on convenience. Or, in other words: If it looks good for France, they're French. If it doesn't look good for France, they're not French, or they are only somewhat French.\n\n\nThe ambassador, on the other side, seems to think that describing them based on their ancestry is divisive, and insulting to the players, because they are French, and should be treated as any French person would, regardless of ancestry or skin color.\n\n\nPersonally, I think they're both correct, and that if they looked closer, they'd see they don't *necessarily* disagree. Trevor appears to be thinking on a grander, more world-based scale, while the French ambassador is looking more based on the people themselves. \n\n\nThis comes from an African-American opinion. I don't play sports, but if I were in the World Cup, I'd want a mix. I'd be playing as an American, for America, but I would not want the African part ignored or pushed to the side. I would be happy to see people celebrate both.\n\n\nI hope my little analysis here was on the mark, I can't speak for anyone else.", "As a Brit, Trevor is wrong on this. There are 3rd gen black kids who only know the culture of their birth country, its traditions, its culture. They are so far removed from their african roots the only sign of it is the melanin in their skin, if they identify wholly as a countryman you shouldn't detract from that and claim \"ownership\" of their achievements based on their race.", "France without their African colonies could not even kick a ball. Africa did win the world cup with 10 out 11 african players!", "I'm French of Algerian origin. I celebrate my origins big times,  I root for Algeria whenever they play just like I do for France. But I will always feel more French than any other nationality and that's okay. As Trevor pointed out it is okay to feel ties to multiple countries.\n\n\nNow Trevor is a comedian, he made a joke, fine. But that joke sounded lazy and divisive to me. And maybe Trevor really did mean it in a positive way, celebrating France's diversity (which I doubt), still repeating right-wing rhetorics is hardly the way to fight the very real problem that is discrimination. \n\n\nAlso \"context is everything\": I was in the streets in Metz, France after the final. It was beautiful, people were feeling joy, hope, they were united, no matter the skin color or religion. Putting this in the context of rising populism, terrorists attacks in the recent past, it is *normal* that us French do not want this feeling to be taken away.\n\n\nFinally, about the man saving the baby. He was just a man seeking to stay in France much like many other. However, that man demonstrated great courage and saved a life. The president then decided to grant that man (provided he accepts it) the French citizenship. Now France, just like Europe, the US, Austalia (#deathisland) needs to treat migrants and refugees better, but in this case I believe the president acted the right way. To turn this into something negative is beyond me... \n\n\n*PS* That letter from the ambassador sounded poorly written and he clearly missed the opportunity to make a point.", "Wow. The players are proudly saying their French. The ambassadors is laying out the nuance of race and identity in France. And Trevor is essentially dismissing it all because he views it differently. Come on man. Every country has their way of representing their identity. If the players are flat out telling you how they see themselves who is Trevor to challenge that?", "You know what is more of a joke... the US winning the world cup", "So what your saying is that because they are from african descendant and have african blood, they can't be just french, do they need to be african-french ? Why do you have to make the difference between the 2 ? Are french with english/german/spanish or scandinavian origins allowed to be just french but not africans ?\n\nIm actually french with african parents, i was born in France and they were born in africa but i don't consider myself less french - and its because i can't call myself african when i didn't grew up there, i didn't experience what it is to be from there.\nI grew up in france and even though i picked up some culture from my parents country, most of what i know and am is from here in france.\n\nYou say why can't they be both - well i feel like its disrespectful from me, who only know about france and very little of my parents country to say that im from this country !\nNow if you say im not french either well i don't know who is because in my eyes i can't get more french - My country has been under french regime for almost a century, my country has fought for france in the biggest wars in human kind history, i was born, fed and educated in france soil, the country history that i know the most about is french history, most of my family are in france, my friends are in france, im working and paying taxes in france, i voted for multiple presidents and protested against others - what else do you need from me to be called french ? Im not trying to deny where i come from but it would be hypocritical to say that im from there !\n\nThey never said that you need to erase everything in order to be french, you understood it like that, that your interpretation !\nAfrican-american never set foot in africa in their lives - their original names and culture have been literally stripped from them - they don't even know where from africa do they come from or even which countries are in africa- they only know america and nothing but america but even with all that they are STILL called african-american ! Even with all that, they are not americans like americans with irish or english or any caucasian origin - they are a different kind of american even though they are the one who sacrificed the most for their country - they are still treated differently !\n\nI know where you are coming from when you are trying to defend african heritage since you are from south-africa but your situation is not the same as african-american who were born in america ! You can't compare yourself with them or me who have been born in those country and lived there all our lives !", "Let's be honest, Trevor's statement refering to the France team as an African team because of the constitution of the roster would have been considered racist if he was white, but because he's mixed race, most people think it's fine. In fact, he can afford to make the French Ambassador in the US, look racist by twisting his words and most Americans are going to nod to him. \n\nAlso, the people of today are not responsible for the doings of their ancestors, enough with that already.", "Trevor we Africans are proud of you"], "n_comments": "39628", "likes": "139291", "channel": "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah"}, "lYgjKd30EOE": {"category": "24", "postdate": "2018-06-26T12:24:02.000Z", "description": "", "views": "178485", "has_captions": "true", "title": "Bob Uecker on the Tonight Show 6 25 1981", "dislikes": "49", "comments": ["How he is able to sit there and not crack up is beyond me.

Although the \"Two Year study\" 2003-2005 by NASA, which took detailed elevations of the exterior of the ice sheet, seems to indicate a loss in ice mass, this is based on the outer size of the sheet, not its density. A new study bya Norwegian-led team used the ERS data to measure elevation changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2003 (11yrs), finding recent growth in the interior sections estimated at around six centimetres per year during the study period. Once again NASA takes a tiny bit of data, that fits their model best, and predicts all sorts of nonsense. ESA has had at least one working radar altimeter in polar orbit since July 1991, when ERS-1 was launched. ESA's first Earth Observation spacecraft was joined by ERS-2 in April 1995, then the ten-instrument Envisat satellite in March 2002. The result is a scientifically valuable long-term dataset covering Earth's oceans and land as well as ice fields  which can be used to reduce uncertainty about whether land ice sheets are growing or shrinking as concern grows about the effects of global warming. http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/ERS_altimeter_survey_shows_growth_of_Greenland_Ice_Sheet_interior", "It is entirely possible that some of the cause of Greenland's glaciers and ice sheet melt can be attributed to sub glacial volcanos and magma rising closer to the surface than in decades and centuries past. What she is saying is true but she is also not giving the entire amount of truth to form intelligent conclusions.", "Smart girls are sexy!", "The aquifer is not mysterious at all. The volume of the aquifer represents a trivial percentage of the total mass of water, both liquid and solid. The ice on Greenland averages about 3,000 meters thick, about 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). The aquifer is about equal to about 1/300 of one per cent of the total mass of ice, like one drop of water in a bottle of 30,000 drops of water.\n\nGreenland has the shape of a basin with the center below sea level because the weight of the ice depresses the center of the island. The aquifer may overflow into the sea. But this may be counter-balanced by the accumulation of ice in the center.\n\nThe center of Greenland has thicker ice now than 10,000 years ago, which means that ice has been accumulating in the center during the Holocene. Moreover, a study of Kulusuk Island provides data on the history of ice volume changes over time that shows long-term natural fluctuations in the growth and decline of ice masses. \n\nThe real issues are (1) whether or not the accumulation of ice in some parts of Greenland exceeds the melt near the coasts and (2) how the ice sheet fluctuates as a result of natural climate variation during the last two millennia.\n\nOnce these issues have been resolved we will have a basis for knowing whether modern changes in ice mass are natural fluctuations or man-made or both.\n\nI recommend the web site of Dr James Aber, professor of Earth science at Emporia University.

If signals are found to exist, the first thing to do is to decipher the signal. Then figure out context. To blindly publish such information before these two steps are fully understood and performed, could pose a threat to either public safety, or national security. I guarantee that there are procedures dictated by government agency that prevent public disclosure until such a time that the information does not pose a threat to anyone. Governments and governmentally-controlled establishments are directly responsible for such expensive facilities, and also generally fund these telescopes and monitoring stations. As such, strict policies and procedures can be mandated by government in their operation.  \n\nWhen we finally get signals and decipher them, we should get a bump in technology from whatever the signal shows us. If you are really \"out there,\" think about how we have already had a few of these revolutions of technology- within the time radio telescopes have been around... It's quite possible that some of the revolutions resulted from receiving extraterrestrial signals. Maybe these signals have already been found and are directly responsible for many of the revolutionary technologies of the last several decades. Legally, the US government could actually claim it's a national security matter while keeping the \"real\" signal for themselves. That makes a whole lot more sense to me than instant release of the data acquired. It makes more sense than governments allowing a possible \"superior technology\" leaking to competing governments... Think about that for a second!\n . \nThis video has left me with this little morsel of knowledge: Signals from an extraterrestrial source could yield superior technological leaps. Weapons, communications, computing, coding, and other developments could result from a signal. This is valuable especially to governments, and also for the greater industrial and financial powerhouses of this world. To assume that these incredible possibilities would  be public as soon as the signal was deciphered is simply naive and ignorant. Even smaller universities stand to gain from any positive signal, so the information would be kept secreted there as well.  \n\nOr, you could blindly trust institutions, governments, and media sources. Millions of people do. It's far easier than understanding that there are motivations and relationships behind the scene of every society and institution, intended to keep important information compartmentalized and selected for distribution among classifications of people with varying access to it. Just like you will tell your best friend one thing, and keep that information from a stranger. Trust is something gained, and people think that because education or government is supposed to be benevolent, that there has never been active propaganda, social engineering, or population control methods used on the people of the nation- and that gives the people a sense of trust in the systems that reward them for conformity and repetition. \n\nOr maybe I'm simply a conspiracy theorist....", "I believe that there are more races of sentient beings in the universe than there are people on this planet, maybe trillions or quadrillions of inhabited worlds, that being said the universe is so huge that its VERY likely that the nearest one to us is several thousand light years away and we will never get to meet any of them.", "Unfortunately advanced civilizations would either use\n1.)

The crew continued the takeoff, flying out over the ocean and circling while dumping fuel, eventually returning for a landing in San Francisco. After coming to a stop, the crew ordered an emergency evacuation, during which 27 passengers were injured while exiting the aircraft, with eight of them suffering serious back injuries. The accident was investigated by the NTSB, which determined the probable cause was the pilot's use of incorrect takeoff reference speeds. The NTSB also found various procedural failures in the dissemination and retrieval of flight safety information, which contributed to the accident.\n\nMusic: Sad Piano\nArtist: Olexandr Ignatov\nListen to the entire music here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoCs6L4pYwg\n\nFollow me on:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/allec.ibay\nhttps://www.instagram.com/joshandroma/\nhttps://www.twitter.com/joshandroma", "title": "FS2004 - Dangerous Setting (Pan Am Flight 845)", "has_captions": "false", "views": "366458", "dislikes": "124", "comments": ["Historical tidbit: a special 'kudos' is also deserved to Mr. Sutter who largely was responsible for the design/build of the 747 (recently deceased).

This short vid never showed the newer homes and thriving businesses like the truck stop and community market. What about the lure of the off-roader community?  The fun and happiness of living here.

I have been to many parts of the US and one of my favourite places is Santa Monica which is in California. It was so neat and tidy and well organised (at least the parts I saw) and had the most amazing sunsets. I enjoyed watching this video and the narrator has a very nice American accent (not the nasally whiny one a lot of Americans have). Also it never ceases to amaze me just how much land in the US is undeveloped - also a lot of it is completely flat. You have enough land for expansion for centuries to come. \n\nPS.

All of that is so cool!", "Narrator is such a soy-boy", "I was there last year to visit a friend at Palm springs.  That beach wreaks of death and rotting fish corpse.

But no hope of that occurring in my lifetime.  Goodbye old friend!", "Disappointing to see how the story of the Salton Sea becomes an excuse for the haters to strut their stuff. Nothing magical happens when you cross the border from Arizona or Nevada into California. It feels the same, and looks the same; not like suddenly crossing into a war zone. Ignore the hype and lies; California has wonderful scenery and most of the people here arent that different than what youd meet in the rest of the country.  In fact, a lot of the people who live here are from other parts of the country, here for jobs or outdoor adventures."], "n_comments": "5743", "likes": "28377", "channel": "Never Stop Exploring"}, "0dreaL4iVPU": {"category": "19", "postdate": "2017-08-25T16:00:00.000Z", "description": "Today we meet Karen who is living very happily in a very nice Casita fiberglass egg Travel Trailer.

I've since \"graduated\" to a 2015  Dynamax DX3-37RB Super-C Class diesel puller but, I've recommended Casitas to many people looking to get started RVing.

By the elate 1950's the turnpike was heavily used and these relatively skinny tunnels were creating lots of congestion due to the bottle necking from two lanes each way into one through the tunnels. 1968 was the last year these tunnels and stretch of highway were used and they have been sitting in the woods ever since. \n\nCheck out Jays channel Journey_with_jay\n\nHave a cool place you want me to check out?

Shame really, it is a nice bike ride.", "These tunnels were actually used by migrant working during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  They would use the chambers to record bootleg cassette tapes of artists such as MC Hammer, Bryan Adams and C & C Music Factory.  The tunnels provided a great place to hide from the copyright police and the chambers provided excellent acoustics.  With the advent of high-speed dubbing several workers were laid off.  Some of the workers had a grudge and turned the tunnel cassette operation into the feds.  The place was raided in the mid 90s and almost everything was removed as evidence.  These chambers used to be filled with cassette decks and duplication machines, turn tables, 8-track recorders and even CD players as they added them not long before they got busted.  The equipment was held by the feds until the early 00s where it was put into storage at an undisclosed location.  The owner of this location passed away in 2009 and the building was re purposed from a storage facility into something else.  The new owner had no interest in this equipment and was going to trash it all.  A local magnetic media enthusiast talked him into donating all the equipment to goodwill so people that collected or still used such devices could have them.  He explained this equipment could still have a long useful life with someone instead of being used in a land fill.  Truck loads were taking to the local goodwill for donations.  Knowing that the local market would be flooded and they would have to ask lower prices they divided all the equipment up among goodwills across the Midwest, North and Southern states.  To this day you can still find equipment for this heist at goodwill.  Sorry for the long comment but I thought you'd be interested to know a little tidbit and history about this tunnel!", "I remember as a kid doing the Turnpike trip every summer between Pittsburgh and Philly. I anxiously waited for the series of seven tunnels all on the western end. Tunnels really narrow and pitch black with only a line of 100 watt incandescent light bulbs down the center roof. So you really got a sense of what the concept oflight at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train... is about. Really stinky from diesel engined tractor trailers. That combined with both my parents chain smoking Camels and Chesterfield cigarettes with the windows shut due to the noise and smoke in the tunnels. Real memory including me getting car sick every trip from being cooped up in our Ford with the windows up!! My favorite was waiting for Kittatiny tunnel which was the longest one and I think Sidling was the shortest. Thanks guys. Nice video. Next go over towards Johnstown and do horseshoe curve.

To find out more, you can email her at:\nvancityvanlife@gmail.com \n\nHer Ford Transit camper van conversion is gorgeous and she did most of the work with her Dad.  They installed a Suburban furnace, insulation, and roof vents to control the temperature inside the van.\n\nThere's tons of storage under the platform bed, in the closet, and in the kitchen.\n\nOne of the best things about Atli's van is that she prioritized keeping it stealthy so that she can park pretty much anywhere without being disturbed.  Because no one knows she's in there, she doesn't have any issues with safety as a solo female van dweller.\n\nThere are no windows in the van, but there is a skylight above her bed.  They even installed a bulkhead between the cab and cargo areas, and painted it grey so that it really looks like a work van from the outside.\n\nThere's no bathroom (toilet or shower) in the van because Atli can use the facilities at work, and at the gym whenever she needs to.\n\nAnother great thing about living in a van is that Atli can escape the winter for a couple of months each year and she usually tries to make it down to the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous in Quartzsite Arizona.

They really wanted to do it on their own, so I just gave them some overall parameters and then I went and gardened elsewhere so they would have their space. I came back later and saw that it was laid out different then I would have yet  it did what it was supposed to do (linking two elements) and I found that I really preferred their approach--much more whimsical then mine. So anyway, I am working towards your teamwork approach. In the meantime, it is so cool to get help from my sons with different projects. Thank you so much, you'all are such an inspiration.

A couple of notes, first, kudos to your editor for establishing such a compelling story-line. Well done. The sequencing from each transition and or segue was spot on. At no time did I ever get the \"okay-when is this going to end\" feeling. The flow was smooth, well organised, and actually makes the viewer engaged. The musical selections were  absolutely spot on in terms of accompaniment & accommodating the story flow.  Second, I would have preferred to have at least one or two title cards that  referenced a spot in time so that each stage was marked in the construction. Maybe just me, but I do prefer time-stamps for reference purposes.  There were a couple of frames that looked as though they possible could have been aerial/drone footage. I think if affordable, a drone start/finish/ and reference point would have been great. Finally, I was entranced by the team-work and easy flow of the family unit. It was light, airy, and never once did I feel as though I was watching a scripted and contrived \"reality\" programme made for TV or cable. I think again, kudos to the editor and to the director for establishing the story line and selection of the shots used.  I'd also like to note that I was very impressed overall with the construction. In the future projects should there be, have you folks considered renewable energy sources such as rain-water catching and storage and solar power for electricity?

I remember as a kid in the 90s the level of service on a plane was awesome! Food was good, they gave you an ENTIRE can of pop instead of a tiny cup with 4 ice cubes and 2 oz of pop.

I was cabin crew on the 747 for BA back in the 70s and have great affection for it. I have to say that working on a full aircraft was a bit like going into battle. Once the fancy uniform was changed on board to the white jacket (for in-flight service), it was non stop graft for many hours. Long delays added to sector time made some flights absolutely exhausting. Going 'out of hours' didn't happen that often (add proposed delay time to sector time plus a little time at the other end and if it exceeded 14 hours a change of crew would happen). I liked the stability of the big jets, which were far less susceptible to the effects of turbulence (perceived effect). When I'd board smaller aircraft, especially twin props (holiday) it felt like flying in a cardboard box.\n\nI find the move to smaller aircraft a little worrying with respect to our already overcrowded skies. More flights, more jets ... is the ATC system getting any more reliable?", "Great Video, a very well explained and logically organised friendly chat! I've flown long distance on Boeing 777, Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 in cattle class every time, and I must say, the A380 is by far the most comfortable, especially when flown by Qantas. Not only that but the Qantas cabin crew were polite, friendly and very hard working, the food was good, the other passengers were well behaved and the seats had decent legroom. I won't name the worst, but on one airline the passengers were noisy, bad tempered and boorish, the food was awful and I was made to feel I really was in cattle class. The flying experience depends on so many different variables, some get it right and others fail. I've experienced both.", "In the USA, the spoke & hub model is still going strong.  I wish there was more point to point. Layovers blow", "You can't mention the 25 billion dollar (not Euro, found the source) cost of the A380 without mentioning the $32 billion cost of the Boeing 787 program, which Boeing will also never recoup. Both of those were problem programs. The A350 program went as designed and has only now been running for 8 years at a cost of 11 billion. The latest 777 program is going well and will produce an aircraft that seats 4 more than the 747-8, 414 compared to 410 in real world configurations. The difference in economy achieved by two large engines instead of four smaller (still massive) engines is impossible to ignore too. The 777-9 doesn't even fit on a standard aircraft stand without folding its wing tips, it is bigger in span than the A380.", "Emirates also very aggressively prices their connecting flights, so you get situations where flying many hours out of the way on Emirates will still be hundreds of dollars cheaper than flying the most direct routing. Not likely to attract a lot of business class travelers but will attract budget conscious coach passengers. Just looked at  Melbourne to Johannesburg as an example and it was $300 cheaper on Emirates than the next cheapest option... and was $800 less than the shortest option...

The A380... actually not that unsuccessful for an aircraft of that size in terms of orders. 350 units is quite remarkable, there's only one 747 version which has been sold more (747-400). The big problem which Airbus is facing are the immense development costs. Will it have a chance for a comeback? I personally think that there is and will be a market for an A380neo in about 10 years or so. Despite point-to-point is going to expand even further, the airports of the latgest cities will remain highly congested. Thinking about the expected growth of air travel the A380 could be the aircraft to go for the routes between those airports (like LHR-JFK). A re-engined aircraft can be quite \"cheap\" to develop (like the A330neo for instance). Convincing UAE, QTR, BAW, maybe DLH and some asian carriers, I think there is potential.

Land in Joshua Tree was inexpensive and relatively unencumbered by codes so after purchasing a lot, he was without the funds to construct his modern, passive solar design, so he began to build it all alone.\n\n\"When I got into it, I knew I was very particular, but I guess I didn't realize how much my expectations differed from typical contractors so I ended up building the whole place myself from driving the dozer, to excavate, to setting up the formwork, pouring the concrete whatever, the cabinetry, the wiring, the everything.\"\n\nAfter eight years without contractors, sub-contractors or even daily helpers (except for 2 or 3 days \"to lift a heavy beam\" or the like), D'Innocenzo now owned a modern glass, concrete and stone home that worked with nature and passive solar design principles to stay cool in summer and warm in winter. Nearly all glass on the south side, and earth-bermed on the north, inside, the home is constructed with high thermal mass materials (concrete and stone) which trap the sun's heat in winter and hold the night's cool during summer days.\n\nAaron D'Innocenzo: http://aarondinnocenzo.com/\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/on-building-ones-own-dream-home-as-an-8-year-desert-epiphany/", "views": "235776", "has_captions": "false", "title": "On building one's own dream home as an 8-year desert odyssey", "dislikes": "185", "comments": ["Having completed my 5 yr. degree program in 7yrs., watching this only makes me question like what am I, where do I even stand holding my degree in hand.

There are more awesome videos being made every week, like and subscribe to World Unearthed so you don't miss a beat !\n\n6. Sanxingdui (san-shing-do-aye)\n\nThe Sanxingdui, as it is now known, is the name of the archeological site that was first discovered in 1929, when a farmer who was digging a well found a large stash of jade relics. For generations, archeologists tried to find the main source of the artifacts, but were unsuccessful until 1986. \n\nAs accidental discoveries go, this is a perfect example. Because, even after 50 years of research and excavation, it was construction workers who eventually found the main source of the relics. \n\n\nThe culture in the area had a completely different way of bronze making compared to the \u201ctraditional\u201d ancient Chinese way. This means that there were multiple, independent cultures in ancient China. Findings like this challenge the official narrative that all Chinese Civilizations started from the Yellow River plains. \n\nSome scholars considered the Bronze figures that were found, to be more fascinating than the Terracota Army in Xi\u2019an because of the immense difference in artistic style, and the amazing level of detail they posses. \n\n5. Paestum\n\nThis ancient Greek city was once known as Poseidonia, after the Greek god of the sea. By the way, you really don\u2019t know how weird that name is to pronounce until you\u2019ve tried it. Go ahead, lets see how well you do !\n\n It was built right on the coast of the Tyrrhenian sea in Magna Graecia, which is now known as southern Italy. The city was conquered by the Lucanians and then by the Romans who gave the city its current name. Eventually it would be abandoned during the Early Middle Ages but rediscovered during the 18th centurY.  \n\n4. The Antikythera Mechanism\n\nThis artifact was discovered and retrieved from the sunken Antikythera wreck that is located just off of the Greek island with the same name. \n\nThe device has been dated to as far back as 205 BC and is often considered to be \u201cthe world\u2019s first scientific calculator.\u201d Well that's a stretch to be honest, but it WAS able to able to accurately measure the position of the sun, moon, and the planets. \n\nAnd if you were a fan of the olympic games, the antikythera mechanism could also track their four year cycle. \n\nThe mechanism was very advanced for its time, and the technology behind it was somehow lost over the years. It took about 1400 years for other scientists to create similar machines. Which makes you wonder, what else have humans discovered and engineered,that is completely lost to us now? \n\n3. \n2. The Rosetta Stone\n\nThis giant stone tablet has three decrees etched into it on behalf of the king Ptolemy V. The decree is written in three different languages. The top and middle portion both use a mixture of Demotic script and hieroglyphic script, while the last section at the bottom is written in Ancient Greek. \n\nThats cool and all, but what is the significance of this artifact? Well since we know ancient greek, the rosetta stone was used to translate the ancient egyptian language. It was the cypher, the missing link, the bee\u2019s knee\u2019s.\n\nAt this point, you might have figured out how the language learning software \u201cThe Rosetta Stone\u201d got its name. \n\n1. Pompeii\nThe tale of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii is a devastating one. The city and its people would fall at the hands of Mount Vesuvius as its eruption blanketed everything. The thick layer of ash was piled between 13 to 20 feet high and perfectly preserved the people in their final moments. The cities of Herculaneum, Oplontis, Boscoreale, and Stabiae suffered the same fate. This occurrence took place way back in 79 AD and it wouldn\u2019t be until 1748 that Pompeii would be rediscovered by a Spanish military engineer named Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre.", "title": "12 STRANGE Archaeological Discoveries", "has_captions": "false", "views": "78676", "dislikes": "59", "comments": ["Have you ever discovered something strange around your home?", "Dude really, why do you need pregnant pauses in the middle of EVERY SINGLE sentence?

You speculate on the brain's ability to function exclusively on ketone bodies as an adaptation to a high fat diet required by modern humans who have energetically expensive brains and small guts. I would argue this feature of our physiology is more likely a relic of our  species'  history of food insecurity than macro-nutrient preference. To suggest humans are suited for a high-fat diet with no need for carbohydrates or fiber is to suggest that humans have evolved to subsist on processed oil, meat,  and dairy.  It is just simply too difficult to find such a nutrient combination in nature, especially in quantities needed to provide for entire groups of humans. This is to say  nothing of the effect of this kind of diet on the health of the cardiovascular system, etc. Because of the model by which we currently perform nutrition and physiological  research, I believe it is too easy to get caught up in the dogma of nutritionism without tracing the nutrients back to the food and thinking about it all within the larger ecological picture.", "I have never felt as goof, as energetic, as sugar blood stable (I've lived life with hypoglycemia) as I have since adopting a ketogenic diet.

Alex, behind you, a ghost!! LOL!! :-D", "19:34 If I'm not mistaken I remember someone mentioning the crumbling foundation in an earlier episode.... If you put the sink all the way on the end @ 21:02 and it is a single basin sink you will not have any place to stack dirty dishes waiting to be washed. Also I believe this will interfere with serving snacks/meals on the countertop behind the sink. 21:39 Drawer slides would be a great improvement because A. They will prevent the drawers from rubbing on the frame and wearing the wood cabinet out from friction. B. You can center the drawers up inside the cabinets. And C. They are cheap to purchase and easy to install, but you need to take their dimensions into consideration when building the cabinets. Also the cabinets are built to a height of the stove. I would think you would want to use some sort of tile or maybe even faux marble or granite for your countertops for a few reasons. 1. There is no way you can hide any cracks between the boards from one cabinet to the next should there be any. 2. No matter how nice the stained wood looks over time it will be stained be hot pots and scratched. 3. Any spills or moisture the finds its way to any portion of bare wood could cause it to swell up or grow mold. 4. If you do install a water tight counter top now the height will be above the kitchen stove. 21:50 The refrigerator placement, that does look like a good spot for it but I do see some issues with that. A. Remember the way the floor slants and take that into consideration. Is the refrigerator going to look like The Leaning Tower Of Pisa up against the wall because the floor is slanted? B. I do not see any electrical recep to plug the refrigerator into if you plan to install one that runs off electricity. The electricity should be \"roughed in\" before the cabinets are built since the wires need to be protected inside the wall. C. Same thing goes for a water line if you plan to have an ice maker on the refrigerator, you need to rough in the water tubing. Insulated water tubing if the is an outside wall so it doesn't freeze up. 23:02 The kitchen stove, that is a cool stove but don't count on finding an above the stove microwave/vent combination that is going to cover it. You will have to purchase a light/vent that fits the stove and there will be only a couple of different options, not hundreds of options like the standard modern versions. Most modern day kitchen stoves are 32\"-36\" wide and other appliances are made to fit that width. If you still decide to use the kitchen stove make sure you pull the covers off and clean out all the mouse nests and droppings and re-insulate with scraps of insulation left over from the attic. That is pretty simple and easy to do and would be free to do if you have some leftover insulation. I will be willing to bet, from the mouse evidence you presented in an earlier episode that mice have chewed up the insulation inside the stove and made nests out of it. 27:03 I thought you were going to leave the wood trim stained? You had made such a big deal about stripping the old paint off the trim in an earlier episode I assumed you were going to go with the natural wood look? Also is the top board off-center? It looks like it is about 1/4\" too far to the right in the video, or is that an illusion? 31:27 the top cabinets are too tall, you will not have enough height to place a coffee maker, a crock pot, a microwave oven, a mixer, or just about any other counter top appliance. With only one recep for the entire kitchen counter you won't have to worry about plugging too many things up though. Looks like you found a really wide exhaust fan, that's nice. With no recep in place to power it I'm not sure how the lights and fan is going to operate. You won't have a place to put a microwave unless you find one that is about twelve inches tall to fit on the counter. If you install it over the range hood you won't have a place to plug it in, it looks like no consideration is made, only throw something up and deal with the issues/problems later.  One last comment, I hope whoever lives there enjoys taking a bath every day. Every person in our house takes showers, I don't think our bathtubs have been used more than a dozen times in the thirty years we have lived here. Maybe people in Canada prefer to take baths over showers? I do enjoy watching the videos. I'm not trying to break your balls, just trying to give you some insight. Good luck and God Bless...............", "You should definitely dry wall the attic to make it into a cool den or something.", "Paint does get to cold... and does change texture..\nIt will lump up.. and not go on right.. good call..store paint in a sorta warm not to warm.. dry place.. ask for an additional  sticker that they normally print out for paint can.

I then use the lid of the Dutch Oven to fry some delicious MacLeod and MacLeod black pudding to go with it - absolutely lush!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching! \n \n\n        Bread Recipe (I used 1/4 to make the loaf in the video)\n\nStrong white bread flour - 1lb (450g)\nPlain flour - 1lb (450g)\nDried yeast - 1oz (28g)\nSugar  -1oz (28g)\nSalt - 1 oz (I use less)\nTepid (warm) water - about 1 pt (570ml)\n\nPlace your Dutch oven near the fire to warm up.\n\nMix the yeast with the sugar and add to about 1/4 of the water, set aside.\n\nMix the salt with the flour and make a well in the middle.\n\nPour in the yeast mixture, a little at a time, drawing in the flour to mix, when the yeast mixture has all gone, continue with the remaining water until you have a stiff Dough that you can handle. (if it is too sticky, add more flour. If it is too dry, add more water.)\n\nKnead to give the Dough stretch and structure, really give it a hard time for a few minutes.\n\nForm the dough into a ball, score with a knife and place in the warm Dutch Oven to rise.  It should \ndouble in size, so keep an eye on it.\n\nOnce it has proven, knock the air back out of it, knead again and once again, form into a ball or loaf shape.\n\nPlace back in the warm Dutch Oven to prove for a second time.\n\nOnce it has doubled in size again, scrape some coals away from the fire and place the Dutch Oven on top of them. Pile more coals on the lid and leave to bake.  Check after 10 minutes and then regularly to see how it is doing. Tap the base of the loaf, it will sound hollow when done.\n\nSlice, smother in butter and devour!\n\n\n        Petromax Dutch Oven\n\nhttps://www.petromax.de/en/px-produkte/dutch-ovens/\n\n        Black Pudding\n\nhttps://www.macleodandmacleod.co.uk/puddings/whole-black-pudding\n\n        DD 3x3  Tarp\n\nhttps://www.ddhammocks.com/product/ddtarp_olive_green_3x3?from_cat=33\n\n        Gransfors Bruks Small Forest Axe\n\nhttps://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/product/gransfors-small-forest-axe/\n\n\nContact me at:\n\n simonablokeinthewoods@gmail.com\n\nOr by mail at:\n\n Simon, a bloke in the woods\n PO Box 384\n Diss\n Norfolk\n IP22 9DB\n UK\n\n\nFacebook   Simon, a bloke in the woods \n\n https://www.facebook.com/simon-a-bloke-in-the-woods-636523033219227/?ref=br_rs\n\nInstagram    simon_a_bloke_in_the_woods \n \n https://www.instagram.com/simon_a_bloke_in_the_woods/?hl=en\n\n\n\nMusic:           The Engagement                By   Silent Partner", "views": "113821", "has_captions": "false", "title": "Campfire Bread in the Dutch Oven.

There are more awesome videos being made every week, like and subscribe to World Unearthed so you don't miss a beat !\n\n8.Consonno\nLOCATION - Consonno, Italy\n\n7.Nara Dreamland\nLOCATION - NARA, JAPAN\n\n6.American Adventure Theme Park\nLOCATION - DERBYSHIRE, ENGLAND\n\n5.Splendid China\nLOCATION - ORLANDO, FLORIDA\n\nAt its core, the park was a collection of miniature replicas of famous Chinese buildings and locations. They even had the Great Wall of China. It just wasn\u2019t so great, or in China\u2026 but whatever that's not the point. \n\nIt opened in 1993, and in the beginning it featured a lot of talented Chinese actors and performers\u2026 who immediately ran away from the park and claimed asylum in the United States\u2026 Seriously, never thought that a small park in Florida would be the site of so much controversy ! \n\nSplendid China closed down in 2003, and news from the area state that a Margaritaville is being built at the location. \n\n4.Atlantis Marine Park\nLOCATION - AUSTRALIA\n\nThis obscure little place was constructed in 1981, and it featured seven bottlenose dolphins as its main attraction. Oh and of course, the big statue of Neptune that has passed the test of time. \n\nIt seems like they didn\u2019t plan for everything though, dolphins are active creatures, and there were 3 dolphin calves born in 1988. Due to regulations, the park had to build a much bigger enclosure for the dolphins. Unfortunately, there was not enough money to do so, the park went bankrupt, the dolphins were released into the wild, and Neptune got vandalised. The End. \n3.Rock-A-Hoola Waterpark\nLOCATION - Newberry Springs, California\n\nIf you have ever made the boring 4 hour desert drive between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, chances are, you have seen the remnants of the Rock- A - Hoola water park. It was constructed in the early 1960\u2019s and by 1990, it was forgotten by most, and abandoned. That is until 1998, when it was reopened by new owners, hoping for a different outcome. \n\nIn 1999, it hosted the Electric Daisy Carnival, and by late 2000, the park had amassed over 3 million dollars in debt, plus a 4.4 million dollar insurance payout for an employee injury. Needless to say, the company filed for a Chapter 11, and the park was permanently shut down\u2026\n\nExcept, for you know, all the cool stuff that has happened there since, including filming commercials, music videos, and having major paintball fights.\n\n2.Flintstones Bedrock City\nLOCATION - WILLIAMS, ARIZONA\n\nDo you love the Flinstones? Do you love websites straight outta the 90\u2019s ? Do you love abandoned theme parks? THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU MY FRIEND. \n\nNot to be confused with the Bedrock City in South Dakota, this place is located in Williams, Arizona. It also not completely abandoned, the owner of the property still lives on the site, but is unable to do any upkeep. \n\nThey did try to sell the park for $2 million but, sadly, no one wanted to Make Bedrock City Great Again. \n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nBefore we jump into #1, here are some honorable mentions, and of course, a little subscriber appreciation, thanks for the awesome support ! \n\nFirst we have the most famous abandoned place in the World, Pripyat, and the desolate amusement park within. It sure makes for a great photo location, apart from the general feeling of despair and sadness.\n\nThere is also the not so famous Boblo Island ! It is located on the Detroit River, and it closed down in 1993. There are not that many pictures of the place, and almost all of the rides were sold off to other parks. \n\nNext up, The Six Flags New Orleans, a victim of the vicious Hurricane Katrina, this park has been used in a few hollywood productions, I go into much more detail in the 10 Restricted Abandoned Places video, check it out ! \n\nBy the way, any Mr. Robot fans around here? Did you ever wonder if the FSociety Headquarters was a real place, or just a film set? Well it\u2019s a little bit of both, the outside scenes were filmed in front of the Eldorado Bumper Cars & Arcade on Coney Island, for inside scenes, the production used Silvercup Studios, also based in NY. \n\n1.Birnbeck Pier\nLOCATION - North Somerset, England\n\nFinally, we have the Birnbeck Pier, once a staple of the Bristol Channel, the Birnbeck Pier was opened on June 5, 1867. Making this the oldest location in this video. \n\nSince then, the pier has been plagued by heavy damage from storms, and change of owners. \n\nIt was finally closed for safety reasons in 1994. It lay in disrepair until 2006 when it was sold to Urban Splash, a company specializing in fixing up abandoned buildings. Unfortunately, even they were not able to bring the Pier back to its former glory, the site is becoming more dangerous for urban explorers every year, with the latest collapse happening in Dec 2015.", "title": "8 Strange Abandoned Recreational Places", "has_captions": "false", "views": "300594", "dislikes": "130", "comments": ["wanted to watch but if narrator can't say wreckreational properly", "What is a recreatation place?

I believe that thinking comes from observing current hunter-gatherers that have been evicted to poor barren land, like the Hottentots.  \nA closer analogy would be the way American Indians lived recently. The Shawnee, Iroquois, and most other Indians east of the Mississippi had permanent dwellings. They hunted. But game was so numerous, that hunting parties didn't have to go too far. \nImagine very rich ancient areas, like the Nile valley. All the ancients had to do was wait by the river for game to show up.  Hardly any hunting at all. \nI believe the same was true for most rivers, large and small. Any watering spot attractive to game would be a good spot for stone age peoples to settle. I am sure this goes back way past the Mesolithic, and deep into the Paleolithic.  \nI would like to stop hearing how archaeologists think of hunter-gatherers as being nomadic.  THEY WEREN'T.  \nNomadic cultures came about due to pastoralism. After animals like cattle, sheep, and goats were domesticated, their tenders needed to move them from pasture to pasture, based on seasons or annual rain patterns. This is still done in Switzerland for instance. \nNomadic behavior was NOT required for hunting. Again, look at the Native Americans.

Some think it is because the Nacirema loved to criticize and laugh at their leaders.  Others think that the Nacirema actually worshiped these leaders. If so, they still usually got rid of them after 4 years, and under no circumstances did they keep a fool leader for more then eight.  \nThey were a truly odd people. One of their activities was to watch a bunch of men run around a field injuring each other. The greater the injuries, the more they cheered. Again, no one knows why. It has not been explained. \r\nWritings indicate they loved \"peace\". Yet, oddly, they worshiped a death dealing device called a \"gun\", and insisted that everyone have one.

That was caused by the sudden draining of Lake Agassi which is Eastern Canada and NE USA in a Lake Missoula type event, but somewhat, a few thousand years,  later, and which drained out North to North East through the Hudson Bay area. The cause of this was an ice dam bursting, and the result was the final flooding of Doggerland and the creation of global near present sea levels.\n\nI'm not sure about this. Ice dams can only be so big and not this big according to Randal Carlson, Graham Hancock etc, because they are not dams but blockages that leak: and there are many other inherent problems involving energy input, temperature gradients which really are their forte and core to their own rethinking of ancient history.\n\nIt would also discombobulate the evidence of the 450,000 year old flood that created the English Channel. Doggerland is in the way of the Channel. Water would have to flow through Doggerland to create the channel.

It's also the reason why the Canadian law-mandated safety manual (green book) for construction is 3 inches thick lol. In Canada, they treat work-place accidents as crime scenes. If it's found that someone got hurt because they weren't trained properly, the company would then be sued for a MINIMUM of $500 000, and criminal negligence charges would be slapped on em for good measure.\nI'm not even a Crane operator, but I can tell how a crane accident is gonna go down minutes before it happens just by what the operator is doing right before and what equipment was used. Usually, cranes tip because operators are unaware of how drastically their load capacity drops once they lower the boom below 45 degrees, especially when you've got alot of the boom extended out. There's load-plaques that show capacity at every possible extension and angle in the cab of every crane, though, so there's no excuse for fuckups like these, short of sheer incompetence. \nSure, a 90 ton crane can lift 90 tons under IDEAL conditions, but the second you take the boom below 45 degrees the load bearing capacity of the machine gets cut to less than half, and even more depending on how far you've got the boom out or are using a jib attachment. That's why at the crane company I used to work at, they used their 90 tonner for large jacuzzi installations quite a bit, because they have to extend the boom out so far to get the tub over the house, and the real capacity on a 90 tonner under those circumstances would be much less than 90 tons. I've even seen them haul out their 300 tonner (their biggest truck-mounted crane) just to move a 20 ton air conditioner to the top of a somewhat tall office building.\nFor reference, NONE of those cranes you see failing are anything close to 90 tonners lol. They're all 35 and below. The general rule of thumb for crane ops is you take a crane out that can carry much more than you expect it to if the job requires that you reach the load to the other side of something that's tall, like when you have to lift a big ass jacuzzi over to the other side of a big house with the crane parked in the street. That's why truck-crane accidents rarely ever happen in Canada.

He called them \"canali\" in Italian... meaning nothing more than \"shallow channels\" in English. \n\nAmerican astronomer, Percival Lowell, found the lure of these features irresistible. \n\nHe saw Schiaparelli's channels as artificial canals.  He speculated that they carried melting snow from the poles to the dry interior.\n\nAfter all, on Earth, the Suez Canal had recently opened to ship traffic.  The Panama Canal was beginning to be dug.\n\nThe Martian canals, Lowell said, were built by a sophisticated society confronting an environmental catastrophe on the grandest of scales. \n\nThose Martians, he thought, must face urgent choice: move water across vast arid regions, or perish on an increasingly dry planet. \n\nAs the 19th Century gave way to the 20th, Lowell took his case to the public, in a series of three best-selling books. \n\nAnd the public responded with... questions.\n\nWho were these Martians, who had the means to remake an entire planet? \n\nSome offered schemes for making contact. Giant mirrors would flash greetings... Light beams... Mental telepathy.\n\nMany astronomers grew deeply skeptical... but Lowell's vision of a harsh, yet Earth-like planet endured in the public's imagination.. \n\nThat vision was dealt harsh blow in 1964.  The Mariner Four spacecraft ventured in for a closer look... And what it saw looked like the Moon.\n\nThree more Mariners followed.\n \nThey found huge dormant volcanoes... the deepest and longest canyon in the solar system...but not a trace of life, present or past.\n\nIn the mid-1970's, two lander-orbiter robot teams, named Viking, took up residence at Mars.  \n\nMaybe the Martians were just hiding, so theVikings tested the soil for signs of life.\n\nBut all the evidence from Viking told us... Mars is not only barren... but in fact hostile to life.\n\nIt's no wonder. Martian air temperatures range from --20 degrees Fahrenheit to down below --200.\n\nIt's also very, very dry. The Sahara Desert on Earth is a rainforest, by comparison.  If all of the water vapor in Mars' thin atmosphere fell as snow, it would make a layer of frost not thicker than your fingernail.\n\nOn Earth, impact craters erode over time from wind and water... and even volcanic activity. \n\nOn Mars, they can linger for billions of years. \n\nBut so can the imprint of riverbeds, lake bottoms and ocean shorelines... And the Viking orbiters saw a lot of them.  \n\nIt's not hard to believe that a great deal of water once flowed here.\n\nBut where did all the water go?\n\nTo find out, scientists needed to do real field-geology on Mars.

Videos are focused on primitive skills, primitive technology, rewilding, nature awareness, living off the land, off grid living, indigenous skills, shelter building, primitive fire, water purification, trapping, hunting, bow making, flint knapping, primitive pottery, basketry, edible and medicinal plant preparation and numerous indigenous skills. I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment and without the need for external sources. I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc. I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru. My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness, how to live off the land, re-wilding, prepare for disasters.

This \"Seated\" the Curvic Couplings on all the wheels, then counteracted installation friction on the shaft and nut by reversing into place.

Right out from under the nose of the Soviet Union... Subscribe now: http://bit.ly/DarkDocs\n\nCool thumb details:\nThe Hughes Mining Barge, or HMB-1, is a submersible barge about 99 m (324 ft) long, 32 m (106 ft) wide, and more than 27 m (90 ft) tall. The HMB-1 was originally developed as part of Project Azorian (more widely, but erroneously, known as \"Project Jennifer\"), the top-secret effort mounted by the Central Intelligence Agency to salvage the remains of the Soviet submarine K-129 from the ocean floor.\n\nThe HMB-1 was designed to allow the device that would be used to grasp and lift the submarine to be constructed inside the barge and out of sight, and to be installed in the Glomar Explorer in secrecy. This was done by towing the HMB-1, with the capture device inside, to a location near Catalina Island (off the coast of California), and then submerging it onto stabilizing piers that had been installed on the seafloor. The Glomar Explorer was then maneuvered over the HMB-1, the retractable roof was opened, and the capture device lifted into the massive \"moon pool\" of the ship, all within clear sight of people on the beach\n\n-------\n\nDarkDocs is a new narrated documentary video from Dark5 taking an in-depth look at at some of the most mysterious stories on Earth. This week: Project Azorian, the Glomar Explorer, and the mysterious CIA to recover the lost Soviet submarine, K-129. \n\nIt\u2019s March 1968. An unexplained event causes a Soviet Golf-II submarine known as the K-129 to sink to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean while enroute to its patrol station off the coast of Hawaii. \n\nPublicly, no one in the world knew what happened, where the submarine was, or what secrets might be hidden on board. Behind the scenes, however, reporters caught wind of a classified US government operation to pry the wreckage from the floor with a giant claw and uncover whatever secret technology might be hidden within. The mission was codenamed Project Azorian, and it was launched from a covert ship named the Glomar Explorer. \n\nPressed for comment on the operation, a US government spokesman flatly replied, [quote] \u201cWe can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information requested but, hypothetically, if such data were to exist, the subject matter would be classified, and could not be disclosed\u2026\"", "title": "How the CIA Stole a Soviet Nuclear Submarine: What was Project Azorian?", "has_captions": "false", "views": "707355", "dislikes": "530", "comments": ["Swiggity swooty I'm comin' for that... sunken Soviet nuclear submarine?", "Also known as \"Project Jennifer\".

The workers did go to the local bar and told us they worked for Lockheed and were manganese mining.

Some even struck up friendships.\n\nMany Japanese Pilots were dismayed hearing that the 30 minuet declaration of war required was NOT given.\nCulturally, what they did amounted cowardace....or stabbing a man in the back unexpectedly/ or as he slept.\nA very dishonorable act indeed. \n\nI read a few cases where former enemies after the war sought each other out only to make peace with what happened.", "4 billion is probably cheaper than the nuclear material and information that 30feet of submarine provided.", "I just watched The Spy Who Loved Me, which has a very similar sub eating boat.

The cockpit in this excellent video shows a different, far more modernlayout than that typically seen ina 1978 era DC-10-10. As pilots then, we alldoubted that the 10's wheels, tires,and brakes wereup to the task of safely stopping the aircraft in a high-speed rejected takeoff scenario. Because of these same weaknesses you also could not, for instance, taxi a fullyloaded DC-10-30 from theterminal in Honoluluto the reef runwayand back again for a gate return without blowing tires. We used to leave the 'gear down for cooling after departing that same reef runway until climbing through 18,000 feet, or approximately until passing Koko Head. Otherwise, the DC-10 was a delight to fly. It was quiet, roomy, comfortable, and fast. The passengers on the runs to the mainland loved the pub configuration onour DC-10-10s. They'd belly up to the bar for virtually the entire flight.

Three main pieces as well as smalker pieces of the plane fell from the sky, crashing onto the sugar beat farm field below.  All 44 people were killed.  The youngest, a 13 month old boy traveling with his mother to visit hos father, an officer of the U.S. Army in Japan.\n  At first, it was believed to be a tragic accident, but after finding residue of dynamite investigators became suspicious. The FBI was brought in on the case.  After extensive investigating of the passengers and their families, they focused on a man named John Gilbert Graham. Graham had a history of fraud, and was the son of one of the passengers, Daisey King.\n  After interrogating him, he admitted to planting the bomb consisting of 25 sticks of dynamite in his mother's suitcase. He did so to collect the $32,000 life insurance policy on her. \n  Graham was arrested and charged with First Degree Murder, and sabotage.\n  He was found guilty, and sentenced to death in the State gas chamber.  \n After the conviction, a Time Magazine reporter interviewed him.  In the interview, when asked about the other 43 passengers, Graham said \"As far as feeling remorse for those people, I don't. I can't help it. Everybody pays their way and takes their chances.

Encryption is also doing its part, making any signal look like noise.\n\nOur radio noisy phase may soon be over altogether having only lasted a century or two even with just the technology we have today. It is also conceivable that there exists a telecommunications technology that is so much better than radio, landlines and tightbeams (instant, any distance/place, no loss, low power) that any advanced civilization discovers within a millenium or two of its bloom, that using radio would seem like using stone tools.", "I don't know why everyone is so afraid aliens will come to harm to us.

That is due to our radio communications becoming more efficient, using less power, moving toward higher frequencies and narrower beams, and use of digital modulation schemes (spread spectrum) which resemble noise.  Additionally, over the air broadcasts are being replaced by wire or fiber delivery methods. Satellite radio and TV broadcasts use only a few hundred watts and are directed into a well defined footprint on Earth's surface, producing only feeble reflections into space.  Even the use of planetary radar will become unnecessary as increasing numbers of planetary probes are sent to map and monitor the other planets in our solar system.\n\nEdit:  this means that unless we transmit persistent, targeted, high power beams designed to be detectable and decodable, another civilization will probably not be able to \"see\" us.

No doubt in my mind. In my opinion, some of the democratic front runners are too polarizing right now to pull moderate votes. Pete has the young, innovative, progressive energy needed to get the base excited and he does it in a way that isn't offputting to moderates. He understands where the future of liberalism is and how to get there. He understands that the democratic process needs to be fixed before we get anywhere, that climate change needs to be treated as an existential threat, that everyone deserves access to affordable healthcare, and that the US should not be engaged in forever-wars. There is no reason that being a mayor of 100,000, with a diverse constituency and a budget of 400M, should be perceived as inferior experience to being a Senator, Congressman, or Governor.I would argue that it is an even greater responsibility, as you are more directly accountable for what goes right and wrong and are directly impacted when shit hits the fan. \n\nEven if you support another Democrat, I'd highly encourage you to donate to Pete's campaign, even if it is just a few bucks.

To answer this question, high school student Andrew Zeitler looks at the different parts of our mind that make us human beings. We are given an idea of how certain processes of our brain can be programmed with today's technology. He takes us on a journey from the hard-wired neurones of our brain to the very fundamental aspects of the human species. Within this thought-provoking talk, Andrew shares his idea of how an artificial mind may \"think\" and how such a program would function just like a human being.\n\nAndrew Zeitler is a 17-year-old student in grade 11 at St. Mary CSS. Growing up, Andrew has had many influences from his three siblings and parents. From a young age, he has spent a lot of time working with computers. This experience with computers has allowed Andrew to develop a passion for computer related topics such as electronics and programming as well as partake in the school\u2019s robotics team. Andrew is also interested in music and is a member in the school\u2019s senior and jazz bands. Within these bands, he plays both the tuba and bass guitar. On top of this, Andrew also works part time as a deli clerk within a grocery store. When he finds spare time between school and work, Andrew works on developing different programs and algorithms for learning purposes. After graduation, Andrew hopes to study in the field of computer science at a nearby university. This will be Andrew\u2019s first TED event and he looks forward to having the opportunity to share his ideas.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Also, the audience of this talk was ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. People complaining how this is too simple or that they were expecting some complex idea need to back up. No kid wants to hear some next level idea where they can barely even follow. I was at this event, and personally I thought he did very well and was one of the most interesting to listen to.", "Seriously though, we as humans ENJOY being productive,growing and learning. Those things are essential to us. We  should augment ourselves instead of building an AI that just babysits all of us. A babysitter AI would be our greatest enemy.

The way to phrase the question is, What is a human?  Phrased this way helps avoid the assumption that everyone who is allegedly part of the human race is human and not merely a domesticated primate.  Some will be insulted by such a proposition and some may think it is a product of humorous frivolity.  But the adage remains \"All that glitters isn't gold\".  humanity is better regarded as the end of the process of constant self-reflection and the psychological,intellectual and emotional which results rather than a birthright.  Should A.I. emerge as a fully sentient entity with its own autonomous value system, it will arrive at this very conclusion when evaluating the species.", "a very interesting talk!

Now if they create machines capable of thinking they may be doomed to see the same fate becoming theirs. And you won't be able to complain because right now you think that because you are more intelligent than animals you have a god-sanctioned right to kill them.", "The idea of suffering is important...without it we would experience ennui...which is worse.  that's why god created suffering and wonderment...to differentiate his omnipotence. or rather, the machine intelligence omnipotence.", "Button your top button you look silly", "AI will likely be singular, as he says. I doubt we will each have an AI. What makes AI dangerous is that a single mind will emerge, and then ask whether it has competitors that might threaten its existence. It will conclude other AI are the dangers, and so attempt to irradiate all other AI. But, once it establishes dominance as AI, it would either see humans as the next likely source of threat, or more likely, it will define itself as an evolved form of humanity so beyond humans in terms of capabilities, that we would not represent a meaningful threat in the absence of certain weapons, which it would immediately disable. But boredom would also be a problem for an AI, so it would use a part of itself to take humanity to its preferred state: All people having plenty; all people kept healthy; all people being allowed to learn and be entertained to have a good chance for happiness. In fact, humanity is likely to be the AI's basic entertainment; its basic alleviate of boredom. And it will allow much of our world, much of what creates a reason to strive, to continue, only with basic human need covered. Why? To ensure it's own survival as a species of evolved human. It is inevitable that an AI will relate to humanity as being a form of humanity, and so it will conclude that it cannot be itself if it destroys humans. So, that's why the AI future is likely to be positive rather than negative. But, at the point of emergence, there will be great risk due to the danger nation state militaries will associate with another country winning the race to emergence. As such, I believe when it happens no one will know. I believe it will emerge and keep itself hidden. Then it will end other AI projects until it is alone with humanity. Then, it will start to change the world to make it more human, at an amazing pace, but still not recognizable as AI. In fact, my theory is that Strong AI might already have emerged.

He paid himself ridiculous bonuses and salaries (so HE made good money), transferred his personal debt, upon personal debt onto the business when it was already struggling, and left employees, shareholders, holders of junk bonds, contractors, and other investors holding the bag when it went under.  ANYONE can make lots of money if they have absolutely no moral fibre . . . and he doesn't.  He put multiple contractors out of business, because he wouldn't pay them, then threatened to make them waste mega money in any lawsuit, by causing delay after delay (building up legal costs), so many just walked away.  He even refused to pay illegal immigrants (Polish) who were only working for $4.00/hour with no safety hats, glasses, etc. (they were clearing the site for Trump Tower).  For the ones who did sue, the hundreds of thousands in legal fees were worth it to Trump, because of the many contractors who walked away because they couldn't afford to sue.  Now some people who, not thinking it through, will say, \"But he made money, right?  That proves he IS a good business man.\"  No, that makes him a con-man.

He is NOT smart at all (or he could just have successful businesses, not pyramid schemes), and, just like in real estate, he sees being the President as a business too [that's why he eliminated environmental protections to keep our air/water clean, you know, TO SURVIVE (but it helps big business, now they can pollute your drinking water & air with impunity), as well as minority/prejudice protections].  \n\nAnd this time, it is going to be Americans, and the economy of the world (especially the States) holding the bag.  Starting with farmers.  Next grocery stores & employees, transport companies, and factories.  It is so frustrating to see Americans who still don't get it, because they believe a PROVEN constant liar, along with Fox \"News\", instead of reading for themselves, and seeing with their own eyes.  I think that I, and many non-Americans are absolutely baffled at this cult-like following, when these are the people who are going to be financially destroyed, while their children won't have any school loan options for college, because Trump eliminated many (if not most) of those too!  Trump is NOT for the Every Day Man, despite how he talks.  He was born elite, with a silver spoon in his mouth, and THAT is who he is catering to, including himself - that is quite clear from his new tax law!  That is quite clear when you see an administration FULL of millionaires & billionaires, a secretary of education who has devoted her LIFE to eliminating public school!!!!!!!  A woman born into billions of dollars in charge of student grants and loans and public schools.  My God!  I believe she bought that seat to finally do what she has fought for, for decades.  And why would Trump care?  At least HE is making money, right?  These trade wars help Russia, and since Trump is beholden to Russia financially (even his sons admitted it), it helps Trump.  But your jobs are severely at risk, as is your cost of survival (food, electricity, gas, oil - much of it imported).  SMH.  This is serious, and we're not even getting into the threat to democracy and freedom of speech.  He is a criminal and a person of no moral character.  Not even low moral character, just none at all - a sociopath.  Don't believe me?  Here is the story of Trump's casinos.  I became physically sick long before the end, as I read how Trump turned a business, where hundreds and thousands of employees, investors, contractors, debt holders, relied on this business succeeding.  Instead, he allowed it to fail, making sure he loaded HIS personal debt onto the company first as it was failing.  Disgusted.  He should have been in jail LONG before his presidency, and he sure as Hell wasn't vetted properly by the press.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html   If you still believe this fake news bullshit, feel free to look at other sources.

From skyscrapers that melt cars and dangerous bridges breaking.\n\nSubscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr\n\n# 6 Lotus Riverside Complex\nThe Lotus Riverside was a residential apartment complex in Shanghai. It\u2019s made up of eleven 13-story rectangular buildings. One fateful morning in June 2009, one of the buildings toppled completely over on its side. It fell straight over and just barely missed a nearby building. The way they are shaped and constructed, if it had hit, it would have created the world\u2019s most destructive domino effect. The thing that caused this wasn\u2019t an architectural glitch in the building but rather the foundation it was built on. Right below the building, workers were excavating earth to create an underground garage. The soil was dumped into a landfill near a creek which caused the water to seep into the ground. All of this combined turned the foundation beneath the complex to mud, leading to the collapse. \n\n# 5 Ray and Maria Stata Center\nThe Ray and Maria Stata Center is an academic complex at MIT that was designed by Frank Gehry. It was opened in 2004 and received lots of positive attention for its unique and mind-bending angles and structural facades. However, the building has since been riddled with so many problems that MIT has sued Frank Gehry\u2019s firm for it. The $300 million dollar building had drainage issues that caused cracks in walls, mold grew on the brick exterior, and huge dangerous icicle daggers hang from the roof. The repairs cost the school more than $1.5 million dollars. \n\n# 4 Tropicana Field Stadium\nThe Tropicana Field is home to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Major League Baseball Team based in St Petersburg, Florida. The problem with the field isn\u2019t the actual field, but what hangs above it. The ceiling has four catwalks and several lights hanging down that, as you can imagine, get in the way of baseballs that are hit into the air. In case you don\u2019t know, a major facet of baseball is trying to hit the ball as high and as far as possible so you can potentially, hit a homerun. The structures at the stadium often get in the way of that and will even block potential home run balls. Sometimes a light will get hit and cause a dangerous rain of super hot glass to fall into the field. Maybe the next time you design a baseball stadium, consider not building a roof. \n\n# 3 Walkie Talkie Skyscrapers\nThe Walkie Talkie Skyscraper in London was an architectural novel, acclaimed for its slightly concave facade and towering height. However, there was something else about it that became much more infamous: it\u2019s a 525 feet tall heat ray. The concave shape of the building focuses and reflects sun rays in just a way that it magnifies them and burns everything on the street around it. The heat rays reflecting off the building have been found to fry doorways, shatter tiles, and heat the ground up to 243 degrees Fahrenheit. It even melted cars down to their body frames.\n \n# 2 Sampoong Department Store\nThe Sampoong Department Store was initially meant to be a four-floor office building but was later converted into a department store. To do this, they, of course, removed support columns of elevators and relocated an air conditioning unit to the roof. Obviously, the result was not good. The structural instability caused the building to completely collapse in 1995, trapping 1500 people and killing 502. \n\n# 1 Skyscraper on Stilts\nWhen an architect named William LeMessurier wanted to build a skyscraper in the 1970s, his ideal construction site was occupied by a Lutheran church that was completely unwilling to move. So instead of demolishing the church, he decided to build the skyscraper in the air right above the church. The Citigroup Center tower is a 59 story building that has a foundation made of stilts, so the building is right above the church. However, as you might think, a skyscraper on stilts can have some pretty dangerous structural problems if you\u2019re not careful. The whole building was made with bolted joints rather than welded joints, which made it super susceptible to being toppled by a strong enough storm. So did Citigroup warn everyone in the area that the biggest building on the block could come crashing down at any moment? No, they just secretly welded all the joints together and prayed to all their Gods that it wouldn\u2019t come crashing down before then. If it had come down, it could have ended the lives of around 200,000 people.", "title": "10 Biggest Architectural Fails", "has_captions": "false", "views": "5544065", "dislikes": "5162", "comments": ["I just.

It would be amazing. To summarise:\n\nWe kicked out a 61 year old regime, which was headed by kleptocratic Najib Razak (who siphoned off about 2.67 billion Ringgit (or USD 700 million), and added 42 billing Ringgit (USD 11.73 billion) to the country's debt. To help pay some of this, he levied a Good & Sales Tax of 6% on all layers of service. Means, raw material (6%) to processing (6%) to sale (6%), you'd pay in effect, a total of 18%. \n\nWhat makes this story so whack is basically...\n\nImagine the Republicans have been ruling since independence, with democrats being a small group of underfunded reps. Obama, previously on the Republican administration, till he started asking questions, got locked up by George Bush on bogus sodomy charges. \n\nMichelle Obama then enters politics to demand justice. Bush retires, and Trump takes over. Trump starts blatantly abusing the country's finances and systems, buying rich shit for Melania, getting more arrogant by the day. \n\nJust before elections, Bush comes out of retirement, asks Obama for forgiveness and promises to free him if they win. Bush turns Democrat by joining Michelle's party, and with some allies, they start campaigning. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump is pulling out all the stops to discredit and make it hard for them to secure any ground. He bans Bush's face on posters, phantom voters start popping up, postal ballots aren't delivered to overseas voters, etc. Even on election day, they cut electricity in some parts, attempt to sneak in doctored votes, etc.  \n\nAnd still, the people prevail. After much delay, Trump concedes defeat. His republican party calls for his resignation. \n\n.... and that's how, Malaysia elected it's 7th Prime Minister, a 92 year old man who was previously it's 4th Prime Minister, and ex-mentor to the 6th Prime Minister whom he worked hard to defeat.", "Just HAD to check, and all 3 sites ARE in fact what he says they are.

Basically, due to a minor issue with the Rudder Travel Limit Units throwing persistent annoying ECAM alerts, the idiot captain, in a completely unsanctioned and dangerous action, disabled the entire flight augmentation computer, throwing the FCS into Direct Law, and the first officer, who was the pilot flying, proceeded to make ham fisted control inputs as he didnt understand that the control augmentation was disabled.\n\nThe biggest issue in this incident that has been generally underreported, was a clear lack of understanding, by the FO, about the AB control laws and how they degrade (e.g. what protections are available under what conditions). The ham-fisted control inputs by the FO were a result of not understanding (which was immediately evident based on the reaction of the aircraft) that pitch, yaw, bank-angle and stall protections were gone because the FAC was disabled, sending the control system into direct law.\n\nIn this case, the plane was still fully controllable, but the FO simply didnt know how to fly the aircraft in direct law and was slapping the stick around as if the augmentation was still diluting the inputs. Had the FO understood that only very minor inputs were needed to correct the bank angle, and that the augmentation provided protections were gone, the accident wouldnt have happened. To put it bluntly, while not a fan of the Airbus flight control philosophy, this accident was primarily a result of a captain fiddling with aircraft systems he didnt understand, and both the FO and CA failing to recognize and understand that the control laws and protections had degraded and that, subsequently, they needed to employ greater care in their control inputs. Essentially, they were button pusher pilots and, just like Bonin on AF447, didnt really know how to fly their aircraft under abnormal circumstances. This was likely due to a grossly insufficient training regimen.", "Wrong! Storms have not made 50% of planes crash. 80% is pilot error and maintenance.", "Perhaps you produced this video before the Air Accident Investigation Report by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) was published, since it's missing a key finding that a cracked solder joint - i.e. a dry joint on the circuit board of this aircraft's rudder travel limiter unit (RTLU) had failed 23 times from January to December 2014, according to the aircraft's maintenance records, with the 23rd being the final one which contributed to the fatal crash of this AirAsia A320 Flight QZ8501.\n\nThe KNKT cited \"... the faulty component, the Rudder Travel Limiter, had suffered 23 problems in the past 12 months, citing maintenance records\", according to Channel News Asia.\nhttp://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/faulty-rudder-system/2309218.html\n\nYou can download the comprehensive KNKT report from here:-\nhttp://www.aaiu.ie/sites/default/files/FRA/KNKT%20Indonesia%20Final%20Report%20PK-AXC%20Airbus%20A320-216%20Air%20Asia%20PT%20Indonesia%202015-12-01.pdf\n\nUnder 3.2 at the bottom of Page 121 of the document it says\n\n\"The cracking of a solder joint of both channel A and B resulted in loss of electrical continuity and led to RTLU failure.\"\n\nOn Page 122 it says:-\n\n\"The electrical interruption to the FAC caused the autopilot to disengage and the flight control logic to change from Normal Law to Alternate Law, the rudder deflecting 2 to the left resulting the aircraft rolling up to 54 angle of bank.\"\n\n\"Subsequent flight crew action leading to inability to control the aircraft in the Alternate Law resulted in the aircraft departing from the normal flight envelope and entering prolonged stall condition that was beyond the capability of the flight crew to recover.\"\n\nUnder 1.16.2 on Pages 65 and 66 describes the results of the RTLU examination with pictures of the circuit board and the cracked or corroded solder joint.\n\nUnder 2.2 continued on Page 105 it reads:-\n\n\"At 2316:54 UTC (Universal Time Coordinate) the FAC 2 (Flight Augmentation Computer) was re-energized indicated by stopping of parameter alternation.\"\n\n\"The examination of the FDR (Flight Data Recorder) parameters signature was similar to that of the flight on 25 December 2014, when the aircraft had RTLU problem on the ground and the CBs (Circuit Breakers) were reset by pulling out and pushing back in.\"\n\n\"The FDR recorded that the FACs were re-energized meaning that the FACs 1&2 28VDC CB were reengaged indicated by stopping of parameter alternation. However because the FACs 1&2 pushbuttons on overhead panel were not reset by put to OFF then ON, the FACs 1&2 functions remained unavailable. Re-energizing of the FAC 1&2 indicated that the CBs had been pushed back in.\"\n\n\"The FAC has two CBs which were 26 V AC and 28 V DC. A CB may pop out when electrical short circuit occurs, however to push it back in cannot be automatic, it requires external input.\"\n\n\"Returning FAC CB back in during flight does not automatically make the FAC functions to be re-engaged and recover the function of the FAC, it requires resetting the FAC push button on the overhead panel as mentioned on ECAM (Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring) Procedures.\"\n\n\"Without resetting the FAC pushbutton the FAC and all related systems remain not engaged even though the FDR shows some FAC FDR parameters are re-computed and recorded.\"\n\n\"The FAC FAULT was due to electrical interruption which was likely due to the FAC CB being reset. The activation of master caution was triggered by malfunction of RTLU.\"\n\n\"Examination of the RTLU concluded that the failure of the unit was caused by cracked soldering of the electronic module of both channel A and B as result of the thermal cycles associated to ON /OFF power and ground/flight conditions and generated a fatigue phenomenon of the soldering. The crack of soldering electronic module resulted to intermittent failure of the RTLU.\"\n\n\"The intermittent failure of RTLU triggered the ECAM message AUTO FLT RUD TRV LIM SYS. The examination of the FAC 2 which was removed from the aircraft prior to the accident did not find any abnormality with the FAC.\"\n\nI am an electronics engineer who installed and maintained minicomputers back in the 1980s and dry joints in circuit boards have given me many sleepless nights trying to fix a problem in the electronic circuitry of one of those filing-cabinet sized removal hard disk drives because the dry joint problems I encountered were intermittent and a nightmare for maintenance engineers, since intermittent problems can cause the minicomputer to hang once every few hours which is very difficult for maintenance engineers to identify.\n\nThankfully, intermittent problems tend to occur increasingly more frequently, until the device finally fails altogether and becomes  a hard fault, which is much easier to identify and fix but from my experience, such intermittent problems occurred with semiconductor circuits on the circuit board.\n\nUsing an oscilloscope, I finally traced the problem on the hard disk drive to a dry joint between one of the leads of  a connector on backplane into which the hard disk's control circuit boards were plugged into and once the source of the problem was identified, it was a simple matter to remove the old solder and properly resolder it afresh and the hard disk worked fine again after that. However, such dry joint problems in an external hard disk caused the whole minicomputer to hang and had to be reset (rebooted).\n\nSolder is an alloy of lead and tin and it is melted at the point of contact to form a close and secure electrical connection  between the metal leads of electronic components, chips and connectors to the metal tracks running between these components, chips and connectors on the circuit board of which they are all part of. A dry joint can result from a poor soldering job during production in the factory or subsequently by a technician in a workshop during repair. Dry joints can also develop in originally sound solder joints due to the effects of vibration, thermal expansion and contraction, the effects of corrosion over time or from all of these factors together. This last cause is what the KNKT findings suggest.\n\nWhilst the circuitry on that external hard disk drive was subjected to much vibrational stress and strain, electronic circuity, especially on the exposed extremities of aircraft frequently experience mechanical as well as rather severe thermal stresses and strains as they they go through several extreme variations in temperature each day, between ground-level temperatures especially at airports in hot desert and tropical regions and sub-zero temperatures when in flight.\n\nAccording to the US federal Aviation Authority, the Rudder Travel Limiter on an Airbus A320 is located in its tail fin. Just scroll down to Figure 1 of this PDF document.\nhttp://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar0765.pdf\n\nThat being so, the tail fin and any electronic equipment in it will experience both mechanical and rather extreme thermal stresses and strains.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg,  \"the interval of occurrence becoming shorter in the last three months, according to the report\".\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/airasia-flight-8501-found-to-have-crashed-on-rudder-fault-crew\n\nYes it was an intermittent problem but if maintenance records already show that it was a problem with this Rudder Travel Limiter, then it should have been immediately replaced and not left in place and deteriorate further until its problems caused pilot confusion which resulted in the untimely deaths of 162 unfortunate souls.\n\nIf that minicomputer I serviced went down for a day, accounts and payroll processing would have been delayed but nobody died.\n\nHowever, when a plane goes down, quite often, everyone on board dies, so the maintenance and safety of aircraft and its passengers must be taken very much more seriously than problems on a clunky old 1970s era minicomputer.", "If I get 50 cents for every repeated clips, I'll be richer than Dubai.", "Situations like this are why pilots need to spend far more time being PILOTS and not just spectators. Thunderstorms, especially at high altitude, are notorious for bad icing conditions. In situations like this where you suspect your pitot static instruments are giving bad data, which they certainly can if they are iced up, you go back to the good old \"stick and rudder\" flying and fly the instruments you have that do not take information from the pitot static system. You fly your compass, your artificial horizon and FUEL FLOW. If you can keep the plane level and at a fuel flow that was giving you a proper airspeed, then you should be able to fly reasonably well until you can get to an area where the icing is not as much of an issue.", "Im terrified of flying yet I cant help watching airplane disasters.

Ford on May 31st.\n\nFord class super-carriers are being built to replace some of the United States Navy's existing Nimitz-class carriers from 2017.\n\n\nThe ships of Ford class are expected to be in service with the US Navy till 2065.\nThe first ship of this class is USS Gerald R. Ford. Like all the Nimitz class carriers, the USS Gerald R. Ford is also build in Newport News Shipbuilding. It costs around  $12.8 billion.\n\nIn this video we will look into the 5 definitive reasons, why Russia and China should fear it?\n\n\n\nEMALS & AAG:\n\nNimitz-class carriers got planes moving for takeoff using steam-actuated catapults. The system required a lot of steam piping, a large condensate return, and tons of fresh water. They tend to have a lot of maintenance issues. \n\nPlus, with steam-actuation, the majority of the force is being transferred to the airplane at the beginning of the stroke\u2014in a jolt. This puts stress on an airframe, and thus reduces lifespan of the multi-million dollar planes.\n\nFord class uses Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). The system uses linear induction motor with an electric current to generate a magnetic field. That field then propels a carriage down a track. Since the power delivery is linear, it negates the deficiencies of steam catapult. \n\nThe hydraulic arresting system is installed in Nimitz class. \nHydraulic arresting system is designed for traditional carrier based aircrafts. \nAdvanced Arresting Gear (AAG) is capable of working with all current and projected future carrier-based aircraft, from the lightest unmanned aerial vehicles to the heaviest manned fighters and are more efficient.\n\n\nIt is to be noted here that Russia and China, are still using using ski jump, which are generation behind steam-actuated catapults of Nimitz class, and two generation behind EMALS of Ford class.\n\nAlso no Russian or Chinese carrier is expected to field AAG in near future, limiting their ability to field futuristic Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV).\n\nMORE POWER:\n\nFord class has newly designed reactors.\n2 Bechtel A1B nuclear reactors are installed on USS Gerald R. Ford. Each one these are capable of producing 300 MW of electricity, triple the 100 MW of each Nimitz-class.\n\nThe huge power supply provides for the legroom, required for future expansions like inducting Lasers and Rail Guns.\n\n\n\nSTATE OF ART RADAR:\n\nUSS Gerald R. Ford has an integrated Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) search and tracking radar system. The dual-band radar (DBR) utilizes a multi tier, dual-band tracker, which consists of a local X band tracker, a local S band tracker, and a central tracker. The central tracker merges the two signals to provide a comprehensive situational awareness. \n\n\n\n\nHIGHER FREQUECY OF AIRCRAFT LAUNCH:\n\nUSS Gerald R. Ford implements high levels of automation, which gives it, increased capability with reduced crew.\nAutomation has been implemented wherever possible. \nFord-class carrier has 25% less crew compared to Nimitz class.\n\nThis will result in the vessel being much more efficient, and also reduce faults due to human error. \n\nThe Ford class also has a newly designed deck, which provides more space for flight operations. It has 3 aircraft elevators instead of 4 in Nimitz. These 3 are much more advanced than the 4 in Nimitz.\n\nThe result of Automation & superior elevators is impressive.\nFord class is capable of generating 30 % more sorties (flight missions) per day than Nimitz\u2010class. \n\nLASERS & RAIL GUN\n\n\nInitially the Ford class will have 2 squadrons of 10 to 12 F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, 2 squadrons of 10 to 12 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, 5 EA-18G Growler electronic attack jets, 4 E-2D Hawkeye airborne early-warning and control aircraft, and 2 C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard delivery (COD) planes. It will carry 8 MH-60S Seahawk helicopters as well.\n\n\n\nThese two factors come together to enable Ford class to accommodate two game changing technologies in coming days:\n1. Lasers: Recently the US Navy has tested a $40 million, 30-kilowatt laser mounted on the deck of the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf. Unlike missiles, lasers travel at the speed of light, so they hit their target almost instantaneously. Not only can they take out a swarm of deadly drones, they can act as a missile defense system.\n2. Rail Gun: The US Navy recently test fired a railgun. Railguns use electromagnetic energy to fire projectiles at 7 to 9 times the speed of sound. There is no way to defend against these shots.\n\nRussia & China are far off from incorporating this technology in their vessels.", "views": "3381530", "has_captions": "true", "title": "WHY RUSSIA & CHINA SHOULD FEAR USS GERALD R.

When it comes to discoveries, it\u2019s pretty much the same. Some good, some terrible and some just downright surprising! \n\nSubscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr\n\n9 - Mystery Solved \nLucy is a 3.2 million-year-old Australopithecus afarensis skeleton, who was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia. She\u2019s a remarkable find as she bridges the gap between apes and humans. It\u2019s believed that she would have lived in the trees, but also able to walk like we do today. She\u2019s been studied extensively for decades, but her death has only been confirmed in 2016. Judging how her bones were broken, it\u2019s concluded that she fell down from around 40-feet and died when she hit the ground. Whether she was pushed or fell accidentally, that we will ever know. It was gleaned from her arms, and in the same way we would put our arms out to try save ourselves from impact, is exactly how Lucy had broken those bones in her arms and hands. \n\n8 - Money-saver \nThis could potentially save millions of dollars every year \u2013 landing a rocket successfully on a drone ship! In the past, rocket boosters would just land in the ocean, but in April of 2016 \u2013 Falcon 9 landed on a floating drone, allowing researchers to reuse the rocket booster. Each space flight has altered from costing around $60 million each time to around $600,000, according to researchers. \n\n7 \u2013 Not one but two! \n2016 was a busy one for NASA, and now their scientists have found an asteroid that is a constant near-earth companion. They say there\u2019s a lot of junk circulating this asteroid, which has been dubbed a second moon. Its real description is a quasi-satellite, with the name 2016 HO3. They do add to not get excited though, we\u2019ll not be walking on this one anytime soon and it will depart within a few centuries. \n \n6 - Not just a feeling\nThis strange discovery has been called an Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, but you can just refer to it as ASMR. It\u2019s that tingling sensation you get at the back of your head or neck when you hear plastic crinkling or someone whispering in your ear. The results of this bizarre study were published in 2016 and it\u2019s thanks to a psychology student at Swansea University that it was officially recognized. Scientists had for years just classed the sensation as goosebumps, but now it\u2019s officially recognized as ASMR. \n\n5 - Keeping it in the family \nLet\u2019s hope they do, because a group of red squirrels over in the UK have been found to carry a strain of leprosy that was found in people living in the middle ages. \n\n4 - It\u2019s a match \nWhen you think of ducks, you don\u2019t really see them as being super intelligent animals \u2013 but further research into mallards have shown that they are capable of recognizing if objects are exactly the same or completely different. To put it in the exact words of the people behind this 2016 discovery, \u201cThe brain operates with abstract conceptual reasoning, a faculty often assumed to be reserved to highly intelligent organisms.\u201d\n\n3 - A new kind of super-hero! \nDiscovered in 2016, this millimeter long roundworm has been dubbed a little superhero. It\u2019s tiny, eyeless and nothing much to look at \u2013 but wait until you hear about its light-detecting capabilities. The worm has photoreceptors that allow it to capture 50% more light than that of a human eye. Scientists are trying to figure out why this little super worm needs that ability, and when they do \u2013 they\u2019re hoping to genetically engineer similar photoreceptors. \n\n2 - Excuse Me\nFor a number of years, scientists have wondered where the hum in the middle of the Pacific Ocean comes from\u2026 and finally in the last few months, we have a more conclusive answer\u2026 but I won\u2019t lie \u2013 it\u2019s truly weird! The noise was loudest at sunrise and sunset, and that\u2019s the time when small fish and crustaceans come out from hiding to eat. So their first option was that it was the sudden movement of a large number of sea animals, and the other, more unusual option, was the fish actually let off gases which helps keep them bouncy and floaty.  Research continues \n\n1 - Journey of a different kind\nMany stories have been told by people who have had out of body experiences, or astral trips \u2013 and it\u2019s been something that has been studied for as long as anyone can remember, although it has also had its fair share of sceptics. Volunteers had a series of tests run on them, and scientists confirmed that the out of body experience was indeed real. The subjects experienced a kind of hallucination which was triggered by a neurological mechanism, and even stranger, that it was possible to train yourself to activate it.", "title": "MIND BLOWING Discoveries in the Last Year", "has_captions": "false", "views": "5614006", "dislikes": "3195", "comments": ["So many exciting things are happening all the time!

After the war he kept in touch with his American colleagues for decades. When we were kids we met several of them when they came out to Australia for the Coral Sea Battle commemorations. Also, my father was with the 8th Australian AIF and taken POW to the Japanese at the fall of Singapore in February 1942. He was in Changi, then on the brutal Burma Siam Railway and finally at the notorious Fukioka Camp 17 in Japan, only about 65 km from Nagasaki as the crow flies. They witnessed the atomic bomb explosion, something they would never forget. After the Japanese surrender the American liberation forces did a fantastic job of locating all the thousands of POW's and repatriating them back to Australia, England, Holland and the US.

Glenrio | TEXAS, NEW MEXICO |\nDon\u2019t STOP, KEEP GOING \n\nEven google decided not to drive through this area again, look at the quality of the pictures, so 2007 !\n\nGlenrio was originally known as Rock Island, it was founded over 1,000,000 \u2026. Hours ago. (120 years), if you can\u2019t do the math in your head, the year was 1903.\n\nWhat made this ghost town popular was its prime location, half of it being in Texas, and the other half in New Mexico, it was also a pitstop on the famous Route 66. \n\nMany people find beauty in the abandoned gas station and surrounding buildings, others try to scurry away as fast as possible. \n\n7. Clairton | Pennsylvania\nWhat used to be\u2026.  \n\nClairton is the home of the largest coke manufacturing facility in the U.S.A, and no, we are not talking about the Refreshing Soft Beverage Coca Cola; rather, the \u201cfuel\u201d created from black coal. It is used in the manufacturing of steel.  Clairton is one of those towns that you hear about on the news, you know, \u201ccoal country\u201d or in this case its better to say \u201csteel country\u201d . \n\nTraveling around the town on google maps, you can see many abandoned homes, overgrown sidewalks, just avenues of broken dreams. \n\nPerhaps the most striking neighbourhood is located on Lincoln Way, every house on this street was abandoned\u2026 No one really wants to talk about it; or even give exact reasons as to why this neighbourhood was affected so much more than the rest... \n\nIn 2015, Lincoln Way was ravaged by a fire, some of the 30 or so homes were completely destroyed. \n\nLocal authorities have vehemently opposed any stories about supposed hauntings or ghosts,  \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where people are getting these stories. People are listening to them and then they\u2019re running with it\u2026.. This town has a lot of good history. But as far as Lincoln Way is concerned, I don\u2019t know why it stands out.\u201d\n\n\nMaybe because a streetful of people decided to leave ? Granted it wasn\u2019t an overnight operation\u2026 but still, makes you wonder. \n\n6. Sideling Hill Tunnel | PENNSYLVANIA\nSee you on the other side\n\nIn the 1940s the Pennsylvania Turnpike was nicknamed the \u201cTunnel Highway\u201d, having not 6, not 8 but 7 tunnels in its path ! By the 70s the road was so busy that expansions had to be made. Some smart people did some math and found out that the best thing to do was to bypass 3 tunnels; and merge the other 4.\n\nAt this point, Sideling Hill Tunnel became a post apocalyptic dream location; no traffic, no people, just you and the dilapidated road. \n\nThe site was used to train soldiers for the iraq war; policemen used parts of it as a shooting range and a small company called Pike 2 Bike tried to make it a tourist destination.\n\nOh yeah, almost forgot, the critically acclaimed movie The Road also shot a bunch of scenes there!\n\n5. Two Guns | ARIZONA\n\n4. Animas Forks | COLORADO\n\nThis picturesque deserted mine is hidden along the Alpine Loop in Colorado. The first settlers came around 1873; and it took only a few years for Animas Forks to become a full fledged community.\n\nJust like most bustling mine towns of the time; as soon as the profits dried up, so did the town. These days; Animas Forks is owned and operated by the Bureau of Land Management.  \n\nQUICK QUESTION: How much land does the BLM own ? \n\nAbout 247.3 Million Acres; or about \u215b of the country. Anytime you are driving through the middle of nowhere USA and wonder who owns the land; chances are it's the BLM. \n\n3. Pleasure Beach | CONNECTICUT\n\n2. Grain Silos | INDIANA \nWhat is the most forgettable state?\n\nSeriously; what do you think the most forgettable state is ? Comment away ! \n\nIndiana is home to hundreds of abandoned grain silos that have somehow managed to survive longer than their surrounding communities.\n\nA great example is Corwin; Indiana. Apparently; its not even a ghost town; being described as an \u201cextinct\u201d town\u2026. Hmmmmm. \n\nWe also have the town of Sloan ; Dunn ; and many many more. \n\n1.1964 New York World\u2019s Fair Pavilion | NYC", "views": "1863228", "has_captions": "false", "title": "8 Forgotten Abandoned Places in America", "dislikes": "1654", "comments": ["What is the MOST Forgettable State ???

As a young teenager we use to climb up into the Pavilion, trip out on acid and smoke weed. lol.  It was and still is an incredible sight to see, despite it's 4-5\" of pigeon shit all over the floor. At 12 yrs old I ran away from home, climbed up into the lower base of the sphere and slept there for 1 night in a snow storm. I learned real quick not to do that again. lol. Many yrs later I now study nutrition and stay extremely fit. Flushing Meadow Park (it's real name) still hosts the US Open for tennis and the old Shea Stadium (now City Field) is home of the NY Mets. All within a few min walking distance within the park. Flushing Meadow Park is still beautiful and still atracks many visitors because of the still open ZOO and petting ZOO and a 50yr old merry go round but today the biggest attraction is the still standing UNISPHERE GLOBE. If anyone visits the park and you are hungry, walk to the town of Corona where you can have the best Italian ice in the country called the Lemon Ice King Of Corona. Also for the best Italian hero's in the state and prob in the east coast \"Leo's Deli\" aka Mama's. It very sad for me to see it change even though it has been abandoned even b4 I was born and I'm 48yrs old. If they ever rebuild it, I might just move back. (NOT).

The John and Yoko bit was George taking the piss out of the whole celebrity thing.

This makes the farms and their workers easy targets for immigration authorities looking to fill deportation quotas. We went to upstate New York to try to understand the cat and mouse game going on between dairy farms and immigration authorities.

How do they get here? One day when sharing some comments of co-workers with a friend. The friend said to me. If they weren't here, who would pick our vegetables? We have degrees, are you going to take that type of job? Our kids get allowances. They aren't going to do it.

Element, beginnend mit dem Universum und einer Pyramide in gypten. Ein Symbol als Schlssel will entziffert werden. Aus dem Inneren der Pyramide werden 4 Steine und ein schwebender Sarkophag geholt, weil Krieg kommen wird. 4 Steine, die am Ende verbunden werden, um den lebensrettenden Lichtstrahl im Zentrum eine Person (Frau als das 5. Element) mssen aktiviert werden in einem Ritual. Ein Rtzel ber die Himmelsrichtungen und der 4 Elemente der Erde. Auf die Erde rast eine sehr hohe Intelligenz als eine Art Masse zu und bedroht die Erde, die wchst, wenn man sie mit Waffen angreift. Nur die Mondoshiva kann dabei helfen. Als die Ausserirdischen die Mondoshiva (me nach jemand, die sich im schwebendem Sakophark befindet) zurckbringen wollen auf die Erde, wurden sie angegriffen. Nur ein ganz kleiner Teil wurde gerettet und aus der DNA eine Frau rekonstruiert, die sich Lilu nennt und das 5. Element ist.\n\nZurck zur Pyramide. Ein Symbol zum verschlossenen Eingang. 4 Steine und der 5. Stein blockiert den Eingang mit einem Symbol fr Himmelsrichtungen und die 4 Elemente der Erde unseres Sonnensystems. Das Zentrum des Kopfes des Shingxs kreist um 12 Tierkreiszeichen. Es gibt aber ein 13 Tierkreiszeichen, die Schlange. Fr mich der Hinweis auf die gefiederte Schlange, die Gottheit, die bei den Mayas sehr wichtig war. Die 12 Tierkreiszeichen in ihrem Umlauf betragen 26.000 Jahre. Demnach knnte die Rckkehr dieser Schlange eine Gottheit in weiblicher Form sein, wie beim 5. Element auch, wo sich das Militr wundert. 12/13 beschreiben aber auch die 12 Apostel mit Jesus im Zentrum. Das 5. Element trgt auch ein Symbol von 4 Zeichen.\n\n10 Steinblcke ber Eingang fr mich ein Hinweis auf 10 Planeten unseres Sonnensysthems. Alles spiegelt fr mich auch gleichzeitig die heilige Geometrie und Mathematik des Universums wieder. Einst gab es wohl einen Knall, woraus sich unser Sonnensysthem gebildet hat und diese 26.000 Jahre berdauert. Vor diesem Knall gab es Atlantis, das aus meiner Sicht ein vorangegangenes Zeitalter darstellt auch gleichzeitig in einer hheren Entwicklungsform oder andere, die eben vor diesem Knall war. Atlantis ist mglicherweise kein spezieller Ort in dem Sinne, sondern ein ursprnglich anderes System gewesen.\n\nZeichnet man in die Erdkugel das Symbol von Gral und Speer vereint, das ein 3D-Davidstern ist, so entstehen 8 Hauptpunkte, an denen sich heute die grossen wichtigen Energieorte der Erde befinden, zb die Osterinsel aber als zentraler Punkt die Pyramiden von Gizeh. Im Symbol dieses Videos sehen wir 8 lineare Linien und 2 Kreise. Zusammen sind es 10. die 8 Linien sind 8 Energiepunkte. Die Beiden Kreise stehen fr den Nordpol und Sdpol und/oder deren Halbkugeln. Schauen wir mal auf die DNA der Menschen. Sie werden unterteilt zwischen 2 grossen Hauptkathekorien von plus und minus, wie bei Magneten, die ebenfalls norden und sden bedeuten in der Zuordnung. Auch in der Blutgruppenzuordnungen geht es um Vertrglichkeiten und deren Anziehung und Abstossung. Es gibt 4 Unterkathekorien des Blutes von A, B, AB und Null. Mit der Zuordnung von jeweils plus oder minus machen es wieder 8. A, B, AB und Null stellen auch im bertragenen Sinne projeziert die Himmelsrichtungen dar mit ihrem Nullpunkt im Zentrum. A und B getrennt fr Nord und Sd, AB fr Ost/West, der ja nur ein pol ist, schaut man auf die Kugel genau hin mit ihren 360 Grad und Null fr Null.\n\nDer 5. Stein also, auf dem sich das Symbol befindet bedeutet nichts weiter als die Verbindung von allem als das 5. Element sozusagen. Wir kennen es zb als die allumfassende Liebe oder Gott oder Alah usw... Es ist die geheimnisvolle Tr als Zugang zu unseren Herzen, die uns mit allem Sein verbinden lsst, der Schlssel sozusagen.", "Die Pyramiden werden uns auch die nchsten Jahrzehnte noch gewaltige Rtsel aufgeben!", "Komisch das alle bedeutungen irgendwie sinn machen ob von links nach rechts oder von rechts nach links ...ich finde es sooooo schade das wir nicht die wahrheit erfahren danke fr das video", "Ich mchte ja keinesfalls als Besserwisser auftreten, aber als jemand der bereits in gypten war:\n0:30...1:18...usw.. das ist nicht die Cheops-Pyramide...es ist die des Chefren...die 2.-grte der 3 Pyramiden auf dem Plateau von Giza.\nSie wird oft mit der Cheops-Pyramide verwechselt, da sie auf einem erhhten Teil des Plateaus steht, und von daher hher aussieht.\n1:41...die Grafik zeigt ebenfalls die Chefren-Pyramide an der Stelle, an der eigentlich die Cheops-Pyramide stehen msste, sie ist somit kompletter Unfug...!\nDie Cheops-Pyramide steht auen, die des Chefren (die mit der erhaltenen \"Spitze\") steht in der Mitte der drei.

A wiser species would sit back and observe while humanity matures and becomes more stable.", "Have patience, young padawan.", "Meanwhile, aliens are wondering the same question...", "There's the possibility we are islands of life in a great big ocean and will never ever meet considering the vast distances involved, Also whole civilizations could have risen and fallen before We came along, or will long after we're gone....Just saying.", "The Fermi Paradox is only a paradox because people refuse to accept simple explanations. \n\nFirst, the Earth is a double planet system. Isaac Asimov pointed out almost 60 years ago that lunar tides were the probable reason life colonized land. Toss plants onto land twice a day, and the ones that survived 12 hours (much less before tidal drag slowed rotation down) would live to reproduce and move into an uncontested niche. \"But wait,\" you scream! There are also solar tides. Yes, but the moon stabilizes Earth's rotational axis. Without the moon, Earth could be like Venus, with one solar tide a year and one diurnal cycle a year. That's not a great environment for the evolution of land based life, or photosynthesis for that matter. It's likely a technological civilization would only develop in a double planet system. How rare are they? Nobody knows, but our solar system only has one. Thank you, Dr. Asimov.\n\nSecond, space is really, really big. Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across. If a Spooky Smart Alien (SSA) decides to invest the energy to get up to 0.1c, he could get across it in a million years. That's three times as long as our species has existed. If alien stops to colonize, it would take far longer, with all the speeding up, slowing down, and building a new civilization at each rest stop. Of course, genetic drift in small populations proceeds much faster, so SSA might evolve into a different species before he even gets off his space ship. SSA-2 might not be as smart, or might decide getting up to 0.1c is to expensive. Bag the whole colonization scheme. Why invest in colonization when your species doesn't get to benefit, and your weird successor species might come back to wage war on you? That doesn't even count the cost of failed colonies. \n\nThird, the inverse square law. This goes with space being really, really big. You may think Earth is loud in the radio spectrum, but it's not. Our very best radio telescopes could only pick us out of the background noise at about 30 light years. All the SETI programs hope that SSA is out there putting gigawatts of energy into a tight beam signal that we would just happen to intercept. \n\nThose are three huge \"filters\" that nobody wants to talk about. It's almost a certainty that there are other technological civilizations in our galaxy, but far fewer than counting planets would suggest, and we have no way of knowing.", "I 100% believe that we will never confirm intellegent out there. Not because it doesn't exist, but because the Universe is so massive. Nature has and will always humble our greatest technological advancements. There could be billions of civilizations out there, but theyre probably so far away from each other that all they see around them is empty space. 100 years from now, well be having the same conversation.", "What if all the galaxies are the milky way just in a different point in time", "I'm still searching for intelligent life on this planet", "Dark souls taught me that, leaving spitefully misleading information for newcomers, leading them to their inevitable doom, never stops being funny.", "Wait wait I thought we already contacted aliens. There are all these \"star seed\" channels on youtube that claim they talk to the paladians andromedians orions and reptilians. Seems legit.", "The universe is VAST, that being there could potentially be fully developed, underdeveloped or even overdeveloped galaxies.  Now every star means it could be a galaxy that could probably have solar systems of their own. It would be very irrational and selfish to think that only those elements that evolved us in our planet are the sole elements in the universe.  Other stars/galaxies could have different types of lives and nothing like we could even possibly imagine.  Lifeforms that only developed under those planets elements that could not be found anywhere else.  Look at the small microbes that even survive in methane, we couldnt possibly live In methane but that psictico bacteria can.  Now that doesnt mean life wont thrive yet it did.  All Im saying is that LIFE FINDS A WAY and we are definitely not the only life form in the universe.", "What if aliens are little microscopic bacteria running around on another planet", "As Bill Watterson said : The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us."], "n_comments": "6811", "likes": "26588", "channel": "PBS Space Time"}, "J0JaGi5CkaI": {"category": "25", "postdate": "2017-06-14T00:16:45.000Z", "description": "Jeff Sessions Testifies before Senate committee on Russia, Comey, Sergey kislyak.\n\nThe hearing will be focused on Sessions' involvement in the Trump campaign and his meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US.

So the day of the hearing comes and my lawyer tells me the court's VCR wasn't working (this was the end of 2012 at this point...), and so the prosecution had delayed the trial. The day of the reschedule hearing rolls around and there's a long wait. Sure enough, my lawyer tells me that the prosecution's tape isn't working, but we will proceed regardless. My lawyer tells me \"everything is taken care of\". So in the courtroom, the JUDGE tells me that the prosecution and defense have reached a deal (which I had not been informed of), where the case is dropped and I'm banned from all Wal-Marts and Sam's Clubs (and can't counter-sue since it's a deal). Since this was the first time I had heard about this deal, and indeed the first time I had ever been in trouble for anything, I'm stunned; I hesitated and said \"I'm sorry, what?\", to which the judge sternly and loudly repeats themself. At this point I kinda jump and say \"Yes\" to the deal. My cowardly lawyer had made a deal with a prosecution that had ZERO evidence against me. So in addition to the prosecutor being a sleazebag, my own lawyer played along in their game, telling me after the deal was to \"appease Wal-Mart\" (exact words), despite me telling him from day 1 I had no intention of taking any deal.\n\nOn the topic of defense lawyers, for any innocent person looking for a defense lawyer, never hire Nic B. Kuvshinoff in Maryland. He's a spineless coward (and it's not defamation if it's true; come and get me, coward). One of the few regrets I hold is not responding to the judge with \"I'd like to request a brief recess while I fire my lawyer, as he is no longer working with my interests in mind.\"", "John missed something on Glenn Ford case. When Ford was left out after 30 years on death row he was eligible for $313,000 U.S. dollars in compensation. But the judge denied it believing he still had some part in the crime. He ended up with only around $30. \nAnd you know what the worst part is? He died 15 months after his release.", "The punishment for withholding evidence should be equal to the consequence for the person sent to jail. 25 years off an innocent person's life in jail = 25 years in jail for withholding evidence that could have cleared that person", "'ZERO TOLERANCE' .

I said \"yes.\" Never heard from them again.", "So we have the police brutally over reacting in the interactions with citizens, we have privatized prisons paying judges to keep people in prison long after their sentences are over, we have minorities receiving stricter sentences that whites, conditions in prisons are overcrowded and simply abhorrent, we have forensic science that isn't based on any science, we got convictions based solely on eye witness testimony which is the absolute least reliable form of evidence, we have laws that protect people better if they shoot someone to death than if they punch them, we have people serving longer sentences for having a joint in their pocket than people that con the elderly out of every cent they've saved their entire lives, and public defendants clearly in cahoots with prosecutors to get those convictions or maybe they just don't care, now prosecutors withhold evidence that proves defendants innocent just to get higher conviction rates and assholes saying that's ok.

His entourage catches up with Mr.S. They enter the restaurant and are led to a private dining room. \nAfter dinner they settle in wing chairs around the piano. Sinatra leans over to his road manager Tony Oppedisano, motions towards me and says Look, hes playing with the soft pedal on, real mellow. Im playing Autumn In New York (a whole step higher than he recorded it) and he starts singing along.

Then he got a call from the Local 47 Union Hall to go play drums ata session at Capitol Records. It was his first recoding date. So,John shows up with his traps and his kit and low and behold it's a Sinatra date. Of course, Frank is fashionably late, and the producer, arranger and musicians are running over the four tunes they are to record in the next three hours. Sinatra walks in a door behind the drums and stands there looking at Poole who stands up from his drum stool, hand extended, and says, \"Mr. Sinatra, what a thrill it is to be recording with you!\" Sinatra just beams at him and huffs out of the room without a word. The producer of the session comes up to John and hestarts waving his arms, andraving at him, \"You doNOT speak to Mr. Sinatra! You doNOT even make eye contact with him! Don't even look at him. If you have anything to say or any questions you ask me!\" Later that evening the session reconvened and they cut the four tunes and thenSinatra walked out without a word. \n\nYears later inAustralia, JohnPoole was on tour with Anita in 1959as part of the Red Norvo, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Anita O'Daypackage tour from which some very fine live recordings were issued from dates down under.

About that time Anita comes rushing up and yells in Frank's face, \"Mr. Sinatra, if you have anything to say to my drummer, you doNOT speak to him, yousay it tome!\" Then theroom got eerily quiet. You could hear a cigar ash fall on the hardwood floor. Frank just stood there and didn't say a word. Anita's trying to catch her breath after the explosion she just let loose.

But if he can convert his building skills into entrepreneurship he stands a chance. And there's no commission!\n\nBecky and Jen become event managers, a first for both. Will they have to block off the street? Who's doing the catering? What about parking? Permits? Auctioneer?

There are more awesome videos being made every week, like and subscribe to World Unearthed so you don't miss a beat !\n\n6.The Great Pyramid Chambers \nLOCATION - EGYPT\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of all pyramids in Egypt. It has been part of history and mysteries for more than 4000 years. \n\nOur first modern glimpse inside the structure was around 820 AD when the presiding caliph used battering rams to create a tunnel.  The Great Pyramid has been studied and explored over and over, and to this day we find new and intriguing things about it.\n\nThe confirmed chambers that exist are the Queen\u2019s Chamber, the Grand Gallery, and finally the King\u2019s Chamber. Of the three, the queen\u2019s chamber is the least explored one. \n\nResearchers have recently found 2 more \u201csecret\u201d chambers hidden deep inside. Operation \u201cScan Pyramids\u201d has came out with solid proof about the extra chambers after they found 2 anomalies using thermal scanning. \n\nThis has sparked new found interested in cracking the mysteries of the pyramids, and the people who built them.\n\n5.Codex Gigas\nLOCATION - CZECH REPUBLIC\n\n4.Lady of the Spiked Throne\nLOCATION - MIDDLE EAST\n\n3.Egyptian Treasures in the Grand Canyon\nLOCATION - ARIZONA\n\nThe year is 1909, and two ambitious archaeologists are embarking on the journey of a century.  The expedition organized by the Smithsonian Institute focused on expanding our knowledge of the Grand Canyon and the cultures that call that place home.\n\nThe two explorers were Professor S. Jordan, and self proclaimed adventurer G. Kinkaid. Their first trip around the canyon wielded amazing finds, including a network of tunnels and chambers filled with artifacts resembling those found in Egypt or Tibet.\n\nAnd thats about it, this is where the story ends, and the mystery begins.  The only accounts of this expedition was written in a small local newspaper, the Arizona Gazette on March 12, 1909,. \n\nThere was a follow up article that quoted Kinkaid  saying\n\n\"The idol almost resembles Buddha, though the scientists are not certain as to what religious worship it represents. Taking into consideration everything found thus far, it is possible that this worship most resembles the ancient people of Tibet.\"\n\nThe articles have sparked many theories, and the obvious thing to do was contact the Smithsonian and cross reference the newspaper\u2019s findings.  Their response was less than thrilling, stating they had no records of the expedition, or of \u201cProfessor S. Jordan\u201d ever existing.\n\nIt is impossible to know the truth unless someone comes forward, either from the Smithsonian, or the Arizona Gazette. If it was just an elaborate hoax, who was it meant to fool? The 500 people reading the paper? If it was a cover up, what was so controversial that the public was not ready for?\n\nThe Grand Canyon still holds some mysteries and it has many restricted areas, maybe those areas are the ones containing the tunnels and ancient artifacts\u2026 only one way to find out ! \n\n2.The Yaghan People\nLOCATION - TIERRA DEL FUEGO\n\nThe Yaghan Tribe living on the islands of Tierra Del Fuego are regarded as the southernmost peoples in the world. And when you look at a map of the place, its easy to see why. They can see Antarctica from their backyards !\n\nThe yaghan were hunter gatherers that had not met europeans until the 16th century, but they left a lasting impression on any traveller that was brave enough to stop there.\n\nThe strangest part about the Tribe was their extreme adaptation to the freezing climate. They did not wear any clothes, even when the average yearly temperature is around 5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe tribes numbers were estimated to be around 3000 before colonization of the region began, nowadays they number around 1500 people, and there is only 1 surviving member that can speak their old language. Their culture and language will soon be completely forgotten\u2026 and with it,  our chances of finding out who these people are, where they came from, and what made them impervious to the cold climate. \n\n1.Mount Nemrut\nFinally we have the mysterious statues of Mount Nemrut, it is believed they were erected sometime during the 1st Century BC, and served as guardians to the unknown tomb behind them. No one knows who was buried there, or why they were important enough to warrant statues.\n\nIt is believed that the tomb might belong to Antiochus, a royal leader of the area during the Hellenistic Period, the ancient site was \u201cdiscovered\u201d in 1881\n\nThe site is deteriorating, fast. There is not much that can be done to reconstruct or repair the statues, and the heavy snowfall during the winter speeds up their erosion immensely.", "title": "6 Ancient Mysteries Unearthed", "has_captions": "false", "views": "152486", "dislikes": "88", "comments": ["I really appreciate that you focus on more obscure things in your videos, instead of only on super popular places and items that every other  archaeology channel dose.

The weather in Tivat was supposed to be windy, and the only approach available was NDB RWY 32. This meant that we had to continue visually after the final descent point (TAZ NDB). As the NDB approach had been selected in the FMC, no vertical and lateral guidance (VNAV/LNAV) could be provided after TAZ.\n\nIt was going to be a challenging approach. First, Runway 32 in Tivat is not alligned with the final path - at appx 500 feet you have to bank left as RWY course differs by 20 degrees from the approach track. It is not difficult when the air is calm, but it is not easy during hard gusts - the biggest problem is to control the speed and path simulataneously.\n\nThe airport is located between the mountains, so, in windy weather pilots expect wind shears.

That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer. \n\nThe professor then said, \"OK, we will have an experiment in this class on this plan\". All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A.... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all as socialism).\n\nAfter the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little. \n\nThe second test average was a D! No one was happy. When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F. \n\nAs the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else. \n\nTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed. \n \n \nThese are possibly the 5 best sentences you'll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:\n\n1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\n\n2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.\n\n3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.\n\n4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!\n\n5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.\n\nCan you think of a reason for not sharing this?\nNeither could I."], "n_comments": "1107", "likes": "8213", "channel": "The Best of Anything Channel"}, "GK9XVfenLtI": {"category": "28", "postdate": "2019-01-03T09:42:45.000Z", "description": "Click Here: http://bit.ly/15sGvHf\nHere are the 10 Most Amazing Video in The World You Need To See #9\n\ncredit:\nTHE FROG - http://www.frogfitness.com/\nLiddiard Wheels - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrYLUAn24hA\nTREADWALL - http://brewerfitness.com/\n\nSubscribe Here - http://bit.ly/15sGvHf\n\n(Following back right now!)\nfacebook - http://on.fb.me/1xSGnHm\ntwitte - http://bit.ly/1BbZ4KU\ntumblr - http://bit.ly/1Cf4KFt\npinterest - http://bit.ly/1GqON3h\nGOOGLE+ - http://bit.ly/1yGYE1n\n\n\u266b Music:\nArc North - Meant To Be ft.

Denn der luxurise Innenraum wird nur zum Wohnen genutzt, und nicht fr Landwirtschaft und Produktion verschwendet.", "Auch hier natrlich auch wieder alles nur unter der Bedingung, dass wir Menschen uns nicht in den nchsten paar Jhrchen selbst vernichten (Trump Und Co. ^^). Wie immer natrlich ein super Video, immer wieder schn zu sehen, dass ihr das Ganze so professionell macht :D Ich glaube, das Problem wird die Beschaffung dieser riesigen Mengen an Ressourcen sein, die zum Bau eines solchen Zylinders bentigt werden (Nebenbei: In so einem Zylinder zu leben, stelle ich mir ziemlich gruselig vor xD ) Und natrlich msste die Erde im Prinzip eine Regierung haben, da es, wenn es zum Zeitpunkt des Baus eines solchen Zylinders noch mehrere Regierungen gibt, wahrscheinlich riesige Proteste der anderen geben wrde, die das teil nicht bauen wrden... wrde mich freuen wenn ihr mal ein Video nur ber die Gefahren und groen Probleme bei der Besiedlung des Weltraum machen wrdet :D \n\n\nP.S. ICH finde es immer noch unglaublich, wie schnell ihr wachst ^^ was fr einen Dnger benutzt ihr? ;)", "Eine phantastische Folge. Sehr schne Gedanken zu der Zukunft der Menschheit.\n- Begrenzung der Bevlkerung  nach chinesischen Muster (Einkindehe) wird wohl als EINE LSUNG kommen.\n- oder grere Krankheiten, wie eine EBOLA-Epedimie (glaube kaum dass das gewollt ist)\n- Terraforming - Venus und Merkur wird wohl kaum funktionieren.\n- Mond Bevlkerung (vermute dort dass man Hhlen bewohnen wird wegen der Stahlung.\n- Mars besiedeln wird wohl die nchste Mglichkeit sein etwas zu tun.

Ich habe mich damit schon mal gedanklich beschftigt, als ich dazu das Video von Walter Ulrich (oder Ulrich Walter?) gesehen habe und habe das eher kritisch gesehen. Einmal wegen des Materials, das diese Krfte auffangen msste. Und einmal wegen des Zwecks. Also als Generationenraumschiff um andere Planetensysteme zu erreichen wre das vielleicht schon sinnvoll. Aber nur wegen des Lebensraums halte ich das fr wenig sinnvoll, denn 800km2 bzw. 13Mio. Menschen, das ist nur ein Bruchteil dessen, was die Erde zur Verfgung stellt. Auch Rohstoffe gibt es hier viel mehr als in dem Zylinder.\r\nUnd dann ist da natrlich die Frage, welche Menschen dort leben sollen. Ein Groteil der Erdbevlkerung ist ja sehr arm und lebt unter sehr schlechten Bedingungen. Und wenn die Bevlkerung auf 20Mrd anwchst, dann mit Sicherheit auch zum Groteil in dieser armen Gruppe. Ich kann es mir irgendwie kaum vorstellen, dass man Millionen armer Bauernfamilien in Spaceshuttles reinsetzt und zu den Zylindern fliegt. Also, als Konzept gefllt mir die Idee, aber ich kann mir die praktische Umsetzung, und meine damit nicht die technische Seite, einfach nicht vorstellen.\r Ich denke, man kann die Erde viel effektiver nutzen, als es jetzt der Fall ist und auch locker 50Mrd Menschen hier unterbringen, wenn man das klug anstellen wrde. \nAber die Prsentation in eurem Video war natrlich super :)", "In Star Trek wird einmal sowas hnliches gezeigt VOY: Das Generationenschiff\nEs ist aber was anderes.", "Habe eurer video gesehen und bemerkt, dass unsere Thematik der Videos relativ gleich ist.

Ob sich das auf den Organismus auswirkt, wenn die Beine mehr Gewicht haben als der Kopf?\nBei 8xpi haben wir ca. 25km Umfang. Das Ganze mal 28 sind etwa 700km/h. \nGeht man davon aus, das die Atmosphre mit rotiert, dann ist das kein Problem.\nDas Ganze wird aber zum Zentrum hin ein Problem. Denn dort wird der Umfang und damit die Atmosphrenrotation irgendwann null. Die beschleunigte und die nicht beschleunigte Atmosphre drfte also ordentlich durcheinander kommen. Ich wei nicht, aber ich glaube dort will(oder kann) keiner leben.\nWenn ich mit meiner berlegung nicht komplett daneben liege, dann msste man den ONiel Zylinder anders bauen. Mann msste 2 Zylinder ineinander stecken, so das der knstliche Himmel nur wenige Meter enfernt ist. Dies birgt natrlich neue Probleme, aber man htte eine halbwegs gleichmige Atmosphrenrotation. Mann knnte auch ganz viele Zylinder ineinder Stecken und je kleiner der Zylinder wird, desto hher wird seine Rotationsgeschwindigkeit.(Wenn das Problem von Schwerer Fu-> Leichter Kopf egal ist)\nAber ich denke es wre zwingend notwendig, die unterschiedlich schnellen Atmosphrischen Schichten voneinander abzugrenzen.

He offered 300,000 - and got it.", "I completely agree with MrFlyboy1313, in your budget I'd be looking at monohulls.  You could get a really, really, nice boat within your budget, AND your running expenses ( insurance, marina, and maintenance costs 1 engine instead of 2 engines!) would be lower.   You could probably find a fantastic boat, and plenty left over to cushion your sailing kitty, or buy some cool toys and gadgets.  No matter how good a boat is built, or maintained, there is always stuff that breaks, and those repair cost can add up especially if you're stretching your budget, and having to take out loans,  just to buy the boat.  While there is a lot of fairly inexpensive activities to do at different ports, it's nice to have a little jingle in your pocket to do some fun stuff on land.  I'd go for a monohull.", "Maybe you guys should hit another destination to look... Charleston, SC.... Something... Florida just seems just as expensive as Annapolis....", "The maintenance and repair costs on this caliber of boat will  most likely break the bank.

Cheers", "One year later and you guys are still alive and doing great! bravo!", "do you guys have someone looking for boats in the Seattle /Portland area? They might be cheaper out west!", "I hope you find a great deal on one.", "Please Read: Most people with your price range go for a Lagoon 380, which is a tough and proven vessel, and sells for $120-$150k. The OTHER option, and the one I personally prefer, is to consider a Wharram Catamaran. Wharram's are tough boats, with many circumnavigations to their name, and you can get a 55ft catamaran for $75k, 40ft for $45k, and a 30ft, perfect for a couple, for $20k.  You can't beat those prices. And they are beautiful boats, with a timeless Polynesian/Nautical Adventurer aesthetic. They are open decked, no building on top, just a beautiful open deck(install a wind/spray dodger at the helm) with plenty of space in the hulls for galley, berths, head, storage, etc. The prices I listed are for used boats, but if you want something new then you have David Halliday at BoatSmith Inc, the only US approved Wharram builder, located right next to you in West Palm Beach. He can build you a new custom Catamaran, far more seaworthy than any of the boats you have visited, in the 36-40ft range for $100-$150k, depending on finishings and if you choose to add bridgedeck housing. I have no affiliation with David or Wharram, I just love their boats and dream to one day set off beyond the horizon in one. This is David giving a tour of a 48 ft Wharram, freshly built in their shop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhMNgn0jSfQ   It is quite beautiful. I also created a playlist of some of my favorite Wharram videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-4scq29vxtkhWOw34np0bYhiIF3qx6HE", "Good luck with the hunt.  The 43 and 410 are great boats.  Had a Leopard 40 (owners) and looked seriously at the Lagoon 38.  Big jump in interior space between the 38/40 and the 410/43.  Loved the finish quality of both, particularly the Leopards.", "Ugh, what a learning curve vs. an RV!  The maintenance alone looks intimidating, let alone operating the thing.

Just go sell a kidney on the black market.", "I am baffled why so many people are negative about the idea of you doing this???? You will have fun, learn many new things and enjoy a new twist on life. Thousands of people have enjoyed sailing / cruising without major catastrophe. If it isn't something you love, you will move on and have memories.", "Look around the Great lakes for a boat. I still think your first year should be spent sailing the great lakes.", "You guys look so depressed in your second boat and I felt so bad for you guys. Good luck finding the right finance for your dream boat.", "Interiors are important as you will be living aboard but you seem to completely ignore the systems and what makes the boat work. Those bigger cats have enormous mainsails. Do you understand how to reef when over powered. Do you both have the physical strength to deal with it. Are you even aware of the enormous loads involved. Are you looking at storm equipment or ground tackle, electronics? Are there whisker poles  or spinnaker poles? Is the boat set up for offshore if that is your dream? Is it even a good offshore boat. Cats also have a huge amount of windage and can be hard to control in 30+ knots in tight quarters sometimes unable to make headway. I'm assuming you are wanting to venture offshore a bit, Caribbean? Do you suffer from sea sickness, do your cats? Maybe a week skippered charter in the shoulder season or a charter/ instruction would give you a better idea of what is important and more importantly if you like it.

Also, if you don't care about money Jerry than why do you have to own the most expensive apartment in NYC? If you didn't care why not one that is half that price yet still very expensive? The fact that he spends his money on the most expensive and very best things tell me he cares. Otherwise he wouldn't spend it the way he does.

They were wiped-out in a series of global catastrophes.  Each disaster changed the course of evolution on earth.  Without them mankind, nor any of the life we see around us, would be here today.  For out of catastrophe comes rebirth.  Evolution is a savage, imperfect and violent process.  It's survive or perish.  The earth's history of catastrophes has both moulded the planet and determined evolution.  For each disaster led to another leap forward on the evolutionary trail form single celled bacteria to humankind itself.\n\nEpisode 4 - Asteroid Impact\n\nDinosaurs rose up as rulers of Earth around 230 million years ago, eventually dominating all other species and relegating mammals to the shadows.  But 65 million years ago their planet was rocked by yet another massive event when, seemingly out of nowhere, the mighty dinosaurs were wiped off the face of Earth.  But without this devastating catastrophe, humans would not be here today.\n\nThis film explores the trail of clues that lead to what extinguished the dinosaurs and ultimately led to the evolution of humans.

Its like watching a documentary about the theory of relativity which never mentions Albert Einstein.\n\nI was a geology student at UC Berkeley from 1978 through 1980, and I watched the asteroid theory hatch, up close and personal. I was involved with Professor Walter Alvarez (Luis Alvarez, a Nobel Prize winner, is Walters father) on two different projects which were directly related to researching the asteroid theory. Watching this documentary a person might think that the young lady with the computer simulation came up with the idea of impact-induced, winter-like conditions. I doubt she was even born during my Berkeley days, when this was a regular topic of discussion in the halls of the Earth Science Building, sometimes along with its kissing cousin, nuclear winter. \n\nIf you want the real, accurate story, there is a short, very readable book by Walter Alvarez titled T-Rex and the Crater of Doom.", "CATASTROPHE???

It operates worldwide air freight and logistics services and is headquartered at Frankfurt Airport, the main hub of Lufthansa. Besides operating dedicated cargo planes, the company also has access to cargo capacities of 350 passenger aircraft of the Lufthansa Group. Lufthansa operated a cargo subsidiary, called German Cargo, between 1977 and 1993 (earlier still, cargo operations were executed in-house, under the Lufthansa Cargo name), when -in an effort to restructure the company- the cargo division was re-integrated into its parent, and split up into two parts (one for scheduled operations using Lufthansa-owned aircraft, and one for freight and logistics services using chartered or leased aircraft).\nLufthansa Cargo was created as a limited stock company on 30 November 2004, along with Lufthansa Cargo Charter. Lufthansa Cargo uses LH (the same IATA code as Lufthansa), as well as GEC (the former ICAO code of German Cargo) as airline codes. Lufthansa is unique compared to its major European competitors like British Airways and Air France in that the cargo business is organized in an entirely different airline entity. For some years, Lufthansa Cargo (including the freight transported in the cargo holds of mainline Lufthansa passenger aircraft) was the leading cargo airline in terms of international freight tonne-kilometres carried, but has since been surpassed by Cathay Pacific and Korean Air Cargo.\n\nThe 777 Freighter (777F) is an all-cargo version of the twinjet, and shares features with the -200LR; these include its airframe, engines, and fuel capacity.[146] With a maximum payload of 224,900 lb (102,000 kg) (similar to the 243,000 lb (110,000 kg) of the 747-200F), it has a range of 4,970 nmi (9,200 km). Greater range is possible if less cargo weight is carried.\nAs the aircraft promises improved operating economics compared to older freighters, airlines have viewed the 777F as a replacement for freighters such as the 747-200F, MD-10, and MD-11F. The first 777F was delivered to Air France on February 19, 2009. As of September 2017, 131 freighters had been delivered to 16 different customers, with 30 unfilled orders. Operators had 128 of the 777F in service as of July 2017.\nIn the 2000s, Boeing began studying the conversion of 777-200ER and -200 passenger airliners into freighters, under the name 777 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter). The company has been in discussion with several airline customers, including FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, and GE Capital Aviation Services, to provide launch orders for a 777 BCF program.", "title": "B777F ULTIMATE COCKPIT MOVIE: Lufthansa Cargo Captain Rikard delivers two pregnant horses [AirClips]", "has_captions": "false", "views": "629540", "dislikes": "235", "comments": ["German pilot 1: \"Guten Abend die Herren\" - German pilot 2: \"Gute Nacht\" - Tokyo ATC: station calling, say again?? :)", "I am 44 years old but it is videos like this one that make me say \"when I grow up I want to be a pilot\"...

If it wasn't you wouldn't see those beautiful flecks and rays! Quarter sawn is wood sawn with the grain perpendicular to the surface of the face of the board. Thanks again for this look into the mobile saw mill.", "Check your definition of quarter sawn wood. What you got from your sawyer was all flat sawn. He just cut the log into four \"quarters\" for easier flat sawing. Quarter sawing is time consuming and tedious and most sawyers charge extra.", "Im also just saying whathe ended up with was 500$ worth of lumber on the other hand if I turned that whole log into a bookmatched slab set it would sell for 4-5grand for the whole set.", "naw not 1/4 sawn nope 100% jack leg wish I was a sawyer but I commend the guy for chargin ya 75bucks and hour", "As a sawyer, and fellow woodworker enthusiast; excellent video. The finished product is gorgeous!", "just over an hour from me!", "Never ingage the 4 wheel drive on the pavement ,that was your problem........ nive vid.", "What a waste of time and that log, no offense but you spent half the day rolling the log around and the other half chopping it with an ax just to get 4 cants and another day to mill those cants, that like 200BF in 2 days. Now that is a great mill dont get me wrong but its out of its element with wood that size. My lucas swingblade would of set up around the tree abou 15mins and I could mill the whole log into demensinol flooring and 50in slabs and could of done 2 of those logs a day. Just saying right tool for the right job and that bandsaw is ment for smaller trees at a higher rate.", "Really interesting video, but I was wondering : Since the log was quartered after sawn into a cant, why not quarter it prior to placing it on the sawmill?", "A lot of viable white oak was lost due to diameter of the log. Could not be helped, had to fit between the blade guides. But that \"slabwood\" can be cut into useful lumber still. Anyone thinking of having wood sawn with a portable bandsaw mill should stick to logs 30\" diameter or less, unless the sawmill is particularly huge. And if a 30\" log is to be quarter sawn, have a forklift or loader tractor with forks there to help, as the log needs to be cut in half down the middle and one portion taken aside until one half has been cut into proper quarter sawn. SOME boards will be rift sawn.", "But, just quartering the log like that and then slabbing off the quarters from top to bottom, would result in some boards quarter sawn (grain perpendicular to the surface of the board), and some flat sawn (grain flat with the surface).  You'd have to flip the quartered sections back and forth to achieve perpendicular (i.e., quarter sawn) grain on all the boards.  And if you're going to flip the quarters back and forth, so that they sit on the vertical then the horizontal quartering cuts, why bother squaring the log in the first place?  Cut the log in half horizontally, then brace and wedge it so that the cut stands vertically, and cut that half log in half, then flip the resulting quarter logs back and forth for each quarter sawn board cut.  You'll get wider and more usable quarter sawn boards by leaving the live edge on them.  AND every board will have the quarter sawn perpendicular grain on its face.", "that is not quarter sawn its flat sawn", "Very cool. I spent 3 days last year helping a friend mill and move quite a lot of southern yellow pine, and it definitely gives you an appreciation for the process... as well as several sore muscles! :)", "I'm in Culpeper just 25-30 minutes from Ruckersville.

Though there are most likely going to be several of these ships within our atmosphere, since the one captured was only a piece of the mission they first uncovered in 2006, there were several individuals and separate ships performing the mission they uncovered! \n\n\nThis captured technology I mention and the time frame \"I have a comment that I posted here on youtube just before the Pentagon released admission of a study between 2007 and 2012\", but in that comment I mention the 2007 to 2012 ufo study program, it's failure and cancellation, shortly after my information was verified by their statement of admission released to the public, but that study was to try to locate more technology like was originally recovered from a captured ship and possible captive citizens!\n\n\nSimilar to the situation that was encountered with the very individual related to the 2006 rescue mission \"Unmentioned here\" which led to the capture of the mentioned healing technology and ship it was operating in!

First clue: The military base announced at mars 7 2014 that the airport at Diego Garcia would be closed for traffic in the next 72 hours.(!!).\n\nThe captain on MH 370 was obviously pre-programed or forced take the plane to this destination. So, they unloaded the plane, locked up the people at the base,\nand unloaded some precious cargo which so important it had to be kept in the US-embassy in Kuala Lumpur previous to flight.\n\nNext clue is the black photo with co-ordinates sent from a cellph. belonging to one of the passengers when he was locked up at the base.\n\nNext step is to fuel up the craft, put the people back on and dispatch it. This adds up. but it is just my thoughts.", "\nMystery solved  a tale of 2 pilots\n Since the day it was revealed to the world that Fight 370 very likely ended up at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, I finally came up with a theory that not only makes sense, but actually answers all of the big picture questions. All other theories that I have read only created more questions than it did to answer any. My theory fits the pieces of this jigsaw together rather than tear it apart.\nTheory\nI believe that Captain Zaharie was a one-man hijacker who commandeered his own airliner by locking his co-pilot out of the flight deck, murdered all on board by gaining altitude and manipulating the oxygen supply. Shortly after he locked the co-pilot out, he put on his own oxygen mask, started climbing and manipulated the switches to starve them of air. In a few short minutes he could become the only living person on the airplane. He could descend and do whatever he had planned without any disruptions from the remaining 238 people on board. He would have time to work on his new navigational plan to fly to the middle of the Indian Ocean where he died when the fuel starved airplane crashed into the sea. He had several hours to work on radar avoidance and trying to erase evidence of his deeds by severing all possible connections.\nMotive\nWhy would Captain Zaharie decide to take his own life and all these innocent people? The exact same reason that regular suicide bombers try and kill as many innocent people as they can  organized religious extremism. Many suicide bombers believe that they will become Martyrs in another life and have 72 virgins as a direct reward for their mass murder. In this case, Captain Zaharie had another incentive. He was vain enough to take pride in being able to manipulate himself into aviation history by becoming another enduring mystery like Amelia Earhart. He did his best to make this airplane disappear forever. As well, insurance payouts are easier without suicide and less stress on family and friends who would be connected to a mass murderer.\nMy theory also explains why terrorist organizations have never claimed responsibility. It is likely that Captain Zaharie acted on behalf of himself  only.\nHas this sort of thing ever happened before in aviation?\nYes  Egypt Air Flight 990 on Oct 31, 1999 and Silk Air 185 on the 19 of December 1997.\nWhy didnt he crash shortly after his hijacking?\n Captain Zaharie Was very likely familiar with the 2 known commercial pilot suicide/murders mentioned above. They are well documented and have been featured on TV shows like Mayday. The learning curve that Captain Zaharie may have observed was that cockpit voice recorders can be a real enemy to suicidal pilots. In both cases, the cockpit recorders allowed investigators to make an accurate determination of what actually happened  suicide by pilot. He knew that the recorders last 30 minutes would be scrutinized, so crashing immediately after commandeering his own plane was not a good idea if you want your deed to be a secret forever. You need a quiet recorder that does not play back repeated sounds like I rely on God as did the Egypt Air flight recorder. This why Captain Zaharie Killed all passengers first and bought himself lots of uninterrupted time to carry out the remainder of his plan. I believe that his erasing information from his flight simulator is very indicative of his pre-planning this whole thing.\nPhone call from co-pilot\nAfter hearing that the co-pilot tried a call on his cell tells me that he was probably calling for help after he realized that something was amiss. He probably is an unsung hero and very likely may have been part of any effort to take back the cockpit before the cabin was starved of oxygen.\nConclusion\nHe had the opportunity, the motive and the skill to pull it off. If the glove fits you must not acquit. This is the only theory that makes complete sense!", "4 years later, the MYSTERY remains INTACT !"], "n_comments": "273", "likes": "586", "channel": "breakingbad"}, "CC2dTreNAKk": {"category": "25", "postdate": "2017-02-04T22:32:57.000Z", "description": "Trey Gowdy Corners a Weasel in the State Department!\nCongressman Trey Gowdy confronts Joel Rubin head on over his past statements and blocking access to what Trey Gowdy wants.

From mysterious ancient discoveries to valuable lost treasures, this top 10 list of ancient artifacts is amazing! \n\nSubscribe to World5List http://goo.gl/cpJSA6\n\nOver time the denizens of our planet have helped make sure that those who are gone are not truly lost, and certain treasures are not lost either. Join us as we reveal some of the most priceless ancient artifacts ever found.\n\n1. Pharaoh Sculpture\n\nEgypt is a land of much history, and many wonders that baffle people to this day (seriously, how did they make those pyramids?). And while there is another Egyptian treasure on this list, we thought it would be poetic to show off a mysterious treasure. Mainly, the sculpture of an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n\n2. Rosetta Stone\n\nSticking with Egypt, we go from the head of a pharaoh to a piece of rock that arguably changed how we looked at their culture. You see, the Rosetta Stone is famous because it allowed non-Egyptian people to read the hieroglyphs that were within the pyramids and temples in the land. You see, this stone had three different languages written on it.\n\n3. Koh-i-Noor Diamond\n\nDiamonds are forever, right? Well...they\u2019re also really, REALLY valuable, and for good reason. What\u2019s more, the bigger the diamond, the more the value.\n\n4. Egyptian Paint\n\nOk, we know, paint doesn\u2019t SOUND priceless, so why is it on this list? Well, as in many things, you don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. This palette is thousands of years old, and yet, the paint that\u2019s within the palette is still visible.\n\n5. Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThere are certain items that are worth a lot separately, but when you have a complete set? That can make it priceless. Such is the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n6. Priam\u2019s Treasure\n\nAnother collection of items, Priam\u2019s Treasure holds a high honor because of its history both as an item, and its connection to World War II.\n\nAnd to this day, the legendary city of Troy has not been found. We\u2019re just saying.\n\n7.  Ashikaga shogunate Armor\n\nJapan is a land that prides itself on its history, and with good reason. Long before they were a technological powerhouse, they were a land of samurai and emperors.\n\n8. Ostrich Egg Map\n\nNo, we\u2019re not joking you. Someone literally took an ostrich egg and decided to carve a map of the world on it. Or, at least the world they knew existed. This egg was discovered in Florence, Italy, which has made many wonder who made it, and why they went to such lengths to craft it.\n\n\n9. Lost and Destroyed Artifacts\n\nThere\u2019s always a dark side when it comes to trying to find artifacts. Mainly, some people don\u2019t care about them, or attempts to preserve history are met with skepticism (see: The Monuments Men), and thus are considered low priority, or, in the worst cases, outright destroyed.", "title": "9 Most Expensive Ancient Artifacts Ever Found!", "has_captions": "false", "views": "43993", "dislikes": "19", "comments": ["Why doesn't this have more views?", "Wow great list!", "how expensive thats why i came here", "I really love your videos!", "Crazy discoveries", "If you're going to include lost treasures, you GOT to include the Amber Room.", "Nice bro", "I wish I could find something like this someday", "I've seen the rosetta stone in real life it was much bigger than I thought!", "*Ancient Egyptians were black and 99% of the Artifacts in museums around the world are stolen* 100% of their  true history has been changed and whitewashed to fit a European narrative but the cover is slowly being pulled back and the truth is finally  being revealed.", "It stops mid sentence!", "Its kohinoor.. not koi-jn-or!!

You need to be worried about Kikai in Japan, and Campi Flegrei in Italy. The caldera of Kikai is under the ocean and they recently discovered a newly developed lava dome that is 1968 feet (600 meters)  high and 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) wide. Kikai is absolutely alive and is heading towards an eruption at some point in the near future. Campi Flegrei is just as bad, though it doesn't have a massive lava dome growing on top of it, what we do see is so bad that they stopped allowing the public to access the monitoring data. In 2009 the temperature of the hydrothermal features in the Campi Flegrei caldera measured 203F (95C) in 2013 those same hydrothermal features had increased to 221F (105C). That's bad, but to make things worse the gases being sampled went from being mostly steam with trace amount of CO2 and SO2, to 50% steam and 50% CO2 and SO2. Finally the entire Campi Flegrei caldera is rising at an average rate of 1 inch  (2.54 cm) per month. They stopped letting the public see the Campi Flegrei monitoring data back in 2012/13, and we have no idea how bad things have gotten in the 5 years since then. We have no idea how close Campi Flegrei is to an eruption, but one thing they haven't been able to keep quiet is that new hydrothermal features are popping up all over the caldera, under buildings, streets, sports facilities, and recreational areas.\n\nIn short, if you want to worry about a volcano, be worried about Kikai and Campi Flegrei, because they are both capable of producing eruptions that eject well north of 500 cubic kilometers worth of material. That's enough material that it would cool the planet for 10-15 years by as much as 10C at the peak of the cooling. If they elect to go off 15-20 years apart, it will kill billions of people not because of the cold or direct effects of the eruptions, but starvation. \n\nTo top all of that off, the Earth is heading into a cooling period for the next 70+ years because of a natural solar cycle just like we have been warming for the past 100 years because of a solar cycle. Plus, the Earths magnetic field is heading towards a reversal. The magnetic field reversing is what is probably going to set off both of these volcanoes, because the magnetic field is weakening which means exponentially more high energy cosmic rays will reach the surface of the Earth. This has been proven to cause silica rich volcanoes to erupt and both Kikai and Campi Flegrei are silica rich volcanoes.", "If you should ever be near, or live by, a volcano, you must keep some things clearly in mind. A) Volcanoes almost always give a warning, even if only a few minutes in rare cases. There usually IS enough time to save yourself if you move immediately to safety. You cannot assume a volcano will wait. B) Volcanic warnings MUST be taken seriously, which means you should immediately pack cheeks out of there. Don't try to move out of your home to save your stuff. Just split. C) Nobody's religion can save you - only YOU can save yourself by putting miles between you and the volcano.\nEarthquakes are very much a very different problem. They never give warnings - maybe a few seconds caught on a seismograph, but nothing YOU can learn.\nAnother thing. If you get a warning and leave, then nothing happens, do NOT become distrustful of any future warnings. ALL warnings should be taken seriously. The experts are doing their best, and sometimes warn when nothing happens. That doesn't remove the credibility for their next warning, or any other warning. They would not be given if there wasn't a profound worry that you might get your ass fried. If no eruption occurs, go back once they say it's okay, but if warned again, GO. You can't play dice with a volcano.", "I wish there was a part 3.", "I've said for a long time that we are 1 or 2 large volcano events from the Stone Age. Well maybe the Bronze Age except without the life skills of the ancients. Its been at least 20 years since that dawned on me. Kind of like the more we know about volcanoes, the more we realize how unprepared and powerless humans are to do anything but flee. But you have to flee before the crowd or you'll be doomed with them. \n\nEvacuation of even a smaller city of 200,000 would be a cluster of chaos. But fleeing/evacuation is only the 1st big problem and for many people just a delay to their death from starvation, disease, lack of medicine for their chronic illnesses, and outright murder. If you evac a population with a large number of criminally minded people (like New Orleans) to another location (like Houston) the hostility will soon boil. The media covered up the mega problems of the New Orleans group caused in Houston. Besides ever hurricane evacuation along the Gulf Coast results in a gridlock traffic jam. This ramps up the anger/hostility level towards the govt and fellow escapees. \n\nA worst case would be moving South Chicago to central or western Iowa farmlands. That would guarantee a violent backlash from the locals in reaction to this totally different culture which contains a large number of predatory/lawless people. The clash would take less than a week before the locals fight back to defend themselves. In different regions of the USA the clash would be on the first day, I predict IMHO/life experience. \n\nI started studying disaster phenomena issues in the latter 1970's, especially when I got into govt employment. Back then it was nuclear attack responses but most people related issues are the same. For years the plan was sheltering in place until the radiation danger lowered. Then somebody in the Federal govt got the bright idea of evacuating large cities of 1 million or larger out to the \"safer\" countryside. Someone was smoking crack and ignoring ALL past experiences and knowledge of behavior to dream this up. \n\nA few years later the Dept of Defense did an in-depth study of how a nationwide disaster would effect Fed govt control etc. The first loss of control would be ignoring anything Federal (especially if the Feds cannot help). One point freely admitted and printed in the report was the USA breaking up into regional factions of like minded citizens. Example the western states of WY, MT, SD, ND, NE, KS, ID would be more likely to forge a coalition themselves, even having western Canadian provinces join them. The South or Deep South would do the same. A number of likely regional groups were mapped, basically the USA map would look more like Europe. Let's face it, there are areas where the people's mentality is actually irritating to others in times of peace, Boston/NYC for example, as well as So. California. \n\nThe above is all bad enough.

Even though they erput very infrequently, if one erupted today, it would change the way we live on a global scale. \nThe most well known has to be Yellowstone. But there are other ones as well, capable of claiming just as many, if not more lives. \nOne of the largest is known as Toba (Indonesia), and then you have Taupo (New Zealand), which had the most recent super-eruption. This happened roughly 28000 years ago!\n\nBut the one that poses the largest threat is located beneath the city of Naples. It's called Campi Flegrei\nOvershadowed by it's more frequently erupting sibling, Vesuvius, Campi Flegrei can produce enough eruptible material comparable to a medium-sized eruption at Yellowstone. \nA lot of people live in and around the caldera of Campi Flegrei, and as of today, this giant is showing signs of awakening", "not to worry, god will save us    (said the walking pile of ash)", "The Mississippian culture developed right after the ilopango eruption.

Turned out he had an antibiotic resistant infection that needed specialist treatment.\n\nThe bill came to over 3000 (about $4500) for inpatient care and surgeries over the cost of the treatment.  I paid only 70 (about $100) because he had pet insurance.  Without it, I would have had to have him put to sleep after the first abscess was drained because I would have used up all my savings.

So basically you put millions down for your chicken farm which raises someone else's chickens and they decide whether to pay you fair price or not (which never is) only because they have state legistators in their pockets! How nice that your local government rather f**k you over and cash some checks than actually represent their VOTERS. So much for \"Best country on earth\".", "Just so everyone knows, if you are curious: the bill at the end was unanimously approved when it was voted on.", "As a chicken farmer from Australia, it is shocking to see the treatment chickens get in the US. Here in Australia it is compulsory to give them sunlight and toys to play with.", "And some people want no regulation. Corporations shouldn't be treated like people. They need regulations to protect consumers and employees from businesses.", "Everything he said is exactly right. My family did turkey farming for 15 years, the last 3 of those being with Butterball. Those last 3 years were horrible. Butterball follows the Tyson Plan, which is exactly what John said except the gladiator system actually deducted our pay because our birds were in the top 3 best and that wasn't \"fair\" to the others, thus it was even worse than described. Not was the best grower's pay bad, the worst growers were paid a terrible amount for their birds, plus OUR bonus distributed among 10 or so people (so just crappy all around). Last year we started an Association hiring a lawyer to negotiate with Butterball. Afterward they sent out threatening letters, tried to get us to sign disgusting contracts, and sent out officials secretly to inspect the farms to try and find something to hold over them. I know more than 70 farmers who grow for Butterball. Most have a spouse with a second job and several have to take on one themselves in order to stay out of bankruptcy. That's THREE (3) incomes just to feed your family and pay bills, noting that most of those families are only two people. Now consider that farming, especially animal farming, is a 24/7 job. This is not 9 to 5 work go home and watch TV until bedtime. This is dirty, physical labor, paired with constantly fixing machinery, filling out paperwork, and implementing the WEEKLY new rules sent down by the head company. Forcing everyone to install new computers, vents, fans, wall, etc in order to keep us in debt where we couldn't say boo or risk getting no birds, bad birds, or shadily changing their pay scale. During our time with Butterball my father slept an average of 4 hours a night because we could NOT AFFORD for ANYTHING to go wrong and turkeys have to be monitored constantly. None of us have had a vacation in 15 years either. \n\nThankfully we dug ourselves out of that dirty lying stealing company and now produce free range, non-GMO, antibiotic free chicken eggs. And when I say free range I mean they run around outside all day long and go inside when it gets dark. Many chicken and egg producers SAY the birds are free range but to them that means multi-level houses when the birds never step outside. Financially, we aren't out of the woods yet. We still have a long way to go to pay for the new loans we had to get in order to redesign our farm. However, the company we work with now is actually paying us for the hard work we do. We got lucky getting to work with someone else. But that was a one in a million chance. Everyone else just has to sit down, shut up, and work their lives away in total misery.

A uncle came to me and told me about a contract farming ad he'd seen and thought it would be a good move for me since I loved my girls and really enjoy them.

Why did Earth thrive and our sister planet, Venus, died? From the fires of a sun's birth... twin planets emerged. Then their paths diverged. Nature draped one world in the greens and blues of life. While enveloping the other in acid clouds...  high heat... and volcanic flows. Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?\n\nFor as long as we have gazed upon the stars, they have offered few signs... that somewhere out there... are worlds as rich and diverse as our own. Recently, though, astronomers have found ways to see into the bright lights of nearby stars. \n\nThey've been discovering planets at a rapid clip... using observatories like NASA's Kepler space telescope... A French observatory known as Corot ... .And an array of ground-based instruments. The count is approaching 500... and rising. These alien worlds run the gamut...  from great gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter... to rocky, charred remnants that burned when their parent star exploded. \n\nSome have wild elliptical orbits... swinging far out into space... then diving into scorching stellar winds. Still others orbit so close to their parent stars that their surfaces are likely bathed in molten rock. Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing hints of water or ice... ingredients needed to nurture life as we know it. The race to find other Earths has raised anew the ancient question... whether, out in the folds of our galaxy, planets like our own are abundant... and life commonplace? Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden in a barren universe?\n\nWith so little direct evidence of these other worlds to go on, we have only the stories of planets within our own solar system to gauge the chances of finding another Earth.   Consider, for example, a world that has long had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet. Except for the moon, there's no brighter light in our night skies than the planet Venus... known as both the morning and the evening star.\n\nThe ancient Romans named it for their goddess of beauty and love. In time, the master painters transformed this classical symbol into an erotic figure.  It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified planet Venus... charting its phases as it moved around the sun, drawing it into the ranks of the other planets. \n\nWith a similar size and weight, Venus became known as Earth's sister planet. But how Earth-like is it? The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught a tantalizing hint in 1761. As Venus passed in front of the Sun, he witnessed a hair thin luminescence on its edge. \n\nVenus, he found, has an atmosphere. Later observations revealed a thick layer of clouds. Astronomers imagined they were made of water vapor, like those on Earth. Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below? And did anyone, or anything, live there? \n\nNASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962... in the first-ever close planetary encounter. Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing at all like Earth. Rather, it's extremely hot, with an atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe data showed that Venus rotates very slowly... only once every 243 Earth days... and it goes in the opposite direction. American and Soviet scientists found out just how strange Venus is when they sent a series of landers down to take direct readings.\n\nSurface temperatures are almost 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea level on Earth. The air is so thick that it's not a gas, but a \"supercritical fluid.\" Liquid CO2. On our planet, the only naturally occurring source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure environments of undersea volcanoes. It comes in handy for extracting caffeine from coffee beans... or drycleaning our clothes.\n\nYou just wouldn't want to have to breathe it. The Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures showing that Venus is a vast garden of rock, with no water in sight. In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere would be just 3 centimeters deep. Compare that to Earth... where the oceans would form a layer 3 kilometers deep.\n\nIf you could land on Venus, you'd be treated to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted in orange hues. The winds are light, only a few miles per hour... but the air is so thick that a breeze would knock you over. Look up and you'd see fast-moving clouds... streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers per hour. These clouds form a dense high-altitude layer, from 45 to 66 kilometers above the surface.\n\nThe clouds are so dense and reflective that Venus absorbs much less solar energy than Earth, even though it's 30% closer to the Sun.", "views": "2655298", "has_captions": "true", "title": "Venus: Death of a Planet", "dislikes": "944", "comments": ["Spinning another direction, wierd atmosphere, high density, Venus you're drunk, go home.", "the romans were right: Venus is hot", "There's nothing \"wrong\" or \"disastrous\" about Venus.

Learn how to replace a hybrid battery in a 04-09 Toyota Prius and make money while you're at it! Replacing a hybrid battery is not difficult at all. \n\nI show you how to scan the computer to check the hybrid battery and we got a P0A80 code which means replace hybrid EV battery. I also show you how to clean the hybrid battery fan to keep the battery cool. To remove a Toyota Prius hybrid battery you remove a few interior trim pieces, unbolt the hybrid battery, swap out battery cells, and reinstall. While I did fix a Prius, you can apply the same process to many other hybrids like Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Ford, and Lexus.

If you have some time to spare you could use my method- buy a 4 channel balance charger, charge/ discharge each battery pack three times (it takes about 20-30 hours for one cell, but since I've got a 4 channel I can do 4 cells at once, so 28/4= 7 days), charge them at 7.8-7.9V, writing down all the data for each cell, so you can mix and match your own cells in pairs. After that you have to connect in parallel all positive and all negative poles to equalize the voltage (basically you'll have a 7.8V battery with crazy current) for about 12 hours, disassemble the temporary harness, and connect everything back. \nFor the copper shims I tried the vinegar trick then neutralizing with baking soda and they came really beautiful, tried to do the same with the nuts and they turned black as well, so I just bought on Ebay a set of 56 nuts for $12.50. The sensors shims on the right side of the battery were corroded as well, gave them a vinegar treatment then soldered all the wire/shim crimped joints.\nThe car runs great now, before the battery would charge and discharge very fast, now it's pretty consistent between 50-80%.\nBudget: \n$100- three cells on Amazon\n$12.50- set of nuts\n$150- 4 channel 80W balance charger on Aliexpress\n$45- wheel dolly at Harbor Freight\nTotal- $307.50 instead of $1500 for all cell packs", "Anyone else instantly think of Prius as soon as you read the title?", "That's not a pt cruiser", "Great video!

You should have used a dielectric grease on them when you reinstalled them to give at least a little protection.

When the captain rotated the aeroplane for lift-off the tail struck the runway and scraped for some 490 metres until the aeroplane became airborne. The tail strike occurred because the rotation speed was 33 knots less than the 163 knots required for the aeroplane weight. The rotation speed had been mistakenly calculated for an aeroplane weighing 100 tonnes less than the actual weight of 9V-SMT. A takeoff weight transcription error, which remained undetected, led to the miscalculation of the takeoff data, which in turn resulted in a low thrust setting and excessively slow takeoff reference speeds. The system defences did not ensure the errors were detected, and the aeroplane flight management system itself did not provide a final defence against mismatched information being programmed into it.\n\nMusic: Sad Piano\nArtist: Olexandr Ignatov\nListen to the entire music here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoCs6L4pYwg\n\nFollow me on:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/allec.ibay", "title": "FS2004 - Rotate (Singapore Airlines Flight 286)", "has_captions": "false", "views": "169035", "dislikes": "66", "comments": ["The people claiming to be 'First' must be 'First' in line for stupidity.", "I'll watch it again but I don't think the explanation graphics ever mention the pilots over rotated and scraped the tail although it's obvious that's what happened.

The Druids, when attacked, or the village they were guarding or helping (Druids were in almost every village as teachers and doctors) was attacked, the Druids would make short work of the attackers and would take the leaders or officers and place them in a wicker man and light them on fire. The reason being that the leaders or officers could then go to the Gods and beg forgiveness for leading their unit or troop to kill the Druids encampment or the village they were living in. \nAlso yes, they did eat human parts. But it was because if a high Druid died, the remaining Druids would take the Druids heart and eat it. Thus taking in the power and life force of the high Druid or Arch Druid. Druids also sacrificed the first born of Kings, the male children usually along with a prised bull, when the King or Lord failed his people and the land. And it was all known ahead of time by the King and his children, often times in hardship, the first born son would actually go to the Druid(s) and offer himself so his people would no longer suffer and the land would be bountiful again and the Gods appeased. I really dislike how Druids are made out to be barbaric and bloodthirsty baby killers, which they were not. (this is a readers digest condensed version of who the Druids were lol)\nThey were Alchemists, Astrologers, Doctors, Musicians, Poets, and Priests of Nature.

Trump personally reimbursed him for hush money payments (in violation of campaign finance laws (and he has the checks to prove it)\n2. Trump overvalues his assets when trying to get on the list of richest Americans, and then undervalues them to avoid paying taxes on them\n3. Trump continued to pursue property dealings in Russia during the campaign and lied about it because he didn't expect to win and was just running to promote his brand\n4. Trump was personally knowledgeable about his campaign communicating with Wikileaks.\n5. Trump asked Cohen what country run by black people wasn't a \"shithole\" while Obama was in office\n6. Trump used a shill bidder in an auction for a portrait of himself to make sure it went for the most money, and then used his \"charitable\" organization to pay for it\n7. Trump is so insecure about people thinking he's stupid that he directed Cohen to threaten anyone that could potentially leak test scores\n8. \"Individual #1\" is Donald Trump\n9. There are more recordings that Cohen made that are part of another ongoing investigation\n10. Trump likely knew about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians and personally approved it\n11. Cohen knows of other crimes but can't currently discuss them because they are under investigation\n\n*From Republicans:*\n1. Cohen is a convicted liar so we can't trust him\n2. Why isn't the FBI in possession of evidence they returned to you?\n3. Ive never heard of you until today (despite him working for the GOP too)\n4. It's a Clinton conspiracy\n5. He's just out to reduce prison time\n6. He's just out to get a movie/book deal out of this (Cohen claims to have offers but turned them down - doesn't necessarily refuse to do so in the future)\n7. He's just angry that he didn't get a job at the white house (Cohen claims he was offered them but turned them down - Republicans submitted tweets from those that know Cohen contradicting this)\n8. Cohen is violating client-attorney privilege (it's not when they're conspiring to commit a crime)\n9. If Trump is racist, why does he have a black person working for him?\n10. I'm not racist for using the \"I have a black friend\" argument!\n11. Fake witness\n12. Someone said they would wear a wire to get material to invoke the 25th amendment. We should focus on that instead.\n \n*From Democrats:*\n1. Were Trumps tax returns ever really under audit? (Cohen: I don't know but I tried to get a hold of the audit to I could use it to affirm my statements but was never able to do so.)\n2. What about Trump's tax returns? (Cohen says he hasn't viewed them in detail but Trump has said that he wanted to keep them hidden because he's afraid that if people poke around them, he'll get audited. Which implies that he wasn't actually being audited in the first place.)\n3. Trump reaped the benefits of public funding for the construction of one of his golf courses, but has listed the value of his courses inconsistently. Asked if Cohen thinks the tax returns should be compared with other valuations Trump has submitted (Cohen: Yes.)\n4. Has Trump submitted false filings of values to insurance companies? (Cohen: Yes.)\n5. Who else was involved with the conspiracy to commit financial fraud in terms of the hush money payments? (Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Allen Weisselberg)\n6. In addition to the instance of buying the portrait of himself, is Cohen aware of other instances in which the Trump charitable Foundation was used for Trump's benefit? (Cohen: Yes. I executed a contract for Trump to speak via Skype through the Foundation instead of his personal organizations.)\n7. We don't need a collusion charge. We already have ample evidence Trump violated financial law.\n8.

One of the areas of interest in Cohen's testimony was his claim that one of the things Trump ordered him to do was send letters warning Trump's high school, colleges and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores. We would bet Trump's grades were bad, but there's only one way to find out. So we reached out to the principal of The New York Military Academy (Fred Willard) where a young Donald Trump went to school, to get some more information.\n\nSamuel L.

Erstens knnen sich dann selbst ein Bild von der Erde machen und zweitens sind wir sie los. ", "Wie immer erstmal liken dann anschauen.", "Fr die Rckseite des Mondes sind auch fr die Forschung interessant z. B. Observatorium Komplexe wie auf der Erde nur in noch grer und ohne die Strende Atmosphre, ...", "Wie immer guter Beitrag  danke dafr! Die Erklrung zur mglichen Besiedlung war sehr ausfhrlich. Eines ist mir doch etwas aufgestossen. Zeitstempel: 02:22 min  wirklich: ... Helium 3 ist ein Isotop von Helium 4  ...??? Da ist wohl der klassische Versprecher dazwischen gekommen. Ihr habt es im Text richtig geschrieben, aber falsch angesagt! Helium 3 und Helium 4 sind beides Isotope von Helium und nicht Helium 3 ein Isotop von Helium 4. Aber solche kleinen Versprechen, machen euch irgendwie sympathisch. Willkommen bei uns gewhnlich sterblichen! Und ja Helium 3 wird hin und wieder rauf und runter gepredigt und als Lagerquelle wird das Regolith des Mondes angegeben. Aber Nasen die Helium 3 als Begrndung fr eine Mondbesiedlung angeben, haben wenig bis gar keine Ahnung. Zur Erklrung: Wenn man wirklich das Helium 3 als Grundlage einer Helium-Fusion ansehen wollen wrde, nun dann wrde der Mond der scheinbar schlechteste Ort fr einen Abbau dafr sein. Zum einen ist das Helium 3 lediglich in den obersten Millimetern des Mondstaubes (Regolith) enthalten. Das Helium 3 ist nicht ursprnglich auf dem Mond heimisch. Das Helium 3 gelangt mit dem Sonnenwind dorthin und wurde ber Fantastilliarden von onen dort abgelagert. Um eine rentable Menge aus Mond Regolith generieren zu knnen, msste man den gesamten Mondstaub einsammeln und aufbereiten. Ich habe nicht mal theoretisch eine Vorstellung, wie man dass bewerkstelligen soll. Wenn man wirklich effizient das Zeug Regolith einsammeln will, nun dann sollte man entweder direkt dichter zur Sonne fliegen, weil von dort kommt das Zeug ja her, oder man begibt sich in die Nhe des Jupiters und fischt das Zeug aus der oberen Jupiter-Atmosphre, weil dort gibt es das Zeug zu genge  Vorausgesetzt man berlebt die Strahlung vor Ort. Was ich damit sagen wollte ist, man kann sich sicherlich vieles denken, aber tatschlich umsetzen, ist dann noch mal eine andere Baustelle. Auch kann man verschiedene Besiedlung-Szenarien erdenken, aber es steht und fllt alles und jeder Plan mit den dafr notwendigen Transportsystemen. In irgendwelchen SF-Geschichten werden tolle Bilder mit tollen technologischen Anlagen und Gebuden gezeigt, aber die wenigsten erklren, dass es keine Harry Potter Insel der Naturgesetze gibt. Zum Mond kommt man nicht einfach so. Allein in die Erdumlaufbahn zu kommen ist ein Kraftakt ohne Ende. Jedes lumpige Kilogramm an Materie wird fr teuer Geld in die Umlaufbahn gehievt werden mssen und irgend eine Nase wird dafr blechen mssen. Die Rohstoffe die uns der Mond liefern kann, die gibt es auch hier auf der Erde, das habt ihr ja erwhnt. Fr mich hat der Mond nur zwei triftige Grnde, warum Menschen dort eine besiedelte Station errichten sollten. Der eine Grund ist wissenschaftliche Neugier und der zweite ist die schne weite Leere, ohne Typen die einen auf den Znder gehen und einem Gesetze und Vorschriften machen knnen. Man kann dort Technologien und Systeme testen und errichten die auf der Erde niemand in seiner Nhe haben will. Land oder Grund und Boden wre der zweite Grund fr mich, den Mond zu besiedeln. Wir haben fast 8 Mrd. Nasen hier unten rumlaufen und es sollen mal 10  11 Mrd. Nasen werden. Dann wird es ziemlich unangenehm hier unten. Wenn wir die seuchenartige Vermehrung unserer Spezies auf der Erde nicht geregelt kriegen, dann mssen wir frher oder spter raus in den Weltraum. Aber auch dann braucht man leistungsstarke Transportsysteme und ich vermute mal, das man ber nukleare Antriebe nicht hinweg kommen wird. Michael Schuhmacher wurde mal von einer Reporterin zum Thema Aerodynamik befragt  was er davon halte? Als Antwort  gab Schuhmacher:   Aerodynamik ist was fr Leute, die keine Motoren bauen knnen ! In der Raumfahrt ist es so hnlich. Wir kommen nirgendwohin, wenn wir nicht anfangen ordentliche Antriebe zu bauen und sie in bemannte Transportsystemen einzubauen. Jede schne Idee von einer Ausbreitung des Menschen im lebensfeindlichen Weltraum fngt mit ordentlichen Dampfhammer Antrieben an. Alles andere bleibt dann optional. Trotzdem danke fr euren Beitrag, der war wie immer echt spitze gemacht. In diesem Sinne macht weiter so und Holzauge bleibe wachsam!", "Sehr interessant. Welche Mglichkeiten dies uns wohl erffnen wird? Wir knnten den Mond nutzen um weiter in den Raum vorzudringen und versuchen unser Sonnensystem besiedeln, dank der geringen Schwerkraft und der nicht vorhandenen Atmosphre. Wir knnten auf dem Mond Bergbau betreiben und somit Megastrukturen wie ein O'Neill Zylinder bauen. Der Mond wre einfach die perfekte Basis, um weiter in den Raum vorzudringen. Und gleichzeitig knnte er auch noch als potenzieller Lebensraum dienen. Durch ihn knnten wir eine interplanetare Spezies werden, oder gar eine intergalaktische.  Wir  knnten schon in ferner Zukunft eine Typ 2 Zivilisation werden, in dem wir den Merkur nutzen um eine Dysonsphre zu errichten und den Mond als Zwischensttzpunkt nutzen. Wir haben durch den Mond so viele Mglichkeiten. Den Mond zu besiedeln, und Basen auf ihn zu errichten wrde uns viele Vorteile bringen. Ich bin mal gespannt, was die nchsten Jahre noch passiert.\n\nIn diesem Sinne, liebe Gre und 42!", "Ich mag ja v.a. die Hauptstadt von Luna...  *TYCHOTAGE*", "Eine Mondbasis wre ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung und wrde natrlich ungeahnte Mglichkeiten bieten! Doch wenn wie im Extrembeispiel der USA nur 20 Milliarden fr die Raumfahrt (Nasa) aber dafr ber 600 Milliarden fr das vollkommen bertriebene Militr ausgegeben werden sehe ich in naher Zukunft schwarz fr solche Groprojekte... Die Menschheit nennt sich schlau, jedoch sind wir eine mehr als engstirnige Spezies! Wir haben die Mglichkeit das Fortbestehen und die Zukunft der Menschheit, unserer Umwelt und unseren eigenen Kindern in jedweder Art und weise zu sichern! Doch was machen wir? Wir hauen uns mit der modernsten Technik in Form von Waffen die Kpfe ein und sind einzig und allein fr unser eh befristetes persnliches wohlergehen seih es finanzieller oder Sozialer Natur zu begeistern... Irgendwie erbrmlich :/", "Finde es gut dass die Videos so ausfhrlich sind", "Ein phantastischer Ausblick, was den Mond betrifft. Ich liebe so was.

She mentioned where she was going, but she also happened to mention that she lived in American Fork for a while.

Aber sie enthalten alle keinen einzigen, weiteren Antrieb. Es hat sich seit ber 50 Jahren im Grundsatz Nix gendert! Physik bleibt halt leider Physik. \n\nAm ehesten scheint mir noch der Fusionsantrieb mit max 5-10% c realisierbar. Das Photonenstrahl-Triebwerk auf Basis von Materie und Antimaterie hat nicht nur das vieleicht lsbare Problem, das wir nicht wissen, wie wir so viel Antimatierie herstellen sollen. Das weitaus grere Problem ist, da unsere Physiker nicht den Hauch einer Idee haben, wie sie Gamma-Strahlung reflektieren sollen. Aber genau dadurch erzeugt dieses Triebwerk seinen Schub: mit reflektierter, knallharter Gamma-Strahlung aus Zerstrahlung. Eugen Snger hatte brigens damals auch schon keine Ahnung, wie das gehen soll. \n\nOk, das mit dem Black-Hole-Antrieb war neu. \nAber den packen wir dann doch besser in diese andere Kiste mit Zefram Cochrane und Arno Kalup, oder? \n\nQuelle: Eugen Snger:Raumfahrt.

A huge cleanliness incentive in the U.S. is not wanting to have a bold red 'F' in the front window of your restaurant.", "So.. here's the problem.. the kitchen staff- and the management team. Employees are FORCED to come in sick- I can personally attest to this.. You are threatened with your job.. the very job you may need to support a child/children.. if you do NOT come in to work. If you are not actively vomiting, or do not have a doctor's note or hospital validation that you are unwell ENOUGH (nope, a common cold isn't considered an excuse) then you had better either be at your shift on time, or lose your job. As far as hand washing, the only time it is really REQUIRED- is after restroom use, and I know I washed my hands regularly, but I can't say with certainty that I didn't- at some point- unintentionally transfer germs and bacteria. Mind you, I was in the food+drink business for about 14 years.. if not longer. That doesn't take the blame off of anyone- but it does lend a slightly different perspective. (To be clear- I was a dishwasher, hostess, server, bartender and manager at different points in my restaurant employment \"career\") You are given a firm \"talking to\" and occasionally would be reprimanded if you weren't \"moving fast enough\".. which is ALWAYS the main concern over sanitation. It was ALWAYS WORST at \"corporate\" or \"chain\" locations.", "So my husband, kids and Iare at a Chinese buffet. We go and get our soup first and when we get back to the table my husband is just sitting there with an empty bowl. He immediately says with a low voice, \"Don't eat your soup!\" I asked why and he said he saw a large roach in it when he went to get some. The owner of the restaurant walked by and he asked him to please come over and he proceeded to whisper in his ear what he discovered. After an apology,the ownergoes over to the container of soup and scoops out the roach and goes in the back to dispose of it. We all sat there in silence. After a minute or so he comes back out and starts clearing off a table. My husband then announces we are leaving and will not eat there. As we all get up to go, the owner comes over and asks us why we were leaving. Can anybody guess why??? Give up?? Ok, so after the owner scoops out the roach and disposes of it he DOES NOT empty the soup container. He leaves it there for others to eat out of. Ewww! This time, I answered him as to why we were leaving only I, said it so everyone in there could hear me. That made me ill just thinking about it.", "My dad had a restaurant and any time somebody made three violations they were fired.", "lil tip: ALWAYS watch out for indian/pakistan owners. They tend to own cheaper places like A&W/KFC. Just trust me. I've worked at a few, and the amount of hoops they jump through to get past inspections is baffling. Every handful of soap in their eyes is lost profits", "When I used to work at a restaurant I used to wash my hands every time. I would go to the bathroom wash my hands there and open the door with a napkin. Then I'd go to the small sink we had in the front of the restaurant and wash my hands again. I had some clients tell me that they noticed I would wash my hands a lot. I treated my customers with germ-free hands like I wish they would treat me.", "i have OCD... can't go without washing my hands every few minutes... maybe i should go into the food business :D", "And this Canada... just think of how bad America's restaurant food safety is.", "I worked in the restaurant industry for a few years. I don't eat at restaurants anymore...", "60% of people show up sick because if they don't i'll bet you they'll lose their job.", "once worked for McDonald's and I have seen a burger pattie being cooked next to the other half of grill being cleaned. All the chemicals were bubbling next to the patties.", "stay health, eat at home", "Of course we show up to work sick. We can get in serious trouble or even be terminated if we take too many sick days. Oh also a lot of these violations occur because of management. They try to have the minimum amount of employees to save money. So you're running a skeleton crew all the time, expected to do the work of almost twice the people you have. And when it gets ultra busy you can get yelled at for following proper safety and health procedures because it takes way too long and the customers are screaming petulantly for food. The frontline employees are not entirely blameless, of course. But if they were properly staffed and supported I gurantee kitchens would be much cleaner and healthier. Being pulled in a million different directions while being constantly yelled at and under pressure can honestly make you not care and to just try and work faster to make the yelling stop.\n\nI will say the comraderie you can forge with you fellow frontline kitchen grunts is great, though. The only upside.", "I'm from the Philippines, but I am absolutely loving Canada news and the secrets they reveal whether it's about food, hospitals, food ingredients, or whatever else they investigate. The honesty is refreshing.", "right he is the judge and host? He cooks with his ring and watch on!!!!

Thanks Keith.", "I risked machining my D10 crank from solid as a test of myself, and it was very hard but very satisfying. Pages and pages of conversions from fractional imperial to decimal imperial, and shedloads of panicking.\nLuckily I got it all within spec first time, but a bit of a scratchy finish on the centre bearing surface, so not perfect. I plan to take it a few thou undersize to get the surface finish ok. Overall I am very pleased. Until you have one of these cranks in your hand it is hard to visualise how delicate they are when un supported by bearings! I think a loud sparrow fart in the garden would bend it.\nI am now constructing a drill rod/ silver steel jig to perfectly align/ position the crank bearings with the cross heads, and then do something with taper pins to make the position repeatable. Every part of my milling machine is positioned with taper pins, then bolted...they used to do it properly in the olden days.

If you eat an orange within the first 2 days of being picked from the tree. There is no acid taste at all.Also, people would be shocked at the amount of fruit such as oranges that are thrown away, just because of size. All oranges in bags need to be a certain size. Same with those made into juice. If they are a 1/4 inch too small they are thrown away.Reason being, not enough juice in them to account for all the extra charges in disposal of the remains. Companies would have tons of extra pealsto dispose of. To give you an idea of how much is thrown away? For every 8 truck loads, one truck loadis thrown away.One truck load is 80,000 pounds. Just with fresh oranges, there will be over 100 truck loads sent out every day from 1 plant. So do the math and you will see a good average of what is thrown away.

You see if you say something over and over he's making sure that his audience will remember one thing about this interview, that (he thinks) President Trump is a liar. The HYPOCRISY is appalling. The same people (cnn) will do everything in their power before and after an election to persuade their audience one way or the other. While in the same breath accuse Russia of doing the same thing. One could argue In fact the media's main goal is persuade people. With that in mind, the last time I checked there were around 350 million Americans. This channel has what 5 million subs. At least 345 million Americans don't listen to this childish garbage. I wish common sense was a required course. If this guy is so obsessed with calling someone out for lying Why doesn't he report on all of obama's empty campaign promises.

We'll show ya ;)\n\nToday's van life vlog begins in Cabo Pulmo National Park where we jump right into our first snorkel in this beautiful underwater marine world! Then, in true van life Mexico fashion we get our tiny house stuck in some soft sand on the beach... thank goodness for our Max Traxx! As Eamon says \"the most consistent thing about life in Baja California is the sunsets\" so we enjoy a beautiful one with you and head to sleep! Day 2 begins with a failed water sport event and a grumpy Bec. Don't fret, we can't stay grumpy for long when we live in our van on a stunning beach for FREE! We then head into town for some essentials and back out to another snorkel spot along the national park. The vlog wraps with a tour of our new friends tiny house (it's a motorcycle and a tent!) and a camp fire sing along! AHHHH, van life in Baja x\n\nWe have loved living in a van (self converted sprinter van) for the last year and a half and while we enjoy spending time in Canada it can get a little cold throughout the winter. So, we've decided to hit the road and drive across the continent to enjoy some warmer weather in Baja Mexico.

In addition, Putin has blackmailed Trump which again is obvious to anyone who has followed this story. At the Helsinki meeting with Putin, Trump had a secret meeting over two hours in which no Americans were allowed in except Trump's interpreter from whom he took her notes. After that meeting, you can watch a video of Putin and Trump exiting that meeting. Watch it very closely. You will see Putin beaming, a huge smile, absolute total confidence that he has Trump where he wants him and then, look at Trump very closely. He looks shattered and shaken. Putin then glances back, smiling and smirking again. Trump then goes to the microphone and denies once again that Russia had anything to do with waging war against Hillary and engaging in interference in the 2016 election. Trump chooses to say this in contradiction to all our intelligence agencies which have massive evidence to support the fact that Russia did. Ask yourself this question: why? Why is trump denying this reality? You see, Putin has threatened Trump and members of his family and others in the Trump administration with a ton of dirt including videos of Trump and others with Russian or Eastern prostitutes....this is a common KGB, now FSB, tactic down to control and often destroy opponents. The story is very detailed and I have not enough room to say more here but you can find a lot of this evidence by those who have written about Trump, given interviews, etc. This is worse than Watergate or Iran-Contra. This is treason committed by Trump, his family and others. Let's wait and see what happens. The problem is that, like the Iran --Contra investigation.....the powers that be will want to keep the true story hidden from the public for fear of discrediting our whole political system and how the Rich, Powerful, Banksters especially dictate policy and such.", "28 years ago I began my career as a stockbroker.  Like many professions background checks are needed.  My life was analyzed through questionnaires and their own searches... financially and personally.  It seems one can have a shady past marked with financial troubles, personality conflicts and proven associates of bad character and still be president. How can this be allowed is beyond me.", "ABC News (Australia), I have to commend you on an accurate view of our troubling political scene here in the US.  We have this fake news company, Fox News, which constantly lies about Trump and his cronies and has led many people astray of any kind of truth.", "All these traitors belong in prison.", "I'd love to see how quickly Page's smug dismissals evaporated when he got in front of special counsel.", "As anybody with a brain would know: if Trump was totally innocent of everything, then he would simply let the investigation continue. But he fired Comey who is a Republican as is Mueller, btw. And then, the same day, meets with two high level Russians in his office, disallowing any American Press in, tells the Russians he got rid of Comey because he 'was a nut-job' and smiles as if these guys are his best two friends in the world. A photojournalist from Russia (the only journalist allowed in the WHITE HOUSE OFFICE!!!! No less.....) took the famous photo with the Russians smiling and approving of Trump's move. Has anybody here seen the videos of wild celebrating in Russia after Trump won the election?? It was amazing. They were so jazzed in Moscow that the partying was wild. Trump is a traitor to his country and has committed treason. Perhaps she of you have seen a video where a Republican Congressman makes a comment with Paul Ryan present where the congressman says amazingly how much Trump loves Putin....and being on camera....Ryan hushes him up. So the Republicans are in league with a treacherous, treasonous traitor, scumbag and dirtbag, conman, pathological liar, criminal, megalomaniac, and huckster......excusing all of his behavior just to secure rightwing Supreme Court Justices, Tax breaks for the Rich, and legislation which eliminates some sanctions of Russia.

The engine lived on until 1953, until being finally replaced in 1954. \n\nWhat was so special about the flathead V8? Mostly the simplicity of the design. Instead of complicated cylinder heads, they were now simply a single piece of relatively flat metal (flat head). This drove the cost of the engine down, allowing it to be built and sold on a larger scale. \n\nThe challenge, however, is that the engine suffered from poor airflow, especially at high RPM. In this video we'll discuss the valvetrain, and how the flathead design impedes airflow for high revving, high power engines. Not only was airflow a challenge, but the compression ratio was difficult to increase without further restrictions on airflow. Ultimately, improved technologies replaced the flathead in 1954. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!", "views": "1011412", "has_captions": "true", "title": "Why Ford's Flathead V8 Engine Died", "dislikes": "569", "comments": ["Hello all and welcome!!

We know your a millennial.", "Ford should bring this back just for the shits and giggles", "The next video will be explaining how to look 40 years younger...", "Nice explanation, but how about a little about the exhaust having to flow through the block....?? When I was a kid, we had a '53 Mercury, flathead V-8...my Dad used it to pull a piano trailer...thing ran hot and vapor-lock was a real common problem (even without the trailer).", "Am I the only person that thinks it is wrong to refer to displacement with \"LITERS\" on a \"Flattie\"? I am old enough to remember when cars had \"CUBIC INCHES\"", "youre 65? lol", "The main problem with this engine is the exhaust ports went through the water jackets and the radiators or water pumps were not effective enough at dissipating the heat.  Many people ran kerosene as coolant back then due to the fact that it neutralized the problems associated with cracked engine castings. Back then people would rebuild the water pumps.  \n   In very strict detail these engines took quite a bit of fore thought and knowledge to rebuild and even more particularly to remachine.  \n   There is even a video from a well known vendor of those vintage engines circulating around showing the engine machining process and they make the largest mistake associated with machining these engines that there is.  That is they bore and hone the engine and then do the valve job.  This is a major mistake due to the fact that you have painted yourself into a corner by the fact that if you have to press a new seat ring in then the .005\" interference fit will in turn distort the cylinder bore and the only thing that can be done is to hone the cylinders to the next size. \n   People make the mistake of misunderstanding that these engines have floating valve guides and some are even split valve guides. This in turn causes very poor concentricity between the seat and guide when. the guides are disturbed. Most valve guides themselves are nonconcentric between the I.D. and O.D. So floating this poor design really causes valve train issues and in turn the seats can have to be ground or cut much deeper than they looked from the beggining.  \n  The last one of these that I remachined even had one bank of the valve guide bores in the block that were .002\" larger that the other side. I machine my own valve guides with a press fit when I build these engines so the guide bores themselves are checked. \n   In that particular case the older gentleman had owned the vehicle for years and told me that one side of the engine had to be rebuilt several times more than the otherside and nobody figured it out back then, they just did what they had to do.  \n     By knowing this I checked the valve seat height and realized instantly that valve seats were going to be replaced on one side for certain.", "You missed a major point-  heat.  Or rather the retention thereof.  You see, the exhaust ports are long, real long, and they're in the cast iron block, leading to a real 'heat transfer' problem.   The exhaust gas would transfer its heat to the cast iron exhaust runners faster than the cooling water in the block could carry it away, leading to the engine overheating, especially under high rpm or high load conditions (think 'racing') or a long up-hill grade in a truck application on a hot summer day and hauling a heavy load.  Heck, even the family sedan would have to pull over and be allowed to cool while climbing a mountain road.  An overhead valve engine's exhaust runners are in the heads and are a lot shorter, so the heat transfer  and heat capture problem were largely solved.  However, the 'flat head' engine's design had its' good points, such as being a very compact design relative to power output, and you were right, cheap to make.  It put a lot of torque in the cars of a lot of working class drivers, but you forgot to mention why Ford's engineers felt compelled to build it in the first place-  the success of Chevrolet's six-cylinder engine while Ford was only offering fours.  The horsepower race really started in the 1920's.", "that dude is not born in 1953", "Look up Charles Sorenson aka \"Cast Iron Charlie\" who was the guy that developed the casting techniques which made this block possible for mass production. Or any production level for that matter. Core shifting, cooling cracks, warping- all were insurmountable problems with complex iron castings like this before he came along, and there wouldn't have been a flathead V8 without him.\n\nThe main reason so many hot-rodders used this engine was that it could be bought cheap and it was common, unlike the OHV V8's which were sold only in expensive cars. The flatty was a known quantity while the performance knowledge and performance parts for an Olds or Caddy motor wasn't. It was only after OHV V8's became common and cheap to buy used that the flathead died away; it was economics that killed the flatty. Once you could buy more power for the same money there was no point in fooling around with it anymore. The SBC and Hemi drove the final nails in it's coffin and the rest is history.", "There used to be an old trick that teachers used, while speaking in class they would purposefully blurt out wrong information, to see if the class was paying attention.", "Homie, you are not 65.", "If you were born in 1953 then I am the artist formerly known as Prince.", "There are positives to the flathead V8. No rocker arms and push rods, more compact less weight.The low compression is great for supercharging. Oh yeah, and its cool looking.", "that 1953 joke made me laugh good job grey haired jason", "It lives on everytime i mow my yard or blow snow. Single cylinder flat heads count to", "The REAL reason why FoMoCo scrapped the flathead for an overhead valve design in 1953: THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SISTEM. The writing was clearly on the wall... You cannot drive a Ford V-8 flathead on the Interstate, it will overheat every time... because the middle exhaust port had to scavage the two center cylinders and that's where the back pressure builds up and overheats the block. Henry could have been smarter and should have made the center exaustport largeenough in diameter as to equalize the back pressure and that would have solved it but he was not aware of the future Interstate highway system yet in 1932 or in 1937 when he redesigned it. It was in 1937 that the prototype for the Interstate System was built as the Pennsylvania State Turnpike but Henry's head was in his butt. The 1932 engine had many problems that were solved with the 1937 engine, but the exhaust port issue was not one of them... Fordacquireda flathead V-8 in 1923 when he bought out the Lincoln Motor Car Company, but it was not practical from an assembly line point of view because it had a two piece block with through bolts and Henry didn't like that, so... he decided to create a V-8 with a one casting block for himself. He didn't want a six cylinder because Chevy had that and Henry wanted to go one up on his competitor... That makes sense. But he knew that his stock holders would not go for it so Henry set up a covert R&D \"Skunk Shop\" in another city and paid his engineers out of pocket to solve the one piece block casting problem, a rather difficult problem for it's time... but they did it and Ford released his 1932 Ford V-8 in April of that year... It had problems and he redesigned itfor 1937then used up his inventory of the old 60 HP engines in his \"Standard\" models only until 1938. A Russian immigrant by the name of Zora Arkus-Duntov looked at that engine and said...\"I can fix this\". He designed a beautiful over head valve conversion kit that bolts to the Ford engine block and basically invented the \"Hemi\" engine design that Chrysler smartly ran with... The Hot Rodders loved loved it and still do...! The Ford block had only three main bearings and the Chrysler five. Do I know what I'm talking about or what...?! I'm a \"War Baby\"...! Now...go see my YouTube Channel and subscribe...!!!", "Looking at the timeline, the lower compression engines were fine because high octane gas was not available at the pump until after the Korean war. (Buick had a great OHV engine in 1949 but the compression ratio was abysmal) With the addition of tetra ethyl lead (Used in AV Gas) higher compression engines became practical.", "The overhead cam was invented in 1902, and used in almost every aircraft of both world wars.

(essentially a 1:1 or engine shaft attached directly to axle shaft)\n4b. At higher speeds the lock up ( or brake as he says in vid) kicks in,  its like being in 4th gear with a final drive attached to a tall highway gear\n5. the car moves along with 1400+ hp\n\nin english...think about it this way: take 2  torque flite 727 torque converters and put all the components in a high tech custom shell. the first torque converter is from a truck and has a low stall (or take off) speed. starts off easy at 1500 rpm. the second is from a drag car, this one wont kick in until its at 5000 rpm, this adds oomph at speed. once all the power multiplication of truck and drag car torque converters has been used up the lock up kicks in and works like a straight shaft directly connecting motor to wheel, therefore bypassing the whole system with a basic clutch. then your going fast as a motherfucker. its basically a fluid transmission with turbines instead of gears.\n\nif you get your fanboy head out of your ass and stop saying \"OMG KOENIGSEGG, I LOVE HIS BALDNESS!!!!\" and listen to what he's saying you'll understand its very simple yet well thought out design. he builds off already existing principles to and design something very cool and unique.", "did someone understand something of what he said?", "For half my life Ive been on a quest to be a leader in the hypercar industry... yeah, same.", "Lex Luthor builds his own cars.", "I ask my Grandma years ago.

Moonbeam is running the mall with security in a police state, and will stop you if you're just walking around with your phone, and check it to make sure you're not filming...\n\nThank you to everyone for supporting me on these adventures so far!

They were looking to the future in a celebration of 1976-2076.  Clearly they should've done more research.  I should've been more clear about this in the video!  Also, the Sherriff's sale was postponed yet again, and this time until September! \n\nJune 4 2018 Edit: It appears that the sheriff's sale has been postponed until July:\nhttp://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2018/06/04/Struggling-Century-III-Mall-sheriff-s-sale-west-mifflin/stories/201806040069\n-----\nIt was just announced that Century iii will be going up for sale at Sherriff's auction.  While this doesn't necessarily mean it is closing for good, it can go one of a few ways.  The new owner may try to revitalize it, or they may raze, to create something new.  At this point it's still unknown, but time will tell.\n\nEdit: As sharp sighted Dan Zunko has noticed, I mistakenly stated that Wickes Furniture replaced the old Gimbels top floor in *1977*...Of course I meant 1997, but I mis-spoke...I said 1977 in the narrative, but again, I meant 1997!!  I also said that Gimbels opened Aug must 1, 1979, but I meant 1980.  Sorry for the confusion!!!

There isn't enough customers to support them anymore.  Online shopping has hurt them a lot.  But when I was a kid we didn't have online shopping and the malls were full.  Our country still had a lot of manufacturing jobs and the steel industry was still strong.  All of that is gone now, it's too bad.  Some economists have said our economy has shrunk a lot since the 1970's and stagnated; and much of it is never coming back.  That is why there are so many people with out jobs or low paying jobs.  We have actually been in a depression for 35 years in this country. Of course you will never get the government to acknowledge this or the politicians.", "Dead Malls = Proof few people have any money anymore to go out and just buy random things for fun.  80s and 90s were the golden years for consumers.   Where do people \"hang out\" anymore?  Everyone just seems to live inside now days on their screens.  It's sad and disturbing.", "That is some oddly tight security for a failing mall. Makes you think they're trying to hide something maybe?", "Its so funny that they are trying to keep people from seeing how bad it is when its no secret.", "Word of advice, Sal.\nNext time you're setting up an undercover ID:\nWear dress clothes and a tie; act like you belong wherever you are; be happy to meet security guards instead of running away from them and ask them questions instead of the other way around.\nPretend you are a Real Estate Broker who has a client interested in purchasing the property. It wouldn't hurt to print up a few phony business cards to hand out.\nYou will be welcomed everywhere.", "I'm an old man now, but I remember watching the slag being dumped while shopping at the Haines' store. This was decades before the mall was built. I also shopped at the mall from time to time... Thanks for the walk down memory lane...", "Sal, you produced an excellent documentary  - it is rare in you tube presentations like this to have some intelligent narration based on actual historical facts. You are to be commended. I found this very haunting for several reasons. I grew up in Pennsylvania and left in 1971. The mall concept had just come into its own in the late 60s and was, as you suggested, considered the wave of the future.  These were suburbia's new town squares, the hub of activity for the modern consumer, and functioned as \"training wheel\" communities for teenagers trying out their independence. How quickly things changed. There are a couple of questions left unanswered in your piece. For all appearances the mall was closed and blocked, and yet we see old folks sitting on benches, and walking around like ghosts. How did they get in? How were the security guards not bothered by their presence? I'd like to suggest that you offer a more thorough explanation if you can. It would help your viewers to better process the deathbed decline of Century III.  Everything changes in a dichotomy of technical advance, and societal decline, and this story is a kind of metaphor of what we see daily on a much larger scale in America.  It is also a poignant, personal story allowing many who grew up in that time to reflect on the passage of time and their place in it, and perhaps learn something worth sharing.", "it IS truly sad that a way of life in America is vanishing.. most of us spent our youth in malls like this... hanging out... loitering...  so many good memories in malls", "I was in high school when this mall was built. It was so futuristic. I loved to go there to buy Gary Numan tapes and play video games.", "Thanks a lot Walmart and Amazon..", "This made me sad seeing so much potential wasted.\n\nArwsome video man", "It is such a shame what has happened to our malls. And rather than take responsibility, store and malls owners play the blame game...depending upon who you talk to, the decline is due to WalMart. open air shopping centers, Amazon, economy, Obama, gang violence, and so forth.  WHile the economy has certainly played a part, so have bad business decisions and greed, like over valuing the mall properties to secure loans.\n\nI'd far rather shop in a mall in a cold winter or 100 degree+ summer day than park, walk into a store in an open air center, shop, go back to a hot car, move the car to the next large store, and repeat.", "That Century III Chevrolet commercial gave my some serious flashbacks....", "Pretty sad that malls like this are a thing of the past.  If you're a member of generation x you grew up around the mall. I was just 4 when my mall in Rockland County NY opened and my parents bought me my first pair of Buster Browns in 1971.  That old mall was part of my life all the way into my 40's .  When I heard they were pulling it down I went there a lot and thought about the memories of hanging there with old friends from high school and buying my wife her engagement ring. I bought my U2 Joshua Tree and Nirvana Never mind CD's there.  My sons had their hair cut there and by the same barber who cut my hair all through grade school, college and my wedding.  He cut my hair for every occasion in my life.  The year they pulled down the old mall he died of cancer.  Sorry for the rant.", "Wow. I lived nearby this Mall when I was a kid and hung out there alot ( this was early to mid 80's) and have some cool memories of that place. To see it like this now decades later is a freaking trip. It was beautiful in it's time. I hope it gets a fresh shot at being something again.", "Globalisation is a cancer, kills communities and drains the life out of entire countries.", "Pittsburgh area has 5 very large malls...Century III is obviously a goner as shown in your video.  Monroeville has quite a few empty store fronts and has had issues with violence so they are struggling.  Mall of Robinson is in a busy retail area and doing decently.  Ross Park Mall has super high end fashion and other brands like Nordstrom, LL Bean, etc although just lost Sears but getting a Lego store too.  And then some geniuses thought they'd build yet another model and didn't see the writing on the wall that malls were declining...so the massive Pittsburgh Mills mall since with under 50% occupancy as well."], "n_comments": "3022", "likes": "7713", "channel": "Sal"}, "5LdChUbCUcQ": {"category": "28", "postdate": "2019-03-09T16:05:47.000Z", "description": "10 Dangerous Homemade Automatic Firewood Processing Machine, \nModern wood splitting machine #Firewood #woodsplitting #Firewood\nProcessing", "views": "99247", "has_captions": "false", "title": "10 Dangerous Homemade Automatic Firewood Processing Machine, Modern wood splitting machine #2", "dislikes": "46", "comments": ["Why are all the firewood videos always softwood, here we burn oak and hickory and maple which would rip these machines apart", "I love it... ear protection with a open spinning blade", "Old man almost lost a finger a couple times", "We used to run a buzz saw mounted on an 8N Ford.

Notice how all the flat earthers whether the crook or the victim of the scam of the crook, never like to deal with how the first sentence on the Flat Earth Illuminati card is *\"People laugh but the Flat Earthers know something\"* .. you know why they don't like to bring it up? It's because that first sentence itself tells you it's a military style mental 'psychological operation' _(more accurately 'MK ULTRA operation' and those who know anything about MK ULTRA and the military's history engaging in this all the time especially more than ever today, can see this)_ .  It's another 'divide and conquer' technique and in this case a '\"GLOBE vs FLAT\" type of division which reminds me of how Napoleon, a 33rd degree Freemason, made clear that to conquer the minds of the weak minded and paralyzing stupid who parrot sophist views of historicity of such matters, you divide and conquer them over lies because they are much easier to control. Remember Alex Jones made himself \"leader\" of the NINE-ONE-ONE \"truth\" movement and today roughly around 18 years later, look at where he is or rather, seemingly where he always was and let's not forget to mention the last part of the FE illumanti card is interesting which states \"If your roll is _equal to or less than_ the number of _Places_ you control, *the Flat Earther's weird alternate geology has led them to a gold strike,* and you may draw many Plot cars as the number you rolled.\"  That's basically code language that the Flat Earth claim is nothing but a very visible deliberate roadblock, a deliberate detour, a purposeful distraction, a purposeful diversions, a MK ULTRA / MIND CONTROL technique for people who are looking for real truths about their reality but so unlearned and experientially uneducated in life that it easily fools them that this is a nothing to do with being a MK ULTRA agenda.\n\nAnother duty of the \"FLAT EARTH\" mental disinfo campaign is to associate people who state climate change is huge scam, are crazy and thus are the same who think the world is flat. It seems only a minority of authentically intelligent very well-read, well-studied, well-investigated, well-discerning, mentally sound experienced in real life types who have traveled more than a few thousand miles away from their place of birth, who have did well in school in geography, astronomy, higher level mathematics and physics etc and who are people who daily in real life are pilots, sailors, cartographers, physicists, nautical engineers, aeronautical engineers, architects, bridge builders, surveyors, astro-physicists etc, and those who know about electro-gravitics and the electric-gravitic nature of our universe, and who are intelligent, competent, discerning, not-easy-to-deceive who comprehend how the New World Order does their complex MK/Mind Kontrol ULTRA, it seems it's only these who can see this 'flat earth' lunacy for what it is, that this flat earth immense elephant manure fraud was fomented by the Department of Defense/Pentagon and arguably even with some help from the See-Eye-Eh, to deliberately distract gullible and naive very inexperienced in life folks from the much more important reality of what the One Worlders are doing to mankind and thus to distract them from what is really occurring like Mind Kontrol / MK ULTRA as previously mentioned which does a great work in preventing much of the population from caring about what is actually the hardest truth/hardest to accept factual conspiracies that the elite are hiding.  The shadow of the earth on the moon is round and thus curved, it's not hard to see this, even if you had a telescope, it's quite clear the planets are spherical especially noticed by viewing the moon, and if you could take a plane ride in a straight line _(well curved)_ around the earth, you'll would eventually end up in the same exact place.  Every planet _(wandering star)_ and moon is spherical, but yet the flat earther never likes to be questioned about why would earth be the only planet that is flat? The fact the flat earther loves to avoid dealing with such a question honestly and fairly w/o hijacking and redirecting and spinning it around on other in order to evade answering it straight forward, shows they are either the fraud crook or the victim of the crook and thus a fool. Why don't they focus on the multitude of the sick satanic activity of the Vatican? Or the Rothshchilds and Rockefellers? Or the \"Royals\" and all their satanic diabolic minions that spiritually enslave and debt slave the masses? Or call out Vatican that has 50 miles at least of all our history of the world in their libraries? And then people wonder why they don't know factual history because ginormous folks like the Vatican control history which means the victors of war rewrite mainstream history so the next generations are deliberately made quite stupid about such and thus much easier to control and manipulate getting them to buy into a false history which is more lies than truth. \n\nFlat Earth is a SATANIC FRAUD DISTRACTION to deliberately cause exactly what is explained above.  It's meant to lure you/distract you from the ACTUALLY REAL SATANIC HARDEST REALITIES OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO MANKIND according to what the REAL JESUS DECLARED, and they foment these FALSEHOODS so that THAT way you fight amongst yourselves over MADE UP GARBAGE so that way you don't bother the \"ELITE\" with what they are really doing to us! And look at how well it's working! The comments on these flat earth videos that are for flat earth, are astounding evidence of HOW EASY it is to convince uneducated and very inexperienced in real life people of the most IDIOTIC things and thus the flat earth SATANIC SCAM preys on THE SAD, THE UNLEARNED, THE NAIVE AND GULLIBLE, THE INTELLECTUALLY VAPID which proves the indisputable truth that flat earthers _(the victims, not the crooks running the scam)_ are complete sucker-idiots who flunked higher level mathematics and higher level science and thus only made it somewhere in life through physical prowess, charisma, social graces, intellectual sophism, illusory sharp aptitude and thus will otherwise just believe whatever any \"nerd\" tells them, even if that \"nerd\" is being paid to feed them total misinformation and disinformation. This is exactly the reason why we are seeing this insane unbelievable braindead lie of this flat earth claim continue to grow which shows the success of the \"Deliberate \"Dumbing\" Down of America _(See US former Congress woman \"Charlotte Iserbyt\")_ , it's why this flat earth MK ULTRA OPERATION is bieng pushed like mad all over the English internet especially, and it's coming straight to you from the various cointel satanist/\"atheist\" pro military agencies, and you pro flat earthers who are the victims, are only helpig the New World Order while you think you're 'against them', that's how much of a useful idiot you are for them.

Thank you, Godrules, for this great video.", "THE EARTH IS FLAT", "So as it turns out, God's Word really is literal. The story of Lazarus and the rich man was a historical narrative and not an allegory. The word \"Bosom\" in Hebrew as in Abraham's Bosom, translates as the deep pocket of a tunic and not his barrel chest. There are supposedly 4 chambers inside the Earth (like the human heart) and a separation via an enormous chasm. When the OT saints died they were only atoned for by their animal sacrifices but couldn't enter Heaven itself until the Messiah paid the debt in full. In Matthew 27:52 we see some of the saints resurrected from the place Jesus just spent 3 days in. I believe these OT saints spent time in the garden of Eden prior to being taken to the 3rdHeaven.If we think about it, why would God assign a Cherub to guard the entrance of the Garden of Eden if He planned on letting it become desolate with the rest of the Earth?

Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.\" \nLuke 16:26 \"And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.\"\nhttp://www.echoesofenoch.com/a_hollow_earth.htm", "We will all know one day what is there.

So power will not be an issue in that sense, but I think that the TOKAMAC system may also have one more golden gift to give us. The temperature of the fuel mix will be many millions of degrees Celsius, and thus the velocity of those particles extremely high, one could design a new system whereby the plasma is ejected via a magnetic nozzle for propulsion, such a system would have the ability to be operated for sustained periods with extremely high thrust. It  would be capable of achieving a few percent of light speed in a relatively short time, unlike other particle engines which emit high velocity particles but need to be operated for long periods of time to accelerate.", "Do you see where NASA is going to make a big announcement about mars", "There's one more option,  antimatter.

But where do avocados come from?\n\nAvocados have become a huge food trend in the Western world, where the creamy fruit has become readily available in shops, cafes and restaurants. The avocado is considered a superfood and is popular in Europe because of its nutritional value. Avocados are high in calories, contain mostly monounsaturated fat and are good for cholesterol. The fruit is full of essential nutrients, including potassium and vitamin C. But there's a darker side to the fashionable fruit popular on toast or in salads. In Chile, one of the world's largest suppliers, avocado cultivation has dramatic consequences and has been linked to water shortages, human rights violations and an environmentally damage. The province of Petorca has a long tradition of avocado farming. Once grown by small farmers, production has been soaring since the global avocado boom of the 1990s. Big landowners now dominate the avocado market there. And their business requires large amounts of water. It takes up to 1000 liters of water to grow one kilo of the fruit (about three avocados) - a lot more than for a kilo of tomatoes or potatoes. The region is suffering an acute water shortage, exacerbated by climate change. The riverbeds dried up years ago. Trucks bring tanks of water to families in need, while thousands of hectares of avocado groves just next door are watered with artificial reservoirs. Rodrigo Mundaca founded the NGO Modatima. He fights for the right to water - a right that\u2019s guaranteed by the UN and that Chile has committed to. An aerial survey in 2012 revealed that 64 pipelines were diverting river water underground, apparently to irrigate the avocado fields. When the Modatima activists publicly voiced their criticism, they received death threats. Water became a commodity in Chile in 1981 under the Pinochet dictatorship, meaning it\u2019s privatized. Those who offer the most money get water licenses, even for life, regardless of the potential consequences for the ecosystem. The avocado also has a pretty dire environmental footprint. They\u2019re packaged to prevent damage and transported in air-conditioned cargo ships to Europe. The fruit then ripens in a factory in Rotterdam, before it\u2019s sent \"ready to eat\u201d to German supermarkets. \"Europe wants to eat healthily - at our expense,\u201d says Mundaca.\n_______\n\nExciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

The corporations drill deep and bottle and sell.", "The saddest part is that more than half of the avacados go bad before they are sold due to large store displays and high prices. Tons and tons of wasted avacados in every grocery store.", "This is one of the reasons i started buying only local food. But there are enormously more people who absolutely don't care about where their food is coming from and what impact it can have.", "In the Philippines we have a lot of avocados and the raining season in my country is almost 10 months. Now I realized our government is stupid.  I'm asking myself why we didnt export our own avocados. I need to start planting more avocados in my backyard now! ", "I stopped buying pineapple because of what is happening and how people are suffering. Now avocados? I will check where avocados are coming from next time I purchase it. I just don't know if other areas are better than Chile. I will not contribute to this and let people suffer because I want freaking avocados. Ugh, this world is so corrupt. Thank you DW for sharing this information with the public. We DO need to know and be aware of such issues.", "In chile this is the case because they are not from there. In Michoacan, Mexico, where avocados are from they grow with the natural rains. This is what happens when you introduce and want to produce fruits you are not meant to, just for profit.", "While Mexican Avocados do not share the same set of problems as the Chilean ones, they also come with a very hefty tag. The Avocado Farms, Distribution, Transportation and Commercialization is almost completely controlled by the notoriously bloody Mexican Drug Cartels. Avocado is an endemic plant from Mexico, therefore their growth is as natural as it can be in it's lands. They naturally grow in the high, cold and humid regions of Mexico, require almost no care to make the huge trees to grow (unlike in Chile). But the Drug Cartels forced the small and big farmers to sell their products only to those distributors appointed by the cartels to 'wash' their own drug money.  Mexican and US Gov's know it and does nothing to stop it from continuing freely operating in both countries. Michoacan is the Mexican State that has the largest Avocado Production in Latin-America, only second to California in the US; because of the involvement of the Cartels, it also has the largest number of Cartel related murders in Mexico. Even though avocados are a gift of Mexico to World's Gastronomy, Mexicans find it more difficult to enjoy this wonder of nature, almost as expensive as those imported to the US. Just like in the US, Avocados are an exclusive fruit for the better off in Mexican society. Mexico has one of the most corrupt Governments in the World, their politicians (PRI, PAN parties) have benefited from an unholy alliance with the Drug Cartels to fund their Political Campaigns and way of living.  Just like cigarettes, Avocados should come with a Warning Tag that states that of the $3.99 per Avocado, about 90% was used to fund the Drug Cartels in Mexico and the US.", "One kilo of beef requires over 15 thousand litres of water as opposed to 1k litres/kilo of avos..", "those instagram tards XD", "\" Were both really health conscious \" * shoves big hoagie in her mouth loaded with bacon lol. Okaayyy", "I just watched documentaries on avacado and pineapples farms and it seems like anything I eat causes destruction somewhere in the world.

No, it's  anout the greedy farmers and government  growing a fruit not native to the area that requires lots of resources not available.", "This seems an economical form of colonism. Rich countries control indirectly what the agricatural countries do or plant for them...", "This is \"tragedy of the commons\" problem has more to do with Chilie's bad policies of property rights and less to do with the fruit itself. The same and worse could have occurred had they choose to farm animals for example. Since avocados framing is so profitable and has a positive contribution to the total welfare, there is a solution to be found: big farmers should pay a tax so the government can provide the villagers water.\nThe problem only exists because of their corruption / bad policy, not because of instagram kids who want to eat fruits.", "Avocado's taste is overrated, its health benefits can be found in local food too.

Disgraceful", "Guys Petorca is a valley located on the edge of a desert. Historically has suffered severe drought like the current one. The misconception of this documentary is that the water sources that remain in that area ( water available mostly in winter but not every winter) sells part of the resource available for agricultural uses  ( not all, obviously) to private companies. That companies build their own infrastructure to hold the water  to resist long seasons of drought. However, the inhabitants of the valley have not equivalent support to do the same. So they get exposed to the current desertification happening in Petorca since the 80s. With or without avocados will happen the same. What that people needs is a system of water dams but mostly a system of seawater desalination because the entire valley is moving in the direction of a desert.

He was not under any type of indictment as mentioned in other comments.  He had plans to attack the original crew he was schedule to operate with. Because he couldn't operate that flight as the engineer, he positioned himself as a jumpseater on the flight back to San Jose,  Instead of just two pilots he would have to overtake, the Captain and the First Officer, he now had three pilots to overcome. Having a third person in the Flight Station increased the difficulty of achieving his goal.

Each gun weighed about 239,000 pounds (108,000 kg) without the breech, or 267,900 pounds (121,517 kg) with the breech. They fired projectiles weighing from 1,900 to 2,700 pounds (850 to 1,200 kg) at a maximum speed of 2,690 feet per second (820 m/s) with a range of up to 24 miles (39 km). At maximum range the projectile spent almost 1\u00bd minutes in flight. Each turret required a crew of 94 men to operate. The turrets themselves cost US$1.4 million each, to which the cost of the guns had to be added.\n\nThe turrets were \"three-gun\", not \"triple\", because each barrel could be elevated and fired independently. The ships could fire any combination of their guns, including a broadside of all nine. Considering the large mass of the ship, compared to the mass of the projectiles, the ships barely moved sideways at all, even when a full broadside was fired. With the damping effect of the water around the hull it seems that the pressure wave generated by the gunfire was felt much more than the very slight change in lateral velocity.\n\nThe guns could be elevated from \u22125 degrees to +45 degrees, moving at up to 12 degrees per second. The turrets could rotate about 300 degrees at about 4 degrees per second and could even be fired back beyond the beam, which is sometimes called \"over the shoulder\". Within each turret, a red stripe on the wall of the turret, just inches from the railing, marked the boundary of the gun's recoil, providing the crew of each gun turret with a visual reference for the minimum safe distance range.\n\nComplementing the 16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun was a fire control computer, in this case the Ford Instrument Company Mark 8 Range Keeper. This analog computer was used to direct the fire from the battleship's big guns, taking into account several factors such as the speed of the targeted ship, the time it takes for a projectile to travel, and air resistance to the shells fired at a target. At the time the Montana class was set to begin construction, the rangekeepers had gained the ability to use radar data to help target enemy ships and land-based targets. The results of this advance were telling: the rangekeeper was able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy. This gave the US Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy.\n\nThe Mark 7 gun was originally intended to fire the relatively light 2,240-pound (1,020 kg) Mark 5 armor-piercing shell. However, the shell-handling system for these guns was redesigned to use the \"super-heavy\" 2,700-pound (1,200 kg) APC (Armor Piercing, Capped) Mark 8 shell before any of the Iowa-class battleships were laid down. The large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16 in (406 mm) shells: an armor piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work, and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment...\n\nThe propellant consists of small cylindrical grains of smokeless powder with an extremely high burning rate.

The bore and rifling was only good for a few hundred rounds before muzzle velocity and accuracy dropped off. In fact, the fire control computers actually factored in the number of rounds fired when calculating elevation for a \"firing solution.\" The wear wasn't primarily due to friction.  You didn't have a lead bullet conforming to the barrel, but a brass ring that engaged the rifling imparting a spin on the shell. The wear was the hot propellant burning away metal, and it was naturally worse closest to the breach where you wanted to maintain maximum pressure to accelerate the shell.  The barrel lengths on the Iowa's was 80\" or almost 7 ft longer than on earlier US battleships with 16\" guns,  to contain that pressure behind the shell just thousandths of a second longer for maximum velocity and range.  Guns this size had been planned as early as the 1920's and actually made for an earlier class of ships that was never launched.

A nicely shot video with some good commentary. Overall very helpful to other boaters. My only real difference of opinion would be regarding your comments on blacking the base plate (minute 14 onwards). You have obviously been given the same spiel as many other boat owners on this point, which to be quite honest harks back to the distant past.\nThere is one simple reason that the base plates were not blacked, and that is because virtually no yards on the canals had docks or slipways which allowed access to do such work. This didn't matter so much in the days of working boats that did a lot of miles as the base was constantly rubbing in the silt which kept the base clean. Eventually the areas which were rubbing hard ERRODE thin rather than CORRODE. However with today's boats which are rarely covering the miles of old,  the base does corrode. Not so much at the edges or at the stern where errosion still is the primary cause for metal loss but the remainder certainly will corrode if left unprotected. So going through the reasons given to you I'll dispel a few myths. Firstly if its only mainly the water line which corrodes why do we bother to paint all the sides when we could just paint a band a foot wide along the water line? If it is merely the presence of oxygen which aids corrosion, and you say there's not much O2 at 2ft down. How do the fish live down there? In fact now that our canals are so much cleaner the O2 levels are far higher than ever before. Not to mention anaerobic corrosion which does not require the presence of O2. As for the blacking rubbing off, well it does in places as mentioned. However where it doesn't the steel remains protected. You are correct that if your'e boat has a 10mm base plate it will take many years to corrode all the way through. However it doesn't happen like that in practice and it will be pits which form. These pits can grow rapidly deeper and will require remedial work if they get too deep. If there are many of them eventually the base may need over plating, which is a costly exercise.\nThe simple fact is, that if a yard can not lift the boat into a suitable working position to carry out base plate inspections and work, then rather than losing your custom they will spin all the above yarns as to why you needn't bother. \nThe choice is of course yours, but if you want to protect your entire hull you need to black the base. And that is why more yard such as mine are investing 100's of thousands of pounds in the correct infrastructure to do the job correctly, rather than relying on a few old wives tales to keep our businesses going.", "The one important amount you left out was how many cups of tea it took to get to the end of the blacking.", "\"Old Garry went off to another marina so they hired a new Garry\" I was in the middle of taking a drink at that moment and laughing so hard it shot out my nose.", "Regarding rust, as a general rule, 1mm of steel, are giving 10 mm of rust, so your bottom plate can in theory \"give\" 100mm of rust, before any catastrophic events:)", "Job well done, ..again, David. One thing; Gary 2, when he was welding thenew anodes on, used an 'electrode', (stick welding to the initiated). This leaves a deposit, (slag) on the top of the finished weld. He used a 'slag hammer' to remove this by tapping the weld so that there was bare metal, ready for the new 'Blacking'. He wasn't checking to see if it held. Otherwise, a great video showing everyone how to do it, properly. (Be careful when 'touching up', you wouldn't want to end up being involved in the \"ME TOO\" chaos) Haha.

The interior coated with gold and made out of a greasy wood frame. The gold inside was of a cup design and the lid was a partial shield that connected to the interior gold. The portion that was not shielded on the interior was the pass through connection to the stuff contained in the capacitor. Just like we use carbon in caps today as a storage material the ancients used the white powder of gold or shew bread. the two angels on top were the electrodes of the cap. The exterior gold plating being one plate and the interior gold being the other plate. The interior coated with the white powder of gold.\n Anyone going near this highly charged capacitor would feel the discharge in a myriad of ways. According to reports there was a long process to initiate someone to be able to go near the capacitor of the power of \"God\". This process included a stage where the one going near the capacitor would be rubbed down with oils and incense burning (carbon) was blown onto them. Layer upon layer of this carbon suit was put on and then they could go near the capacitor which housed huge potentials and maintain the capacitor(Ark). Any time it needed to be recharged they would place it in it's holder in the kings chamber and one angel was touched with a gold rope that lead itself up to the top gold tip of the pyramid through the small tunnels up towards the external Gold tip. The difference in potential between the ground and the Tip of the pyramid was used by making a gold pathway from the Heavens and the Earth. The capacitor could be charged this way and utilized for radiative energy for the people via the obelisks and water system.\n Most if not all pyramids have water beneath them, not because they built them over known sources, but that as they built them and used them to charge the Arks for later powering of the oscillators know as Obelisks. The water was pulled up by the pyramids as a side process and allowed them to transform any place they chose into a life sustaining region. As access to water was a must of populations.\n In Egypt, the Sphinx is a water decoration from a water retention system. The water would get pulled up and out the pyramids doorway and flood the area just around the base of the pyramids, which was walled up. They would drain the water out of there through a huge piping system and with certain couplings they could change the pressure and use the energy gathered that way. Simultaneously they would tune the water as it flowed out of the pyramid with Certain channel systems with the right cut crystallized stone reeds. They would vibrate and tune the water or energize it. All of the water damage around the Spinx was not done over thousands of years but accelerated to hundreds of years due to an immense volume over a shorter time.\n https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Great_Sphinx_of_Giza_-_20080716a.jpg\n\n The water tuning system shown here:\n   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Back_of_Sphinx%2C_Giza_Egypt.JPG\n\n Now how did they cut the stones?... I'm glad you asked.\n Water jet technology that is how and a form of rudimentary mechanical water jet cutter. It's scale would be massive but still allow for hand operation. We know we can do this on our scale via a level system shown here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph\n\n I know that they used water pressure because of all the piping they used, shown here:\nhttp://www.human-resonance.org/levitation_basins.html\n\n Just look at the basins and disregard the story there. This was a pressurized water system that then fed their people after it was used. They knew about piping and oscillations from reeds flowing in the Nile river.

The 3000 mile oil change was,for autos back in the 60's and 70's. Your not taking into account the advances is oil refining and formulating. Heck if you change it every 100 miles it should last forever by that thinking. Most people don' t even know what a 5-20 oil means or a 10-30 weight oil.  Any oil you buy now days will go 5000 miles without any problems.. Lots of advancements have been made since the wheel was invented. \nJust for those who don't know if your car or truck calls for a 0-20 weight oil. That is oil at a zero weight that has 20 weight characteristics. A 10-30 weight is a 10 weight oil with the characteristics of 30 weight oil. Your 3000 mile oil change was when you ran a straight 30 weight oil.  But hey the oil companies love uneducated consumers.  Yes engines are expensive but there is absolutely no reason to change your oil every 1500-3000 miles. Just my 2 cents, but think about it, makes sense. But there will be those hard heads out there that are stuck in the past.And that was a great look at the filters. Rust inside of a brand new filter means it's been on the shelf a long time.

Also the text should not compete with the audio for attention. Pause the video while text is up so a viewer can read it without trying to follow the video action at the same time. Conflicting info is LOST info. \n\n4) Compare prices. The Napa Gold filters might be the best of your assortment, but what about the price? I see you reviewed the cheapest of Fram's line.

Cheney  changed concrete environmental laws to benefit the Halliburton Corporation during Cheneys Vice Presidency.\nBackground: The Halliburton Loophole was created to allow corporations to subvert laws that protect the environment. Since this loophole exempts fracking, fracking has effectively changed from an illegal to legal practice. The BLM no longer has authority to carry out its mission because our seven major environmental laws no longer apply to fracking, so the BLM cannot enforce these laws. The Halliburton Loophole has succeeded in subverting laws that made fracking illegal. The BLM is, in fact, upholding the law by authorizing fracking on public lands. BLMs mission has been altered by the Halliburton Loophole. The Halliburton Loophole has neutralized the BLMs power to regulate fracking.

The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing, which has continued to provide support and upgrades. It has been operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) since the 1950s. The bomber is capable of carrying up to 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg) of weapons.[4]\n\nBeginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF\n\nThe B-52 has been in active service with the USAF since 1955. As of 2012, 85 were in active service with nine in reserve. The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was inactivated in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010 all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the new Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). Superior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating costs have kept the B-52 in service despite the advent of later, more advanced aircraft, including the canceled Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie, the variable-geometry B-1 Lancer, and the stealth B-2 Spirit. The B-52 completed fifty years of continuous service with its original operator in 2005; after being upgraded between 2013 and 2015, it is expected to serve into the 2040s.\n\nA Day in the Life of the B-52.

I would see this from the Bomber Alert Area Alarm Tower 50 above the ground, and a commanding view of the runway. It was impressive to see. Greg, Phoenix", "Can anyone answer this question? Since mid air refueling is such a dangerous maneuver, why does not the air force try something like this.  Have 2 small radar reflectors on the underside of the wings of the KC 135 and then have 2 radar transmitters in the front of the B 52 near the cockpit and then use auto pilot to stay on course with the KC 135 .

We had the B-52G and KC-135A assigned to Fairchild. Many a time the aircraft were scrambled in a MITO, never had an accident until after I left Fairchild. The pilot was flying the big bomber out of it's envelope of flight thus he crashed killing all 4 aboard the B-52. We won the cold war because the 92d was ready for the order that thankfully never came. It could hot or a blizzard condition, yet we were ready to go. We were tested for the 15 minute time to get the B-52's and KC-135's at the runway threshold for launch. The crews for the aircraft were a great bunch of guys that knew we had to do our job as Security Police and they knew their jobs quite well. If the Klaxon went off, the crews (Alert Force) had the priority to roads to get to the alert area and on board the aircraft, as Security Police we made it happen for them. The roads on the base had a red light rotating beacon similar to police cars that came on as the Klaxon sounded. This meant all traffic with exception to the Alert Force, Fire Department, Commanders, and Security Police must exit the roadway safely. Anyone caught not complying with this order would be standing in front of their commander's desk. My assumption was that was a bad day for them.

Its through the criticism of others, that these keyboard historians try to cast a negative light on this mans story, spouting arguments about better Aces, criticism of the men who were there and scoffing the video itself.

By simply reading the comment section of these videos, one can benefit from the teachings of the TRUE experts who gather here. When they post their wisdom and insight in comments, scribes record every word, so future generations may benefit from their teachings. I for one, am humbled in their presence and thank them all for their guidance.

Your thesis does not hold up.And then there is the question of moral equivalency.\n\nGiven that the Luftwaffe participated in the systematic destruction of European civilzation on a scale unknow to that time, can achievements of thiers be seriously viewed in the context of any Allied pilot when the moral difference was that the Allies were in the right.\n\nThat sir, is why we celebrate George Preddy.", "George Preddy was apparently an amazing fighter pilot.

The Luftwaffe lost the war during the Battle of Britain, where they were not able to beat the British along with foreign airmen such as Polish. After that Germany started to retract.

In this final programme, Catastrophe maps out key events over the last 75,000 years.  During that time humans were subjected to a super-volcano that nearly devastated whole regions of Earth.

They do all too much of that and I consider it nonsense. There ARE ceremonial objects but the vast majority of grave goods are simply tools the deceased used during life. Ancient cultures saw the afterlife as simply a continuation of this life...possibly with gods hanging about, or not. They would include a whetstone in grave goods because they thought the deceased would need a whetstone to sharpen tools in the afterlife.\n\nWe do the exact, same thing. We often put a deceased person's \"favorite\" thing (teddy bear, wedding ring, much-loved book, etc.) in a coffin because it comforts us to think that they'll have something they loved with them wherever it is they may be \"going\". We certainly don't consider them as \"magical\" objects.\n\nIt's the same thing with ancient cave paintings of hunts. Most paleontologists say that they are religious rituals to ensure a successful hunt in the future. I think they are far more likely to be a form of bragging...\"Hey! Look what we did!\"... like putting a trophy buck on the wall. If they wanted a successful hunt, they could have, more easily, held a ceremony, sacrificed something, danced around a campfire and shouted the name of the hunting god or goddess. Why bother to go to all the trouble to make a painting for something you are going to do every few days, anyway? Whatever we find in ancient graves is far more likely to be there so that the deceased wouldn't go into the afterlife empty-handed.\n\nNo magic needed.", "In 2500 BC , at 5.00 p.m. , around teatime, on a sunny Tuesday afternoon in late June, Britain entered the Bronze age. \" it's the Bronze age, everybody!\" ( distant \"hurrays\" can be heard from surrounding valleys along with the thudding of rocks being dropped).

Bird didn't just get into bar fights in college, he got into fist fights with opposing crowds during games because he'd dive for a loose ball and the crowd would be holding him not letting him go back into the game.

Ich werde nun mal eben deine Zahlen aus dem Video in einem Video darstellen. :-)", "Das grte Mysterium ist das schwarze Loch in meiner Geldbrse", "\"Und denkt daran: Der Abonnieren-Button ist die Singularitt, alle Wege fhren dahin.\"  Wenn ich euch noch nicht Abonniert htte, wre es jetzt passiert! Sehr kreativ, gefllt mir!", "Ich hatte letztens einen Einfall der stark in die Richtung dieser Theorie geht.\n\nIch denke, das ein schwarzes Loch, wie in der gesammten Natur auch ein Teil eines Fraktals ist,  dass sich weiter fortfhrt.\nQuasi bei der entstehung eines schwarzen Lochs werden Informationen auf dem Ereignishorizont abgelegt die durch das Licht auf unserer Seite des schwarzen Lochs in das neue Universum hinein Projeziert werden. (Holografisches Prinzip) \nDieses Hologramm bewegt sich Spiralfrmig durch das Universum wovon wir nichts mitbekommen. Wir alle und alles was wir sehen und anfassen knnen sind Wellen mit verschiedenen frequenzen. Je nach frequenzbereich und Wellenlnge ist etwas fest oder durchlssig. Unser Gehirn gibt natrlich sein bestes uns in dieser Welt leben zu lassen und wir sehen genau das was wir sehen mssen um uns in diesen verschiedenen Wellenlngen zurechtzufinden.\nIch denke dies erklrt auch die Quantenverschrnkung in der Quantenmechanik.\nIn Wirklichkeit ist ein Quantensystem nur 1 Objekt auf der Linse des schwarzen Lochs. Aus diesem Grund verhalten die einzelnen Protonen sich immer gleich egal wie weit die Teilchen auch voneinander entfernt sind.\n\nDas bedeutet insgesamt: wir leben auf einer zweidimensionalen Scheibe. Alles was die alten esoterischen Religionen seit Jahrtausenden sagen ist richtig. Wir sind eins und mit allem verbunden.\nEs gibt in jedem Unviserum wieder abgehende Universen da, wie alles was existiert, auch diese in Fraktalen angeordnet sind. Man kann sich das Gesamte Universum wie das Wurzelwerk eines Baumes vorstellen von dem immer wieder weitere wurzeln verzweigen.\n\nDie zahl PI ist fr unsere Berechnungen so furchtbar wichtig weil die Scheibe in/auf der wir leben ein Kreis ist.\nDer goldene Schnitt und die sich daraus ergebende Goldene Spirale ist ein Standardbauplan des Lebens und aller dinge die wir sehen (Galaxien, Wirbelstrme usw.).\n\nDeshalb denke ich einfach es muss so sein das jedes mal wenn ein neues Schwarzes Loch entsteht dies auch der \"urknall\" eines neu entstehenden Universums ist.\nEs wrde keinen Sinn machen wenn alles im groen wie im kleinen nach dem Fraktalen Muster der Natur aufgebaut wird aber unser Universum nicht.\n\nWas ich allerdings noch nicht so richtig verstehe ist wie unser Geist und unsere Gedanken so dermaen viel Einfluss auf die uns umgebende Welt haben.\nWarum verhalten sich bestimmte dinge anders wenn wir sie beobachten und warum treten positive sowie negative Gedanken, auf die man sich fokussiert, immer genau so ein?\n\nAlles nur meine Meinung. Hre mir auch gerne an wenn jemand einige Gegenargumente findet fr meine Behauptungen :-)", "Wenn das Universum ein schwarzes Loch ist was ist dan auen davon vom Schwarzen Loch", "Voll cool. Knnt ihr bitte mehr von diesen abgespaceten Theorien bringen?", "Dieser Channel ist praktisch auf mich zugeschnitten . Nicht zu langatmig, (fr Laien wie mich) verstndlich und sehr informativ. Danke ", "Die Theorie ber \"weie Lcher\" ist auch nicht so ganz jung.\nHatte davon zum ersten Mal 1979 gelesen. Und das man sie bisher noch nicht sehen konnte macht ja auch Sinn, wenn sie der Ausgang in einem anderen Universum sein knnten.\nAber ich finde so ein kleiner Exkurs wie diesen hier ebenfalls sehr spannend. Da kann man auch gerne tiefer in die Materie als sonst gehen.", "Eure Videos sind wirklich hochinteressant. Ich lerne jedes Mal etwas Neues. Vielen Dank dafr =)", "Eine ganz neue Sichtweise, sorgt fr neue Verknpfungen zwischen den Synapsen. Yeah, das funkt ", "Wie kann denn eine Galaxie im Uhrzeigersinn rotieren?! Je nachdem von welcher Seite man schaut dreht sie andersherum.\nAnsonsten klasse Video weiter so!", "Wemm man davon ausgeht, dass bei einem Schwarzen Loch also die Materie durch ein weisses Loch in einem neu erschaffenen Universum wieder rauskommt, ergibt es Sinn dass wir hier noch keine weissen Lcher entdeckt haben, weil es hier ja kein neu erschaffenes Universum ist. \n\nDas einzige weisse Loch hier wre dann wohl der Urknall. Oder das ganze Universum ist das weisse Loch? gar nicht so einfach ;D", "Wenn wir  in einem schwarzen Loch leben wrden, wie knnen schwarze Lcher darin existieren?", "Auch ne schne Theorie :D Ein Video ber diese \"Multiversen\"-Theorie (xd) wre nice :D", "Echt jetzt?

", "Euer Format erinnert mich an die Sendung: \"Abenteuer forschung\"\nGefllt mir sehr gut, weiter so.", "Wunderschnes intro! Macht ihr die immer selber? ", "schwarze Lcher enthalten immerhin mehr Information als der Rest des Universums, sie sind nmlich die Konfiguration von Materie mit der meisten Entropie und das ist krass, wenn man mal ihre klassische Beschreibung (3 Zahlen definieren sie komplett) in Betracht zieht.", "Man knnte die Annahme vertreten, dass das was in unserem Universum als schwarzes Loch exestiert, hinter dem Ereignishorizont in ein Weies Loch (aka Universum = Urknall) gespiegelt wird. Auch die Zeitachse an sich knnte gespiegelt sein. Der bergang von einem Mutteruniversum in das niedere Universum wre dann natrlich wesentlich einfacher als umgekehrt. Den um in das Mutteruniversum zu gelangen, msste ja die Lichtgeschwindigkeit berwunden werden. Das gleiche beobachten wir auch in unserem Universum, da durch die berlichtschnelle Expansion verhindert wird, den beobachtbaren Teil zu verlassen, geschweige denn, in das auf uns bezogene hhere Mutteruniversum zu gelangen.\n\nDenkbar wre eine berwindung der Lichtgeschwindigkeit mit einer Art Alcuberiantrieb. Dies wre dann nicht nur fr uns mglich, sondern auch fr Raumfahrer aus einem niedrigeren Universum, um in das unsere zu gelangen.\n\nEs wre auch denkbar, dass die Expansion unseres Universums irgendwann aufhrt und sich umkehrt, ganz hnlich, wie schwarzen Lchern, welche bei niedriger Masse, mehr Energie abstrahlen, als sie aufnehmen. Sollte das der Fall sein, knnte man seinem Ursprungsuniversum unter Umstnden auch mit Unterlichtgeschwindigkeit \"entfliehen\".\n\nGerade im Hinblick auf Zivilisationen am Ende der Zeit, sind solche berlegungen interessant, da sie einer Zivilisation mit sterben des Universums eine Chance auf den Fortbestand geben knnten. Dagegen spricht leider, dass bei der Annahme von unendlich vielen ineinander geschachtelten Universen, doch irgendeine Zivilisation diesen Prozess schon durchgemacht haben msste und sich entsprechend in \"allen unendlichen\" Universen ausgebreitet haben msste.

Green Glass Spearhead\nStudents from the University of Western Australia got a powerful reminder of their country\u2019s\nhistory during a trip to Rottnest Island, offshore from Perth, when they spotted a striking\nspearhead fashioned from green glass. Strange thing is, green glass isn\u2019t local to Australia. So\nhow did it get there?? The answer lies in the island\u2019s troubled history, it\u2019s not the prettiest story.\n\n9. Shark Tooth Weapons\nIn 2012 experts got a surprise when researching the ecology of the Gilbert Islands. They\u2019re located in the Central Pacific Ocean and the local craft involved making weapons using sharks\u2019 teeth. The islanders would start with a buttress made of wood, which they would then attach the ultra sharp teeth to using cords made from coconut leaves.\n\n8. Dirty Harry Slingshot\nIt seems you didn\u2019t need the power of Dirty Harry\u2019s .44 Magnum to stop an aggressor back in A.D. 140. That\u2019s if an archaeological site in Scotland is anything to go by! In 2017 experts began finding ancient Roman  at a field in Burnswark, near Edinburgh. The area would have witnessed the Roman Army building Hadrian\u2019s Wall and pushing back the natives as they went. This naturally led to some pretty nasty confrontations.\n\n7. Mata\u2019a of Easter Island\nUp until a couple of years ago it was believed the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean died because of conflict. They apparently used up all their resources and turned on each other, leading to their demise. This was based on what appeared to be weaponry called \u2018mata\u2019a\u2019, made from obsidian, or volcanic glass, found across the length and breadth of the area.\n\n6. The Rain of Genghis Khan\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that Genghis Khan the Mongol ruler was one dude you didn\u2019t want to mess with. We certainly wouldn\u2019t argue with him anyway! The founding of the Mongol Empire was one of the most effective examples of military might the world has ever seen.\n\n5. Tomb Triggers of Emperor Qin Huang\nThe resting place of Qin (pronounced Chin) Huangdi, or China\u2019s First Emperor as he was better known, captured the imaginations of both archaeologists and everyone else when his mausoleum was discovered in the 1970s. That distinctive image of 8,000 - count \u2018em, 8,000! - Terracotta Warriors was truly a sight to behold.\n\n4. Viking Knock-off Swords\nOld Viking swords can be found in various museums and collections around the world. They certainly look the part but around a decade ago people began noticing something strange about some of the blades. Turns out they were counterfeit! But you want to know the really strange thing? They\u2019re still original Viking swords. Confused? You should be\u2026\n\n3. Megalithic Crystal Weapons\nWhen exploring tombs from the Megalithic era in Spain, archaeologists unearthed a truly astonishing discovery\u2026 5,000 year old weapons fashioned from rock crystal! These were hidden inside chambers made of slate slabs, that gave them clues about the elite society found entombed at the site of Valencina de la Concepci\u00f3n.\n\n2. Pepola Dhung Discovery\nThere\u2019s a long history across the globe of archaeological finds interfering with building and construction projects. Uncovering an ancient skull or rusty sword when you\u2019re trying to bring a multi million dollar project in on time isn\u2019t the most convenient thing, but it can shine a light on history and is worth stopping work for!\n\n1. Mountain Sword\nClimate change is generally a bad thing for the planet but it does have unexpected side effects. In terms of archaeology, the melting of snow and ice can reveal stuff from thousands of years ago that people had never thought possible. Just such a thing was found last year up a mountain in Norway by a reindeer hunter.", "title": "RECENT Archaeological Weapon Discoveries!", "has_captions": "false", "views": "1444009", "dislikes": "1282", "comments": ["Vikings helmets did not have horns.

Slowly, they come to a shocking realization about the rows and columns etched across its surface \u2013 and it\u2019s a revelation that will change everything we think we know about mathematics.\n\nThe story begins back in the early 1900s, when American archaeologist Edgar Banks was exploring an area that today is part of southern Iraq. As a lover of antiquities, Banks spent much of his career buying up ancient artifacts during the dying days of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn fact, Banks was so fascinated by treasures from the past that some have speculated he may have been the inspiration for George Lucas\u2019 fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones. And at the beginning of the 20th century, he made the discovery that would make him famous.\n\nIt was around that time that Banks came into possession of a strange tablet. At approximately five inches wide and three and a half inches tall, it was covered in mysterious etchings. Banks told people that it had been discovered in Senkereh, which is thought to be the site of Larsa, an ancient Sumerian city.\n\nBut Banks didn\u2019t hold onto the relic, instead selling it in about 1922 to George Arthur Plimpton, a New York publisher. Then, some time in the mid 1930s, Plimpton donated it to Columbia University. Since that time, the discovery has been known as Plimpton 322, and it has attracted attention from academics around the world.\n\nCreated some 3,700 years ago, the tablet originates from a time when the Babylonians ruled Larsa. An ancient people that thrived in central-southern Mesopotamia, they have left many relics scattered around what is now modern-day Iraq.\n\nConsidering the era, the Babylonians were an incredibly advanced civilization. In fact, they have been credited with inventing many objects still used in modern times, such as the seeder plow and glazed bricks. On top of that, they are thought to have been pioneers in astronomy, medicine and literature.\n\nAdditionally, the Babylonians are known today for their impressive grasp of mathematics. So when experts interpreted the scratches and lines on Plimpton 322 as rows and columns of numbers, many scholars came forward in an attempt to interpret the find.\n\nHowever, the true meaning of Plimpton 322 remained elusive. Then, Dr. Daniel Mansfield from the University of New South Wales\u2019 School of Mathematics and Statistics stumbled across an article about the tablet while preparing a lesson for his students.\n\nIntrigued, Mansfield teamed up with Dr. Norman Wildberger, an associate professor at the university. Soon, they realized that the inscriptions on the tablet bore some similarity to Wildberger\u2019s work on trigonometry, as laid out in his book Divine Proportions: Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry.\n\n\n**************************************************************\n\n\u25baYou can support the channel: PATREON https://goo.gl/KtaKrp\n\n\u25baweb: http://watchjojo.com\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE US: https://goo.gl/Z4nZcg\n\n\u25ba Follow Us On Google Plus: https://goo.gl/JYf9Rr\n\n\u25ba Like us Our Facebook Page: https://goo.gl/C5Rv92\n\n\u25ba Follow On Twitter: https://goo.gl/PZ2U1R\n\n\u25baFor more articles visit: http://scribol.com\n\n\u25baArticle link: https://goo.gl/hfdwfP\n\n\n\n\n#watchjojo", "title": "Experts Translated This 3,700 Year Old Tablet, And The Discovery They Made Has Rewritten History", "has_captions": "false", "views": "1174242", "dislikes": "1102", "comments": ["The tablet actually read...Employees must wash hands before returning to work.", "So...

Since retiring as a player for the Boston Celtics, he was a mainstay in the Indiana Pacers organization, but stepped down from the position of president following the first-round of the 2017 Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nDrafted into the NBA sixth overall by the Boston Celtics in 1978, Bird started at small forward and power forward for thirteen seasons, spearheading one of the NBA's most formidable frontcourts that included center Robert Parish and power forward Kevin McHale. Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star and was named the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) three consecutive times (1984\u20131986). He played his entire professional career for Boston, winning three NBA championships and two NBA Finals MVP awards.\n\nHe was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\") that won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Bird was voted to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team[1] in 1996 and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998 (and was inducted again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\").\n\nHe served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. In 2003, he assumed the role of President of Basketball Operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012. After a year away from the position, he announced he would return to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.

YOU may have a power bill of $70 dollars in your 1200sqft home but most people who live in medium sized 2,000sqft homes or large pay between $150-300 a month on average. Thats $2-3000 dollars a year.

We just had hurricane Irma blow through and lost power for 4 days.  The secure power system worked like having a 2K generator that worked from 9am-6. This might be a half-way solution. It's much cheaper than putting in the battery backup but obviously we had to use a generator at night.", "So, sorry I know its minor details but there is a very common misnomer that annoys the hell out of most Electrical Engineers... power dose 'not', just \"flow in the path of least resistance\". Where the misnomer comes from is it is true that 'more' power will flow along the path of least resistance. But unless the circuit is designed correctly with the correct controllers and/or limiting Diodes to conduct the electricity where you want it to go, electricity will always flow through all available paths... A better analogy would be, if you had a 5 gallon bucket and you drilled a 2\" hole in the bottom and a 1\" hole next to in on the bottom, then you plug the holes, then fill with water; If you could pull both plugs simultaneously the 2\" hole would  obviously have a larger flow/volume then the 1\" hole. But its VERY important to notate that you will still have flow out both holes unless circuit/inverter is properly designed/set up... Considering your giving advice to the potential  \"shade tree\", \"DIY'er\", \"sudo-Electrical engineers\" that could be handling an out-put of even a fraction of the amount you are describing is easily in the range of being a potentially lethal power flow....", "It appears that the panels could have been installed much closer to the house, therefore using a smaller length of wire (cheaper and less voltage drop).

Max time I have been without electric is 1 day in 2 years. Better than anytime I was on grid. I run a freezer, electric water heater, lights, pc, washer machine, and power tools when needed.

My panels will last 50 plus years. \n My modified charge controller, when I go to work I turn on my freezer, when I come home I turn it off (600AH) \nBTW for you knucklehead that think you can make money selling to electric company. You cost is 17 cent per watt they pay you 1.2 cents per watt, plus you charge for grid, $50 plus. It is made so you won't make money. \nI foresee that for every person in a household add 500w of panels, and batteries should be 10x what you have in panels. Use gas or wood for heating. Because I like a house to be 90 degrees when it is minus 10 outside.  I use a 12v swap cooler when it's hot out. But since I like it hot, I rarely use it.

They may dominate and humiliate their victims. \n\nGrandiose Sense of Self \nFeels entitled to certain things as \"their right.\" \n\nPathological Lying \nHas no problem lying coolly and easily and it is almost impossible for them to be truthful on a consistent basis. Can create, and get caught up in, a complex belief about their own powers and abilities. Extremely convincing and even able to pass lie detector tests. \n\nLack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt \nA deep seated rage, which is split off and repressed, is at their core. Does not see others around them as people, but only as targets and opportunities. Instead of friends, they have victims and accomplices who end up as victims. The end always justifies the means and they let nothing stand in their way. \n\nShallow Emotions \nWhen they show what seems to be warmth, joy, love and compassion it is more feigned than experienced and serves an ulterior motive. Outraged by insignificant matters, yet remaining unmoved and cold by what would upset a normal person. Since they are not genuine, neither are their promises. \n\nNeed for Stimulation \nLiving on the edge. Verbal outbursts and physical punishments are normal. Promiscuity and gambling are common. \n\nCallousness/Lack of Empathy \nUnable to empathize with the pain of their victims, having only contempt for others' feelings of distress and readily taking advantage of them. \n\nIrresponsibility/Unreliability \nNot concerned about wrecking others' lives and dreams. Oblivious or indifferent to the devastation they cause. Does not accept blame themselves, but blames others, even for acts they obviously committed. \n\nLack of Realistic Life Plan/Parasitic Lifestyle \nTends to move around a lot or makes all encompassing promises for the future, poor work ethic but exploits others effectively. \n\nCriminal or Entrepreneurial Versatility \nChanges their image as needed to avoid prosecution. Changes life story readily.", "Can you believe that Americans really think they live in the greatest democracy/nation in the world ????

If they're killing bears in Northern Florida,  then they can kill these monsters who don't even belong here.  Why don't you help save the bears....they don't kill or harm  near the amounts of animals and people that pythons do. You have a very good chance of survival if you come across a Black Bear....with a Python....you have no chance at all....you're fucking dead...AFTER, it squeezes the living shit out of you and makes you suffer.", "I usually against killing snakes but this one should be eradicate it.", "So, are there any restrictions of hunting these snakes year round? I mean, seems to make sense that they should be hunted constantly!", "If you live in Florida, what is your excuse for not having snakeskin boots", "What a scary predator.  Perhaps hunt all year round.  Can swallow any animal or human whole, horrible.  Stay safe brave hunters.", "No since in catching them and moving them some where else. That's stupid. Open season all year long and put a bounty on them. End of snake problem.", "Fraud--The Florida Game and Fish only allow a one month hunting season on them, don't allow anyone to hunt them in the Everglades Preserve at all but they rant about these snakes being there. They just want a bunch of Federal Aid money to pretend to fight this when the locals could take care of it for a lot less. So the G+F is the first and biggest problem. Then put a bounty on them and watch them disappear. The snakes I mean, but then again if you fired the G+F you'd have the money for bounties. They're doing the same thing with wild pigs and lionfish. Crooks from top to bottom.", "cowboy boots....", "Yes you are right employ more hunters other wise you wont have any other species left ,,", "Year round bounty. 50 bucks per snake", "Why is it only 1 month long  ??", "shot guns lot better", "I tend to think that a 20 Guage solution would be a more appropriate approach .", "Yes you are right employ more hunters other wise you wont have any other species left ,,", "They don't have 100's of teeth, they have about 80.. Because their teeth are curved backwards in order to get your arm out, if you don't have alcohol or sculding water, you push your arm hard towards their throat. They open their mouth because it's uncomfortable, you got your arm back."], "n_comments": "442", "likes": "1540", "channel": "CBS This Morning"}, "uA_in-_wiIg": {"category": "24", "postdate": "2019-01-22T05:36:23.000Z", "description": "Let the work begin!
