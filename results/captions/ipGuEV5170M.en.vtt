00:00:00.677 --> 00:00:04.055
- [Voiceover] Hey guys,
it's Alex C with TFBTV.

00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:06.038
Today we're going to discuss
what we believe to be

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:10.159
the best five infantry
rifles of World War II.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.478
To qualify, the rifle
has to have been used by

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:15.792
a nation engaged in the war,
so this disqualifies firearms

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:18.838
from nations like Sweden or Switzerland.

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:22.603
Also, this is a list of rifles
firing full-power cartridges,

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:24.710
so submachine guns like the MP40,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.989
machine guns and assault
rifles are not eligible.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.906
Sorry Stermgewehr fans.

00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:32.597
Things taken into
consideration for this list

00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:35.361
are reliability, innovation, legacy,

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.694
total production, and user friendliness.

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.273
First up is the French MAS-36.

00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:45.163
If I had to choose a bolt-action
rifle to take to war,

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:47.354
this one would be it.

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:50.238
Brave French soldiers
equipped with MAS-36 rifles

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:53.350
alongside brothers with
Hotchkiss guns and Chatelleraults

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.826
held the Wehrmacht at
bay during the blitzkrieg

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.869
and allowed over 300,000
soldiers from the French Military

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.693
and the British Expeditionary
Force to escape to Britain

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:05.281
to fight another day during
the battle of Dunkirk.

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.049
Many brave French
soldiers lost their lives,

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.276
and Churchill spoke of these men

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:12.602
saying that these Frenchmen,
for four critical days,

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:16.163
contained no less than
seven German divisions.

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:18.216
This was a splendid
contribution to the escape

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:20.714
of their more fortunate comrades.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:25.254
Britain could not have
continued the war without them.

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:27.012
The future of France seemed dim,

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:29.446
but the free French forces
eventually struck back

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.907
with many wielding the MAS-36.

00:01:31.907 --> 00:01:35.109
It's short, light, handy as hell,

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.526
accurate, rugged, and simple.

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:40.445
The rear-locking bolt provides excellent

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:41.937
mud and sand resistance,

00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:43.505
and the rear aperture sight is precise

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.939
and provides a long sight radius.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.466
The 7.5 French cartridge is also short,

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.993
making the action shorter
and easier to cycle

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:55.839
compared to rifles like the
Springfield 1903, or M1917.

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.116
The MAS-36 is easy to
load with stripper clips,

00:01:58.116 --> 00:01:59.572
and I've never had a hangup with them

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:01.182
when loading with haste,

00:02:01.182 --> 00:02:04.128
which I've actually done quite a lot.

00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:06.138
The bolt handle is optimally placed,

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:08.522
and the action is fast,
which makes follow-up shots

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:10.843
very easy to line up.

00:02:10.843 --> 00:02:13.225
Aside from this, the MAS-36 is probably

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:15.620
the easiest rifle to maintain on the list,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.295
and taking the bolter out
requires one motion of the hand.

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:22.029
The MAS takes the number
five spot on this list

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.693
because of its utilitarian nature

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:25.421
and overall practicality.

00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:28.442
While it is not as well known
as other World War II guns,

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:32.359
it certainly deserves
more credit than it gets.

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.785
Next up is the Arisaka Type 99.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:40.984
The Arisaka rifles were
tested by US ordinance

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.369
after the war, and the men
conducting the experiments

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.784
were astounded by how
strong the actions were.

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:49.547
The carbon steel used
was incredibly strong,

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:51.046
and P.O. Ackley said

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.336
this receiver was not only carefully,

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:55.302
but even elaborately heat treated.

00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:58.392
To make such heat treatment
and results possible,

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:01.279
the materials must be good.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.868
Bear in mind that this
quote came from a man

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:05.116
who was famous for taking
existing cartridges

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:06.658
and hotrodding the hell out of them,

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:09.035
so this is high praise.

00:03:09.035 --> 00:03:12.103
The Arisaka rifles are a
modified Mauser action.

00:03:12.103 --> 00:03:13.831
The ranks of the imperial
Japanese military

00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:16.480
were largely filled with
members of the peasantry,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.983
and higher ups would often joke

00:03:17.983 --> 00:03:21.127
that a new soldier cost
only one yen, five rin,

00:03:21.127 --> 00:03:24.917
which was the cost of
mailing a draft notice.

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:27.585
Imperial troops, starting in 1939,

00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.688
were beginning to be
issued with the Type 99.

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.840
Every Type 99 or 38 rifle was engraved

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.728
with their chrysanthemum, the
seal of the Japanese emperor.

00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:38.317
It was considered a great honor

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:41.639
to serve under the
highly-revered divine Hirohito,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.188
and in the Imperial Rescript to soldiers,

00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:46.715
it stated that duty is
heavier than a mountain,

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:49.677
death is lighter than a feather.

00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:52.677
The Type 99 is strong, light, handy,

00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:56.955
and the 7.7 Japanese cartridge is stout.

00:03:58.323 --> 00:04:00.330
The riflers also are equipped
with a number of features

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.936
that make it stand out among its peers.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:04.910
The rear sight is of a ring design,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.700
and has small wings that in theory

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.893
allow for more precise
volley fire at airplanes.

00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:13.296
The monopod allows for
stable shooting when prone.

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.261
The dust cover, while noisy,

00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:18.814
also keeps debris out of the action.

00:04:18.814 --> 00:04:21.028
Perhaps the most interesting
feature of the type 99

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.105
is its chrome lined bore.

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:25.773
This was the first infantry
rifle to make use of this,

00:04:25.773 --> 00:04:27.413
and it provided troops with an excellent

00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:29.189
and much-needed corrosion resistance

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.603
in the humid environments of the Pacific.

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:35.978
The Type 99 is essentially
a modified Mauser action

00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:38.266
that is light, handy,
and ridden with features

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:40.538
to enhance its overall effectiveness,

00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:43.892
earning it a well-deserved
place on the list.

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:45.794
Next we have a crowd favorite,

00:04:45.794 --> 00:04:47.294
Lee-Enfield No. 4.

00:04:48.512 --> 00:04:51.367
The No. 4 is an improvement
over the old SMLEs

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.706
as it has an excellent
rear aperture sight,

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:56.097
is lighter, has a stronger action,

00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:59.883
and is one of the smoothest
rifles you'll ever find.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.223
The 10-round capacity of the
No. 4 gave it a slight edge

00:05:02.223 --> 00:05:05.133
over its competitors,
which usually held five,

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:06.385
but the use of rimmed ammunition

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:10.093
makes loading it with
chargers a bit tricky.

00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:12.636
Lee-Enfield rifles are
extremely quick to cycle,

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:15.209
and using the thumb and
forefinger on the bolt technique,

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:17.741
even an average marksman
can expend all 10 shots

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.541
in the magazine in no time.

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.155
The action of the No. 4 is a variation

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.585
of the old Lee-Metfords,

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:26.347
which was introduced in 1888.

00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:27.992
The resourceful British
continued to tinker

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:29.903
with the action for decades,

00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:34.204
and the No. 4 was truly a
world-class combat rifle.

00:05:34.204 --> 00:05:36.687
British soldiers armed
largely with No. 4 rifles

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:38.714
punched their way through
the beaches of Normandy

00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:41.491
through the low countries to the Rhine,

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:43.572
and didn't stop until
men proudly displaying

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:46.990
the Union Jack paraded through Berlin.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.659
The No. 4 was not officially replaced

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.840
until the late 1950s, when
a variation of the FN FAL

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.320
was adopted as a replacement,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.534
but it served in the corners
of the empire for much longer.

00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:01.394
In fact, a rare variation
developed for snipers,

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:05.096
the L42A1 was not officially
retired and deemed obsolete

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.429
until the 1990s.

00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:10.483
The No. 4 is regarded
by many as the pinnacle

00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:13.297
of what a bolt-action combat rifle can be.

00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:15.372
A well-trained man can
turn this bolt action

00:06:15.372 --> 00:06:17.205
into a semi-automatic.

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.768
Next up is the Karabiner 98 kurz,

00:06:20.768 --> 00:06:23.435
usually referred to as the K98k.

00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:29.121
The K98k is a carbine version
of the venerable Mauser 98.

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:29.974
According to Mauser,

00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:32.359
over 100 million Mausers have been made,

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:36.099
and they are still making
rifles with that action today.

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.018
Nearly every bolt action in
production is a derivative,

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:43.185
including guns like the
Remington 700 and Ruger M77.

00:06:44.126 --> 00:06:46.892
The K98k was the backbone
of the Wehrmacht,

00:06:46.892 --> 00:06:50.964
but the Kriegsmarine and the
Luftwaffe used them as well.

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:53.864
In total, nearly 15
million K98ks were made by

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:56.664
a total of seven factories,
including Mauser,

00:06:56.664 --> 00:06:59.331
Berlin-Lubecker, and even Steyr.

00:07:01.356 --> 00:07:05.330
The Germans used the Mauser
rifles to devastating effect.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.987
Accuracy is second to none.

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:09.487
An 8x57 is a very stout round.

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:12.280
The Wehrmacht armed with
Mausers and employing tactics

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.773
the world had not seen before

00:07:13.773 --> 00:07:16.863
conquered the nations
of Europe one by one.

00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:19.348
Men in stahlhelms marched through Warsaw,

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:21.432
Amsterdam, Copenhagen,

00:07:21.432 --> 00:07:23.599
Brussels, Oslo, and Paris.

00:07:25.597 --> 00:07:28.036
The German war machine
relied on the Mauser,

00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:32.337
and it took the combined might
of the allies to strike back.

00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:35.800
The Mauser is the quintessential
bolt-action military rifle,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.582
and anyone with five
minutes of instruction

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.670
can learn to effectively use one.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.633
The K98k's turned down bolt handle

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:45.304
allows for quick cycling
and ease of carry.

00:07:45.304 --> 00:07:47.786
The three-position safety is wonderful,

00:07:47.786 --> 00:07:50.408
and the action is brutally
strong but also safe,

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:54.671
incorporating a safety lug
at the rear of the bolt.

00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:57.707
The gun's massive claw extractor
allows for controlled feed

00:07:57.707 --> 00:08:01.172
and incredibly smooth primary
extracting and cycling.

00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:02.948
The rifle also cocks on opening,

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:05.385
accomplishing primary
extraction and cocking

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:06.968
in the same motion.

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:10.892
The Germans did field self-loading rifles,

00:08:10.892 --> 00:08:13.935
but the G41s, both Walther
and Mauser variants,

00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:17.410
as well as the G43s all suffered
from reliability problems,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.092
weight, and complexity.

00:08:20.092 --> 00:08:23.044
Thus, the K98k was produced
in at least some form

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.677
until the end of the war.

00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:27.832
More soldiers have entered
into battle with a Mauser

00:08:27.832 --> 00:08:30.475
than any other shoulder-arm in history,

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:33.654
and the iconic K98k
variant definitely deserves

00:08:33.654 --> 00:08:36.036
a spot on this list.

00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:39.385
Lastly, we have a rifle that
you may have already guessed,

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.552
the M1 Garand.

00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:43.550
This is not me being patriotic

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.389
or biased in favor of American small arms.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:49.008
It would be foolish not
to put the M1 on the list,

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:50.979
as it was the harbinger
of the general issue

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:53.881
semi-automatic infantry rifle.

00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:56.033
There were self-loading
rifles before the M1,

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:58.033
like the French RSC1917,

00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:01.415
but the Garand was the rifle
that truly proved to the world

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:04.876
that the era of semi-automatic
rifles had arrived.

00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:07.219
John Garand, a
Canadian-American toolmaker,

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:08.667
revolutionized rifle production

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:11.098
while working at the Springfield Armory,

00:09:11.098 --> 00:09:13.628
and his genius allowed for
cost-effective production

00:09:13.628 --> 00:09:16.387
of semi-automatic rifles.

00:09:16.387 --> 00:09:18.887
The M1 beat out the Pedersen rifle,

00:09:18.887 --> 00:09:20.802
which was the first self-loader
approved for adoption

00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:23.093
by a U.S. infantry board,

00:09:23.093 --> 00:09:24.561
and became the symbol of a generation

00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:27.417
of American fighting men.

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:29.716
Officially adopted in 1936,

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:32.099
over six million were produced
and used to great effect

00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:34.622
in North Africa, mainland Europe,

00:09:34.622 --> 00:09:37.699
and the Pacific, where my
own grandfather in his words

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:42.065
gave Tojo hell at Zig
Zag Pass with the 38th.

00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:44.934
The M1 is a gas-operated rifle
with a long stroke piston

00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:46.852
and a rotating bolt.

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.474
It is loaded via
eight-round en bloc clips,

00:09:49.474 --> 00:09:53.029
which are fast as hell to
throw in and get to business.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:55.647
Accuracy for a rifle that
was designed in the 1920s

00:09:55.647 --> 00:09:58.027
is excellent, and even today,

00:09:58.027 --> 00:10:01.980
M1s can be seen shooting
at competitions everywhere.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.539
The rifle is famous for the
harmonious ping it makes

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:07.944
after firing its last round
and ejecting the clip.

00:10:07.944 --> 00:10:09.435
Many people over the years have said

00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:11.615
this has gotten many GIs killed,

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:13.176
but in my research, I have not come across

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:15.048
a confirmed account,

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:18.418
mostly because you can reload
an M1 in two or three seconds.

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.868
Combat doesn't usually
happen at 10 meters,

00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:23.071
and your squad-mate next to you had an M1,

00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:24.709
the guy next to him had a Thompson,

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:29.431
and the guy next to him was
doing his thing with a BAR.

00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:32.289
The M1 did not completely
exit US military service

00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:34.298
until the mid-1960s.

00:10:34.298 --> 00:10:38.328
They were surplussed or
given to friendly nations.

00:10:38.328 --> 00:10:40.881
In World War II, the M1 was king.

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:42.475
It offered quick loading,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.890
incredible accuracy, excellent sights,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.881
and reliable semi-automatic fire power.

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:53.354
