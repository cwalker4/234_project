00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.436
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:05.870
To err is human.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.590
Come and cry on my shoulders.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.290
To err on camera
is entertainment!

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.560
Oops!

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.970
They say you should
learn from your mistakes.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.560
Well, we put five big ones
from the expanded PokerStars

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.710
archive, so maybe you can
learn from these guys' mistakes

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.210
instead.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.070
Sam, please, don't bluff.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.780
When you're convinced
you're beat,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.250
it's tempting to make
cards at showdown.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.750
But in the Barcelona
Main Event in 2010,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.340
Giuseppe Pantaleo learned
a valuable lesson.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.790
So two big stacks
go to the flop.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.630
And the flop is queen high.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.640
Nothing for either player.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.370
This is a fairly safe
flop to continuation bet.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.640
This only hits a queen
and the club flush draw.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.970
He can bet and take it down.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.130
Or he can think about
it and check back.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.310
The queen comes on the turn.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.560
There's also a third club.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.720
And Lizano feels
like he can steal it.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840
Giuseppe slowed
down on the flop.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.960
Jesus is going to take a stab.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.820
230,000.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.855
Again, Giuseppe's going
to think about this.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.420
We saw him happily float
against Chandler DeVries.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.920
Yup.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.360
And it looks like that's
what's going to go on here,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.420
Giuseppe has a
cunning plan in store.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.240
He's going to float
this turn with nothing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.010
to try to win this
pot on the river.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.290
They both have the same hand.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.810
Queens and deuces
with a jack kicker.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.490
The aggressor will
probably win this pot.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.500
Lizano has not shut down,
he bets a second time.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510
And Giuseppe's
reaching for chips.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.850
It looks like his plan
is falling into place.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.640
He's going to raise
Jesus off this chop-pot.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.150
Makes it 790,000.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.560
How much?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.930
Jesus thinks Pantaleo
is on the steal.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.770
Can he find the courage
to re-raise him?

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.540
Well, Jesus can't possibly
call this river raise.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.190
He could only be
good if Giuseppe

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.040
was calling his turn bet
with a complete air ball

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.180
to bluff the river.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.160
To win, he needs to re-raise.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.650
He's called!

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.210
Immediately!

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.851
Well, it's going
to be a chop-pot.

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:44.350
Whoa!

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.760
Pantaleo's just mucked!

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.830
Giuseppe just forfeited
the pot by mucking hand

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.250
and it would have
been a chop-pot.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.750
Yeah, but you don't
think someone's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.900
going to be calling you
with the same hand, do you?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.882
That's exactly why he mucked!

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.472
I can't believe Lizano
called there with jack high,

00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:06.930
and I can't believe
he just mucked!

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:10.982
I had the jack high, too.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.091
Yeah, I saw it.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.590
You saw it?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.298
Well if there's one
lesson to be learned,

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:16.910
never muck your cards
until your opponent's hand

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.900
has been revealed.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.420
Bluff called off a chop.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.340
Yes, that actually happened.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.690
At number 4, Neil Farrell blasts
off in full Farrell-do fashion

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.090
on the bubble of the 2014
Barcelona Main Event.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.310
Olly Price calls out to
the big blind with jack-8.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.970
And we're going
three-way to the flop.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.550
Top set for Lamprecht.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.090
Hey, all right,
you flopped a set,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.350
James Woods from The Hard Way.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.680
He checks.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.990
Price, who has nothing--

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.030
And this is weird.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.910
--leads for 13,500.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.800
Most folks are never
leading anything here,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.087
but Olly's no slouch.

00:04:07.087 --> 00:04:09.670
My guess is that this is part
of an overall strategy we're not

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.310
privy to yet.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.930
Farrell calls with ace high.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.137
Not surprising, Olly's lead
usually isn't very strong.

00:04:17.137 --> 00:04:18.970
Lamprecht it is going
to want to raise here,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.934
but I'm not sure he needs to.

00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:23.350
He's basically got a lock on
this hand against even really

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.700
strong ranges.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.740
He's made it 36,500.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.900
Gets a fold from Price.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.224
I'd be far more surprised
to see Neil call now.

00:04:31.224 --> 00:04:32.890
He pretty much has
bottom of his calling

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.130
range to the original
bet, let alone this one.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.630
Isn't that right, James
Woods from Cat's Eye?

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.270
Call.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.160
Well, I guess we're
going to turn.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.860
Now and James Woods
from Videodrome

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.776
looks kind of sick about
it, I don't know why.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.360
Ace of hearts on the turn.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.590
Puts a flush draw out there.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.530
Should be a pretty easy
shove for Lamprecht,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.018
he's got about half pot.

00:05:00.018 --> 00:05:00.930
All in.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.010
There he goes.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.886
Ooh, piece of candy.

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:08.550
And I guess Farrell feels
he's getting a good price.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.070
He might think he has the
call and he probably hates it.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.680
Could just be dead.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.124
This could be fun.

00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:19.790
Calling on the flop was probably
the worst decision by a Farrell

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.610
since the movie Phone Booth.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.050
But I like Phone Booth.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.290
This is not going to buy
this Farrell a new house.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.210
He calls.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.290
Do I have to show?

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.140
Ha ha.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.680
I did not think you
would have that.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.471
It's on TV.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.460
And Neil Farrell
is drawing dead.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.880
Lamprecht will double up here.

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.070
I would've lost all this
stuff, you couldn't even

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.380
shove it anyway, that's fine.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.360
Nice hand.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.320
And kind of lucky too.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.332
What a bizarre hand.

00:05:58.332 --> 00:06:00.520
Oh, bad news, Farrell-do.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.450
Gotcha!

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.340
At number 3, it's another
hand from Barcelona.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.790
Maybe it's the heat.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.130
In the Super High
Roller in 2014,

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.724
Martin Jacobson
did a Neil Farrell.

00:06:13.724 --> 00:06:15.140
We're going three-way
to the flop.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.470
And that flop has a 4 on it.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.990
A set for Colman.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.290
What's Martin doing?

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.550
He should be checking here.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.810
This is bad timing.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.157
He leads the flop for 77,000.

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:46.990
I like a flat call from
Colman, because they

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.630
think Martin's donk leading
this flop with a bad hand way

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.030
more often than a good one.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.040
So Dan raises, he
probably gets two folds

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.810
way too often, which
you don't want,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.220
you want Martin
to keep bluffing.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.260
Colman does just call.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.680
And Seidel folds.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.310
We'll never know what he had.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.910
10 on the turn.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.071
Jacobson now with a gut shot.

00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:26.070
Martin's probably never
going to get a fold here

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.830
unless the board runs out
so badly for 4's that it

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.130
makes his hand actually win.

00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:36.535
He's betting again,
which is just 9% equity.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.150
155,000.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.980
There's not much
more reason for Dan

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.250
to fold now than
there was on the flop.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.730
7-8 out there.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.830
Once again, Colman just calls.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.340
627,000 in the middle.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.320
One card to come.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.870
And that card is a king.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.336
A set of 4's are good.

00:08:06.336 --> 00:08:07.960
Yeah, I don't think
Dan's ever folding.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.251
Hopefully Martin just gives up.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.050
All in.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.660
He bluff shoves!

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.250
Or he just blasts off.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.070
Probably not going to work.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.540
Quick call from Colman.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.770
And Jacobson's out!

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.180
Yeah, you probably got me, huh?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.140
Let me just calmly take a
second before exiting this 50K

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.451
tournament.

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:39.230
Nice hand.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.450
Martin Jacobson, the
eternal bridesmaid

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.000
on the European Poker Tour.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.130
Good luck, guys.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.760
He'll be off to
Vegas in November

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.400
to compete at the World Series
of Poker Main Event Final

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.292
Table.

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:51.236
Wow.

00:08:51.236 --> 00:08:52.624
That was [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:52.624 --> 00:08:53.124
Huh?

00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:54.070
That was a gift.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.700
It was.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.240
Really.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.445
Say, I've never seen him
doing something like this.

00:08:58.445 --> 00:08:59.930
Yeah.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.881
That was ambitious.

00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:01.380
Huh?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.410
That was ambitious.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.030
You [INAUDIBLE] to
do stuff like that.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.080
Guess so.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.520
Only against you, kid.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.392
Only against you.

00:09:09.392 --> 00:09:10.850
Don't cry for either
of those guys.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.930
Both won eight figure scores
at the WSOP that year.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.110
Now, guess what hand
number 2 is from?

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.080
Yes, more Barcelona buffoonery!

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.900
In 2012, the year
of the Filson Hats,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.400
Mikalai Pobal forgot
a cardinal rule

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.547
at the final table
of the main event.

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.880
You know, Pobal's supposed
to be wearing the silver hat,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.000
but he didn't want
to play the hat game.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.465
And he claims he likes to party.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.490
Flop is king high
with two hearts,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.214
top pair for Jouhkimainen,
nut flush draw for Pobal.

00:09:43.214 --> 00:09:44.630
That's a flop
that's usually going

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.970
to generate a lot of action.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.279
Pobal should have no
problem seed betting here.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:51.320
Ace high is going to be
ahead plenty, and if not,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.278
he's building a nice pot
towards the nut flush.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.667
Pobal does bet-- 450,000.

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.250
As you can see, even
against top pair,

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.300
he's not that big of a dog.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.770
Absolutely no
reason Jouhkimainen

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.859
should be folding
top pair just yet.

00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:08.400
Maybe not even if
another heart hits.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.830
Joni will call.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.210
And we go to the turn.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.010
I bet he wishes
he had a hat now.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.240
3 of diamonds.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.670
Pretty innocuous card.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.860
Jouhkimainen checks
top pair a second time,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.200
Pobal checks behind.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.639
Opts to take the free card.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:37.930
And it's a heart on the river,
Pobal now with the stone

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.760
cold nuts.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.610
Jouhkimainen checks to him.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.870
And he checks behind?

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.810
You can't do that!

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.295
Up goes the nuts.

00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:47.780
Oh [BLEEP]!

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.060
Wow, after playing for
five days and 12 hours,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.470
mistakes like that
can happen sometimes.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.110
What you have?

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.430
Second nuts?

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.340
No, he has the nuts.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.381
I don't have second nuts.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.176
One hand?

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:01.050
One round.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:01.970
One hour.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:02.887
One round.

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:03.841
One hour.

00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:06.397
It's actually against the
rules to check back the nuts.

00:11:06.397 --> 00:11:08.980
So he'll-- we'll be playing the
next hand when he's big blind.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.610
When he's the big blind next,
he will be able to get back in.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.368
Mikalai Pobal gets
a one orbit penalty.

00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:18.176
And for right now, you
can just stand right here.

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:19.104
It won't take long.

00:11:19.104 --> 00:11:19.812
It's three hands.

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:20.840
Yep.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.760
Who in the [BLEEP] forgets that?

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.960
Well, controversially,
we are leaving

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.790
Barcelona for the
conclusion of our countdown.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.860
The biggest head
scratcher of all time

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.080
comes from Poker After Dark.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.420
It takes a lot to make
Phil Ivey's jaw drop,

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.570
but that's exactly what
happened during the first season

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.150
of the show.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.462
She's got low [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:50.044
Raise to 1,200.

00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:51.532
The [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.918
I think you would call
with this hand, Patrick.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.380
Button raise, there's
never anything.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.950
Contrary to what Patrick might
think, Jennifer has a real hand

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.030
and it just got better.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.250
She's flopped top
set, Patrick flopped

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.370
a pair of 10's with a
gut shot straight draw.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:54.452
Bet 2,000.

00:12:54.452 --> 00:12:54.952
Check.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.854
Full house?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.070
I can't beat that.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.622
I thought you had pocket kings.

00:13:21.622 --> 00:13:22.370
I was like.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.170
I almost thought I had you.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.430
Aww.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.060
Surrounded by that line, you
can't help but feel for her.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.860
Well those are the
top five mistakes

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.290
that hopefully you will repeat.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.980
