10 Facts About America That Make No Sense
to Foreigners

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.419
America.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.660
It’s one of the biggest countries on Earth,
both in terms of population and sheer size.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.160
It’s the planet dominating superpower; the
heaviest hitter where culture is concerned;

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.050
a place known by nearly every single human
on the planet… and, to all but the 4-5%

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.439
of humanity who live there, it makes absolutely
no gosh darn sense.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.910
See, despite its cultural clout, America still
seems deeply weird to foreigners.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.610
And we don’t just mean people who come from
repressive kingdoms and tin-pot dictatorships.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.070
Europeans, people from Southeast Asia, Australians
and Brits all find yuge chunks of life in

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.140
the good ol’ US-of-A beyond comprehension.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.150
If you were born stateside, the following
might not seem super crazy to you.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.470
But trust us, every single foreigner is reading
this with their jaw dangling open and their

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.900
eyeballs popping out.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.900
10.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.540
US Toddlers Shoot One Person a Week

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.480
Americans sure love guns.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.240
The US has the highest rate of gun-ownership
on planet Earth, and the least-restrictive

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.759
gun laws (only Switzerland comes close).

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.469
That’s all thanks to the 2nd Amendment,
which has been the subject of near-constant

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.219
debate since being written.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.460
But it’s not the sheer number of guns in
America that really astounds foreigners.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.219
It’s the crazy things that leads to.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.149
Things like US toddlers shooting one person
a week.

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.250
There’s literally no other country on Earth
you could write that sentence about.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.659
Even countries that are swimming in guns,
like Serbia, Norway, and Switzerland, don’t

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.320
have toddlers blowing one another away.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.740
To be fair, they have tiny populations, but,
to be even fairer, c’mon buddy.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.100
US toddlers have shot on average one person
a week (including themselves) for the past

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.499
two years.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.400
Even warzones don’t have numbers like that.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.740
More bizarre still, America keeps on arming
its toddlers.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.469
In 2016, Iowa made it legal for babies to
handle loaded guns.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.689
That’s right.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.079
The guys in the Hawkeye State elected to arm
the very babies that are trying to shoot them.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.240
How’s that for hubris?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.440
9.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440
Bestiality is Still Legal in 9 US States (but
premarital sex is outlawed)

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.060
Despite this being 2017, plenty of US States
still have sex laws on the books that are…

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.130
unenlightened, to say the least.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.930
And by that, we mean they were seemingly written
by two guys named Festus and Bubba while necking

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.500
with their pet hog Clancy.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Incredible as it may seem, there are nearly
ten US States where it is still legal to have

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.870
sexual intercourse with animals.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.750
We say ‘nearly’ ten, because one’s the
District of Columbia (not a state, kids!).

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.390
The other nine are Hawaii, Kentucky, Nevada,
New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.960
and Wyoming.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.520
In addition, plenty of states still only consider
bestiality a misdemeanor.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.700
This would be odd enough if the US was a spectacularly
licentious place, but it’s not.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.450
In addition to allowing you to marry your
bestest sow, four states still outlaw either

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.770
premarital or extramarital sex, or co-habiting
with your partner prior to marriage.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.990
While the laws are effectively never enforced,
the fact they’re still on the statute books

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.510
attests to America’s unique mix of religious
piety and deep-seated desire to mimic the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.060
guys from Deliverance.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.060
8.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.590
The Highest Paid Public Employee in 39 States
is a Sports Coach

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.150
Go to any other country in the Western world
– Canada, Germany, the Czech Republic, New

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.900
Zealand, wherever – and the highest-paid
public employee will be someone working in

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.010
a selfless capacity.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.100
They’ll be the guys and gals running universities,
or public hospitals, or the local council.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.610
America, though, laughs in the face of such
devotion to the public good.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.670
Instead of rewarding headmasters or doctors
or teachers, the highest public pay package

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.470
in 39 states goes to sports coaches.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.370
Specifically, guys coaching football or men’s
basketball.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.320
We’re not talking comparatively small sums,
either.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.980
The salaries involved would be enviable in
the private sector.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.870
University of Alabama football coach Nick
Saban, for example, rakes in over $7 million,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.329
plus bonuses, likely making him one of the
highest-paid public employees not living in

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.969
a corrupt dictatorship.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.740
For those from outside the states, this seems
less extravagant, and more like an absolute

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.340
inability to get priorities right.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.729
Only Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana,
New York, Nevada, New Hampshire, Vermont and

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.180
both Dakotas refuse to award their highest
public pay packet to a football or men’s

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.180
basketball coach.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.180
Interestingly, both Hawaii and Vermont, as
you’ll remember from a second ago, still

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.010
technically allow bestiality.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.830
We’re really not sure what to make of that.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.830
7.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.379
Over Half of All Americans Don’t Hold a
Valid Passport

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.990
In 2014, polling company YouGov revealed only
8% of Britons had never left their country

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.759
of birth to travel abroad.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.491
While this is maybe not all that super-impressive
(Britain is tiny and France is close), it

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:06.430
puts the US to shame.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.139
The same poll found only 50% of Americans
would admit to ever having left the country.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.520
That’s nearly 160 million people who have
never been to Canada or Mexico, let alone

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520
Europe or Asia.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.370
For people who were born in Europe, that’s
almost like saying you’ve never seen a glass

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.520
of water.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.919
The idea of not going abroad from time to
time is alien.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.960
In places like Germany, over 90% of the population
hold a valid passport, and you better believe

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
they use it.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.949
But that’s Europe, we hear you cry, it’s
a small continent with, like, a bazillion

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:36.949
countries.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.050
Well, first, we’re pretty sure you’re
exaggerating there, bud.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.360
Secondly, look at Australia, a country nearly
as big as the US, and more cut-off from the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.560
rest of the world.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.199
According to official data, one third of the
population goes abroad every single year.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.469
That compares to 50% of Americans over their
entire lifetimes.

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.469
Clearly, the US is a travel-averse country.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.469
6.

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:01.539
30% of Americans Prefer Saving Money to Vital
Medical Treatment

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.909
Compared to other developed nations, healthcare
in the US is expensive.

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.830
You can blame that on too much Obamacare,
or not enough of it, but the fact remains

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.650
that public systems, private systems, and
public-private systems elsewhere in the world

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.099
all deliver better service at lower cost.

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.699
This alone can seem staggering to foreigners.

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.030
Then there’s the American attitude to health.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.419
Faced with a serious illness or injury, around
30 percent of Americans would rather walk

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.199
it off than pay for treatment.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.819
This… simply doesn’t happen elsewhere.

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.669
Norway has the second most-expensive healthcare
in the world, and pretty much no-one there

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.479
avoids necessary treatment.

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.970
Japan has an insurance-based, private system
with payments often covered by employers,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.479
just like the US, and people don’t skip
out on medical care.

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:53.620
To find other people choosing money over hospitalization,
you have to leave the developed world behind

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.550
and start poking around in poorer countries
where wages are low and healthcare unaffordable.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.580
We’re not trying to rag on American healthcare
here.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.470
America has some of the best doctors and hospitals
going.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.810
But the idea that you’d choose money over
health (or that you’d have to choose)?

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.729
To non-Americans, that’s insane.

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:13.729
5.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.970
7 States Have Custody Rights for Rapists

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.210
OK, let’s turn to some really, really dark
stuff now.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.279
There exists a certain subsection of guys
who like to rape women.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.520
Occasionally, this results in their victims
getting pregnant.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.919
Depending on where they live and their religious
convictions, the women may then decide to

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.509
carry the baby to term.

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.839
Now, here’s where it gets creepy.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:43.860
In around 7 states, it’s perfectly legal
for the rapist-father to sue for custody of

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.979
his newborn child.

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:47.979
Imagine that for a second.

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:52.749
You’ve been violently assaulted, gone through
the hell of guilt and self-recrimination,

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:57.520
been courageous enough to bring the resulting
baby into the world… and now you’re forced

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.400
to watch as the D-bag who hurt you decides
he wants to be a father to your son/daughter.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.520
Well, if you live in Alabama, Mississippi,
Maryland, New Mexico, North Dakota, Wyoming

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.949
or Minnesota, that can totally happen.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.270
In addition, there are 20 more states where
it might be legal.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.119
In Indiana, for example, you can only block
the rapist from seeking custody if you remember

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:22.689
to do so within 3 months of your baby being
born.

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:27.639
This is some seriously dark stuff, and we
guarantee that if you mention it to anyone

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:33.610
from elsewhere in the developed world, their
jaws will drop so low they hit the ground.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:39.000
Sure, some Middle East states may have even-worse
laws, but that’s not really a benchmark

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.909
to aspire to.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.009
4.

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:46.950
America Has More Self-Identified Patriots
than Anywhere Else on Earth

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.449
In July 2016, Gallup released the results
of their yearly patriotism poll.

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:57.339
They found 52% of Americans call themselves
“extremely patriotic”, the lowest level

00:08:57.339 --> 00:08:58.980
in polling history.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.899
The news triggered a slew of introspective
articles by American writers, wondering what

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:04.120
had gone wrong.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.040
For those reading elsewhere in the world,
it felt like stepping through the looking

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040
glass.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.399
52% is such a good score it leaves other countries
eating the USA’s dust.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:18.110
Such levels of patriotism simply don’t exist
in the rest of the developed world.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.930
In a similar survey by YouGov, only 13% of
Brits thought their country was “the best

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.110
in the world.”

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.640
That was the highest score in the EU.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.500
Germany and France got only 5% each.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.509
The second and third highest-ranking countries
globally, India and Australia, scored 34%

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:35.509
and 36%.

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:38.000
But the US?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.900
The US busted through the 40% mark, with an
additional 32% claiming America was at the

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.759
very least “better than most other countries.”

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:50.110
For the majority of foreigners, the idea of
showing US-levels of patriotism is simply

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.130
alien.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.550
You will never see a flag in every yard in
any other country on Earth.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.420
But that’s the US public for you: optimistic
to a tee.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.130
Even if they’re unhappy with their current
government, folks still believe that the idea

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.420
of America itself is worth believing in.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.290
3.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.370
Americans are More Likely to Get Bitten by
Other Americans than Rats

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:15.500
The stereotype is that Americans likes three
things: football, fast food, and violence

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.699
(often all at once).

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.410
It’s true that America’s murder rate is
crazy-high.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.399
It’s also true that the national sport is
getting drunk and starting bar-fights.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:27.009
But surely it’s not as bad as all that?

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:32.350
Well, we hate to break it to you, but this
arresting statistic says otherwise.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.360
If you live in America, you are more likely
to be bitten by another American than you

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.880
are by a rat.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.149
To be clear, this isn’t because US rats
are particularly docile or rare on the ground.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:46.579
Cities like New York are completely infested,
and people get bitten all the freakin’ time.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:51.490
There are over 40,000 rat bites recorded in
America each year.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.569
The only trouble is, there are at least 45,000
human bites recorded right alongside them.

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:59.019
Again, this is a freaky fact for Americans,
too.

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:03.100
But, also again, it’s just something that
doesn’t happen in most other countries.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.579
Sure, drunks in Britain like to hit each other,
and Italian soccer hooligans are violent as

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:10.819
heck, but biting enough people to outstrip
rats?

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:14.550
It’s something we can’t imagine happening
anywhere else.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.550
2.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.480
Americans Take ‘Fast Food’ Extremely Literally

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.090
The US is the birthplace of fast food.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.790
It’s the nation that brought the world the
drive-thru, perfected the snack, and coined

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.290
the phrase “lunch is for wimps.”

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.260
Foreigners know all this intellectually.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.390
But confront them with a statistic like the
following, and it’ll still blow their minds.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.949
Americans, you see, are the 3rd fastest eaters
on Earth.

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:43.339
On an average day, Americans spend only 74
minutes eating, nearly the lowest in the world.

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:47.260
That’s only slightly over 20 minutes each
for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and far less

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.040
if you include time put aside for eating snacks.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.740
If you live in the USA, this probably doesn’t
seem so weird to you (the working lunch is

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.860
an American specialty), but if you live elsewhere…
man, you’re probably wondering how the heck

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.860
they do it.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.870
In France, the average eating time is 135
minutes a day.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.180
In Turkey, it’s 162 minutes.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.450
Even in Japan, where people work far longer
hours than in the US, they still manage to

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.379
put aside 117 minutes a day for chow.

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:16.380
The only other countries to spend as little
time eating are Canada (72 minutes) and Mexico

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.019
(under 70 minutes).

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:22.740
This is probably to do with both the American
hard work ethic and fast food culture, which

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.980
prioritizes productivity over relaxation.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.579
The same can be seen in a related statistic
on cooking times.

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:35.019
Nowhere else on Earth do people spend as little
time cooking each day as in America.

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:36.069
1.

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:40.069
Government Departments Have Official Advice
for Reporting Elvis Sightings

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:44.540
One of the things foreigners know about the
US is that it’s full of wackos seeing wacko

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.540
things.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.150
There’s a reason The X-Files was so popular
20 years ago.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.960
But it’s one thing to hear about guys filming
shaky footage of Bigfoot on their cell phone.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.790
It’s another entirely to hear that actual
US government departments have official advice

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.120
for reporting Elvis sightings.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.459
Here, for example, is a link to the Federal
government’s official website for copyright.

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:02.459
Hover your mouse over the link.

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:03.459
See that it ends .gov?

00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:04.459
It’s impossible for anyone not representing
a government entity to register a .gov address.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:05.459
This site is legit.

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:06.459
It’s part of the Federal government, and
paid for by taxpayers’ money.

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:08.970
And it includes official advice on how to
copyright your sighting of Elvis.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.560
This isn’t a joke section put up by some
lighthearted bureaucrat indulging a whim.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.540
It’s completely, mind-bogglingly serious.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.110
Which means the government was getting deluged
with enough requests about Elvis sightings

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.329
that they went to the trouble to post official
advice about it.

00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:36.899
OK, say it with me now, altogether: only in
America.
