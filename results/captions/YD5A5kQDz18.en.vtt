00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.880
Well, Tao's home on the farm he's a friend to Maggie.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.680
They look like they're doing great right now, but how was it when they first were introduced?

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.069
Let me take you back to some of those first moments just a few days ago

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.680
You might be surprised

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.760
Good boy, Way to go.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.440
He looks so big here.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.080
Oh, look at you.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.980
Are you Okay? That was quite the ride wasn't it?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.980
Just be very careful. Don't give him that much Liz.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140
Walk him back, walk him around.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.860
Maggie, you're not even focused on him.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.900
You wanna go see?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.600
a little more.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.220
Oh hi.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.200
[train horn sounds in the distance]

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.320
How about walking them over to the round pin area and we'll walk them in circles on

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.200
Opposite sides of the pin now Adelynn you head to the left and just walk them on opposite sides the same direction

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.080
Pick him up make him walk

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.790
Keep them on opposite sides of the pin for now

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.910
There you go

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.499
For tonight the first night, we don't want to keep them together because we haven't really

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.760
Acclimated them very well

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.100
So we're gonna keep Maggie in Maggie's place the old place for tonight and then tomorrow. We'll work on getting them

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.680
Used to being around each other.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.440
today is day two of the horses being together

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.860
They were introduced sort of last night and today

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.140
We're going to put them together and see how they interact we're gonna tiptoe into that last night Maggie stayed here

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.130
And tayo stayed back. Oh, where is he somewhere back over there and

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680
Now we're gonna. Just see what happens

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.380
He's starring at her.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200
You see her Tao?

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.420
Oh hey Tao.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.440
Hey, I'm going to let her go because if something happens I don't want to [words not understood]

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.419
We were told there was going to be some kicking and some biting no matter

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:07.739
How we did this we introduced them over the fence last night. They've been seeing each other all morning over the fence today. I

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.919
Didn't know there would be this much

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.429
Kicking, it's a little nervous a little nerve-wracking for me

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.060
But it looks like maybe they're settling down and sorting it out at least. I hope that's the case

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
I'm not sure if the ears

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.140
Back on it on the head, Tao's head

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:37.680
I'm sure it means something. I'm not I don't know exactly what it means the positioning the the scratching the head down

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.620
Maggie seems

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.860
Fairly relaxed and fairly normal until Tao gets too close.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.540
Before we bought Maggi she lived at a barn a facility where there were a lot of horses and according to my daughter ,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.689
Maggie reacted similar in a similar way when she was introduced to other horses, so I think she has a little bit of a

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.740
dominance

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.740
streak in her

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.200
You ok Tao?

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.680
Might be really silly for being in here with them

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.620
I'm backing up because

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.620
Tao is positioning himself a little bit walking toward me and I want to make sure that I don't get caught in the crossfire

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.500
Tao definitely looks a little nervous Maggie seems pretty chill and

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:06.980
Yeah, I don't know if that's because she's the mare and he's the gelding you know male versus female or if it's just this

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:14.620
Is Maggie's property and Tao is introduced and he's the new guy or you know? I'm trying to read into this a little bit

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.430
But I really don't know what I'm talking about

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:47.890
According to some of the horse stuff that we know if they're licking and chewing and their ears are forward

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.489
Then they're okay, she seems pretty okay

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.450
But they're still trying to figure each other out

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.010
And I'm trying to position myself around trees so that I can get away if I need to you

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.550
Maggie

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.810
Quite honestly, I probably put myself in an awkward and dangerous position by being in there with the horses

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.389
We're gonna leave them to sort things out. It looks like they're gonna. They're gonna figure it out. Hopefully

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.939
There's not a whole lot of biting and kicking still left to do, but I guess that's normal

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.860
And they have to work that out, so we'll come back in a little bit and see how

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.480
they're doing.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.520
While they weren't looking my daughter dropped the blue toy out here

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.340
which has green in it the horses rolled around and the grain falls out, and then they eat the grain I

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.460
Guess we're hoping that if there's enough distraction the horses can

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.720
I don't know, maybe find a way to not

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.120
Focus on each other, but maybe they need to

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:22.329
What that is doing it's giving Tao something to distract him so Maggie can get some hay

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.800
It's day three

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.579
Christmas Day

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.920
We just had our family times, and now I'm gonna go out here and check on the horses. My daughter's already out

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.520
The horses from here up here to be doing fine

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.780
Hey Maggie. Tao.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.060
You guys doing okay this morning? yeah?

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.440
Are you taking Maggie for a walk out front?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.240
Yeah, I'll take her out this morning to let her graze. Okay.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.840
Good boy Tao.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.640
From what I've seen that now after the introduction the day two and the morning on day three

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.390
This has been a successful

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:50.430
Introduction of two horses

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.589
We may not have done it all correctly according to other people's methods

00:11:54.589 --> 00:12:00.559
But the biting and the kicking we were told was going to be normal and they did do that

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:06.499
So I know I put myself in a little bit of a bad position at times while I was in the field

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:11.119
With the horses, that's probably not something you should try at home. I didn't really think that through

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.640
But you know I'm okay, and we came out okay, if you like this video, please share

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.110
He's talking to you

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.860
He's saying, please share this video with your friends and family because we will all consider that a gift

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.580
Thank you so much for watching this episode of

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.700
Horses on the Daddykirbs farm. I'll talk to you soon

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.960
Yeah, are you talking to me? Are you talking to the people in the camera, or do you miss Maggie?

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.470
You miss Maggie that's it
