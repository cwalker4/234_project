00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
- Welcome back to my new video.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
The Airbus A380 is the
world's largest aeroplane,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.950
and the most expensive one as well.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.800
Last week Airbus announced that

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.730
it would stop production of the A380 by 2021.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.490
So, what went wrong?

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.080
In just 10 years this aeroplane has fallen

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.960
from being an airline status
symbol to being a reject.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.600
Let's find out about, in this video,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.340
the rise and fall of the Airbus A380.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.160
Airbus has spent a decade trying

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.670
to break into a market
dominated by the Boeing 747.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.310
They had set its sights
on bigger targets.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.080
Airbus wanted to introduce
an aircraft even bigger

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.500
than the Boeing 747 with
lower operating costs.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.980
The result was a double-decker
concept called the A3XX,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.140
which was eventually called the A380.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.310
The A380 was launched in December 2000.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.240
The super jumbo has now been in service

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.690
for more than a decade.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.970
An A380 takes off or lands

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.000
around the world every two minutes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.980
Today the A380 fleets make
over 300 flights per day

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.520
operating on more than 120 routes,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.480
and 60 destinations by 14 airlines.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.220
Since its entry into service

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.496
the A380 has carried almost
250 million passengers.

00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:16.930
The first A380 flight took place

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.260
in Toulouse on 27 April, 2005.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.080
People from all over the
world came to Toulouse.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.080
Well, I was one of 'em too.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.270
It was a day that I will
never forget in my life.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.520
At 10:29 a.m. the first
A380 prototype opened up

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.940
the throttles of its four
massive turbofan engines.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.220
As the super-jumbo took off

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.830
from the Airbus facility
in Toulouse, France,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.270
the largest commercial airliner
around was actually flying.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.920
Seeing is believing.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.620
The A380 entered into commercial service

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.140
with Singapore Airlines on 25 October 2007

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810
from Singapore to Sydney.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.910
I was one of the lucky few
who flew on the inaugural return flight

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.020
from Sydney to Singapore on the next day

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.830
in the new Singapore Airline suites.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.510
At 239 feet long, 79 feet tall,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.790
and 262 feet from wingtip to
wingtip, it is a big aeroplane.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.623
Only the Boeing 747-8 is longer
at 250 feet and two inches.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.440
The A380's flight crew

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.360
operate from a state of
the art glass cockpit.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.680
The aircraft is flown using a side-stick

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.130
with a fly-by-wire control system.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.920
This is a table, and one
more flip is the keyboard.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.893
Engine power is here, the radio is here,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.323
and speed brake, flaps,

00:02:39.297 --> 00:02:43.730
- Parking brake, this one.
- Parking brake.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.840
Each A380 consists of around 4
million individual components.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.760
The aircraft has 220 windows and 16 doors.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.850
During the takeoff,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.860
the wing will flex
upwards by over 4 metres.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.010
Guys I'm just on the platform.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.800
We've reached the maximum
height in this hanger,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.320
and it goes to about the same
level as the 380 tail,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.010
it's about 75, 80 metres tall.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.470
And it gives you a bird's eye
view of the A380 underneath.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.400
This is the best view to look at a 380; to look down on it.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.880
What a marvellous piece
of engineering, really,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.090
for such a large aeroplane
to exist and to fly in the sky today.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.760
That's the camera, that's the tail camera.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.000
Oh that's the secret.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.063
So crazy, yes, to touch that.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.060
As an airliner, the A380
promised luxury and comfort

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.850
on an unprecedented scale.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.490
The airbus delivered premium features

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.330
such as walk-up bars,
lounges and bathrooms with showers

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.400
which set this super-jumbo
jet apart from it's rivals.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.973
There are first class suites.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.652
(gentle music)

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.034
And then the even larger
first class suite.

00:04:07.034 --> 00:04:09.617
(gentle music)

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:14.870
And then there's the Etihad Residence,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.833
a 125 square foot home in the sky.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.330
Passengers love the comfort
and the quietness of the A380.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.880
Even the economy class
is very comfortable.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.130
I think very few aeroplanes
have achieved this status.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.100
And I also know that there are many
people who go out of their way

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.120
to book on to an A380 flight
to ensure that comfort.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.090
14 Airlines operate A380 currently.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.360
Air France, Asiana, British
Airways, China Southern,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.990
Emirates, Etihad, Korean
Air, Hi Fly, Lufthansa,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.060
Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.313
Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.550
Portugal's Hi Fly became the first airline

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.530
to offer a second hand A380,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.330
when it took delivery of an
ex Singapore Airlines jet

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.700
in the summer of 2018.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.030
Japan's All Nippon Airways will soon begin

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.750
commercial service with
it's first A380 in 2019.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.420
- The success of the A380

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.370
first is derived from
the passenger experience.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.320
The A380 offers the most comfortable cabin

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.630
in the industry today.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.340
One benefit often overlooked

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.340
when having an A380 in your network,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.250
is the effect that it has
on the connecting traffic.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.560
This means, not only, that
you stimulate traffic demand

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.280
from other origin and destination pairs.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.510
But also, you can improve the yields

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.880
of those connecting flights.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.210
When you're travelling long
haul, say Trans-Pacific,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.920
there are only so many time slots in a day

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.390
that you would wanna take off

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.160
when you consider what time you
would arrive in the morning.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.310
So from a pure passenger preference,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.490
there are peak hours of
when you want to travel.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.431
The A380 offers the solution

00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:56.910
through picking up the most
capacity on these peak hours,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.990
and thus bringing in the
most revenue for the airline.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.100
- But no customer is more
important than Emirates,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.600
which ordered almost half
of all the A380's ordered.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.780
But why does Emirates
love the A380 so much

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.530
at a time when other airlines are staying away

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.180
from the super-jumbo jet?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.420
Emirates is a predominantly
long-haul international airline,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.770
whose business is built around funnelling

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.400
millions of passengers
through its hub in Dubai and

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.890
then on to their destinations
around the world.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.280
As a result, Emirates needs an aircraft

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.640
that can carry lots of passengers
for very long distances.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.080
A perfect job for the A380.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.304
- We believe that this aircraft

00:06:37.304 --> 00:06:41.350
will be the most suitable
aircraft for us, and Emirate.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.120
And that's why we went and
signed up for a total order of 142.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.710
We needed the A380 for
our operation as our hub

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.620
in Dubai grew rapidly.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.370
We have been able to use
the aircraft at the slot

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.510
constrained airports like
Heathrow, JFK, and also at airports

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.460
where we have full passenger
demands, such as Manchester,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.660
Dusseldorf, Prague, and also to Mauritius.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.140
- And on behalf of my
colleagues at Airbus,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.717
let me finish by offering congratulations

00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:22.717
to your highness Sheikh Ahmed,
Tim, everybody at Emirates

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.900
on your 100th A380, thank you all.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.167
- I thank all the team who
have been working from Emirate

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:34.120
and Airbus all over those years

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.850
to bring such a beautiful
aircraft to this industry.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.811
Thank you.

00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.394
(upbeat music)

00:07:56.968 --> 00:07:57.880
- (Narrator) But few airlines

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.710
use the Emirates strategy.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.480
These days the trend in the industry

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.750
is to offer direct flights using smaller,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.170
long range aircraft, point to point.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.400
Instead of Emirates's dedicated
hub and spoke routes model,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.470
most airlines have moved towards

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.470
more point to point flying, using
the ultra modern 787 or A350.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.077
Smaller, next generation,
composite Y bodies like

00:08:19.077 --> 00:08:22.620
the 787 Dreamliner offer
airlines more flexibility

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.880
and less risk.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.480
According to the CEO
of Qantas, Alan Joyce,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.580
it costs less to operate
two 787 Dreamliners

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.690
than it does to fly a single A380.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.670
The A380 super jumbo
hasn't been the game changer

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.030
Airbus hoped it would be
when the idea was conceived

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.370
just two decades ago.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.030
This is especially the case
on the financial front.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.820
I have flown on the A380 with
less than 100 passengers

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.830
on board several times
during the low season.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.320
Who needs business class
when you have the whole row -

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.723
ten seats - all to yourself on the A380?

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.020
For much of the plane's
life, Airbus has struggled

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.790
to find airlines willing to
put the A380 into service.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.930
With a price tag of $445.6 million,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.700
the A380 is one of the
most expensive and lavish

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.630
aeroplanes  ever built.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.130
Production ends with just 251 aeroplanes .

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.863
Airbus has already delivered 234 A380's.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.920
Only 17 A380's are yet to be delivered.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.040
14 are set to join Emirates, and 3 will go

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.330
to Japan's All Nippon Airways.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.310
As a result, the A380 never developed

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.570
into a true work horse like the 747.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.320
Instead, it has been
relegated to the position of a niche aircraft,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.550
only economically feasible on routes

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.530
with heavy airport congestion.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.100
Emirates airline president, Sir Tim Clark,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.020
has for years pushed Airbus to make

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.570
a more cost effective version of the plane

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.610
with upgraded aerodynamics
and a new fuel efficient

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.890
engine called the A380 NEO.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.530
That hasn't happened.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.490
Airbus has been reluctant
to invest the kind of money

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.490
needed to develop a new version of the A380.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.820
In 2017, Airbus offered it's
customers a moderately updated

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.720
version of the plane called the A380 plus.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.380
- Well there's a number of
benefits which the A380 plus brings.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.130
First of all, lower fuel burn,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.300
a four percent reduction in fuel burn.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.930
We're also adding up to 80
additional seats to the aircraft.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.750
To maintain the range we're
increasing the maximum

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.780
takeoff weight by 3 tonnes,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.030
and then we've also got
benefits in terms of new systems

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.816
and more efficient maintenance
and operational reliability.

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:36.140
- (Narrator) The A380 Freighter
never came to fruition.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.930
In January 2018 Emirates
ordered 20 additional A380's

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.930
that would have kept the
A380 production line moving

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.840
for the next decade, however
that deal fell apart.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.170
In the end, even the
A380's most loyal customer

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.010
couldn't hold on any longer.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.240
Emirates cut 39 A380's
from it's original order of

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.400
162 planes, and bought a
smaller twin engine A330 Neos,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.440
and A350's instead.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.860
Even though the A380
production ends in 2021,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.469
the planes are expected to
fly on for years to come.

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:12.302
(aeroplane engine)

00:11:29.826 --> 00:11:32.890
Whether the A380 is a success or failure,

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.350
it remains a significant
part of aviation history.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.920
I hope the A380 can remain flying

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.130
in the sky for many more years to come.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.140
Have you flown on the A380 before?

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.730
I would really like to hear your stories

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.200
and read your comments.
