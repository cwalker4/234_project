00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.070
If you had a lightsaber what color would your crystal turn for you comment your color in the comments right now

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.300
Now here's a video I've been wanting to do since the channel's birth

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.410
but just felt like everyone already knew the answer and there are so many videos like this on YouTube that I felt that that's just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.660
No point doing it but much to my surprise

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.380
It doesn't really seem to be as known as I thought. Do you all remember being a little kid after watching Star Wars?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.760
Imagining that you had a lightsaber, I'm sure everyone here can relate. What color was your lightsaber? For me

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.259
It was always green or red well in this video

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.260
We'll finally learn the different colors that are in Canon,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.029
coupled with what they mean now the new Canon explains lightsabers as turning the color of their users force powers and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.590
Turning red if they are forced to bleed by the Sith. In legends

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.029
however the colors were sought after on different planets awarded to the user by their skills and color preference now to

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.519
Understand a little better before we embark on these colors

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.200
We must know why lightsaber even emits colors so to begin all

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.080
Lightsabers house a crystal and this crystal starts as colorless until the users personality and force abilities help determine what color

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.100
the crystal will emit. Now not just any Jedi can take any crystal if it is a match the crystal will make a soothing hum

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.619
However, if the match isn't compatible, then it will remain frozen to the touch

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.240
Let's start this off

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.159
Unconventionally here as usual in Star Wars Theory let's begin with purple now purple is the color that wasn't supposed to exist

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.898
However when Samuel Jackson got the part of mace windu he wanted to stand out

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.659
So he asked George if he could have purple. Now

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.609
I'm sure you can guess what the answer was there purple signifies a user of the light that harnesses some dark side attribute and attacks

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.610
while

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.049
Synergistically using them to defeat the dark side just like how Mace uses of a pod which is a variant of the seventh lightsaber fighting

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.199
Style one that Darth Maul mastered as well it allowed him to turn the dark side energy around him towards his attacker

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.270
Blue and red makes purple the perfect balance now Disney still has yet to reveal

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.299
How Mace Windu made his purple lightsaber since they're extremely rare which will require some backtracking?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.520
But I'm sure it'll be done at some point at least hopefully next up. We'll cover blue, now

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.049
This color is used by most Jedi as it's symbolic of guardians and protectors of the Peace.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.139
They are like the Warriors of the Jedi Order by far the most well-rounded of all the Jedi good at everything but

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.429
Master of none now blue lightsabers are yet to be further explained by Canon in Star Wars as to how a Jedi turns it blue

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.790
instead of green

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.459
But in legends the blue crystal was abundant on the planet alone some popular blue users were Anakin Skywalker obi-wan

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.310
Kenobi ki-adi-mundi and plugg Koon although platoon if you wait a few minutes will get the yellow

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.929
you'll also see that he had a yellow lightsaber so basically any jedi padawan before they really start to exhibit their favorable force powers and

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.029
talents would have a blue lightsaber the next color is one of my favorites Green now Green was used only for those who were

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.399
Extremely powerful in the force and ones who offered a different view than other

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.899
Jedi a Jedi consular as they called them typically used negotiations instead of using their weapon however if need be

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.639
They have no problem using it and what a force they were to be reckoned with

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.959
In conjunction with their lightsaber training which would start at the early age of a young league as they would progress and own their force

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.459
Powers creating the green blade that we see their force powers would definitely help them with their attacks and their fighting style

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.569
Everything from speed to acrobatics to power would be implemented

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.069
Against their opponent this makes for one of the deadliest Jedi in the galaxy as their force powers aided their attacks and strikes

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.980
popular green light

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.980
Yoda qui-gon jinn Kit Fisto

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.908
Quinlan vos and of course Luke Skywalker by the way how many of you think Luke will have his green lightsaber in

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:18.869
Episode 8. I hope he does red the next color I'd like to talk about is red now of course

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.060
We don't see light side users with red lightsabers as no organic crystal is red to begin with

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.479
In order to make a lightsaber red one must make it bleed

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.960
Against its will I have a video covering the Canon Darth Vader comic and how he made his first lights hit return red from green

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.919
Which he stole from a Jedi I'll have him pop up as a cart now

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.569
And then at the end of this video again now red signifies if you didn't guess already

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.979
anger hatred pain suffering and destruction basically everything a Sith stands for perfect for a Sith Lord

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.399
hell-bent on killing Jedi some popular users

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.650
include darth vader darth maul darth sidious Count Dooku the inquisitors and

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.999
Kylo Ren how many of you here think Snoke will have a red lightsaber or perhaps will he have a black one or?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.220
Will he don't even use a lightsaber is he just too powerful and way beyond using a lightsaber

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.039
I'm excited to find that answer out in December yellow. Now this lightsaber was more rare

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.360
Not as rare as purple

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.220
But it was typically only used by scholars and Jedi Temple guards or in other words

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.849
Jedi sentinels it involved the user's crystal to identify their unique intellect and see them as somewhere in-between

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.289
Guardians with blue and forced to in consulars with green now

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.589
There is no Canon explanation yet about how a lightsaber turns yellow or why?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.090
but what I can say is that Jedi Temple gaurds rotated throughout the order and

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.949
With this impermanent position the yellow lightsabers would be passed around as well

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.079
You could think of it somewhat like shifts

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.180
so if Jedi sentinels had a shift to be

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.239
Protectors and Jedi Temple guards then they would take the lightsaber that was there waiting for them from the last person

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.519
These lightsabers never belonged to any guard in particular. They were just used amongst the order

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.389
We've seen guards use them along with the rail poof and blow Koon

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.290
Who's appeared more orange at times, but I figured I'd mention it

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.689
Anyway, is due to the closeness in color until we have a cannon orange explanation the next color

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.979
We'll examine is silver or rather white ahsoka used this color lightsaber in rebels and until the ahsoka novel came out

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.990
It was a bit of a mystery well

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.959
This is a lightsaber color that exists when a user

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:37.340
reverses the bleeding method and frees a crystal from its pain that the previous user forced upon it in other words if you heal a

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.470
bleeding crystal then it turned white

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.049
Ahsoka, took the red lightsaber crystal and freed it from its pain and turning it a pale white color

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.389
I also have a video explaining this very topic in detail how it's so good turned her lightsabers

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.390
white which I'll have to pop up now and

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.989
At the end of the video the last but not least lightsaber is the color black

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.509
Which many speculate to be snoke's lightsaber as he has a black Kyber crystal ring on his finger?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.879
I think that he won't even use one

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.150
But that's neither here nor there a black lightsaber blade has been seen in the Clone Wars used by the dark saber

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.729
it's an ancient weapon stolen from the Jedi hundreds of years prior to the Clone Wars by the

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.670
Mandalorians

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.689
Even more distinctive than its color or lack thereof

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.440
the dark sabers flat

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.480
Curved blade is just like a real sword it eventually came into the possession of Darth Maul during the Clone Wars until we see it

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.210
later again

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:36.199
And rebels a little Easter Egg is that we can see the dark saber written in the files in rogue one

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.930
When jyn erso is trying to steal the Death Star plans?

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.770
Now to throw in a bonus fact for all those who made it this far in the video

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.239
Comment below if he did did you know the earliest?

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:51.628
Lightsabers also called proto sabers didn't include internal power cells mainly because they hadn't been invented yet

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:55.619
Proto sabers had external power sources this meant that Jedi had to carry around

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:03.299
Huge backpacks on their backs or around their waist which were attached to the lightsaber by a power cord if the cord was cut

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:10.379
Or severed in any way the lightsaber would shut off in battle the Sith were eventually the first ones to develop

00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:14.309
Power cells that cut through the lightsaber cords also

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.959
Did you know that Luke's green lightsaber in The Return of the Jedi was going to be blue?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.289
And it was even shown this way in episode 6 promo

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.159
But George Lucas made the call to switch to green

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:34.198
solely because the blue blade was more difficult to see during the fight scene above the Sarlacc pit while Jabba and his palace watched the

00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:40.859
Blue lightsaber was apparently getting lost in the blue sky, that means. We'd never have seen green. I'm glad they changed it

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.060
It's much more cool

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.299
This way now the real question is what lightsaber

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:51.180
Would you have what color would your crystal turn and why I hope you guys enjoyed this episode?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.579
I think this is one that you can refer back to later down the road if you ever forget or you want some more clarification

00:08:56.709 --> 00:09:01.679
On it. It's one that I wanted to cover for sometime if you want me to do legends colors

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.220
Let me know as there are literally hundreds of different colors

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.910
Which I think would be pretty cool and fun to do also for tomorrow's episode

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.250
Do you want me to cover the reason Luke Skywalker went into hiding there are some spoilers in this room?

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.070
I wanted to take a breather from leaks and theory videos

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.140
I just didn't want to saturate you all or bored you or kind of spread it out over time anyways

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:26.069
Thanks for watching this video leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed it to help the channel grow

00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:33.989
And I'll see you all in the next episode of Star Wars Theory until then my fellow Jedi ins and friends

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.349
remember the force will be with

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.460
always

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.300
You
