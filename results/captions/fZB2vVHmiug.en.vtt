00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:17.648
I'm honored to be here.

00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:20.244
I find these TED talks fascinating

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:22.600
and inspiring.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.350
Some of these people, the speakers,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.820
are so smart that they just hurt my brain.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.991
(Laughter)

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:31.392
I'm not going to hurt anybody's brain.
(Laughter)

00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:33.765
That's my first promise.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.626
Every day we have a choice
when we wake up:

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:38.974
We can focus on
what's wrong with our lives,

00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:41.841
or we can focus on
what's right with our lives.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.851
In the next 10 minutes,
I'm going to illustrate how

00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:47.129
focusing on what's right with our lives, 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.257
rather than what's wrong with our lives,

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.686
is the best way to fix 
what's wrong with our lives.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:55.309
Moreover, focusing on 
what's right with the world

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.396
is the best way to fix 
what's wrong with the world.

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:01.916
This is my nephew, Oliver.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.540
Oliver is 3 years old,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.994
and I went for a lunch date with him
the other day.

00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:09.842
And so, I picked up Oliver.

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:11.580
We live in downtown Boston.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.060
It was nice weather, 
so we went to a picnic table.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.510
That's a picture of Oliver enjoying 
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.463
And so,

00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:23.316
that's the end of my speech. Thank you!

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.920
(Laughter)

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:28.504
So, Oliver 
– while I was getting the lunch out –

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.216
jumped off the table

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:33.368
and there was an elderly woman
at a bench near us,

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:34.811
very elderly woman.

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:38.418
And before I could stop him, 
I thought maybe she was homeless,

00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:40.395
because her bag was a little bit dirty,

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:44.311
and before I could stop him, 
Oliver introduced himself.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:46.754
And the woman said, "How old are you?"

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:49.448
And Oliver said, "Guess."

00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:52.729
And she said, "I think you're four."

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.861
And he said, "I'm three and a half!

00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:57.781
How old are you?" (Laughter)

00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.758
And the woman said, "Guess!"

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:03.055
And then Oliver took a step back 
and looked at me for help.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.607
(Laughter)

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:06.713
And I was, like,
"Dude, you're on your own!"

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:08.104
(Laughter)

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:10.657
You can't win with a woman's age, right?
(Laughter)

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:13.737
So, Oliver knew he was on his own, 
he took a step forward again,

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:16.334
he looked at her
and gave it his best shot.

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:17.562
"A thousand?"

00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:20.555
(Laughter)

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:21.811
I'm dead serious.

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.543
And so, before I could apologize,

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:26.925
the old woman was laughing
at the top of her lungs

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:29.668
and Oliver was laughing, 
and I started laughing.

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.191
Pretty soon she joined us
and we just made friends.

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:36.527
And you know, when we were kids

00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:40.083
we were all optimistic,
we all lived our lives like this.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.859
And Oliver showed me something
that day because

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.479
he focused on the opportunity, 
he didn't focus on the obstacles.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.911
Unfortunately, as we get older,

00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:52.953
we tend to focus on the obstacles
and not the opportunity.

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:56.447
So, we become skeptical as we get 
older, instead of living like this,

00:02:56.447 --> 00:03:00.145
and we live a bit more like this 
and we become pessimistic.

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:03.396
Don't give me that look, any of you,
because you're all guilty of it.

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:06.290
Maybe not you guys, not yet, right?

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.412
So, the thing is that nobody 
wants to be pessimistic.

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:12.964
Being a pessimist is not fun to be around

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:16.770
and pessimism adds anxiety 
and stress to our lives.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.734
The reality is that everybody
on the planet wants to be happy.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:24.428
Some people think that
having nice things will make them happy.

00:03:24.428 --> 00:03:29.165
Some people think that being at
some special place will make them happy.

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:32.558
The reality is that the only 
thing that can make us happy

00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:35.571
is our disposition,
our view of the world.

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:37.688
This is my mom, Joan.

00:03:37.688 --> 00:03:41.322
And Joan and my dad raised 6 kids 

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:43.946
on about enough money for 2 kids.

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.440
And my mom had a special trick:

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.047
she'd get all 8 of us at the dinner table,

00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:52.731
and of course we had as much dysfunction
happening in our home

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:55.671
as any typical American or Boston home,

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:58.803
and my mom would
cut right through all that,

00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:01.225
and she'd say something very simple,

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:04.158
"Tell me something good
that happened today."

00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:08.259
And she taught us something, because 
she changed the energy in that room.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.737
This is a picture
of my younger brother John, 

00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:13.345
who's my business partner
with Life is good.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.983
He's on the bottom bunk
and I'm on the top bunk.

00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:18.390
If anybody in here has 
ever met my brother John,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.240
he's a bit of a space shot,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.196
and if you look closely at the radiator,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.160
it's very clear that he's been 
snacking on the lead paint.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.637
(Laughter)

00:04:32.113 --> 00:04:34.712
My brother and I are
the youngest of 6 kids,

00:04:34.712 --> 00:04:38.819
and if you visit my parents 
-- they live in Needham --

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.569
and there's bookcases and bookcases

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.479
filled with photos
of my older brothers and sisters.

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.251
This is one of three photos
of my childhood.

00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.894
(Laughter)

00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:51.506
And when I look at the picture,
I'm like, "Mom,

00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:53.618
I can forgive you
for not taking the photos,

00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:55.831
but how about putting some sheets
on the bed?"

00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:57.396
(Laughter)

00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:01.552
So, when my brother and I
graduated from college,

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.035
armed with no money and no experience 

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:08.411
but some good advice from Mom,

00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.857
we started designing T-shirts and 
selling them in the streets in Boston,

00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:15.038
and soon after we bought a van;
we called the van "The Enterprise."

00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:19.341
We told each other we're going to boldly
go where no T-shirt guy has gone before.

00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:21.371
So, we got in that van, believe it or not, 

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:23.031
and we traveled for 5 years,

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.911
and we slept in that van 
on the road every night.

00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:29.511
And we had many great conversations
on the road,

00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:31.821
but one changed our lives forever.

00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:33.805
It was a conversation about
how the media

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:36.329
inundates our culture
with negative information,

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:38.584
always telling us
what's wrong with the world,

00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:41.979
but rarely telling us
what's right with the world.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.652
And the result of that conversation 
was Life is good, the brand.

00:05:45.652 --> 00:05:48.083
Seemed silly to trademark those 3 words, 

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:50.524
it's almost like trademarking "hello."

00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:52.702
So we got lucky in many respects,

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:56.160
but we were drawn to being optimistic

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.979
and we believed that there 
was power in being optimistic.

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.262
What was more important to us
at the time, 

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:02.755
and what was a question mark,

00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:04.268
is it commercially viable?

00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:07.483
Will people actually buy those 3 words 
"Life is good"

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:09.348
and other optimistic messages?

00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:10.453
Well, they did.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.538
Two days later,
in the streets in Cambridge, 

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:15.303
we sold 48 shirts in 45 minutes.

00:06:15.303 --> 00:06:18.148
It scared the heck of us,
because we didn't know what to do.

00:06:18.148 --> 00:06:21.952
But the business started growing, 
despite our lack of business acumen.

00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:24.871
I don't have time for all the mistakes
we made, but trust me,

00:06:24.871 --> 00:06:26.040
we made lots of them.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.931
But the brand idea was strong 
enough that it carried us.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.812
We began to blur the line 
between work and play,

00:06:32.812 --> 00:06:35.896
and so to us this is what 
a board meeting looked like.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.834
We really didn't know what was 
happening with the business,

00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:41.195
but it was growing underneath our feet.

00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:43.876
And the more shirts we designed, 
the more people bought.

00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:45.756
So in the first 6 years,

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:48.446
the first day when we sold
those shirts in Cambridge,

00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:50.749
we had $78 in our pocket.

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:54.622
And in 6 years it became
a $3 million business.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:58.215
We thought we were on our way to the moon
and we were just enjoying things.

00:06:58.215 --> 00:07:01.859
And people asked, because we have a 
Life is good Kids Foundation these days,

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:05.412
"Did we start with the idea
of an integrated model,

00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:07.405
for-profit and non-profit?"

00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:10.179
Trust me, I had no idea
what an integrated model was

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.005
and I guarantee you,
my brother had no idea what it was.

00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:15.105
(Laughter)

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.236
We were just trying to avoid
getting a job.

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.029
(Laughter)

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.247
And we were enjoying it and
we were doing well with that, okay?

00:07:23.247 --> 00:07:25.110
That's when something surprised us.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.627
We started to get mail from people 
who faced severe adversity,

00:07:28.627 --> 00:07:31.128
and we really didn't know 
why they were writing.

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:33.097
I'm going to read an example of a letter,

00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:35.474
and the letter came from 
one of these two boys.

00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:38.245
I still haven't met them,
but one day I will.

00:07:39.017 --> 00:07:41.812
"Dear Bert and John, my name is Alex.

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:44.182
I have a brother, Nick, and we are 10.

00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:46.471
We both have extra challenges
in the world,

00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:50.250
but at the end of the day, 
we still have each other.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.176
We were both born early 
and weighed only 1 pound,

00:07:53.176 --> 00:07:55.227
so we had a lot of growing to do.

00:07:55.227 --> 00:07:58.005
When I was born, I had my leg amputated.

00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:00.159
Nick is legally blind.

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:03.901
Me and Nick have all of your shirts, 
with all the things we like doing best,

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:05.473
but if you ask us what we do best

00:08:05.473 --> 00:08:07.758
and what makes us happy 
and laugh the most,

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:09.683
it is just being together.

00:08:09.683 --> 00:08:13.383
I know now that Nick has 
more challenges than I do."

00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:14.910
This is my favorite part because

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.317
the kid's 10 years old, it's like
he's been around the world, right?

00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:22.939
"But he says and does things that 
make me laugh and forget feeling bad.

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:24.824
I don't know how to describe it, 

00:08:24.824 --> 00:08:27.319
other than to say that I love him.

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:29.394
You're lucky to have a brother, too."

00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:31.566
He doesn't know my brother.

00:08:31.566 --> 00:08:34.051
(Laughter)

00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:37.645
"I hope you do fun things together. 
Your friends Alex and Nick."

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:41.821
So when you get a letter like that,
what do you do?

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:42.516
(Applause)

00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:43.555
You know?

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:48.594
You get a letter like that, it shows 
you the depth of optimism,

00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:51.564
it shows you gratitude
for what you do have,

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.823
and it makes you think, "I'll never
say I have to do something again.

00:08:54.823 --> 00:08:56.144
I get to do something."

00:08:56.144 --> 00:09:00.227
We get to do the laundry,
because you get to stand on two feet.

00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:03.535
You get to go grocery shopping,
you don't have to go grocery shopping,

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.305
because when you go grocery shopping, 

00:09:05.305 --> 00:09:07.745
you get to look at the labels
with two eyes.

00:09:07.745 --> 00:09:09.787
So here's these kids asking for nothing.

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:12.312
They really called just to say "hi"
and hang out.

00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:17.511
So we did the only logical thing 
anybody would do at that point.

00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:18.927
You probably guessed it. 

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.663
We started a pumpkin festival.

00:09:20.663 --> 00:09:22.241
(Laughter)

00:09:22.241 --> 00:09:24.835
And the pumpkin festival 
raised money and awareness

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:27.037
for children facing unfair challenges.

00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:28.829
And we had it up in Portland, Maine.

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:31.308
And if anybody's been to Maine 
in October,

00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:33.507
it ain't bikini weather, okay?

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:34.436
(Laughter)

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:37.912
We didn't know if anybody would show up
to our stupid little party or not,

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:39.454
but people showed up. 

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.116
Lots of people showed up.

00:09:41.116 --> 00:09:43.720
And this woman showed up
14 months pregnant in a bikini.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.441
(Laughter)

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:47.704
She brought her husband, Mr. Positive Man,

00:09:47.704 --> 00:09:50.560
and whoever this guy was, 
was escorted from the premises.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.728
(Laughter)

00:09:52.728 --> 00:09:54.394
That festival grew and grew,

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:57.469
and eventually we broke the 
Guinness World Book of Records

00:09:57.469 --> 00:10:00.315
for the most lit pumpkins
in one place at one time,

00:10:00.315 --> 00:10:01.711
on the Boston Common.

00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.079
Eventually the Life is Good
– and it raised –

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.737
that first year it raised over $100,000.

00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:10.213
In 2006 on the Boston Common 
it raised half a million dollars,

00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:12.610
every penny going to kids who need it.

00:10:13.532 --> 00:10:16.856
The pumpkin festival has now become
the Life is Good Music Festival.

00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:19.599
This attracts 30,000 optimists.

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:23.794
Thirty thousand optimists for a weekend, 
who get together and hear great artists.

00:10:23.794 --> 00:10:26.029
This is Michael Franti in the picture;

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:28.992
we've had Dave Matthews;
we've had Jack Johnson this year.

00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:32.985
So it's fun for us, we're still blurring 
the line between work and play,

00:10:32.985 --> 00:10:36.729
but we weren't born for business, 
business was born for us.

00:10:36.729 --> 00:10:38.361
Business is a tool

00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:40.533
and our optimism and open-mindedness

00:10:40.533 --> 00:10:43.665
allowed us to listen
to those boys and other letters

00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:47.147
and convert what we were doing 
to be a little more meaningful.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.364
This kid, I have no idea,
he's at one of our festivals

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:53.778
and I don't know what he's looking at,

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.971
but we literally blew his mind.

00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:58.622
(Laughter)

00:10:59.812 --> 00:11:02.220
The community of optimists
has grown, okay?

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.993
So, social media has a way, I mean, 

00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:07.726
the Internet was only invented in 1989,

00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:10.541
in a short period of time
something remarkable has happened,

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:12.977
and it's a beautiful thing for humanity.

00:11:12.977 --> 00:11:15.253
For the first time
in the history of the world,

00:11:15.253 --> 00:11:17.683
customers – the people who buy things –

00:11:17.683 --> 00:11:20.290
have taken control from 
the people who sell things.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.076
So my brother and I are still busy 
making mistakes with our business,

00:11:24.076 --> 00:11:26.624
but you know what? 
People believe in us.

00:11:26.624 --> 00:11:29.852
They believe in us. They don't care 
that we make business mistakes.

00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:32.961
The believe in us, they believe 
what we're doing is authentic.

00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:36.013
We now donate over 10%
of the profits from Life is good,

00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:39.185
no matter what we do, 
to kids that need help.

00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:40.785
So people read about that,

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:43.605
and they care about the causes
that are important to them,

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:44.855
and they invest in them.

00:11:44.855 --> 00:11:48.229
That is the way that capitalism is going.

00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:51.813
Capitalism isn't broken, it's been abused.

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:56.218
And optimism and open-mindedness 
enables us to see that.

00:11:56.218 --> 00:11:58.063
For us,

00:11:58.063 --> 00:12:00.168
this is just the beginning
of our road trip.

00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:02.144
We just signed a deal with Hallmark, 

00:12:02.144 --> 00:12:04.790
a 5.5 billion-dollar company.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.138
I get millions and billions mixed up.

00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:09.253
(Laughter)

00:12:09.253 --> 00:12:11.326
Everything we ever put on a T-shirt 

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:13.399
is now going to be on a greeting card.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.474
You know why
that's just particularly cool?

00:12:15.474 --> 00:12:19.412
Because 10% of our profitability 
from that will go to kids who need it.

00:12:19.412 --> 00:12:24.021
So we're harnessing one of the big, 
bad capitalistic companies out there

00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:26.394
to do great things, and you know what?

00:12:26.394 --> 00:12:29.646
Hallmark and Life is good 
are attached at the hip now.

00:12:29.646 --> 00:12:32.028
We signed a second deal with Smuckers, 

00:12:32.028 --> 00:12:34.130
another company that's over $5 billion.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.562
I got it right that time.

00:12:35.562 --> 00:12:36.727
(Laughter)

00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:39.842
The thing that's cool about that: 
we're making gourmet coffee.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.239
I don't drink coffee, I don't know 
anything about coffee, I don't care.

00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:45.380
Ten percent of the profits
from that coffee

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.801
is going to go to kids that need it.

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.254
We're going to travel
throughout the world.

00:12:50.254 --> 00:12:52.837
We're going to bring our 
little brand everywhere we go

00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:55.217
and we're going to help kids 
all over this world.

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:57.929
We're not selling the company
and we're not going public.

00:12:57.929 --> 00:13:01.089
We're doing what we like 
and we're liking what we do.

00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:03.901
You each have a road trip. 
Your life is a road trip.

00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:06.835
And we all share
the road of life together.

00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:08.485
Be good to each other,

00:13:08.485 --> 00:13:09.869
love yourself, 

00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:11.251
love each other,

00:13:11.251 --> 00:13:13.033
and enjoy the ride.

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:16.297
(Cheers)

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:17.248
You too!

00:13:17.248 --> 00:13:19.817
(Applause)

00:13:19.817 --> 00:13:21.770
Give me a high five.

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:23.826
Atta boy!

00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:26.779
Thank you!
