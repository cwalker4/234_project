00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.128
- He's an American computer programmer,

00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:03.688
an internet entrepreneur.

00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:06.133
He's best known as one of
the co-founders of the social

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.922
networking website, Facebook.

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:10.133
His personal net worth is estimated to be

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.684
38.6 billion dollars.

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:14.788
He's Mark Zuckerberg, and here are his

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.871
Top 10 Rules for Success.

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:21.435
- First of all, focus on it.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.268
I think like,

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:24.428
you basically get what
you spend your time doing.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:27.133
I want the company to build
three products this year,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.367
and we're going to work on
a few others because people

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.166
are interested in them, but
those are the three things

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.830
that I'm going spending
my product time on. Right?

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.482
You get what you put into it.

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:39.654
If you spend a third of
your time trying to make the

00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:43.233
people around you better
through getting better people,

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.539
mentoring, getting them to be better,

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.672
getting the best people in

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:47.690
your organization and you're
known to more impactful roles

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.183
then I think over time that's just accrues

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.029
and you get a better organization.

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:54.038
We've had this tradition
for, I don't know,

00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:57.273
probably seven or eight
years at the company,

00:00:57.273 --> 00:01:00.505
where every week we have a Q&amp;A

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:04.164
where employees can come
and ask me any question

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.316
that they want, about what's going on

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:08.666
and what the direction of
the company is or questions

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.568
or things that they read
about in the press or

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:13.892
that their friends who use the product,

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.128
what they're asking them.

00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:17.735
And it's been this really
important tradition for us.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:21.327
Both because we really believe
in openness and communication

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:23.193
and that kind of what
Facebook is all about,

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:26.294
but it's also really important for me

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.977
and for running the company
to be able to get feedback,

00:01:29.977 --> 00:01:33.211
and to be able to learn
what's on people's minds,

00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:37.121
what are employees and folks
who are a part of our team are

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.631
thinking about, and just kind of,

00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.906
a lot of the time, there are
good questions that people ask

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.402
that change the way that we,

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:46.168
that we think about what we're building

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:48.610
and what we're here to do in the world,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.390
that often makes us go
think and re-evaluate

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.339
how we should be approaching
different problems.

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:55.929
So many things go wrong when
you're starting a company,

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.405
and often I think people ask,

00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:00.974
"What mistakes should you avoid making?"

00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:02.475
And my answer to that is

00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:04.667
don't even bother trying to avoid mistakes

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.415
because you're going to
make tons of mistakes.

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:09.598
And the important thing is
actually learning quickly

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.888
from whatever mistakes you
make and not giving up.

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:16.467
There are things every single
year of Facebook's existence

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:17.788
that could have killed us

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:19.914
or made it so that it just
seemed like moving forward and

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:22.143
making a lot of progress
just seemed intractable,

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:23.939
but you just kind of bounce back

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.262
and you learn and nothing is impossible,

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:29.947
you just have to kind of keep
running through the walls.

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:32.572
I don't hire people who I
wouldn't work for myself.

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.998
I think that's a really good
heuristic because every one

00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:36.363
knows there's the saying like,

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:39.634
"A players hire A players and
B players hire C players",

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:43.624
which is like good people
hire good, you know.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:46.023
And I don't think that that's
that informative cause I mean,

00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:46.856
- It's not that useful.
- What are you going to say?

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:47.689
Just someone in your organization,

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:48.628
- Hire better people.
- Says you're a B player,

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:51.431
you don't get to hire
people, like I mean, no.

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.647
(audience chuckles)

00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:54.557
I think a lot of the time the
problem is you don't actually

00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:56.793
know, sometimes you're like
trying to figure out how good

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.057
someone is if you didn't think
they were good, you wouldn't

00:02:58.057 --> 00:03:01.517
have hired them, but the
heuristic of only hiring people

00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:03.350
who you would work for

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:06.822
tends to be pretty good, I think,

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.616
because then it's like, then you know.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:12.178
It's like, I would not for
this person then OK I'm not

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:13.883
going to like stretch just because

00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:15.275
I need to fill a role today.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:17.616
When you're starting something,

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:19.524
it's just kind of hard, you
need to be pretty headstrong

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:21.399
about it, there's going to
be all these challenges that

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.679
come up, and I think the main
thing that you need to do is

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:25.128
just not give up. Right?

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:28.314
And kind of know what you want to do and,

00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:30.445
the best entrepreneurs that who I've met,

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:32.943
don't really start companies
because their goal is

00:03:32.943 --> 00:03:34.246
to build a company.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.156
They do it because they want
to make a change in the world,

00:03:36.156 --> 00:03:37.036
and help people.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:39.284
And I think if you kind
of stay true to that

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:43.059
and if you just focus on kind
of powering through no matter

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.519
what the challenges are that
will inevitably come up in your

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.418
path, then you'll find that
there are lots of tools that are

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:50.981
available and a lot of people who will

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.628
help you build what you're building.

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:55.597
One definition that I have for a good team

00:03:55.597 --> 00:03:59.641
is a group of people that makes
better decisions as a whole

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:02.621
than would individually
make as a sum of the parts.

00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.929
And when you're,

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.638
I think most smart people
like learning, right?

00:04:06.638 --> 00:04:09.110
That's like one of the thrills
of starting a company, right?

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.005
Is you're just, the learning
curve can be so steep

00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:14.099
and if you can set up a
team dynamic, where you're

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.376
constantly learning from the
people around you then, I mean,

00:04:16.376 --> 00:04:17.551
what's better? Right?

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:19.467
These are the people I wake
every morning and I want to,

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:21.232
I want to go learn from and work from.

00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:23.397
- Is that one of your heuristics
for hiring people too,

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:25.693
like, hire people that you learn from?

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:29.072
- Yeah. And when building
a team, you want it to,

00:04:29.072 --> 00:04:31.931
you want to think about the
dynamics so that way you can

00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:34.805
maintain this property that
the team makes better decisions

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:36.925
as a group than any individual would.

00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:39.002
I always kind of like,

00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:43.147
I get a little upset whenever
any media attention focuses on

00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:47.014
me, personally, and me leading
Facebook, much less a movie.

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:48.670
(laughs)

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.834
- It's been kind of a bad year, hasn't it?

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:52.777
- It turned out okay.

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:53.768
- Time, McAvinue

00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:55.041
- It turned out great.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:57.034
The Time thing was awesome.

00:04:57.034 --> 00:04:58.474
(audience laughs)

00:04:58.474 --> 00:05:00.909
That was really flattering, but like,

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.547
I think that it's one of
these things that the media

00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:04.507
systematically gets wrong is that

00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:06.391
this idea that it's a person.

00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:07.596
It's never a person.

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:10.787
It's always a team and
the most important thing,

00:05:10.787 --> 00:05:12.696
if you are an entrepreneur,

00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:15.859
trying to build something is
you need to build a really good

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:18.503
team and that's what I
spend a lot of my time on.

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:22.261
I spend probably, at least,
three hours a day with

00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:24.539
our core team at doing things.

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.213
I spend probably 25%
of my time recruiting,

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:30.990
finding good people,
both outside the company

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.905
and inside the company to
put in more impactful roles.

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:38.806
So there's this inherent
conflict in the system, though,

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:41.687
which is are we trying to
optimize newsfeed to give each

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:45.264
person, all of you guys, the
best experience when you're

00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:48.463
reading or we're trying to help
businesses to just reach as

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:49.987
many people as possible.

00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:52.798
And in every decision that
we make, we optimize for the

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:53.631
first.

00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:57.148
For making it so that when,
for the people, who we serve,

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.224
who use Facebook and are reading
newsfeed get the very best

00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:01.593
experience that they can.

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:04.534
That means that if a business
is sharing content that's

00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:07.028
going to be useful for
them, then we'll show that.

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:09.411
But that means that if the
business is sharing content that

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.758
isn't going to be useful for
them, we may not show that

00:06:11.758 --> 00:06:14.483
because it's probably more
important that they learn about

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:16.773
their friends who had a baby
and their baby is healthy.

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:19.438
So that's an important guiding
principal for how we think

00:06:19.438 --> 00:06:23.842
about this stuff, and as the
products continue to develop

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:27.436
there's just going to be more
people sharing more things and

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:30.440
we're going to continue to try
to do our best at showing the

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.557
best thing that we can,

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.478
understanding that there's
no way that we can,

00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:36.158
that a person will ever take
the time to go through every

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:39.479
one of the 1,500 things that
are shared with them every

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.973
single day, but that's kind
of how I think about organic

00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:46.376
reach and there are a lot
of pages that are going,

00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:49.093
that are doing quite successfully
and their organic reach is

00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:51.573
growing quite a bit because
they're delivering content to

00:06:51.573 --> 00:06:53.465
people that they really want.

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:55.084
So if you're a business owner
and you're thinking about how

00:06:55.084 --> 00:06:57.147
to use your free page on Facebook,

00:06:57.147 --> 00:07:00.616
I would just focus on trying
to publish really good content

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:02.506
that's going to be
compelling to your customers

00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:04.300
and the people who are following you.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.151
You know, I actually spend a
bunch of time analyzing and

00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:10.789
reflecting on why it was that
we were even able to do it

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.614
because, like all reason
suggests that we shouldn't have

00:07:14.614 --> 00:07:16.186
been able to do it, right?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.339
Because all these other companies
had way more engineering

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:19.256
power and,

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.041
and servers and time and
money and all this stuff

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.849
and I actually think that this
is a pretty instructive thing

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:29.107
for anything that you want
to go do because this is,

00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:31.216
the same property is going to
be true for anything that you

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:32.994
guys start, is that someone
else is going to have more

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.519
resources and be able to do it.

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.640
The reason why I think we
actually ended up being the ones

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.137
doing it is because we just
cared way more about it than

00:07:39.137 --> 00:07:39.970
everyone else.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.086
Right, so, there were always
projects at some of these other

00:07:43.086 --> 00:07:46.900
companies that were these
hobbies, but we always thought

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.231
that it was this really important
thing and really just like

00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:51.891
felt in our gut and our heart
that we wanted to do it,

00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:55.197
and you know, early on there
were all these skeptics saying

00:07:55.197 --> 00:07:56.808
that 'Oh, this can't be a business,"

00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:58.763
we didn't actually care that
much about it being a business

00:07:58.763 --> 00:08:01.774
early on, but a lot of the
reason why bigger companies

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:04.238
didn't invest in it was because
it wasn't clear that there

00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:05.443
was a model that would work for it.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.895
- [Interviewer] It seemed like a bad idea.

00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:09.295
- Yeah, and I actually think
that that's true for a lot of

00:08:09.295 --> 00:08:10.267
the best ideas.

00:08:10.267 --> 00:08:12.871
Where it is that it's not
that someone else can't do it,

00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:13.936
they actually can,

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.405
and the odds are sacked against you,

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:17.965
but I think often that belief
in the fact that you just care

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:21.309
so much about what you're
doing is the only thing that

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:22.868
kind of drives you to do it and,

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:24.919
you know, to be honest, that
kind of drives me to this day,

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:28.478
I mean, one of the big emphasis
points for the company right

00:08:28.478 --> 00:08:32.238
now is internet.org and for a
while we had this rallying cry

00:08:32.238 --> 00:08:35.984
of can we connect a billion
people and when we start talking

00:08:35.984 --> 00:08:37.834
about that we thought
that was crazy, right?

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:40.702
It was way bigger than any
service in the world that had

00:08:40.702 --> 00:08:43.869
been built and it was ten digits long.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.249
It felt crazy, we'd never get to that.

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:49.877
But then the thing is, as we
started to actually get closer

00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:51.593
to that, we took a step
back and we're like,

00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:53.906
'Alright, well, our mission
isn't actually to get 1 in 7

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:55.832
people in the world to be
connected, it's we want to connect

00:08:55.832 --> 00:08:56.665
everyone',

00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:59.486
so it's a big issue that only
around the third of the people

00:08:59.486 --> 00:09:01.672
in the world have access
to the internet and that's

00:09:01.672 --> 00:09:03.769
something that we think that
we can do something about and,

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:05.425
similar to early Facebook,

00:09:05.425 --> 00:09:07.544
there's no business model around this,

00:09:07.544 --> 00:09:09.899
I mean, all the people who have
all the money in the world,

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:12.057
I mean, it's not necessarily a fair thing,

00:09:12.057 --> 00:09:14.706
are already the people who are
on Facebook in the first 7th

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:18.293
of the world, but we just
believe really strongly that,

00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:19.745
it's like this is what we are here to do,

00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:21.932
this is what our company cares about,

00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:22.782
I care about it,

00:09:22.782 --> 00:09:23.736
the team cares about it,

00:09:23.736 --> 00:09:24.899
our culture cares about it,

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.499
so we're just going keep pushing
on it and I actually think

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:30.243
a lot of the reason why great
stuff gets built is because

00:09:30.243 --> 00:09:33.129
it's kind of irrational at the time,

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:34.561
but so it kind of selects where the people

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.165
who cares the most about it doing it.

00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:39.271
But the students around me
were really important, as well.

00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:40.104
Right, and

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.249
both in high school and in college,

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:46.402
I mean, the people who
started Facebook with me,

00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:47.685
a lot of people who are still with me,

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:51.178
running the company today are
people who I met when I was at

00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:54.177
Harvard and some of them were
my T.F.'s at Harvard, right,

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.485
and you know, when the professors were off

00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:59.530
writing papers, these were the
people who actually taught me

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.190
and then we hung out and we
had like social bonds and

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.690
academic bonds and

00:10:05.797 --> 00:10:07.969
I just, I wouldn't understate
the importance of that,

00:10:07.969 --> 00:10:11.553
and I mean, it's very tied into
my whole philosophy and the

00:10:11.553 --> 00:10:15.752
product that I spend my life
building Facebook because we

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:19.421
just believe that social
bonds are critical.

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:22.660
One way that I think about
the value that Facebook is

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.370
filling in the world is that, you know,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.465
you go through school
and, at least when I did,

00:10:26.465 --> 00:10:28.298
people just focused on

00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:31.628
academics, like achievement,

00:10:31.628 --> 00:10:34.612
different areas, and one of
the things that no one really

00:10:34.612 --> 00:10:37.889
ever taught me was like, having
friends is really valuable,

00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:39.917
not that I didn't have friends, but like,

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:41.903
although you know, the movie.

00:10:41.903 --> 00:10:42.736
- Right.
(audience laughs)

00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:45.219
- Of course you can see that, but,

00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:46.477
- But that first girlfriend.

00:10:46.477 --> 00:10:48.359
- But for sure, I don't
think anyone is like,

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:50.693
it's not like, okay, 3rd
grade we're going to like,

00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:53.927
now we're going to like teach
you that like hanging out with

00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:56.709
people is a very important
development, right,

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:57.850
and I don't know,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.541
I actually think that that is.

00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:02.218
I think that that's part of
the reason why sometimes people

00:11:02.218 --> 00:11:03.693
view Facebook as a waste of time,

00:11:03.693 --> 00:11:05.956
but I actually think it's this
extremely, socially valuable

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:08.589
utility and I know that I
wouldn't be where I am today

00:11:08.589 --> 00:11:12.176
without that aspect of my
life being as developed

00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:14.162
as the academic part.

00:11:14.162 --> 00:11:15.450
- Thank you so much for watching.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.463
I made this video because
Moxertons asked me to,

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:20.935
so if there's a famous
entrepreneur that you want me

00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:23.432
to profile next, leave
it in the comments below,

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:24.802
and I'll see what I can do.

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:27.379
I would also love to know
which of Mark Zuckerberg's Top

00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:30.341
10 Rules had the biggest meaning to you.

00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:32.523
Leave it in the comments, and
I will join the discussion.

00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:34.900
Thank you so much for
watching, continue to believe,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.733
and I'll see you soon.

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:45.156
- Hey everyone, yesterday
Governor Chris Christie

00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:47.927
challenged me to the ALS
Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:11:47.927 --> 00:11:51.110
Governor, I accept your challenge!

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.065
And after I dump this
bucket of ice on my head,

00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:55.504
I get to nominate three
new people to challenge,

00:11:55.504 --> 00:11:57.483
so I'm going to challenge Bill Gates,

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:59.878
my partner in Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg,

00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:02.856
and Netflix' founder
and CEO, Reed Hastings

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.839
to do this within the next 24 hours,

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.308
so you have 24 hours to do this
or you have to donate $100.

00:12:08.308 --> 00:12:10.141
All right, here we go!

00:12:15.647 --> 00:12:17.397
That was really cold.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.537
I think that that's why you
become an entrepreneur, right.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.186
Like, you don't get to pick
your partners a lot of the time.

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:35.603
But you do get to pick your organization,

00:12:37.142 --> 00:12:39.963
and you do get to pick who
you partner with, I mean,

00:12:39.963 --> 00:12:42.585
sometimes you may be forced by
circumstances to try to work

00:12:42.585 --> 00:12:45.899
with people who aren't your
top pick to have to work with,

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:49.232
but you get say over all this stuff, and

00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:52.387
I don't know,

00:12:52.387 --> 00:12:53.349
don't be a victim.

00:12:53.349 --> 00:12:54.567
Make it happen.

00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:56.247
But no, I think the real story is just,

00:12:56.247 --> 00:12:58.107
you know, a lot of hard work.

00:12:58.107 --> 00:13:00.218
I mean, that's a lot of
people who are engineers

00:13:00.218 --> 00:13:02.801
who kind of sit around and code

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.756
and were here because we're

00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:06.681
trying to help people connect

00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:08.588
and we believe deeply in this mission and,

00:13:08.588 --> 00:13:12.048
you know, our community today
has 1.35 billion people in it

00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:14.128
and there's 7 billion people in the world,

00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:15.633
we want to connect all of them.

00:13:15.633 --> 00:13:16.673
And that's why we're here.
