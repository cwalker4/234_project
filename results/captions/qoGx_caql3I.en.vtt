00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:19.850

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.498
(audience laughter)

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:23.031

00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:24.105

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.380
Nah, really, this afternoon, I

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.561
Yeah, the sign said, "Look

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.475
money back."

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:31.869
I gave a girl my check.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.703
She said, "Keep it. We're
gonna mail it back anyway."

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:37.256
(audience laughing)

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.067
I tell ya, I try to be a right guy.

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:42.178
I never get a fair shake, ya know?

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:43.572
I was gonna take a little vacation.

00:00:43.572 --> 00:00:45.209
I spoke to some guy who
works in a travel agency.

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.403
He told me I could spend
six nights in Puerto Rico.

00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:48.236
No days.

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:51.025
Just six nights in Puerto Rico.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:52.906
I said to him, what I do with myself days?

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:53.928
He said, "You can do whatever you want,

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.762
"Just keep outta Puerto Rico."

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:58.762
(audience laughing)

00:01:01.137 --> 00:01:03.587
I tell you, I don't get no
respect from anyone, you know?

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.131
No respect at all.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.780
One time I was drowning.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.334
I was yelling, help! Help!

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.632
A lifeguard came over,
said "Alright keep it down!

00:01:10.632 --> 00:01:11.696
"Keep it down!"

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:14.227
(audience laughing)

00:01:14.227 --> 00:01:16.712
I don't know, I tell ya,
sometimes I think back, ya know,

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.651
I remember things, I was
a kid it was the same way,

00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:19.484
I got no respect.

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:21.124
One time my ole' man
took me to a carnival.

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.330
We went to see the freaks.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.187
The owner looked at me,
he told my ole' man,

00:01:25.187 --> 00:01:27.811
"Get the kid out, he's
distracting from the show!"

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.040
(audience laughing)

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.326
The trouble with me is I'm too easy-going.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.266
I gotta coupla kids.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.102
I'm nice to them.

00:01:35.102 --> 00:01:36.716
They got smart answers too.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:38.283
The last time, I have a kid
who has a birthday, I took him

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:39.363
to Coney Island, ya know?

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:41.302
I asked him, You wanna
go in the crazy house?

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:43.508
He told me to save my
money, we'll be home soon.

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:47.002
(audience laughing)

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.268
I tell ya, I tried to figure things out.

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:49.417
I can't!

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:51.344
I been to every psychiatrist in New York.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.365
My whole life is psychiatrists.

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:55.617
When I was a kid, eight years
old, my parents they sent me

00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:57.149
to a child psychiatrist.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.752
I went for a year and a half.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.273
The kid didn't help me at all.

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:03.918
(audience laughing)

00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.623
Sometimes I say to
myself, what's going on?

00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:08.365
And lately I'm so mixed up,
I don't know what I'm doing

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:09.198
anymore.

00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:12.007
I know just last week
my gums were shrinking.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:13.973
I went to see my dentist he
told me I'm brushing my teeth

00:02:13.973 --> 00:02:15.222
with Preparation H.

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:18.222
(audience laughing)

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:29.387
My dentist, that's another
beauty, my dentist.

00:02:29.387 --> 00:02:32.231
It cost me 5,000 dollars to
get all new teeth put in.

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:33.798
Now he tells me, you need braces.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:36.798
(audience laughing)

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.610
I tell ya, I'm at the end of the line.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.002
I don't know who to believe anymore.

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:46.151
My doctor, David Ruben.

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:47.243
He wrote a best-selling book.

00:02:47.243 --> 00:02:49.402
Everything you always
wanted to know about sex.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:51.062
He left out the most important thing.

00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:52.223
Where to get it?

00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:53.419
(audience laughing)

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.499
(Lively band music)

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.499
(audience applause)

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:06.376
- Great crowd. Great crowd.

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:07.316
- Great crowd

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:09.162
- One place you can relax
over here, no kidding.

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:11.183
You got communication going for
you, that's the whole thing.

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:12.053
- Especially tonight.

00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:12.886
- Tonight.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:13.864
- Great communication.

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:14.991
You are too much.

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:16.117
- Silly mood tonight.

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:17.742
- I was backstage

00:03:17.742 --> 00:03:19.748
breaking up with the
whole thing, what the hey?

00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:21.735
- What the hey?

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:22.960
Remember all those old burlesque sketches?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.824
That's one of the funniest lines
I've heard you do in a long

00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:25.657
time.

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.804
You do a lot of funny things,
but getting the new teeth, and

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:29.336
the dentist tells you you need braces.

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:30.332
That's a funny, funny line.

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:31.412
- I thought of it right out there.

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:32.245
- Really?

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.487
- Good word, but that's a good line.

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:36.892
- I know, it's a funny line.

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:37.890
- Tell me about the book.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.028
Now that you're a big author.

00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:40.479
- Oh, this is a very interesting book.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.823
I've been four years of
research, and doing it.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:44.850
Year and a half of editing.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.688
- [Johnny] Can I read
the thing on the back?

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:46.521
I didn't see that.

00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:47.688
- Go right ahead, sure.

00:03:47.688 --> 00:03:49.058
- It says, "This book is ridiculous.

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:49.900
"This man is nuts.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.809
"He's an idiot. He should
never have written it.

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:52.642
"He deserves no respect.

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:53.475
"He ruined my life.

00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:54.308
"I cooked very good.

00:03:54.308 --> 00:03:55.972
"He has no business to open a restaurant.

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:58.085
"My children are very healthy
and happy from my cooking.

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.174
"In fact, as you read this,
I'm trying to make arrangements

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:01.263
"to have him put away.

00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:02.424
"Mrs. Dangerfield."

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:03.538
(audience laughing)

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:04.955
I didn't see that

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:06.359
- Yeah, it's a very interesting book.

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.217
I told you, four years of
research that went into it,

00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:12.815
and year and a half, and a
year and a half of editing,

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.939
and I want to thank my dear
friend, for helping editing it,

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.043

00:04:16.043 --> 00:04:16.876
(audience laughing)

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:17.709
He assisted me--

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.542
- Vinne Boom-Batz?

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.565
- He assisted me, in helping

00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:22.644
book, really.

00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:25.396
In fact, chapters four and
five are devoted completely

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:26.429
to heartburn.

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:27.799
- I didn't know that.

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:30.063
(Johnny laughing)

00:04:30.063 --> 00:04:32.049
- Johnny, I'll tell you this

- Vinnie Boom-Batz.

00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:47.269
He did the editing of the whole thing.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:48.720

It's very easy to do it.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.710
It's a very interesting book,
and it's got cartoons too, as

How do you make potato mounds?

00:05:19.324 --> 00:05:21.460
- You go to a chef in a
restaurant and pay him off.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.293
(Johnny laughing)

00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:23.320

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:33.848
- Give me the cake..

00:06:33.848 --> 00:06:35.136
- Give me the cake.

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:37.219
- Don't give me the cake.

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.314
- There's no place to go if we start that.

00:06:40.314 --> 00:06:43.251
If we start throwing this
cake, then the show must end.

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:46.251
(audience laughing)

00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:48.604
- Thank you very much.

00:06:48.604 --> 00:06:50.647
That's what I mean by
communication, you know?

00:06:50.647 --> 00:06:51.680
That's beautiful.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.934
- [Other Guest] I don't
like the look in his eye

00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:55.478
(laughing)

00:06:55.478 --> 00:06:56.576
- You want me to set this over here?

00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:58.248
- Now I'm gonna be nervous
for the whole show.

00:06:58.248 --> 00:06:59.316
I'ma get the cake in my face

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:00.187
- No, I wouldn't do that.

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:01.020
I would never do that

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.227
- [Other Guest] Not with
a candle in it anyway.

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:03.060
- No, no.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.957
(audience laughing)

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:04.790
That would smart.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.623
That could be

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:06.456
- Uh oh

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:07.843
- That could be up your
nose in Pittsburgh.

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:08.819
(audience laughing)

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.048
I would never hit anybody
with cake, unless you had

00:07:11.048 --> 00:07:14.043
pre-arranged on a sketch,
cause that is not fair to throw

00:07:14.043 --> 00:07:15.866
a cake, or do something
like that to somebody.

00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:17.073
So, I'll set it over here.

00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:20.073
(audience laughing)

00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:26.303
Now, I wonder what's gonna happen tonight?

00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:28.184
Uh oh, here comes the cake now.

00:07:28.184 --> 00:07:31.736
(audience laughing)

00:07:31.736 --> 00:07:33.835
Is it impolite to ask you how old you are?

00:07:33.835 --> 00:07:34.668
Do you care?

00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:35.501
Does it make any difference?

00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:36.334
- No, I tell the truth.

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:37.167
I tell the truth.

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:39.187
I'm 29, I don't never...

00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:41.521
No, I'm telling the truth,
I'm 51 years old today.

00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:42.354
That's the truth.

00:07:42.354 --> 00:07:43.344
- I didn't believe that.

00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:44.458
- No, I'm 51. That's true.

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:45.376
(audience applause)

00:07:45.376 --> 00:07:46.281
- You do not look it.

00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.152
I'm 51, I mean, I don't

00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:47.985
- I meant that.

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:48.835
You really don't look it.

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.549
- No, I can lose ten pounds,
and say, hey I'm 46, but

00:07:51.549 --> 00:07:53.099
what the heck, I mean, tell the truth.

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:53.932
What's the difference?

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:54.765
Know what I mean?

00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:55.598
That's what I feel.

00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:56.474
Be truthful.

00:07:56.474 --> 00:07:58.262
That's the only way you'll
find communication in life.

00:07:58.262 --> 00:08:01.152
(laughing)

00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:02.229
- You're on a communication
kick tonight, aren't ya?

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.087
- It's been bothering me
lately, the reason why you gotta

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:06.246
have communication, and this
is the one place you have it

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:07.079
here, you could relax.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:09.227
It's the only way you can
relax, if people can communicate

00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:10.609
together, and then get
along good, you know.

00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:11.442
- [Johnny] Well, we're
certainly doing that.

00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:12.962
- And that's why, that's important.

00:08:12.962 --> 00:08:14.230
- It really is.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.150
(audience laughing)

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.596
- In fact, the other night
I was talking to one of the

00:08:18.596 --> 00:08:20.763
Patrons over at my Bistro.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.028
He was engaged to this girl,
and they broke up because of

00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:29.021
lack of communication, plus
the fact that he had six dogs,

00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:29.962
and she didn't like dogs.

00:08:29.962 --> 00:08:31.936
I think men love animals more
than women, they really do.

00:08:31.936 --> 00:08:32.922
They really do.

00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:34.803
I mean look at all the guys who
are so happy when the rabbit

00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:36.173
lives, you know?

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:37.369
(audience laughing)

00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:39.261
- I never thought of that.

00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:41.212
- I mean, a lot of men and
women, they don't relate.

00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:42.988
You take an average guy
makes love to a girl.

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:45.969
When they're all finished,
what's the first thing comes into

00:08:45.969 --> 00:08:46.802
his mind?

00:08:46.802 --> 00:08:47.835
How do I get outta here?

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:50.835
(audience laughing)

00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:54.221
You gotta have communication.

00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:55.196
- That's communication, huh?

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:56.961
- And guys, guys, you can't
figure guys out either.

00:08:56.961 --> 00:08:58.807
I knew a guy who was going
with this gorgeous, beautiful

00:08:58.807 --> 00:08:59.805
girl.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.082
Left her for his wife and kids.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:04.173
(audience laughing)

00:09:04.173 --> 00:09:05.157
- [Johnny] Didn't know that

00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:06.853
- How else can you relax
without communication?

00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:07.740
- You gotta have communication.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.831
- You mention 42nd Street?

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:09.737
I go there occasionally.

00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:11.653
I find out sexy movies from
Denmark, you go in there, you

00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:13.568
just relax, forget everything.
It's like a different world.

00:09:13.568 --> 00:09:15.656
I saw one, last week, too,
you know? This was a little

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:18.732
different than a sexy movie.
They spoke in English, but the

00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:20.013
sex was dubbed in.

00:09:20.013 --> 00:09:22.316
(audience laughing)

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:23.152
- Unusual experience.

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:24.592
- Very, very unusual experience, yes.

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:25.425
- Well that's communication.

00:09:25.425 --> 00:09:26.258
You gotta communicate.

00:09:26.258 --> 00:09:27.091
- Yes, it is definitely.

00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.138
As a matter of fact, I knew it
was going to be a wild movie,

00:09:28.138 --> 00:09:30.600
cause when I walked in, a real
sexy place you know, a big

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.628
naked blonde showed me to my
seat, and I was so embarrassed.

00:09:34.628 --> 00:09:36.567
I told the guy, put on
some clothes, you know?

00:09:36.567 --> 00:09:40.201
(audience laughing)

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.021
I'm gonna look for some
communication, right after New

00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:43.901
Year's Eve, I'm going over to Hawaii.

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:45.771
I mentioned that at the
Friar's Club, with you and Ed.

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:47.408
I'm going to Hawaii, right
after New Year's Eve.

00:09:47.408 --> 00:09:48.241
New Year's Eve, you know
who's gonna work my place?

00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.074
- [Johnny] No.

00:09:49.074 --> 00:09:49.907
- Belly dancer.

00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:50.740
We have Little Athens.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.573
- Little Athens?

00:09:51.573 --> 00:09:52.406
- Little Athens.

00:09:52.406 --> 00:09:53.239
Belly dancer.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:56.265
Don't get fresh with Little
Athens, she calls her boyfriend

00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:57.774
Big Dominick, you know what that means?

00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:01.524
(audience laughing)

00:10:01.524 --> 00:10:02.476
- Only about this short, right?

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.123
- Yeah, but ya right away.

00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:07.468
But I'm going to Hawaii, and
as a matter of fact I'm gonna

00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:10.385
stay there at the Sheraton Waikiki.

00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:12.582
That's what I say, Why Kiki?

00:10:12.582 --> 00:10:14.301
(audience laughing)

00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:16.518
No, as matter of fact you are
very big in Hawaii, you know?

00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:17.351
- I didn't know that.

00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:20.175
- I spoke to the Italian
Vice Counsulate, who goes to

00:10:20.175 --> 00:10:21.008
Hawaii.

00:10:21.993 --> 00:10:24.649
Yeah, he's the Italian
Vice Counsulate of Italy.

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:26.936
He's in Hawaii, Guido Salmaggi,
I mention the name to you?

00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:27.970
- [Johnny] Guido Salmaggi?

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.803
- Guido Salmaggi.

00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:30.872
And he, he sung at my club
too, you know, he did.

00:10:30.872 --> 00:10:32.323
(audience laughing)

00:10:32.323 --> 00:10:33.435
He's the Italian Vice Consulate.

00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:34.805
Can I, he's watching.

00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:37.751
Can I just say hello, one second?

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.957
Hey Guido! Aloha!

00:10:39.957 --> 00:10:42.957
(audience laughing)

00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:46.458
He'll be there with his cousin Tullio.

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.291
- Tullio and Guido.

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:48.504
Tullio will be there.

00:10:48.504 --> 00:10:50.254
And his nephew Romeo.

00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:53.308
- You're really going to Hawaii?

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:54.141
You're gonna work there?

00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:54.974
- No, no I'm not going

00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:55.807
- No, no! You're not going to work there.

00:10:55.807 --> 00:10:56.640
- I'm going to vacation there.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.473
- [Johnny] Vacation there.

00:10:57.473 --> 00:10:58.306
- I don't work all the time.

00:10:58.306 --> 00:10:59.139
- Of course you can't.

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:00.551
- No sense in working all the time.

00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:02.757
(audience laughing)

00:11:02.757 --> 00:11:03.590
No sense in working all the time.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.568
I want a vacation, you know.

00:11:04.568 --> 00:11:06.426
A lot of people go for all
kinds of money for vacation.

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:07.459
I'm very simple.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.292
- Are ya?

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.893
- Just gimme a beach, a pair
of shorts, and a t-shirt, with

00:11:10.893 --> 00:11:11.726
a woman in them.
