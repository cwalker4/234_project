00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.580
Hi, it’s me, Tim Dodd, the Everyday Astronaut

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.650
Block 5.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.960
The elusive final iteration of SpaceX’s
Falcon 9 rocket is finally almost here.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.280
Although we’ve known quite a bit about what’s
going to be new with Block 5, the general

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.920
public has had a really hard time understanding
what, when, why, huh?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.020
Well today, we’re going to try and untangle
the confusion of block changes, revealing

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.940
the history of the Falcon 9 and how its evolved
into the fully and rapidly reusable rocket

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.020
we hope to see with this new ultimate Block
5 Falcon 9.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.120
We’re also going to do a side by side comparison
of all versions of Falcon 9 including Block

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.620
5 to show you just how much is changing before
SpaceX commits to freezing the Falcon 9 so

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.300
astronauts can finally ride on top.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.570
And lastly we’re going to explain why SpaceX
has been throwing away some of their older

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.920
Falcon 9’s before they get into this new
Block 5 booster.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.900
Ok. Time to do some untangling, let’s get started!

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.060
SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket has quickly evolved
from your standard run-of-the-mill rocket

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.409
into a very powerful, extremely capable and
awe inspiring autonomous landing and reusable

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.450
workhorse in under a decade.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.429
Today we’re going to take a deep dive into
the world of the Falcon 9, how it’s changed

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.210
and what this ultimate Block 5 version means
for SpaceX and hopefully the space industry

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.210
as a whole.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.829
Now previously, we’ve talked a little about
how the break-neck evolution of the Falcon

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.649
9 had led to the Falcon Heavy being delayed
for 5 years, and we’ve also talked about

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.779
how the nimble design and iteration philosophy
of SpaceX has led to the cancellation of propulsively

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.490
landing the Dragon capsule.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.109
So if you still have questions remaining after
watching this video, check out those other

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.819
two videos to potentially help fill in some
gaps.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.939
So first off, what the heck is a block?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.270
Well, a block is a large solid piece of hard
material, especially rock, stone, or wood,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.620
typically with flat surfaces on each side.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.660
SpaceX sometimes uses the term block as an
iteration change of their vehicles.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.359
This comes from the iterative and incremental
development principle.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.739
One of the earliest examples of this principle
is with NASA’s project Mercury and the Army’s

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.890
redstone rocket, both of which had some small
design tweaks as they applied lessons learned

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.890
from each flight.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.689
In terms of engineering and manufacturing,
it means you’ll do small iteration changes

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.070
to improve upon what you’ve learned, and
once you make changes to the production line,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.519
that’s considered a block change.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.980
There’s trade offs to this design philosophy.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.280
Some cons are the fact that there’s more
prototyping and more changes in manufacturing,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.519
which can be more expensive.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.810
This is kind of the opposite of the “if
it ain’t broke don’t fix it” philosophy

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.360
that’s sometimes adopted by the aerospace
industry.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.150
The idea’s that you don’t introduce any
new variables because new variables can lead

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.440
to new and yet unknown failures.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.200
SpaceX knows a thing or two about this.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.010
But Elon Musk has been known to embrace failure
stating in a 2005 interview with Fast Company

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.390
on the topic of SpaceX - “Failure is an
option here.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.290
If things are not failing, you are not innovating
enough.”

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.900
BUT, this philosophy also means the product
can evolve to be more current, fluid and potentially

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.989
much more capable.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.860
This is the reason why the Falcon 9 has evolved
to be over twice as capable as its initial

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.329
version and also why it can do that thing
that no other orbital class rocket can do…

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.230
what’s that called again?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.220
Oh yeah.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.720
LAND.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.540
So before we try and untangle the mess of
the block names, let’s go through the history

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.629
of major changes of the Falcon 9 and compare
them to the newest ultimate version, Block

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.829
5... this will help us be on the same page
when we try and get to that cluster-turd mess

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.689
that is block change nomenclature.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.920
The first Falcon 9 launched on June 4th, 2010
out of Cape Canaveral’s SLC-40.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.360
This first Falcon 9 was a baby compared to
today’s Falcon 9.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.110
Standing at 47.8 meters or 157 feet tall,
this first version was much more stout than

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.110
it’s newer siblings.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.749
It was also much less powerful, delivering
4,940 kN or 1.1 million pounds of thrust.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:04:00.060
The first version of the Falcon 9 was powered
by SpaceX’s Merlin 1C, which is a lot less

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.889
powerful than today’s Merlin 1D.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.230
Besides the fairly obvious differences like
in height, lack of landings legs, lack of

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.360
grid fins, there’s one more thing that makes
it easy to spot the first version of the Falcon 9

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.140
Those 9 Merlin 1C engines were configured
in a square pattern as opposed to what we’re

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.380
used to seeing today, the octagonal cluster
known as the octaweb.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.140
We’ll talk more about that in a second.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.210
This first version of the Falcon 9 only flew
five times with its last launch on March 1st,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.270
2013 carrying a Dragon capsule to the International
Space Station for CRS-2.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.090
A little more than 6 months later, we got
the first launch of an upgraded Falcon 9,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.360
sometimes called v1.1, on September 29th,
2013.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.330
This was also the first launch from SpaceX’s
west coast launch site, SLC-4E at Vandenberg

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.350
Air Force Base in California.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.480
This second version grew substantially to
68.4 meters or 224 feet tall, which is up

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.280
a whopping 40% or so from its previous 47.8
meters or 157 feet tall.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.880
However it did remain that exact same diameter
at 3.66 meters or 12 feet wide.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.960
Perhaps the biggest upgrade to this Falcon
9 was in thrust.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.770
Due to the much upgraded Merlin 1D engine,
the Falcon 9 was now producing almost 30%

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.480
more thrust, achieving 5,880 kN’s or 1.3
million pounds of thrust.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.360
This second version introduced the new octaweb

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.680
layout of the 9 merlin engines on the first stage.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.560
SpaceX changed to an octaweb design so they
could just machine the same 8 pieces to hold

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.000
onto each engine instead of needing separate
corner and edge pieces, allowing for easier

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.080
and more common manufacturing as well as easier
installation of

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.400
the new engines with more commonality.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.510
But perhaps the biggest and most exciting
change this new version of the Falcon 9 introduced

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.470
was the hardware necessary to land the first
stage.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.500
Due to the increased performance of the Falcon
9, it was now capable of putting its payload

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.850
into orbit, and have enough fuel remaining
to land the first stage using its engines

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.550
to come to a controlled touchdown.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.530
Besides SpaceX doing a few tests of supersonic
retropropulsion or firing its main engines

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.510
into the oncoming atmosphere at supersonic
speeds, they also started to play around with

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.120
trying to softly land the first stage in the
ocean.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.250
But the most obvious addition was on CRS-3
which launched on April 18th, 2014.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.030
This was the first rocket that featured landing
legs.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.790
Something that people genuinely laughed at.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.390
Trust me, I was there!

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.720
My first ever launch was CRS-3, and to me,
I was so excited to

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.960
see a rocket with landing legs!

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.000
How inspiring and amazing I thought.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.390
But other people who were at the press site
were literally laughing at the concept, saying

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.050
it was just impossible and clearly a waste
of time.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.750
Later SpaceX added grid-fins to the interstage
portion of the rocket in order to be able

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.980
to precisely control descent through the atmosphere.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.890
They first appeared on CRS-5 which launched
on January 10th, 2015 and was the first attempt

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.750
at landing on the autonomous spaceport drone
ship, Just Read the Instructions.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.720
Although they got close, no v1.1 Falcon 9
ever landed.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.570
SpaceX continued to tweak and refine this
version of the Falcon 9 until they experienced

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.080
their first in flight failure of the Falcon
9 on June 28th, 2015 during the CRS-7 mission

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.220
at T + 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.620
SpaceX stood down to find the cause of the
issue and took this time to change over to

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.090
the penultimate version of the Falcon 9, sometimes
called v1.2 or Full Thrust.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.780
The name’s kind of confusing, like that
time SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell called

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.020
it that and more.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020
She said

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.560
“I don't know what we're going to call it.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.020
Enhanced Falcon 9, Falcon 9 v1.2, Full-Performance
Falcon 9”

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.000
This upgraded version first flew on December
21st, 2015 with the historic OG2 launch out

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.840
of SLC-40 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.520
The reason this particular launch is considered
historic is because it’s the first launch

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.300
that also had a successful landing of an orbital
class booster.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.800
Something I couldn’t believe happened.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.870
"Oh my god!" (cheering)

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.040
This version featured another healthy set
of upgrades including enough additional performance

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.960
to land the Falcon 9 from an even more energetic
and crazy geostationary launch profile.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.490
Some of the main changes is the Falcon 9 grew
again, growing to 70 meters or 230 feet tall,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:04.710
and the thrust increased to a whopping 7,600
kN or 1.7 million pounds of thrust.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.140
Most of this thrust upgrade was the result
of SpaceX choosing to sub-cool the liquid

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.990
oxygen and cool the RP-1 rocket fuel.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.690
This increases their densities, allowing more
to be contained in the same volume and resulting

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.890
in improved overall performance.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.960
SpaceX also upgraded the landing legs, the
interstage, the vacuum engine, the octaweb,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.320
the stage separator and a host of structural
and weight saving changes.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.770
But here’s where things get extra tricky.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.710
Since then, this version seems to be going
through constant small tweaks here and there,

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.000
including many things that will appear later
on Block 5.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.380
One of the most obvious things we’ve seen
pop up on a few of these v1.2 boosters are

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.020
those awesome titanium grid fins, which are
also super expensive considering they’re

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.170
the largest single piece of forged titanium
ever made.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.280
But now, it’s time we throw in the newest
and ultimate Falcon 9, Block 5.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.860
For once in its life, the Falcon 9 isn’t
going to grow any taller.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.010
It’s finally done with its growth spurts
I guess.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.520
Well maybe, Elon has hinted that they could
potentially stretch the upper stage a little

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520
bit later.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.680
Even if it doesn’t grow any taller, it will
be SUPER easy to spot the difference.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.641
Block 5 features a very distinctive black
interstage, black landing legs, titanium grid

00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:15.770
fins and black raceway, that pipe looking
things that run the length of the booster

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.940
that protects the electrical connections and
plumbing.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.031
This new version will feature a thrust upgrade
of around 7% for their Merlin engines, bringing

00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:30.100
the total to 8,130 kN or 1.8 million pounds
of thrust thanks to even more refined tuning.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.170
SpaceX also upgraded the turbines inside the
turbo pumps that power the engines.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.090
SpaceX and NASA noticed there were some small
microfractures that would occur after tearing

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.960
down recovered engines.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.870
NASA requested SpaceX find a fix, so SpaceX
addressed the issue.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.781
But a fun note to remember is the Falcon 9
is the only rocket engine outside of the Space

00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:51.840
Shuttle where engineers have been able to
tear the engine down after it’s full flight

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.900
to space.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.080
So perhaps all other turbopump turbines get
these micro cracks, but we’ve just never

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.490
recovered them to witness!

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.460
The main purpose of this Block 5 variant isn’t
really to be more powerful, but it’s really

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.920
just to apply all the lessons learned from
the previous 50 plus launches of the Falcon 9.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.720
For instance the rocket can now optimize it’s
angle of attack on landing thanks to those

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.340
awesome titanium grid fins and refined flight
control system.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.160
Oh, and those titanium grid fins are super
heat tolerant, and don’t require ablative

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.480
paint and catch fire like the previous aluminum
ones, meaning they can be reused over and over.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.190
They also coated the entire vehicle in a thermal
protective coating which should help limit

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.920
reentry heating damage and they also made
reusable and easily replaceable heat shields

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.730
at the base of the rocket that help protect
the engine and the plumbing.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.560
The landing legs will now be able to be retracted
allowing for easy shipping and rapid recovery.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.360
The previous landing legs actually had to
be unbolted before they could ship each landed core.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.670
SpaceX is also introducing a new and improved
composite overwrap pressure vessel or COPV.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.730
A COPV failure is what caused that pad anomaly
with AMOS-6 on September 1st, 2016.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:08.160
All and all, Block 5 should be the final iteration
of the Falcon 9, allowing for multiple reuses,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.690
and rapid turn around, hopefully even under
48 hours with no refurbishment.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.910
We’ll talk more about that in a minute…..

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.230
Ok… so now it’s time to let the untangling
begin!

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.300
Remember at the intro when I said “we’re
going to try and untangle the mess with the

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.300
blocks?”

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.060
Well, I can officially say the deeper I got
into this, the more confusing it got.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.029
With the help of my Patreon members in our
discord channel, we scoured every inch of

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:33.270
the internet to truly find an answer.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.420
We checked with FAA fillings, the FCC filings,
wikipedia sources, the spacex subreddit’s

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.070
wikipedia, searched for every tweet with Elon
or SpaceX talking about blocks or versions,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:48.870
every discussion on nasaspaceflight.com, countless
other sources and I can honestly say I’m

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.870
still really confused.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.480
But I’m going to explain the two major trains
of thought.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.120
One group of people think the Falcon 9 went
like this.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:03.350
Falcon 9 v1.0 or block 1, Falcon 9 v1.1 or
block 2, Falcon 9 v1.2 Full thrust or block

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:09.170
3 and block IV was testing out parts of Block
5 and then lastly Block 5 is it all put together.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.279
And there's another group of people and evidence
that points to it being more like this which

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.470
I actually think has a little more weight
to it.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.810
There's Falcon 9 V1.0.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.460
Falcon 9 V1.1 which actually had two blocks.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.130
Then there's Falcon 9 Full Thrust which actually
has 5 blocks.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:30.270
The first block 1 of full thrust was that
OG2 mission and since then we’ve seen 2,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.640
3, and 4 floating around and the final Block
5 will be the fifth version

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.320
of the full thrust variant.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.320
And here’s my final conclusion on this topic.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.160
I don’t know.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.060
But what I DO know is that SpaceX doesn’t owe
us any naming scheme.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.760
They have a lot of proprietary and internal
information and there’s a good chance they

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.260
don’t even have blocks or names themselves!

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.089
The way SpaceX tends to do iteration changes
means they just simply might not have hard

00:12:56.089 --> 00:13:00.650
numbers or naming schemes and each rocket
is almost unique as they evolve and are not

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.940
beholden to simple layman block naming.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.660
That being said, I have personally received
multiple reports that Block 5 is the 5th iteration

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.840
of the “Full Thrust” variant…

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.800
And however we get to that point, tomato tomato,
I’m just happy to call it block 5 and move on

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.440
So speaking of all of this rapid evolution
and design changes, SpaceX is required by

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.080
NASA to fly the Falcon 9 Block 5 7 times without
changing anything before it’s qualified

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.090
for human flight.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.850
They’re calling it a freeze of the design.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.460
They don’t want SpaceX doing any tweaking
that might lead to unforeseen incidents.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.980
(sobbing)

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.210
So expect things to settle down here for a
bit.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.050
Besides that, Elon mentioned now that Block
5 is the last major version of the Falcon

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.920
9, SpaceX plans to put all their engineering
efforts into their upcoming Big Falcon Rocket

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.000
or BFR.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.470
Now lastly, we need to help explain why SpaceX
has been throwing rockets away lately instead

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:56.260
of landing them, even having grid fins and
landing legs on some that are being expended.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.270
Well remember that whole Block 5 is meant
to be rapidly reusable thing?

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:05.850
With Block 5 SpaceX hopes to be able to fly
the Falcon 9 10 times without refurbishment.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.270
They hope to just do an inspection and then
fly again with each booster capable of around

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.710
100 flights without requiring significant
refurbishment.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.630
I really hope that's the case!

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.320
Oh hey guys it's me, Tim.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.850
You might not recognize me without the spacesuit
on.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.220
What I meant to say there was they're hoping
to get 10 times before they refurbish the

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.080
vehicle and 100 uses all together before the
vehicle's lifespan is over.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.540
I just didn't want to have to reshoot it.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.420
That being said, the non Block 5 full thrust
variants were never intended to be flown more

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.750
than once or twice without significant refurbishment
which means it’s not very cost effective

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.839
to continue to fly them.

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:46.440
There’s a lot to take into account including
the cost of recovery.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.490
When SpaceX sends the droneship out with a
support crew, that stuff isn’t free.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.940
As a matter of fact, when you factor in the
gas, the support crew, the dock recovery crew,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.910
the transportation etc etc etc, it could easily
add up to a million dollars or MORE.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.620
With these rockets not being designed to refly
more than once, it’s just an additional

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.930
cost to go retrieve them.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.779
There’s also the thought that SpaceX is
expending these boosters to test the extremes

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:14.050
of the vehicle, including maximizing how aggressively
they can land and how steep their angle of

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.830
attack can be as they reenter.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.690
Data is valuable, and at some point, potentially
a lot more valuable than having another trophy

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.070
piece collecting dust.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.360
And the only way you can truly test these
aggressive reentry and landing profiles is

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.170
with grid fins and landing legs to ensure
that all variables are the same.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.330
A full dress rehearsal if you will.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.780
Does that help clear the air at all?

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.160
Or did I just make this a whole lot more confusing.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.260
What are your thoughts?

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.410
Are you sad to see that all white Falcon 9
die off?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.930
Or are you looking forward to seeing Block 5 fly and
hopefully flying over and over again?

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.350
Let me know your thoughts in the comments
below!

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:51.440
In an upcoming video I’ll be comparing the
Block 5 Falcon 9 with ULA’s Atlas V. A showdown

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.450
of the two rockets that will be taking astronauts
to the International Space Station hopefully

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.050
by the end of 2018.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.120
Fingers crossed!

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120
So stay tuned.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.600
