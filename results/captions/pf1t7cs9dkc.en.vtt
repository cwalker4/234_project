00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:07.439
Floods. They are clearly
catastrophic, traumatic events,

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:09.041
although they have also
been responsible

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.876
for one of the most
memorable clips

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:12.879
in the history
of broadcast news.

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:14.514 line:0%
Good morning.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:16.683 line:0%
Well, obviously we're getting
a nice break from the rain,

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.418 line:0%
but not the flooding.

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:19.952 line:0%
-This is essentially now...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.655 line:0%
...a part of the Passaic River
in this neighborhood.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.257
That's it.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.726
Fuck James Cameron
and fuck<i> Titanic,</i>

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.394
because that is now officially

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.096
the greatest boat disaster
ever captured on film.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.198
It's over.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.368
Now, floods were
everywhere this summer.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.438
Think of them as the "Despacito"
of natural disasters.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.406
Persistent, ubiquitous,

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.675
and absolutely no fault
of the Puerto Rican government.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.044
And floods are
always threatening.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.646
Ninety percent of all
natural disasters in the U.S.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:48.815
involve a flood.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.050
Which is, I assume,
the reason that FEMA's website

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.351
once referred to flooding as

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.320
"America's number-one
natural hazard,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.421
exclamation mark."

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.024
Which is a pretty weird
tone to take

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.692
when describing
something horrible.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.162
It's like saying, "Boils:
America's number-one

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.262
staph infection!"

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:07.266
Or "Parks: America's number-one
place to die unnoticed!"

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.903
And floods are only going
to get worse

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.104
due to climate change.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.205
And I know that there are people
who will dispute that,

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.141
and we just don't
have time tonight

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.677
to litigate whether
extreme-weather events

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.245
are exacerbated
by climate change.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.180
So for now, let's just say...

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.581 line:0%
(DRAMATIC MALE VOICE OVER)

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.649
-Yeah.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.352
They just definitely are.
I mean...

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.221
-Sure, sure...
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.490
...it is-- It is
a complicated issue,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.992
and we may not have
definitive proof

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.527
until the late 1980s.

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.897
But-- But, while floods
are often referred to

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.165
as "natural disasters,"

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.800
the truth is the damage they do
is often to some extent

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.069
within our control.

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:44.704
Because we have made
certain decisions

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.639
that put and keep
people and property

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.241
in the path of flooding.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.409
And that is what
this story is about.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.944
And before we go any further,

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.913
let's acknowledge
that people live near water

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:54.947
for all sorts of reasons.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.515
For some, it's where
their families have lived

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.318
for generations, or a necessity
for the work that they do.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:00.853
And for others, it's a luxury.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.023
And living next to the water
is undoubtedly attractive,

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.225
despite the risks,
like flooding,

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.160
or stepping on pointy seashells,

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.863
or mistakenly giving
a Tostito to a seagull

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:12.264
without realizing that
that means

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.500
you will now spend
the rest of your life haunted

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.502
by a Tostito-addicted seagull.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.771
The point is,
whatever the reason

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.039
-to live by the water...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.007
-(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)
-many do-- Oh, for fuck's sake!

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.478
You've got to be kidding!
I don't have any Tostitos!

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.847
I've been telling you that
for six years!

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.782
Look, no Tostitos!

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.917
No Tostitos! Get out of here.

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:34.353
Get out of here,
you flying beach rat.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.723
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)
-Sorry.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:41.594
The point is,

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.363
the dangers
of waterfront living are real.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.032
But many people, like this man,

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.334
who lives on the water
in Tampa Bay,

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.135
feel the benefits outweigh
the risks.

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:52.839
REPORTER:<i> Mark knows
 that life here is tenuous.</i>

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.440
<i> But he doesn't dwell on it.</i>

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.909
Every morning when I walk out
to get the paper,

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.545
I see dolphins frolicking
in the bayou,

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.347
and Roseate spoonbills

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.816
<i> walking around the edge
 of the bayou, so...</i>

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.953
<i> it tends to make you forget
about all those sorts of things.</i>

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.955
Sure, I can imagine
that seeing a Roseate spoonbill

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:11.290
would take your mind off things,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.759
because you're spending
your whole day

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.527
trying to figure out
how a flamingo

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.095
could have gotten its
stupid bird face

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.496
stuck into a panini press.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:19.498
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'm just saying,

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.668
even people who like birds
don't like this bird.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.537
The Audubon society,

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.472
an organization
whose entire purpose

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.574
is to champion birds,
says they are, quote,

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.510
"Gorgeous at a distance
and bizarre up close."

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.611
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.781
Which is like the
American Kennel Club saying,

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.683
"We celebrate all dogs and honor
them as man's best friend,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.919
but the Dandy Dinmont
has a trash personality,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.056
and looks like a scotty
fucked Phil Spector.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.024
And look, look...

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:48.093
If you are literally overlooking
a bayou like that guy

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.363
you are probably aware
that flooding is a risk.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.001
But not every flood-prone area
is directly along the coast,

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.203
and sometimes aggressive
development

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:58.771
can exacerbate
the risk of flooding,

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.373
even considerably inland.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.607
Just look at Houston,

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.509
which was recently rocked
by Harvey.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.712 line:0%
REPORTER 2:<i> The metro area's
 development has exploded.</i>

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.147
<i>One study found the Houston area</i>

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:11.617
<i> has added 25 percent
 more pavement over 15 years,</i>

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.786 line:0%
<i> replacing soil-rich wetlands
 that could absorb water</i>

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.089 line:0%
<i>with concrete-covered suburbia.</i>

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.626
Exactly, and that made Harvey's
damage significantly worse.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.562
Concrete isn't good
at absorbing water.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:25.564
That is why people don't
dry off at the beach

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:27.666
by rolling around
in the parking lot.

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:31.537
But it's not just global warming
or unchecked growth

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.973
that have put more people
in risky, flood-prone areas.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.274
It's also the fact that

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:38.010
it's frequently only possible
for people to take that risk

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.812
because they have
flood insurance.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.647
Just look at<i> Buying the Beach.</i>

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.048
It's a<i> House Hunters</i> type show

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:45.517
for people who want to live
near the water. And one episode

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.820
featured two brothers
named Mitch and Daniel

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.888
<i> arguing over a particular
 beach house</i>

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.357
<i> which led to this exchange...</i>

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.360 line:0%
What do you think
about the island house, Mitch?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.696 line:0%
MITCH:
<i> Well, I think there was a lot
of good and a lot of bad on it.</i>

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.831
<i> Right off those steps into
 the beach, can't be beat.</i>

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.333
DANIEL:<i> We are really close
 to the water.</i>

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.334
<i> That's just another thing
 that's got me concerned.</i>

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:04.170 line:0%
Well, that's what
insurance is for.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.007
"That's what insurance is for."

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.342
That may be
the most reckless statement

00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:11.510
ever said on a boat.

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:13.178
And I'm very much including,

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:15.214
"I can definitely
make this shot work."

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:18.751
And, "Hey! Let's feed
these gulls some Tostitos."

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.187
-(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)
-I don't have any!

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:24.256
All I did was said the word.
Get out of here!

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:26.926
No Tostitos! No Tostitos!

00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:29.796
But Mitch-- No Tostitos!

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.832
But-- But Mitch...
Mitch isn't wrong.

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:37.269
That if they bought that house,
they could get flood insurance

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:38.437
and surprisingly cheaply.

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.406
And it's worth taking some time
to understand why

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.807
that is the case, because

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.543
unlike other forms
of homeowner's insurance,

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.380
flood protection is actually
underwritten by the government,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.948
through the NFIP,

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.716
or National
Flood Insurance Program.

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:54.086
It started nearly 50 years ago,
after historic floods

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.155
wiped out many people's
homes in the 1960s,

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.456
and the government
back then realized

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:58.558
that there was
a real problem.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:01.227
Insurance companies
wouldn't cover floods

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.329
at an affordable cost,
because it was too risky,

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.798
so because of that,
the government was spending

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.700
way too much
on disaster relief,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.703
so they stepped in,
and created the NFIP,

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:13.205
which offered significantly
discounted insurance

00:06:13.572 --> 00:06:15.974
to encourage people to buy it,
and that sounds great,

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:19.245
but crucially, the aim
at the time was not

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:22.682
that people would be staying
in at-risk homes permanently,

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.984
as the program's current
administrator explains.

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.152 line:0%
They presumed
that if we told

00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:30.022 line:0%
people they were at risk,
they would move.

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:33.725 line:0%
They presumed that
over the life of the program,

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.696 line:0%
those discounts wouldn't need
to be continued,

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:38.964 line:0%
and they presumed they wouldn't
need to be continued because

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.499 line:0%
once people knew
they had the risk,

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:41.601 line:0%
they would move out.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:44.269 line:0%
That has not proven true.

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:48.307
No, but of course it hasn't,
because that's not how

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:49.475
-people work.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.745
We will gladly accept huge risks
to our personal safety

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.515
for the sake of a discount,
that was the entire premise

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:57.316
behind the McDonald's
dollar menu.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:58.417
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:00.619
A-- and that is just one
of the many flaws

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:02.889
with how this well-intentioned
program was designed,

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.424
because everything about it
from who participates

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:06.858
to where the money goes,

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:09.094
to the incentives it creates,
needs fixing.

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:12.464
And let's start with the fact
that eligibility for the program

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:14.500
is determined
through flood plain maps.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.069
You are required
to buy flood insurance

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:19.539
if you have
a federally-backed mortgage

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.341
and FEMA's maps show
that you live in a risky area.

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:25.210
Unfortunately, the mandate
has been poorly enforced,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.247
meaning that lots of people
don't buy insurance who should.

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:30.983
And the maps themselves
can be both out of date

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.584
and wildly inaccurate.

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:35.521
In fact,
just days before Harvey struck,

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.456
a study of Houston
area flood maps

00:07:37.556 --> 00:07:39.791
was published and
the results were alarming.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.294 line:0%
REPORTER 3:
<i> Over the course of a decade,</i>

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.563 line:0%
<i> researchers at Rice University
 and Texas A&amp;M Galveston</i>

00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:47.032 line:0%
<i> studied one section
 of southeast Harris County.</i>

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:48.901 line:0%
<i> They found FEMA's
 flood plain maps</i>

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:52.371 line:0%
<i> missed about 75 percent
of the damages from the storms--</i>

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:55.775
Seventy-five percent.
At that point, you might as well

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.644
predict floods by having
blindfolded six-year-olds

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:01.046
pin little cardboard puddles
onto city maps

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:02.147
at birthday parties.

00:08:02.814 --> 00:08:04.884
But even if all the maps
were perfect,

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.152
there would be another flaw
with the NFIP,

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.253
which is how it's administered.

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:09.989
You see, typically
the government

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:11.690
doesn't directly insure you.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.226
Instead, it pays
private insurance companies

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.528
a fee for every policy
they sell.

00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:17.629
But not just that.

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.832
The federal government
is then responsible

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.333
for covering any losses,

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.803
which is a pretty
fucking sweet deal

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.003
for those companies.

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:27.540
They take none of the risk,
and yet they get

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.374
all the rewards, but it gets
even worse,

00:08:29.474 --> 00:08:32.611
because they also get paid
for each claim they handle.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.746
And when<i> Frontline</i>
crunched some of the numbers,

00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:36.915
and presented them
to a former head of the program,

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.517
they found something shocking.

00:08:39.117 --> 00:08:41.219
REPORTER 4:<i> There was one
 number that really jumped out.</i>

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.889
<i> With all the claims
 in the wake of Sandy,</i>

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.393
<i> the profits were more than
 $400 million.</i>

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.329 line:0%
Because they're handling
a lot of claims that year

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.998 line:0%
and they get-- make a lot of
money when they handle claims.

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.935
When a big storm hits then,
they make more money.

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:58.671
Yeah, at the very time
you need them to make less money

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:01.773
if anything, because-- because
of-- the burden

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:03.342
is gonna be borne
by the taxpayers,

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:04.543
they make a killing.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.877
That's true.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.313
For insurance companies,
the bigger the disaster,

00:09:08.413 --> 00:09:09.681
the more they stand to profit.

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.917
And that is a business model
not usually seen

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:13.885
outside
of Nicholas Cage's career.

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:14.987
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.722
(STAMMERS) And while
the insurance industry

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.957
may dispute exactly
how much profit they make,

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:21.393
the fact remains that
the government and the taxpayer

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:24.063
are definitely the ones
eating the losses,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.464
which is one of the reasons why

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.366
even before
these latest hurricanes,

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.770
the program was
$25 billion in debt,

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.772
and there are not enough
Roseate spoonbills in the world

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:36.375
to take your mind off that,
and just to be clear,

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:39.678
there are exactly enough
Roseate spoonbills in the world.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.046
I-- I'm just saying,

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.816
do we all really need
more of this?

00:09:44.516 --> 00:09:46.452

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.429
And look,
there is a good argument to make

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:59.998
that helping people stay
in their homes after a disaster

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:01.400
is what government is for.

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.236
But remember, a big chunk
of that money

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:06.538
is just going
to the insurance companies

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.174
and another shockingly big chunk
of that money

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:10.742
goes to very few homes.

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:12.478
For instance,
along the Gulf Coast

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:15.314
in Florida, just one percent
of properties covered

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:19.451
by the NFIP have accounted
for a quarter of flood claims.

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:20.919
These are called... (STAMMERS)

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:22.654
...so-called
"Repetitive-loss properties."

00:10:22.754 --> 00:10:24.657
Now, they are homes
that can flood over and over

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:27.726
and over again, getting payments
each and every time.

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:30.162
And some of them
are costing us a fortune.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:51.984
Because if nothing else,
if your house floods 40 times,

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:54.120
Mother Nature is sending you
a pretty clear message,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.455
and that message is,
"Hey, would you mind leaving?

And some parts of the country

00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:03.362
have particularly
extreme examples of this.

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:05.130
Now, you remember
Mitch and Daniel?

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:07.099
The pastel deathtrap
that they were looking at

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.268
is on a place
called Dauphin Island,

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:11.803
where over the past two decades,
homeowners have paid

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:15.974
just $9.3 million in premiums
into the NFIP,

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:19.678
but they've received
$72.2 million in payments

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:21.046
for their damaged homes.

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:24.249
It is so bad that the island
got written up by<i> Bloomberg</i>

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.652
under the headline,
"Love of Coastal Living

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:30.488
And at first glance,
we thought, "Hold on.

Isn't that
the exact same eyesore

Well, the good news is,
it's actually not.

The bad news is,

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.833
it's literally the house
next door

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:43.802

the repetitive loss properties,
which you shouldn't,

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:14.566
there is another issue,
and that is that nearly one

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:17.302
out of every five homes
covered under the NFIP

00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:18.970
is a second home.

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.140
And because the program
isn't means tested,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.676
the benefits frequently go
to some wealthy individual's

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.815
I think that he put a camera
on a long delay timer,

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:39.251
then sprinted
for a full 45 seconds

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:40.852
back to the deck of his house,

whispering
"hurry, hurry, hurry!"

00:13:42.754 --> 00:13:45.490
to himself the entire time,
and got in position

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.359
just in time for that photo
to happen.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.361
That is the only scientifically
possible explanation.

00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:53.031
We debated this
the entire fucking week

Here's the-- here's the thing.

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:04.043
If... If you choose to build
something in a risky place

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:05.845
like John Stossel's

-bottom's-only beach mistake,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.582
you should absolutely
be allowed to do that,

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:12.984
but you shouldn't expect
the government

00:14:13.084 --> 00:14:16.722
to repeatedly help you rebuild
when things inevitably go wrong.

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.825
However, the vast majority,
the vast majority here

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.394
of NFIP beneficiaries
are not wealthy,

00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:23.862
or second homeowners.

00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:27.232
They often really need this
program and cannot afford

00:14:27.332 --> 00:14:28.233
for it to go under.

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:30.301
And, for those stuck in
repetitive loss properties,

00:14:30.602 --> 00:14:33.238
it is easy for anyone to just
say, "They should move,

00:14:33.338 --> 00:14:34.573
they should just move."

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:36.608

difficult than that

00:14:36.708 --> 00:14:38.043
as this Kentucky woman,

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.919 line:0%
repetitive floods in it?

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:49.287
Who would want to buy a house?

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:51.957
We have neighbors that have had
their houses up for sale

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.425
for two and three years

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:56.761
and haven't even had anyone
come and view the house.

00:14:56.861 --> 00:15:01.600
We need a buy out from FEMA
or from whoever it is that

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.802
is responsible for this.

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:06.905
Right, and her decision to try
and leave that home

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:08.206
could not have
been easy because

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:10.542
you don't want to throw out
the baby with the floodwater.

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:13.478
But, at a certain point,
the responsible thing to do

00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:16.214
is to get a better,
more water-resistant baby.

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:18.817
Which is, incidentally,
also the title of Britain's

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:20.919
best-selling book on teaching
children to swim.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:21.853
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:15:22.253 --> 00:15:24.489
Now, unfortunately, our buy-out
programs are hugely

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.991
underfunded
and prohibitively slow.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.628
It can take years for buy-outs
to get approved,

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:32.231
by which point, homeowner's have
probably had to

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.766
rebuild their house at the
government's expense

00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:36.835
and it may have
already flooded again.

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:38.770
So, essentially,
a government program

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.173
that was supposed to help people
in flooded homes

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.042
is sometimes trapping them
inside them indefinitely.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.845
And trapping people in
structurally-unsound homes

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.580
isn't what
the government is for,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.615
it's what buying
the beach is for.

00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:51.617
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:54.719
No, there just has to be
a better way here,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.822
and there are some key
things that we can do

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:57.756
to improve this program.

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.291
We can do things like
means-test it

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:02.194
and eventually get rid
of discounts for second homes

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:04.529
and gradually increase
the insurance rates

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:07.132
on some properties so that they
reflect actual risk.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:09.734
Unfortunately, the last time
that Congress tried

00:16:09.834 --> 00:16:11.270
a major reform of the NFIP

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.539
with the Biggert-Waters Act
of 2012,

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.841
the result was that many
people's rates skyrocketed

00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:20.112
overnight and politicians were
so spooked by angry constituents

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:23.148
they significantly scaled back
many of the reforms.

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:26.451
And, I'm not saying that this
will ever be politically easy.

00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:29.855
Because even if you do properly
fund and streamline

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:32.524
a buy-out scheme, there are
still going to be cases

00:16:32.724 --> 00:16:34.492
where people just want
to stay put.

00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:37.462
Right here in New York,
there is a low-line community

00:16:37.562 --> 00:16:40.065
called "Broad Channel,"
where the streets can flood

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.599
twice a month.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.236
Its residents fought against
those rate increases

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:47.839
a few years ago and many of them
have no interest in leaving.

00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:50.475
No, the neighborhood's
too great then.

00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:54.012 line:0%
Listen, my whole house got
destroyed by Sandy and I--

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.615
you know,
I redid my whole house.

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.584
I-- You know, people were like,
"You're crazy, you should move."

00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:00.952
I said, "Absolutely not."

00:17:01.486 --> 00:17:02.788
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:05.790
But, you're standing
in water right now.

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:08.560
Maybe the people telling
you to move were saying,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.564
"At the very least, can you move
up five inches to dry land?"

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:13.998
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:17:14.098 --> 00:17:17.636
But the hard truth here is
even expensive interventions

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:20.305
are likely to only buy that
community a little more time

00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:23.741
and people in Broad Channel
will eventually be leaving,

00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:26.078
whether it's by moving truck
or by boat

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:29.881
because environmental conditions
are going to get worse.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.483
Heavy downpours have increased
in the last 50 years

00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:34.887
and sea levels have been
climbing steadily

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:38.056
and I'm not saying that that is
because of climate change

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.157
even though...

It just is. It just--
It just is. Precisely.

00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:51.303
The NFIP is actually due for
re-authorization this December

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:53.705
and I would argue that it is
time to take another shot at

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:56.408
serious thoughtful reform
because without it

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:58.944
we have an unstable,
unsustainable program

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.613
that is indirectly harming
some of the people

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.181

-Some people in high-risk areas

will need to move
