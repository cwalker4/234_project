00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.220
Two of the triumphs of the early 20th century
were the development of Einstein’s theory

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.380
of relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.920
Einstein’s theory came in two categories.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.640
One was his special theory of relativity,
which mostly dealt with objects traveling

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.050
at constant velocity, and the second was his
theory of general relativity, with objects

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.570
whose velocity is changing.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.370
And, yes, for the purists, that delineation
is not perfect.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.149
But it works pretty well.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.950
If you take his second formulation and follow
it down the rabbit hole, you go from changing

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.860
velocities, to accelerations, and eventually
gravity.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.780
Ultimately, Einstein’s theory of general
relativity is a sophisticated theory of gravity,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.619
which has taught us that what we experience
as gravity is really the bending of space

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.900
and time.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.600
Pretty weird stuff, to be sure.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.080
But it’s been proven time and again, with
detailed predictions about the orbit of Mercury

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.610
and the recent observation of gravitational
waves.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.720
There is no credible doubt in the scientific
community about general relativity.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200
It’s a good representation of reality.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.530
The problem comes when Einstein’s ideas
meet quantum mechanics.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.700
Now there’s no issue with special relativity.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.760
Special relativity and quantum mechanics merge
just fine.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.350
The result is quantum electrodynamics, quantum
chromodynamics and quantum field theories

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.350
in general.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.000
I made perhaps a dozen videos on those subjects.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.950
However, when general relativity- which is
to say Einstein’s theory of gravity- meets

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.510
quantum mechanics, the result is very different.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.240
The two theories simply can’t coexist.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.140
You get infinities and conceptual difficulties
everywhere.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.770
And, even though some of the very smartest
minds of the last century have worked on this,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.360
it’s still a problem.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.140
We don’t know how to merge quantum mechanics
and gravity.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.349
Now I made an earlier video about just why
scientists think that a quantum theory of

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.780
gravity should exist and it’s probably worth
your time to take a look at it.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.090
But in this video, I’m not going to repeat
those reasons.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.080
Instead, I’m going to just talk about an
idea as how one might merge quantum mechanics

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.080
and gravity.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.010
The name of this particular idea is called
loop quantum gravity, or LQG.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.880
Essentially, what it does is try to use what
mathematicians call discrete mathematics.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.040
An example is simple counting and it is this
type of math on which quantum mechanics is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
based.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.130
This approach could avoid all the nasty and
troubling infinities that have perplexed mathematicians.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.470
Loop quantum gravity then imposed two core
principles of general relativity.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.610
The first is what is called background independence.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.800
This means that it doesn’t require that
space exists prior to writing down the theory.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.420
To give an analogy, if you're writing on a
piece of paper, you can assume the paper is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.879
there and then you write on it.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.210
Further, you can assume the paper has a certain
shape.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.680
It’s flat.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.989
The assumption of flat and unchanging space
is very common for most physics theories.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.740
But in loop quantum gravity, you make no assumptions
on the nature of space.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.340
To continue our metaphor, it's as if the equations
can exist independently of the paper, and,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.709
even more interesting, they can bend and change
just like general relativity.

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.880
The second core principle has the very cool
name of diffeomorphism invariance.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.480
The phrase is definitely a winner that you
can drop at your next cocktail party.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.810
Diffeomorphism invariance simply means that
what’s going on at a point in space depends

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.050
only on that point and not where it is located
in space, nor what's happening at other spots

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.260
in space.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.269
So, if you combine those two core ideas and
don’t require that the mathematics be continuous,

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.049
you can then explore the equations to find
out if they force you to conclude that space

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.960
and time is continuous or quantized and it
turns out that- drum roll please- both space

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.460
and time are quantized.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.550
One of the core consequences of that conclusion
is that loop quantum gravity implies that

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.940
there is a smallest length, which is 10 to
the -35 meters, a smallest area, which is

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:49.010
10 to the -70 square meters and a smallest
volume, which is 10 to the -105 cubic meters.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.500
Further, there is a smallest time, which is
10 to the -43 seconds.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.030
So that’s a very strong implication.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.970
It says that it's literally impossible to
have a smaller volume than 10 to the -105

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.970
cubic meters.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.380
It’s kind of like looking at a beach closer
and closer, until you're resolving individual

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.570
grains of sand.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.780
But, in loop quantum gravity, it’s impossible
to go smaller than a grain of sand, which

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.460
is our metaphor for a grain of space.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.830
Similarly, this implies that there is no shorter
duration than a quantum of time.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.870
It’s like a digital stopwatch, which counts
out the seconds, one after the other, but

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.740
there's nothing in between- except this time,
it goes 10 to the -43 seconds, then 2 times

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.800
10 to the -43 seconds, 3 times 10 to the -43
seconds and so on.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.240
That’s really the core consequence of loop
quantum gravity- the smallest bit of space

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.080
and time.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.970
Now there's been a bunch of mathematics and
ways to draw this out, involving terms like

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.949
spin networks and spin foam, but those take
some time to dig into and they don’t really

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.790
help your understanding all that much.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.290
So, I won’t go into them here.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.300
I’ll put a link in the description if you
want to read more.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.430
Now one of the interesting questions is how
do you get from the quantum of space and time

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.720
to Einstein’s theory of general relativity?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.440
It’s because when you add mass and energy,
you can distort the shape of the little volumes.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.740
Now that seems like it wouldn’t make sense
because I said that there were quanta of lengths,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.580
areas, and volumes, but you need to remember
that you are bending space and time and that

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.259
has the property that you can distort the
local definition of space in such a way that

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.270
the volumes are unchanged.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.560
So these ideas of quantum spacetime are all
good and all, but are they real?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.430
I mean, is there any way that we can test
them?

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.050
Well, we can’t get at them with our current
particle accelerators.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.740
They simply aren’t powerful enough.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.979
But it turns out that there is at least one
way to test the theory.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:03.210
It turns out that if you take the idea of
quantized space and time and apply it to the

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.630
passage of light, there is hope.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.680
Loop quantum gravity implies that different
colors of light travel through spacetime at

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.860
slightly different speeds.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.660
High energy light- that is to say shorter
wavelength light- travels more quickly through

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.389
quantized spacetime than longer wavelength
light.

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.740
Now the differences are ginormously small
and aren’t accessible except through a cute

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.770
idea.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.199
If you let light travel for very long distances
across the known universe, maybe you’d see

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.940
a difference.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.740
There are a few examples of sources of light
that are bright enough to be seen across the

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.949
visible universe, and one of them is called
a gamma ray burst, which are the brightest

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:51.350
explosions in the history of the universe,
second only to the Big Bang itself.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:57.020
They allow us to look at different color light
that has travelled for a very long time.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.009
There are multiple instruments looking for
these, but one of the most powerful is called

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:03.710
the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.340
By the way, even though the Fermi telescope
and my own Fermilab share a name, they aren’t

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.729
related in any way, except for a respect for
Enrico Fermi.

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:19.190
When astronomers looked at distant gamma ray
bursts and analyzed the arrival time of light

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.060
of different wavelengths, it appears that
light of all wavelengths travel at exactly

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.190
the same speed.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.819
So this could be a problem for loop quantum
gravity, or it could just mean that this particular

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:32.099
prediction isn’t universal.

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.700
We just don’t know.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.950
But we’ll keep working on it because- either
way- the idea of a smallest bit of space and

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.659
time is simply a very cool idea.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.679
Okay- that was fun.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:46.800
Do I believe in loop quantum gravity?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.880
No, of course not.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.190
There’s no confirming data.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.149
But it’s a fascinating idea and I am very
interested in finding ways to test it.

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:58.459
If loop quantum gravity is real, I’m sure
we’ll figure it out and, even if it’s

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:00.850
not, the journey will be fascinating.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:06.199
Learning about this stuff is a great way to
stretch your mind, because, of course, physics

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.300
is everything.
