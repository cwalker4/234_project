00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.840
"North Korea launched another intercontinental ballistic missile."

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.560
"People were told to take cover in basements or in concrete buildings."

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.020
"Could this kind of missile now reach cities on the East Coast, possibly New York or D.C.?"

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.420
What would happen if North Korea launched a nuclear weapon?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.735
U.S. officials think North Korea has as many as 60 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.760
And tensions between the two countries have escalated to new levels during the Donald Trump presidency.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:32.285
Remember when Trump compared the size of their nuclear buttons?

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:35.885
So, how close are we to an actual nuclear war?

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.420
It’s closer than you might think.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.500
The U.S. is reportedly considering a "bloody nose" attack on North Korea.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.740
This could include a manned airstrike or shooting down a missile test launch.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.180
Basically, a warning shot intended to humiliate North Korea.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.960
But this warning could be taken as an act of war.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.620
Jeffrey Lewis is an expert on disarmament, arms control and nonproliferation.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.460
He thinks the "bloody nose" tactic could lead to disaster.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.160
The way I think of it is — the problem with the bloody nose approach is imagine if you saw a guy holding a gun.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.720
Like if you walk up and punch him in the nose, he might very well shoot you.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.660
Because he doesn't know that it's only gonna be one punch in the nose.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.280
It's also possible that a Trump tweet could push North Korea over the edge.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.080
You could imagine that in the middle of a crisis,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.620
where there's a lot of stress and confirmation bias and pressure,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.640
a poorly worded tweet might be interpreted as the start of an attack.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.220
North Korea may also strike first, but that's less likely.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.860
At least, that's what former missile launch officer Bruce Blair thinks.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.680
I would be willing to imagine that he would not launch a nuclear weapon at the United States

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.120
or our allies unprovoked,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.095
because he knows that would be the absolute end of his regime.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.540
They are worried that the Kim family will suffer the same fate as Saddam and his family

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.460
or maybe Muammar Gaddafi.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.300
Regardless of the trigger, Lewis says North Korea's attack would be in two phases.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.000
In the first phase, North Korea would look to wipe out nearby U.S. defenses.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.840
They would launch nuclear missiles at U.S. forces based in Japan and South Korea.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.260
When they talk about nuclear weapons, they say the mission of their nuclear weapons is to deter and repel an invasion.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.720
The purpose of those nuclear weapons would be to try to destroy the U.S.'s ability to invade them.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.760
So destroy the airfields where aircraft may operate out of.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.620
To destroy any troops that are massed. To try to damage ports.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.080
The U.S. has 30,000 troops based throughout South Korea.

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:43.640
In the event of an attack,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.500
these troops would likely evacuate their bases and help prevent North Korean troops from crossing the border.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.480
Separating North and South Korea is the DMZ or demilitarized zone.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.440
This is the DMZ between North and South Korea.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.360
You can see in the distance over there North Korea, just beyond the rock that juts out.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.680
Tilman Ruff was at the DMZ with ICAN — the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.960
They were there to send a message of peace ahead of the Winter Olympics.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.040
He describes what the mood was like on the border.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.740
Stuff happens quite regularly.  They're shooting across the border.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.920
The week before and the week we were there, North Korean soldiers tried to defect and crossed the border.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.180
One of them was successful, one of them was severely injured by being shot repeatedly

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.280
from the North Korean side.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.040
As soon as war erupts, you know there's gonna be millions if not tens of millions of dead in South Korea.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.140
Seoul would be ablaze.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.960
Over 25 million people live in the Seoul metro area.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.980
The city itself is just 35 miles from the DMZ,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.600
and there are over 3,200 bomb shelters that can supposedly withstand an artillery attack...

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.080
but not necessarily a nuclear or chemical attack.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.680
A single 250 kt nuclear bomb over Seoul would cause an estimated 783K deaths,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.960
and one over Tokyo would cause about 697K, according to a study by a group called 38 North.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.040
The people of Seoul, however, seem unfazed by the constant threat.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.500
58 percent of South Koreans don't think North Korea would actually start a war,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.220
according to a 2017 survey by Gallup Korea.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.340
"Ironically, living here makes me feel less threatened against [threats].”

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.800
“[Nuclear weapons] may be used as a means of threat, but I don't think they would actually use it to start a war."

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.800
Other potential targets in South Korea could include the port of Busan,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.560
the South Korean president's home, the military base Yongsan Garrison, and Camp Humphreys.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.660
Once the nearby US defense is taken out, phase two would be to aim the nukes directly at the United States.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.900
This propaganda photo from 2013 shows a map of potential targets.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.540
These include Pacific Command in Hawaii; PACOM's naval ports in San Diego;

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.880
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, which is home to the US Air Force's Global Strike Command;

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.040
and Washington, D.C.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.940
It would take about 30 minutes for a missile to reach the US, and 10-15 to hit Japan or South Korea.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.380
We wouldn't know until it actually exploded whether it was a conventional warhead,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.295
a nuclear, or chemical, or biological warhead.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.080
So, how would the U.S. respond?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.040
Blair was a missile launch control officer with the U.S. Air Force.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.760
If Kim Jong Un launched a ballistic missile or more at the United States,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.540
we would detect the launch within a minute from satellites in space that have heat sensors.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.760
Early warning teams in Colorado and Omaha, Nebraska would receive this information as well as reports

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.700
from ground radar in Alaska which could identify the path of a missile within 2 minutes of launch.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.740
And those crews in the United States would have about 3 minutes from the time they got the first sensor

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.980
information until they are supposed to assess whether we are under attack.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.940
They alert the Pentagon of the threat, as well as Strategic Command,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.360
who would initiate an emergency teleconference with the president and his advisors,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.120
including the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Advisor.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.245
A 4-star general at Strategic Command would brief the president on the threat and his options.

00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:41.520
He has probably on average about 6 minutes to deliberate and decide what to do.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.740
The War Room and the Pentagon would then challenge the president

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.100
to authenticate using a special code known as the "biscuit."

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:57.740
A launch order would be sent to underground and submarine crews that includes the war plan and special authentication codes.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.820
I was one of them. It would have taken me 1 minute to carry out that launch order. It's the length of a tweet.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.600
All in all, it could be 20 minutes before missiles are launched at North Korea.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.720
If North Korea launches their missile from a submarine - then the entire process needs to be twice as fast.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:23.000
The US has 44 missile interceptors stationed in California and Alaska, but it's not a guaranteed defense.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.640
The odds are very low that a single missile could destroy a warhead.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.040
So we would have to launch a salvo of our missile interceptors

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:39.820
to have any chance of destroying an incoming North Korean nuclear warhead.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:45.040
F-35 fighter jets could also be used to respond to and "kill" missiles early in the launch,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.900
but we don't yet have this capability in the United States.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.940
North Korea may also fire off decoys to confuse our defenses, while the real nukes hit their targets.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.760
Millions of people could die if just one of these nukes hits a major city.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.460
While we have an alert system in place, and disaster relief with FEMA,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.260
there's very little someone can do to protect themselves in this situation.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.620
All of the bomb shelters and other protection that we had during the Cold War have all atrophied

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.400
and basically been shut down. So we're starting all over again almost.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.860
North Korea has no missile defense, so the U.S. could very easily wipe out most of the country with its own nukes.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.460
But we are more likely to use non-nuclear options to stop them.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.900
We'd win a conventional war. We don't need nuclear weapons.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.580
The US would target its nuclear reactors, missile-production facilities, and launching pads

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.660
for intercontinental ballistic missiles with stealth aircraft, submarines, and ships.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.680
There are estimates of about 200 launchers spread around North Korea.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.800
The U.S. would also try to take out Kim Jong Un, who would likely be moved to a bunker

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.660
soon after a U.S airstrike.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.520
With or without nuclear weapons, I don't think Kim gets out of this alive.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.260
How would other countries respond?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.740
Japan and South Korea both have ground-based missile defense systems

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.420
But those defenses, you know they don't really have a great operational record.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.400
China's involvement would likely depend on who strikes first.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:21.840
China would almost certainly come to the defense of North Korea if the United States attacks first.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.980
It's also indicated to North Korea, that if North Korea attacks first, it's on its own.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.080
In the case of Russia, I think it would more or less stand pat.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.660
While a nuclear war would be devastating, it's a real possibility.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:44.800
I think that the odds are very significant that in the next 25 years, nuclear weapons will be used.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.080
The Nobel Peace prize winning group ICAN is working on a treaty to end nuclear proliferation.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.000
I think the more promising approach is really a global one.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.800
That doesn't say nuclear weapons are okay for me but not for you.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.480
You better get rid of yours. But that says nuclear weapons are not okay for everybody.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.340
Blair's group, Global Zero, is working towards the same goal.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.720
We have to get rid of nuclear weapons. It's the only solution.
