Talks at Google is honored
to welcome him here today.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.370
CHRIS VOSS: Thank you very much.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.620
And I got to tell you,
with that introduction,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.260
it makes it sound like I
can't keep a job, doesn't it?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.790
MAIRIN CHESNEY: So to begin,
you and I were talking earlier.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.010
And I was telling you
about how I read your book.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.590
And it is full of
incredibly practical tips

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.440
and great stories.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.410
And I told you
about something that

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.690
happened to me this morning.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.260
CHRIS VOSS: Right.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.800
MAIRIN CHESNEY: And in
preparing for this talk,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.457
I was going through all of my
notes, and all of the tickets,

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:16.290
and making sure that
everything was in line.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.748
And I realized that
I had forgotten

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:20.210
to request director's
chairs for us to sit in.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.240
And so I sent out a quick e-mail
of oh, shoot, I'm so sorry.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.870
I forgot to request
these chairs.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.290
Is there any way that we can
get some chairs for the day?

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.630
And the response was, no.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.010
We're cleaning up from
I/O. You know, sorry,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.860
but we can't get
them to you today.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860
And one of the
lessons in the book

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.700
is that no is not the
end of a conversation.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.560
It's the beginning
of a conversation.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.150
And me before reading
this book would have said,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.790
oh, OK, I got a no.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.960
That must be the end.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.730
But I really did think of
the book and think, OK, no.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.200
No does not mean absolutely not.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.160
It means, what's a
different approach?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.100
What the different
question that can be asked?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.790
And so I responded,
well, is there any way

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.170
that I can go pick
them up somewhere.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.128
You know, I understand
you can't drop them off.

00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:04.390
But can I go pick them up?

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.890
To which I got a
response, actually,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.431
I was able to arrange
it so that they

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:08.600
can be dropped off for you.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.290
And it was-- it worked.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.190
And it was amazing.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.300
So yeah, that was just one of
the many, many topics that you

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.720
highlight in this book.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.560
CHRIS VOSS: All right,
so first of all,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.809
thanks for getting me a chair.

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:22.979
I appreciate that.

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.770
Now the interesting
thing about that story,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.766
though, is two really
important points.

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:29.140
First of all, there's a lot
more space between yes and no

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.630
than most of us realize.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.550
You know, sometimes
we get into sort

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.520
of a binary, on/off,
yes/no sort of thing.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.130
And we don't realize
how much space

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.590
there really there if we
just give the other side

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.630
a little bit of time to sort of
think, a moment, if you will.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.290
There's some data out there that
indicates to us that a moment

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.220
is just three seconds.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.509
And three seconds can be an
eternity for a mind process.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.550
So the other thing that's
also really interesting

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.860
about that, and I think
it's one of the completely

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.580
different approaches
we take in the book,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.890
is what happens after
the other side says no?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890
Now early on in my career,
I came across a book

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.220
that I still refer to all the
time called "Start With No"

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.480
by a guy named Jim Camp.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.160
And Camp's theory was, if
you make the other side feel

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.490
free that they can
say no at any time,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.460
then it respects their autonomy.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.936
They'll relax a little bit more.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.810
They'll be more willing
to work with you just

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.890
knowing that it's OK to say no.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.700
So we decided to take
it one step further

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.880
and see what happens when
someone actually says no.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.570
And since yes is protection--
or no, yes is commitment,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.870
and we don't know what
we've gotten ourselves into,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.620
which is why we're
scared to say yes,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.580
but no is protection--
that typically what

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.760
we find is as soon
as somebody says no

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.160
and if they feel protected,
they tend to relax.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.732
They center a little bit more.

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:47.440
And they can think
more quickly, which is

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.760
exactly what happened with you.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.812
You inadvertently
triggered a no.

00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:55.790
You remained very pleasant
in the way you talked to her.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.240
And we know that if we're
pleasant to interact with,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.590
it actually helps the
other person think better.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.960
Because your mind
works up to 31%

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.729
more effectively if you're
in a positive frame of mind.

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.520
So when you're in a
positive frame of mind,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.853
it triggers it in somebody else.

00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:14.390
And it makes them smarter
just by smiling at them,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.820
having-- you've got a
wonderful tone of voice.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.750
So she's already making this
person smarter by the way

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.240
she interacts with her.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.120
Your counterpart says no,
which she now sort of centers

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.430
herself and triggers-- you
give her a moment of time.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.680
And the next thing you know,
she's strong ideas at you

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.960
and working it out.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.160
And that's finding that
space between yes and no.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.710
And many times,
it's triggered when

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.540
the other person
actually says no,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.730
because they feel protected.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.130
And they feel safe.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.540
And people are more likely
once they feel protected

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.930
and safe to interact with you.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.560
So just in a few short
moments, you were brilliant.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.520
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Thank you.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.950
So after that first
no, kind of in general,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.524
what's the correct response?

00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:01.940
Earlier when we
were chatting, you

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.227
said, well, you don't
want to ask a-- you don't

00:05:05.227 --> 00:05:06.310
want to attack in any way.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.020
You don't want to--

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.310
CHRIS VOSS: Right, right.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.230
MAIRIN CHESNEY: So
what's the right approach

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.470
after that initial no?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.110
CHRIS VOSS: Well, first
of all, just to hesitate,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.600
give them a chance to think.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.730
Because you never
know what's going

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.870
through the other
person's mind when

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.760
you start talking with them.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.030
There's probably
four or five things

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.488
that have been going through
their mind throughout the day.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.560
So giving them a chance
to sort of focus on you

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.220
is the other thing that no does.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.180
And I'll give you another hint.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.240
Like, we never call
anybody on the phone

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.860
and say, have you got a
few minutes to talk-- ever.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.360
Because if you say
that to somebody,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.040
a whole bunch of things start
going through their mind--

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.460
how long is a few minutes?

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.040
Do I have a few minutes?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.081
Do I want to talk to you?

00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.066
Do I even like you?

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:40.690
All these things go
through their mind.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.660
Whenever we call someone, we
say, is now a bad time to talk?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.050
And you get one of
two responses on that.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.275
The person will say no, no.

00:05:50.275 --> 00:05:51.619
It's never a bad time to talk.

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:52.910
What do you want to talk about?

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.040
And they're very focused.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.820
Or they'll say yeah, as
a matter of fact it is.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.445
But I can talk at
two o'clock tomorrow.

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.660
And you get a
scheduled time to talk.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.410
Now the follow-up to that,
if nothing good happens

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.760
in that space that happens
after that, the next most

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.000
important thing to do
is get the other person

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.550
the say that's right-- not
you're right, but that's right.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.940
And you get a that's
right when you

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.230
summarize the situation from the
other person's point of view.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.870
Don't be afraid to summarize a
situation that sounds like it's

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.510
against your best interests.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.150
I mean, that's
actually the key to it.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.550
And we've broken open a
number of negotiations.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.980
But it's a summary
of the facts and how

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.530
the other person sees them.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.845
And that's right will
then move you forward in,

00:06:41.845 --> 00:06:44.580
like, ridiculously
phenomenal ways.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.900
It's actually-- there's a
number of different reasons

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.240
why we think that it works.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.250
One of the reasons
is-- my co-writer

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.730
Talh Raz is brilliant.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.417
And read anything he's written--
Talh Raz-- T-A-H-L R-A-Z.

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.000
If he's written it,
it's well written,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.589
and it's worth reading.

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:00.880
But we were going through this.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.091
And he said, I think it
triggers a subtle epiphany.

00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:04.590
Because think of
the number of times

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.580
when you've heard
someone on TV or you've

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.350
seen a slogan that you
totally agreed with

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.620
and your reaction
is, that's right.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.680
You know, that's right
is when you completely

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.290
agree with something and you
think it's the complete truth.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.960
So that's a powerful thing
to get somebody to say.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.060
The other thing I
think it is is-- we

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.030
think it is is if
someone you're talking

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.220
to says that to you,
they're telling you they

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.230
feel empathy with you
at that brief moment.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.750
And there's a difference
between empathy and sympathy.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.950
But when they feel
empathy from you,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.460
they feel connected with you.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.030
And they want to collaborate.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.400
So if you get a no, the very
next most important thing

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.240
to try to get out of
somebody is that's right.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.160
MAIRIN CHESNEY: And so it
sounds like the that's right

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.872
is similar to oh, you get it.

00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:56.830
CHRIS VOSS: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.890
MAIRIN CHESNEY: And there are--

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.920
CHRIS VOSS: Yep.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.260
MAIRIN CHESNEY:
There are a couple

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.000
of times where in
different ways,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.750
you sort of highlight the
importance of your counterpart

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.410
feeling like you get it, you
know, finding their religion

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:08.910
and--

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.141
CHRIS VOSS: Yes.

00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:13.390
MAIRIN CHESNEY: --you know,
triggering a that's right.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.190
And so how is this
empathy and oh,

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.344
you understand important
in a negotiation?

00:08:18.344 --> 00:08:20.260
CHRIS VOSS: You know,
that's a great question.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.150
Because we believe the
world, the entire world

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.580
breaks down into three basic
approaches to conflict.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.020
And it's basically fight,
flight, or make friends.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.230
And each one, something
is more important to them

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.230
than making the deal.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.780
The deal is secondary to each
one of those three types.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.789
And one particular
type that I happen

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.260
to belong to-- the assertive
type, the natural born

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.530
assertives.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.280
You know, we think
of ourselves as being

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.029
very direct and honest.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.570
It's more important
that you actually

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.040
understand where I'm coming
from than you agree with me.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.260
I want to know you
know what I mean.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.100
If you know completely what
my perspective is and I'm

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.680
satisfied that
you've heard me out,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.440
then there's a
pretty good chance

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.560
that I'm going to
agree to your deal

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.500
as long as you know
where I'm coming from.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.041
I mean, it's sort
of like if you work

00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:18.290
for a boss who wasn't doing
what you want him or her to do,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.010
well, if you understood-- if
they knew that you knew where

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.532
you were coming from,
they accepted everything

00:09:24.532 --> 00:09:26.990
that you said, you actually
wouldn't have a problem if they

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.310
didn't follow your advice just
as long as you were 1,000% sure

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.250
they knew where you
were coming from.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.435
So the other two
types, you know,

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:39.580
what we call the accommodator,
friend-oriented person--

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.340
they want to make sure that
we have a great relationship.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.798
If we don't make
a deal, it's fine.

00:09:43.798 --> 00:09:46.180
But as long as you know that
I like you and I feel you

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.100
like me-- that's important.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.830
And then a third type
is the analytical.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.270
And they're highly
pragmatic, try

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.460
very hard to make
dispassionate decisions.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.110
As long as they
have the opportunity

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.340
to share their reason for what
they want, they're thinking,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.320
the results of their analysis,
then they're happy also.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.190
So there are other
things more important

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.742
than making a deal to all of us.

00:10:11.742 --> 00:10:13.700
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Do you
find that people usually

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.400
fall pretty strongly into
one of these three camps?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.890
Or are some people
a combination of two

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.349
or even a combination
of all three?

00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:22.848
CHRIS VOSS: Well, you end up--
the more experienced you get,

00:10:22.848 --> 00:10:25.120
you tend to pick up traits
from the other two types.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.580
Because to be a complete
negotiator or even a rainmaker,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.540
you need all three.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.350
You need to be able to
assert your best position.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.790
You need to get
along with people.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.030
And you need to be
able to analyze.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.240
So very few people are just like
stone cold one of the three.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.415
And then as we learn, we begin
to pick up the other types.

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:50.780
So the assertives
and the analysts

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.110
tend to pick up the
accommodators' characteristics,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.540
because there's some solid
data out there that indicates

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.580
that you're six times
more likely to make

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.099
a deal with somebody you like.

00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:06.795
And as an assertive, I
want to know the better way

00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:07.670
to come to agreement.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.470
So if you enjoy
interacting with me,

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.720
that increases good chances
that I'll get what I want,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.834
I'm good with that.

00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:15.000
MAIRIN CHESNEY: And then
do you have to sort of-- do

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.070
you have to adapt your
technique depending on who

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.600
you're dealing with as well?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.650
CHRIS VOSS: Well, you
learn, and then you

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.620
begin to understand that if you
have an impasse, if you have

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.460
a disagreement, how
the other person might

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:33.640
be looking at it in really
broad characteristics.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.470
Like for example, just
silence-- dead silence--

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.730
each one of those three
types looks at silence

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.776
very differently.

00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:42.150
As an assertive,
if you're quiet,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.150
I think that means you
want to hear more from me.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.450
And so I talk.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.880
Where if you're an
analyst and you're quiet,

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.850
you just want to think.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.080
And I could completely
misinterpret that, you know?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.860
And you're happy
when I go silent,

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.330
because you're like thank god,
he shut up so I can think.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.180
And then the accommodator,
who's very relationship

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.990
focused, when there's
silence-- well,

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.740
the only time the
accommodator goes silent

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.270
is when they're mad.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.950
So if we're talking and
you go silent on me,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.770
I'm afraid you're mad at me.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.950
So when there's an impasse,
when there's a difference, when

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.410
you having a
problem, it's usually

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.447
a result of the three types.

00:12:20.447 --> 00:12:21.280
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Mhm.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.075
CHRIS VOSS: My co-writer
Thal is highly analytical.

00:12:25.075 --> 00:12:25.700
He's brilliant.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.640
I mean, he's a brilliant guy.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.550
And I sent him an
e-mail once when

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.130
we were working on the book.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.090
And there was some
wording that I

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.320
wanted to have changed in
what we were working on.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.195
I wanted it written a
little bit differently.

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:40.510
And a writer will say,
change whatever you want.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.050
But that's their baby.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.389
You start changing words,
they don't like that.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.430
So I sent him the e-mail.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.500
And I didn't hear anything
from him like four, five days.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.830
And now I'm like, oh my
god, oh my god, you know?

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.720
This has got to be bad.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.930
So I call him on a phone.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.956
And he'd been on
vacation with his family.

00:12:55.956 --> 00:12:57.580
And he could tell
that I was concerned.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.649
And he goes, what's
with all the concern?

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:02.190
You never get worried
about anything.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.023
Why are you worried?

00:13:03.023 --> 00:13:04.980
And I go, it's four,
five days since we spoke,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.360
and I sent you this e-mail.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.162
And he said, oh, OK.

00:13:09.162 --> 00:13:10.620
Well, a lot of
people tell me going

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.890
silent on them bothers
them too, so-- I just

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.145
interpreted it wrong.

00:13:15.145 --> 00:13:17.270
MAIRIN CHESNEY: You started
your negotiation career

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.260
in hostage negotiation.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.950
Is that correct?

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.700
CHRIS VOSS: Well, I started it
actually when I was about three

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:23.920
trying to--

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.480
MAIRIN CHESNEY: I
was going to say--

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.870
CHRIS VOSS: --get out of
trouble with my parents.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.560
MAIRIN CHESNEY:
--professionally--

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.990
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Professionally.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.530
CHRIS VOSS: Professionally,
yes, technically.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.113
MAIRIN CHESNEY: And
so I was wondering

00:13:31.113 --> 00:13:35.090
if you might talk a little bit
about how you found hostage

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.720
negotiation and
then how that's led

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.650
into the rest of your
career, you know,

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.130
founding the Black Swan Group,
and sort of how negotiation

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.520
has been a part of your life.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.740
CHRIS VOSS: Sure.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.980
Completely indirectly--
everything sort of

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.460
fell out of the sky.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.580
I was on a SWAT
team with the FBI.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.540
I had a recurring
knee injury and then

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.520
just decided before
the knee was completely

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.520
shot while they could
still put it back together

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.650
to try something different.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.240
And in the crisis response-- I
always liked crisis response--

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.640
we had hostage negotiators.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.630
And that sounded cool.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.220
I didn't know what they did,
but how hard could it be?

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.300
Talk to people, right?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.930
That can't be hard.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.920
And so I decided I was
going to be a hostage--

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.750
and I very definitely,
distinctly remember thinking,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.000
yeah, I'll talk to terrorists.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.020
I could do that.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.890
So I went to the head
of the New York Office

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.750
team, a woman named Amy,
phenomenal, tough, New York

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.130
agent.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.480
And she said, do you
got any experience?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.129
I was like, no.

00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:32.170
Do you have any training?

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.680
No.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.210
Do you have any
education in the are?

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.880
No.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.224
Do you have any
background whatsoever

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.140
in this that would make
you a good negotiator?

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.110
I was like, no.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.994
She was like, go away.

00:14:44.994 --> 00:14:46.219
I'm like, come on.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:46.760
She says, no.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.180
Go away.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.971
Everybody wants to be
a hostage negotiator.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.030
Everybody wants to do it.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.180
No, go away.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.472
And I said, there's got to
be something I could do.

00:14:54.472 --> 00:14:55.430
And she said, there is.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.580
Go volunteer at a suicide
hotline-- which I did.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.170
I recontacted Amy
recently, because I wanted

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.820
to put the story in the book.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.940
And she said, you
know, I had to have

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.800
told 1,000 people to
volunteer at suicide hotlines.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.850
And two people did.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.760
And you were one of them.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.510
You know, one of the
things that I learned

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.884
was ask the right person.

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:17.050
Do what they tell you to do.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.891
You got to ask the right person.

00:15:19.891 --> 00:15:20.890
But be willing to do it.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.550
And so I volunteered
at the hotline.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.542
I came back five,
six months later.

00:15:24.542 --> 00:15:26.250
And I said, yeah, I've
been volunteering.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.460
She said, you're kidding me.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.620
She said, I tell
everybody to do that.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.350
Nobody does it.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.050
Where are you volunteering?

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.890
I told her it was
a suicide hotline.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.930
It was founded by
Norman Vincent Peale,

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.790
"The Power of Positive
Thinking" guy in New York.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.360
She says, that's where
I volunteered too.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.400
So I was the only one that
did what I was told to do.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.440
She moved me past
five other people.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.300
I got the next training slot.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.300
I went down to the FBI's crisis
hostage negotiation school.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.340
It was a phenomenal,
phenomenal experience.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.690
It was almost moving--
and then came back

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.190
and was lucky enough-- not
terribly long after I got back

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.010
there was a bank robbery with
hostages in Brooklyn, which

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.260
is actually a very rare event.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.057
They happen in the movies-- they
happen on TV every other week.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.140
In the real life, it happens
in the entire country

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.110
about once every 20 years.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.960
And we showed up.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.630
And it was a great operation.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.250
The first bank
robber to surrender

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.870
surrendered to me personally.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.810
So it went well.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.900
We got everybody out.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.235
And then I started to
teach that incident

00:16:35.235 --> 00:16:37.474
and tell everybody
how it went and found

00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:38.390
that I liked teaching.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.850
And then one thing
led to another.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.470
And the next thing I knew,
I'm sitting here in Google.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.970
MAIRIN CHESNEY: I
wonder if you also

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.240
might talk about the Black
Swan Group a little bit

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.610
and what you do there.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.270
CHRIS VOSS: While I was
still with the Bureau,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.190
I talked my way into Harvard
Law School's negotiation course.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.830
I'm the only agent
that ever did that.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.520
And while I was
there collaborating

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.109
with my now
colleagues at Harvard,

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.810
we decided we were
doing the same thing

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.849
only-- same techniques,
different stakes.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.770
Basically, that means
I had better stories.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.940
And then after that, I
decided that this was an area

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.579
that hostage negotiation
does apply to business

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.319
and personal negotiations.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.599
Did very well with it there.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:25.319
And I was encouraged
by my colleagues there,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.460
Sheila Heen, John Richardson,
Doug Stone-- phenomenal people.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.740
Have been very supportive of me
ever since I came across them--

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.621
very good friends to this day.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.870
And so I just decided it
would be something new to do.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.310
Because most of my career I've
liked going in new directions,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.040
trying stuff that other
people hadn't tried.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.440
So about the time
I retired, which

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.030
was in 2007, which I know
already seems like a long time

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.360
ago, there was a book out
called "The Black Swan"

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.860
and it was about
very small, little,

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.307
innocuous things that
had massive impacts.

00:17:59.307 --> 00:18:01.140
And that's the whole
design of these skills.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.400
I mean, these skills,
even if the other guy

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.840
knows that you're
negotiating with them,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.530
they're still OK with it.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.250
It's very subtle.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.380
One of the cases I
talk about in the book,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.430
it was a very long kidnapping
in the Philippines.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.200
And ultimately one
of the turning points

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.990
was getting the terrorists to
say that's right on the phone--

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.920
changed everything.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.050
There was a $10 million
ransom demand on the table.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.810
It went from $10 million to
zero in one conversation--

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.950
space of about five minutes.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.440
It had been going
on for a while.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.910
And our negotiator got the
bad guy to say that's right.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.750
And this was a bad, bad
guy-- murdering, raping,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.390
head chopping bad guy.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.650
Got him to say that's right.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.870
And it changed everything.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.830
So a couple of weeks
after that case was over,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.760
I was back in the
Philippines-- [COUGHING]

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.050
excuse me-- on another case.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.900
And the negotiator
that I was coaching

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.650
is a phenomenal, patriotic,
wonderful human being,

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.689
guy named Benji.

00:18:58.689 --> 00:19:00.980
He says, hey, you're never
going to guess who called me

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.060
on the phone two weeks ago.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.780
So I was like, I don't know.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.620
And he said, it was our
terrorist, bad guy name Sebiah.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.480
He said, Sebiah called me.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.790
Really?

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.090
What did he say?

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.800
Because he didn't
know who Benji was.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.220
He just knew Benji had
to be the government

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.920
military cop, some
high ranking official,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.966
but didn't know who he was.

00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:27.920
He said, hey, have
you been promoted yet?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.030
I don't know what you
said to me on the phone.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.070
I was going to kill Jeffery.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.580
You kept me from doing it.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.580
They should promote you.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.230
He hangs up.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.730
See, even when they know,
they're still OK with it.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.200
And that was the whole
approach to negotiation.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.490
If someone will deal
with you and they

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.090
won't feel worse as a result
of it-- most people I know,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.650
if they got a negotiation story,
they'll be like, oh, yeah.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.840
You know, I had these
guys over a barrel.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.340
Well, I really hammered them.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.222
You know, there's
nothing they could do.

00:20:02.222 --> 00:20:04.180
Well, the problem with
that kind of an approach

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.390
is if you hammer somebody
in a negotiation,

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.450
they're going to wait for
the rest of their life

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.520
to pay you back.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.920
And you don't hammer people
that you never see again.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.621
There's no such
thing as a one-off.

00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:17.870
They're going to be people
that stay in your world one

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.800
way or another, either
your day to day life

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.230
or they will see you again.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.360
So you want to
negotiate successfully

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.830
with people where afterwards
they call you up on the phone

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.094
and they say, nice job.

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:32.060
Nice job.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.580
I'd talk to you again-- which
is exactly what happened

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.807
in the Philippines.

00:20:35.807 --> 00:20:37.890
MAIRIN CHESNEY: You do
make the point in this book

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.400
that your counterpart is also
your partner, which I thought

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.480
was an interesting
point in a negotiation,

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.630
that you're not necessarily
going head to head,

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:54.040
you're trying to work
towards a conclusion.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.340
But you also make the
point that compromise

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.705
is a little bit of a dirty
word sometimes in negotiation.

00:20:59.705 --> 00:21:01.080
CHRIS VOSS: It's
a horrible word.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.413
And I hope they don't bleep
that out on the tape, right?

00:21:03.413 --> 00:21:06.151
You said compromise.

00:21:06.151 --> 00:21:07.900
MAIRIN CHESNEY: So
what about compromise--

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.830
what about do you think
involves working together?

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.765
And then what about
compromise is so negative?

00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:16.140
CHRIS VOSS: You
know, and there's

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.770
a difference between
a high-value trade

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.860
and compromise.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.220
Compromise, splitting the
difference, meeting half way,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.580
it's usually kind of--
I'm sorry, but is usually

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.550
kind of a lazy approach.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.170
And you leave
money on the table.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.865
You leave better outcomes on
the table when you compromise

00:21:30.865 --> 00:21:32.730
or you meet in the middle.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.280
You know, I like
to say, never be

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.655
so sure of what you want that
you wouldn't take something

00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:37.840
better.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.190
And so you want to interact with
someone-- because the adversary

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.280
is the situation.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.760
If you're talking to
someone, actually you both

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.240
have a problem that the
two of you talking together

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.340
will likely solve.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.026
And even if it's what's the
most effective high-value trade?

00:21:55.026 --> 00:21:56.400
What can I give
you that's really

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.180
valuable to you that might be
fairly easy for me to give?

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.660
I did a talk for the
Memphis Dispute Resolution

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.780
for the Memphis Bar Association
a number of years ago.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.870
They were putting
out a magazine.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.776
They had to put somebody on
the cover of the magazine.

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:17.150
They said, we'll
put your picture

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.710
on the cover of the magazine.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.100
Getting my picture on the
cover of a magazine that

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.150
gets some distribution is
extremely valuable to me.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.360
It's something very
hard for me to get

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.190
that I don't get on a
regular basis, something

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.040
they got anyway that they've
got to do every month.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.200
So that's a perfect definition
of a high-value trade.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.270
And the idea was they wanted
some training on negotiation.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.765
And they would to
hear somebody who

00:22:41.765 --> 00:22:43.950
came in from a
different point of view

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.234
and some stuff that's
fairly easy to understand.

00:22:46.234 --> 00:22:47.900
I mean, I've had a
lot of people tell me

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.120
that the ideas are digestible.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.610
They're easy to apply.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.985
They're not hard to figure out.

00:22:52.985 --> 00:22:57.437
You know, everything is designed
to be very user-friendly,

00:22:57.437 --> 00:22:59.270
that you can figure it
out, and you can use,

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.960
and you start making a
difference right away.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.950
So yeah, the adversary
is the situation.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.750
The person you're
talking to, they

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:10.020
might feel like that they've
got to be your adversary.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.840
And you can get them out of that
eventually with enough time.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.990
People are really
far more defensive

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.172
than they are attacking.

00:23:17.172 --> 00:23:18.630
But the adversary
is the situation,

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.670
so I got to partner
up with this person.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.350
So I'm going to
engage in behaviors

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.240
that's going to make you tend
to want to collaborate with me.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.740
And if we get into some really
serious hard bargaining,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.356
I can do that too.

00:23:29.356 --> 00:23:31.720
You know, I can hold
a really strong line.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.130
But ideally, you're
still going to feel good

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.567
about the entire interaction.

00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:38.900
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Hostage takers
and kidnappers are crazy.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.034
So there's no way that
those same techniques

00:23:41.034 --> 00:23:41.950
are going to work on--

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.390
CHRIS VOSS: Right.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.134
MAIRIN CHESNEY: --you
know, sane people.

00:23:45.134 --> 00:23:47.050
CHRIS VOSS: You know,
but yeah, the perception

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.540
is that hostage
takers are crazy.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.480
And they're not.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.150
I mean, everybody has patterns.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.040
Everybody is driven
by emotions, you know?

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.890
Now that there's much
more of a recognition

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.924
of emotional
intelligence, it's not

00:23:59.924 --> 00:24:01.090
that hard to make that case.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.780
But if we were at a business
meeting and I were to say,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.960
it sounds like you're emotional
about this, that still would

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.640
be an insult. But
if I were to say,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.689
it sounds like you're
passionate about this.

00:24:11.689 --> 00:24:12.855
You'd be like, that's right.

00:24:12.855 --> 00:24:13.580
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Yes, I am.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:14.306 --> 00:24:15.770
CHRIS VOSS: You
know, that's right.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.170
That's right, remember?

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:22.130
So what's the
passion and emotions.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.810
I don't know.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.700
It's a matter of terminology.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.060
And then also, we were talking
about Danny Kahneman's book,

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.811
"Thinking Fast and Slow."

00:24:31.811 --> 00:24:33.310
There's more and
more data out there

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.540
that indicates there's
an emotional component

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.820
to every decision we make,
each and every decision.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.330
We make our mind up based
on what we care about.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.270
Therefore what you care
about is an emotion, how

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.470
you feel about things.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.150
So let's start with
the idea that we're

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.150
emotional to begin with.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.220
A hostage taker, if
he's upset, is just more

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.420
of himself or herself.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.890
They're not different, they're
just more themselves intensely.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.120
So hostage negotiation is
a set of tools and skills

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.050
that can deal with people
in very intense emotions.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:10.050
They're equally effective when
the emotions are less intense.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.670
And the flipside
is, half the time we

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.340
act like things are the
end of the world anyway.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.210
I mean, anybody that's
had trouble getting

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.350
to sleep at night
means you were tossing

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.180
and turning over something
that was bothering you.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.940
It bothered you enough so that
you couldn't get to sleep.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.050
Anybody that's ever
felt stress, you've

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.850
just taking yourself
hostage because you're

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.090
worried about losing something.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.815
So when we start
running it backward,

00:25:37.815 --> 00:25:41.760
then actually there's some
emotional wiring in everything

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.400
that happens.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.879
So let's start from the
premise to begin with that

00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:46.670
let's have some tools
that work really well

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.250
that are emotional
intelligence tools.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.917
You know, there's still a very
intense drive to be rational.

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:52.750
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Mhm.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.570
CHRIS VOSS: You know,
"Getting to Yes,"

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:59.250
which is a fundamentally,
phenomenally sound book,

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.340
but it really is
based on a drive

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.340
to become rational or
even the recognition says,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.270
separate a person's positions
from their interests.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.150
OK, wow.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.200
That sounds very rational.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.920
Why don't you tell me why
you want what you want?

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.200
Well, most people think if
I tell you why I want it,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.880
then you've just got
all the power over me.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.270
You've just gotten at my
deepest, darkest secrets.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.730
Or I've revealed
all my weaknesses,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.730
and I've revealed all
my vulnerabilities.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.280
So that as an idea
just doesn't work.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.270
You know, tell me
why you want this.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.700
Oh, because I
can't pay my bills.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.604
Oh, you know, then I've got
leverage-- quote leverage.

00:26:38.604 --> 00:26:40.270
And most of the books
that have come out

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.800
have been along this
drive for rationality.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.620
How can we approach this in this
methodical, pragmatic, rational

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.770
approach to negotiation?

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.400
You know, more and more comes
out in different degrees

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.716
in other ideas-- again, Jim
Camp's book "Start With No,"

00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:59.670
it's still got a
phenomenal chapter

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.680
about open-ended questions.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.910
And it's a completely
different approach.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.380
And it's written from a
layman's point of view.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.030
His philosophy is
a combination--

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.530
he was a football coach.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.680
He was a fighter pilot
in the Air Force.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.140
And he was a salesman.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.434
So it's got all that kind of
terminology mixed in together,

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:17.600
which makes it entertaining.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.580
Bob Mnookin, the head of
the program on negotiation--

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.430
the first story is me
negotiating with him

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.290
in a simulated
kidnapping negotiation.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.390
His book "Beyond Winning" has
still got a fantastic chapter

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.260
on empathy, the tension between
empathy and assertiveness.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.230
I still assign it, and I still
review it every now and then.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.490
And my Harvard
brothers and sisters

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.730
are now very much
more recognizing

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:47.910
that empathy is the tool for
negotiation effectiveness.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.400
And in my book, we call that
actual tactical empathy,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.960
understanding what we can
do with someone's emotions

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.750
and help sort of frame
their decision making.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.980
MAIRIN CHESNEY: You
highlight in here

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.920
that there are these
unknown unknowns that really

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.930
can be the answer to
finalizing negotiation

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.242
and to figuring out what it
is that both of you want.

00:28:10.242 --> 00:28:11.700
And so I was
wondering if you could

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:17.240
talk about finding these
unknown unknowns, what it means

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.110
to be an unknown unknown,
and how we become better

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.409
at it really tracking those
down in a negotiation.

00:28:23.409 --> 00:28:25.450
CHRIS VOSS: Right, so
there's two kinds of pieces

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.540
of information that
the other side has that

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.790
are really important to you.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.860
It's the stuff that they know is
important to you and the stuff

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.760
that they have no idea
it's important, but it is.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.260
And that's why detecting
deception is not that helpful.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.590
Because detecting deception
in an interaction,

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.500
you only know to cover up
what you know is important.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.920
And I got to trigger a lot
more conversation with you

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.760
to get the sort of
accidental stuff.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.540
Now the other thing
is that there's never

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.160
a negotiation that anybody
is ever in when they're not

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.120
holding cards, if you
will, if you're not

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.920
hiding pieces of information.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.450
There will never come a time
when you're in a negotiation

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.380
that you don't have proprietary
important information to you

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.290
that you're worried about
letting the other side have--

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:11.950
ever.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.870
So if that's true for you, it's
also true for the other side.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.130
So here's two people
holding pieces

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.960
of information that they're
not showing the other side,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.130
they know the other
side doesn't have.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.440
And the unknown unknowns
are kind of when

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.384
those two things overlap.

00:29:27.384 --> 00:29:29.050
Because I don't know
what you're hiding,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.210
and you don't know
what I'm hiding,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.168
there's going to be a
lot of stuff in the space

00:29:32.168 --> 00:29:36.140
there that could be huge if
we could just figure it out.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.394
Some of it might be just
why you want what you want,

00:29:39.394 --> 00:29:42.060
which again, never be so sure of
what you want that you wouldn't

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.850
take something better.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.214
One of my students, a male,
is negotiating with his wife

00:29:49.214 --> 00:29:50.130
over a Christmas tree.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.630
Very practical guy, practical
guy-- wants an artificial tree.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.850
Lots of practical reasons
for an artificial tree.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.240
Doesn't catch on fire.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.750
You buy it once.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.410
Never have to-- you
know, all the reasons.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:06.930
And he can't understand
why she won't go along

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.700
with having the artificial tree.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.360
It makes so much sense.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.120
And so sometimes it's like,
well, why is this person crazy?

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.650
Where are they coming from?

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.430
And he searched his mind a
little bit and thought, well,

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.846
the only thing
that could possibly

00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:22.580
be driving her was, you know,
maybe something from when

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.570
she was a kid.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.792
So he said to her-- he used
the tool we call label.

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:28.750
And he just labeled it.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:33.100
And he said, it seems like maybe
you had real trees growing up.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.710
And immediately she
starts to tell him

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.810
about her memories of
Christmas as a child

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.560
and how have they stuck
with her and how important

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.130
it was to her that their
children have those same kind

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.030
of memories through life.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.460
And they get a real tree.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.680
Because as soon as he found out
why she wanted what she wanted,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.410
he completely came
over to her side.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.800
He knew that that
was a better outcome.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.860
Nearly every negotiation is like
that if we give it a chance.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.900
And getting to the point
where the other side is

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.380
comfortable with
sharing that information

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.120
is really what the point
of everything in the book

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.380
is about.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.430
There's always going to be
information you don't have

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.350
and that the other person
doesn't know it's important,

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.090
which is why the more the
conversation gets going,

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.490
the stuff that comes out, the
innocuous information could

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.990
make all the
difference in the world

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.854
and make not just
little differences.

00:31:30.854 --> 00:31:32.270
The Black Swan is
something little

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.090
that makes a huge difference.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.120
And that's really what
you're looking for.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.880
It also saves time.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.507
It keeps you from
having to renegotiate.

00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:42.340
It keeps you from having
to do it over again

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.230
you move forward in
a better partnership.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.920
You know, a great
summary from somebody

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.370
is when you
summarize it in a way

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.680
that they would never be
able to say themselves.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.530
The story in the book
is when I got my son

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.650
to change the way he
was playing football.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:55.810
And he was a lineman.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.140
And line are great
football players.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.570
It's a very blue
collar skill, kind

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.800
of a combination of a hard
hat construction worker

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.780
and a NASA scientist.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.080
Because they got to hit things.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.710
They put their heads down,
and they crash into stuff.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.900
And the stuff they're
trying to crash in

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.000
is trying to get away from them.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.500
So it's like trying to shoot a
missile with another missile.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.870
It's-- football is a very
complicated, complicated job.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.520
And as a quarterback,
I never appreciated

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.790
how complicated the job was,
because they just did it.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.390
And they moved them from
lineman to linebacker.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.960
And he went from
being told to hit

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.839
everything he saw to get
out of way of everything.

00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:32.880
You know, only one thing.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.005
It's the guy with the ball.

00:32:34.005 --> 00:32:35.190
Everything else, you duck.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.970
He wouldn't do it.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.630
And the other way
you know you're wrong

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.880
is when you're trying to
explain something to somebody

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.671
and they look at you
and say, you're right.

00:32:42.671 --> 00:32:44.710
If somebody says
you're right to you,

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.786
what they're really asking you
to do is shut up and go away.

00:32:47.786 --> 00:32:49.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.330
They don't want you
to talk anymore.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:54.650
And so as my coach-- or as
his coach and me are both

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.070
explaining to him how he's
supposed to be playing

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.743
linebacker, guess what
he would say to us--

00:32:59.743 --> 00:33:00.701
AUDIENCE: You're right.

00:33:00.701 --> 00:33:02.050
CHRIS VOSS: You're right.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.650
And we'd be like, well, yeah.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.890
Because we like hearing that.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.620
We love being told
that we're right.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.750
And then you go right back
to it the very next day.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.097
It was do it the wrong way.

00:33:11.097 --> 00:33:13.430
And I thought, you know, what
is going through his mind?

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.170
You know, what's
the matter with him?

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.170
And finally, I took him
off to the side one day.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:27.230
And I said, you think that
dodging a block is unmanly.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.030
You feel like getting out of
the way of somebody who's trying

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:35.972
to hit you makes you a coward.

00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:37.430
And he got real
quiet for a second.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.240
And then he said, that's right.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.540
And he started ducking
blocks the next day.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.012
And he told me the
other day, because we

00:33:47.012 --> 00:33:48.720
talk about this a lot,
he said, you know,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.610
I never would have been able
to explain that for myself.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.214
Until you said it, I
didn't know it was true.

00:33:55.214 --> 00:33:56.630
And never in a
million years would

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.800
I would've thought of doing
it was acting like a coward.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.260
But it was absolutely
what was driving me.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.790
And so when you can
summarize again,

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.200
from-- because if you say
that to him like that,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.770
it was almost like I was
trying to talk him into it.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.750
Well, it's cowardly.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.604
But I was just
recognizing it for him

00:34:13.604 --> 00:34:15.020
even though it
sounded like it was

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.590
against what I
was trying to get,

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.340
it just gave him an epiphany.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.350
And it was really a
black swan for him.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.760
AUDIENCE: How do negotiation
strategies and tactics change

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.650
when there is
emotional entanglement

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.790
with your adversary
such as your spouse?

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:28.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.020
MAIRIN CHESNEY: So
the question was,

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.719
how do negotiation
techniques change

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.590
when there's emotional
entanglement with someone

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.900
such as your spouse?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.290
CHRIS VOSS: Well,
it's harder for us

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.310
to fairly reword it
in a way that they

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.864
would say that's right to.

00:34:43.864 --> 00:34:47.770
I mean, we get in our own
way so much more the closer

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.969
we are to someone emotionally.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.540
And it's harder to do that.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:56.639
There's something we call--
I call an accusations audit.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.540
It's very disarming.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.910
But I will take all the things
that you might be harboring

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.370
against me, you know, whatever
names you might call me,

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.280
and I would say, look,
seems like I've been

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.160
a jerk the entire time here.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.450
Seems like I've been in the
wrong the entire time here.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.250
And the closer we
are to someone,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.880
the harder it is for us
to make those accusations.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.690
It could be a spouse.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.880
It could be a business partner
where things have gone bad.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.200
I mean, I've advised
people that were working

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.070
on trying to divide
their business up

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.835
with someone that they could
no longer get along with.

00:35:30.835 --> 00:35:33.210
And I said, look, you've got
to articulate everything bad

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.550
that he would say about you.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.856
And I'm not doing
that, you know?

00:35:36.856 --> 00:35:37.950
I don't care.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.440
I'm not doing that.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.280
So that's us getting
in our own way.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.610
And I get in my own
way on a regular basis.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:45.490
And it's hard for me.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.530
I'm not trying to make
it sound like it's easy.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.050
It's not.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:52.000
Most of the things that are
simple are also very hard.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.580
And the closer we
are to someone,

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.570
the harder that often is is to
completely recognize how angry

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.150
they are if the anger is at us.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.630
And we feel that
we're not responsible.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:07.760
We know they're
holding us responsible.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.180
One of my first
negotiations after I

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.210
got trained on the
hotline was with the woman

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.070
who's now the ex Mrs. Voss.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.660
And I had learned on the hotline
that when you heard anger

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.860
in somebody's voice that you
would say, you sound angry.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.810
And it would make it go away.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.835
And it was like magic.

00:36:25.835 --> 00:36:28.126
You know, it worked for me
on the hotline all the time.

00:36:28.126 --> 00:36:30.024
And someone calling
on a hotline,

00:36:30.024 --> 00:36:32.190
there's going to be anger
that's going to be driving

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.980
them one way or the other.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.060
So I'm in a conversation
with the now ex Mrs.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.660
Voss over the
discussion of something

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.410
that was fundamental to our
relationship at the time.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.490
And I heard anger so, you
know, I'm kind of like,

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:47.200
I got my hostage
negotiation skills here.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.120
I can handle this.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.600
It's going to be easy.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.940
So I look at her and I
say, you sound angry.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:56.920
Yes.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.870
I see you shaking
your head over there.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:02.020
You know that probably
didn't go well.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.800
And she, like, blew up.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.220
She was like, rah, rah,
rah, angry, rah, rah.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.270
And I remember at the
time going like, ahh.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.460
But I'm a hostage negotiator.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.776
That's not supposed to happen.

00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:20.150
Well, the problem was, it
wasn't just that she was angry.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.920
She was angry at me.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.378
And she held me
responsible for it.

00:37:22.378 --> 00:37:25.125
And what I said
stopped short of that.

00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:29.810
Now a more accurate
thing would have been,

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.660
it seems like I've
been unreasonable.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.444
It seems like I've been unfair.

00:37:34.444 --> 00:37:36.360
It seems like I have
never given you a chance.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.943
It seems like I
haven't respected you.

00:37:37.943 --> 00:37:40.140
It seems like I haven't
respected your autonomy--

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.120
something closer that she could
have said that's right to.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.760
And it's harder when
we're closer to them

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.015
or if we don't feel responsible.

00:37:49.015 --> 00:37:51.140
If they think we're
responsible, it's harder for us

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.070
to recognize that.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.610
So that's a long, long
answer to your question.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.455
I hope that helped.

00:37:56.455 --> 00:37:57.830
MAIRIN CHESNEY:
Is there anything

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.170
that you've encountered
in popular media

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.610
that you believe to be patently
false about negotiation

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.170
or negotiation technique?

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:09.210
CHRIS VOSS: Well, in the movie
"The Negotiator," first of all,

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.090
early on, there's a line between
the Samuel L Jackson character

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.660
and the woman playing his wife.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.326
And she says, well,
you're a negotiater.

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:16.740
You lie for a living.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.480
Lying is a really bad idea.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.920
And I don't believe--
I never believed it

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.640
in hostage negotiation.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.900
And I don't believe in
a business negotiation.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.940
One of the reasons that I hit it
off with my friends at Harvard

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.820
real early on, Bob Mnookin
running the program up there,

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.330
they put a heavy emphasis on
teaching people not to lie.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.220
And just off the
top of his head,

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.720
while I was up there
the first time,

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.290
he said, Chris, you know, what
do hostage negotiators think

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.990
about lying?

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.982
And I said, don't lie to anybody
you're not going to kill.

00:38:45.982 --> 00:38:47.440
And they kind of
laughed, you know.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.580
And they thought that
was kind of funny.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.820
And then they got
uncomfortable, because they

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.990
realized I meant it.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.770
But-- but then I said, you
know, but even then, it's

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.530
probably a bad idea.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.570
Because somebody that they know
is going to find out you lied.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.810
So I don't believe in lying.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.130
I think lying is a bad
approach in negotiation.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.630
The other side's
going to find out.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.500
In a business deal, you lie,
they're going to find out.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.070
And they're still in your world.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:17.220
I also don't believe in the
attacking kind of a negotiator,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.390
I mean the tough,
pound the other side.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.486
It's just bad for
business long term.

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:26.110
People don't want to make deals
with you anymore after a while.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.820
I mean, when I first got
up to the Harvard program

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.750
on negotiation in their class,
I resorted to my hard bargaining

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.730
techniques that I'd learned
as a kidnapping negotiator.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:39.960
Kidnappers are businessmen.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.070
They're commodities businessmen.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.990
Whether we think it's horrific,
they think it's a business.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.280
And I had learned some very
hard bargaining techniques

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.430
that I used to just
really pound people with.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.221
And they didn't know
that I did it to them.

00:39:52.221 --> 00:39:54.670
I did it in a very
invisible way.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.620
The problem was, word got out.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.610
So the first two
or three times, you

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.386
know, I really slaughtered
the other side.

00:40:02.386 --> 00:40:04.010
And then they started
talking about it.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.110
And it's like your reputation
getting out in the industry.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.086
And pretty soon, no
one would talk to me.

00:40:08.086 --> 00:40:09.710
I mean, I'd sit down
for a negotiation.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.890
They'd stare at me, because they
were afraid to say anything.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.792
Well, I spoke to a CEO
in the energy business

00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:16.000
a couple of years after that.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.655
And he said, I've got such
a reputation in my industry

00:40:18.655 --> 00:40:21.340
as been a hard bargainer,
nobody will deal with me.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.840
I got an agreement sitting
on my desk right now.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.440
The other CEO was there
with me the whole time.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.680
We negotiated every term.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.610
He's afraid to sign it, because
if you make a deal with me

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.730
now, by definition,
you've been beaten.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.906
And people now no
longer want to admit

00:40:35.906 --> 00:40:37.030
that they've dealt with me.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.839
So no one will make a deal.

00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:40.880
So if you're a hard
bargainer and you really beat

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.360
the other side, word gets out.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.835
And it isn't long and you
can't make deals anymore.

00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:48.210
MAIRIN CHESNEY:
The question was,

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.150
how do you begin a negotiation?

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.170
How do you start?

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.570
CHRIS VOSS: I want to hear
where you're coming from first.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.170
Everybody shows up
in a negotiation

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.900
having rehearsed their argument,
having rehearsed their talking

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.220
points.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.450
The reality is until they
get that out of their head,

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.340
they're not going to be able to
listen to anything that I say.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.950
So while they're focused
on what they have to say,

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.421
I want to hear what it is.

00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:11.920
Because they're not
going to be able

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.221
listen to me until they've
had their say, number one.

00:41:15.221 --> 00:41:16.970
Number two, I now
believe there's probably

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.520
going to be some really
important information for me

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.840
to pick up that I
didn't otherwise have.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.090
As a general rule, I
can get in a negotiation

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.880
in 10 or 15 minutes
information that

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.000
would have taken me at least
two weeks to acquire otherwise

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.452
if I could ever have gotten it.

00:41:33.452 --> 00:41:35.160
And there are certain
things about what's

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.240
going on in your world that no
matter how much research I do,

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.401
I can never find that out.

00:41:39.401 --> 00:41:41.900
Your boss may have given you a
hard time about the last deal

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.030
that you cut.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.570
You may have internal pressures
to get something done.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.840
You may have no pressures
to get anything done.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.510
You might not be hungry at all.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.239
There's no amount of research
that I can do outside

00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:54.280
that I can find that out.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.250
I have to find it out from you.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.960
So I want to get the
conversation started

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.170
so that we're talking and
you're comfortable talking

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.121
with me as soon as possible.

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:04.620
And so yeah, I want
you to go first.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.287
I want to hear where
you're coming from.

00:42:06.287 --> 00:42:08.911
MAIRIN CHESNEY: The question is,
if the person on the other end

00:42:08.911 --> 00:42:10.780
is a criminal that
you want to apprehend,

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.770
what can you possibly give them?

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.020
What leeway do you have?

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.780
CHRIS VOSS: If somebody
is talking to you,

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.920
you've got something
they want-- period.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.220
You know, I always said,
there's always leverage.

00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:26.980
You're asking, what kind
of leverage is there?

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.560
What can I give them?

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.820
My colleague Jim
Camp liked to say,

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.490
there's no such
thing as leverage.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.730
Because it all exists in
the eye of the beholder,

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:36.970
in the mind of the beholder.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.800
I've got another
colleague says, it

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800
doesn't matter what
leverage they have on you.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.758
What matters is what they
think of the leverage

00:42:42.758 --> 00:42:44.360
you have on them.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.540
Again, it all ends up being
in the eye of the beholder.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.690
If you're talking to me at all,
I've got something you want.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.462
Otherwise you
wouldn't talk to me.

00:42:54.462 --> 00:42:55.920
And you don't even
necessarily have

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.980
to be talking directly to me.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.752
If you're communicating in
a way is somewhat designed

00:43:02.752 --> 00:43:04.210
to get you something
that you want,

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:07.740
if you're complaining
publicly, then

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.440
there's something you want.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.050
And it's up to me to
recognize that and then

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.920
take whatever that thread is,
whatever that black swan is,

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.390
and use to establish a
working relationship,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.680
and find out what we can
make happen together.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.379
So if the criminal's talking
to me, I've got leverage.

00:43:24.379 --> 00:43:25.920
MAIRIN CHESNEY: The
question is, what

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.365
are the kinds of things
that a kidnapper wants?

00:43:29.365 --> 00:43:33.020
What are you
negotiating with them?

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.310
CHRIS VOSS: If they're
talking-- every kidnapping,

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:37.040
they want money.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.250
They want recognition.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.650
If we can give them
recognition or the flip side

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:45.280
is, if it's public
in any way, shape,

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.340
or form that means that there's
good publicity for them.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.700
They're trying to get publicity.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.880
And if there's good publicity,
there's bad publicity.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.840
So if I understand that
dynamic, if they're

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.500
expressing themselves
in any way,

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.610
there are things they
want to have happen.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.610
There are things they
don't want to have happen.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.230
All I've got to do is sort of
flip it the other way around

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:06.813
and make them worried
about the things

00:44:06.813 --> 00:44:08.429
that they don't
want to have happen.

00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:09.970
And then that changes
their behavior.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:14.242
Because fear of loss is the
number one driving-- myself,

00:44:14.242 --> 00:44:16.200
a lot of psychologists
believe the fear of loss

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.250
is the number one thing
that drives our decisions.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.960
Psychologists usually fall
into one or two camps--

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.610
we make every decision based
on either fear or love.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.940
Others say you make your
decision based on fear of loss.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.660
Whichever of those two
areas that you fall into,

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.610
the bottom line is
fear and fear of loss

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.730
are a big determinant
in how people think.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.070
So I just recognize that
and then just use the tools

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.282
that I'm given.

00:44:43.282 --> 00:44:44.990
MAIRIN CHESNEY: What
do you say to people

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:48.050
who say that there's no
such thing as bad publicity

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.622
if you don't have
any to begin with?

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:57.690
CHRIS VOSS: Most people
don't like to be laughed at.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.400
And that seems to be
the one thing that

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:06.010
hurts-- ridicule seems to be the
one thing that even people that

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.990
take that philosophy,
ridicule seems to be the one

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.870
thing that they don't like.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:16.910
So I understand the intellectual
thought process behind it.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.110
The only thing worse
than being talked about

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.540
is not being talked about.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.300
But I haven't seen anybody yet
that likes ridicule-- anybody.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.680
So ridicule tends to be
the one powerful sort

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.700
of x factor black
swan in publicity

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.169
that makes a difference.

00:45:33.169 --> 00:45:34.710
MAIRIN CHESNEY: The
question is, when

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.910
is time for threat and
retaliation if you're

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:37.860
put in that position?

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.960
And once you do it--
should you do it?

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.249
Should you wait?

00:45:41.249 --> 00:45:43.790
CHRIS VOSS: You know, I tend to
think of both of those things

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.690
as like a nuclear strike.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.790
And there's this
long, toxic residue.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:57.000
And you have the capacity
for a nuclear strike.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.960
And people like
the idea, you know,

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.800
but I don't know any time
that people after the fact

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.860
have said, yeah, that was
the right thing to do.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.660
I've had negotiations go bad.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:18.080
And one went bad
earlier this year.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.150
And I still regret the
loss of that relationship.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.010
And I will try to repair it.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.980
One of our main
core philosophies

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.190
is no deal is better
than a bad deal.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.440
And one of that
was a bad deal that

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.760
stretched out over three years.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.150
And we made a lot of money.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.320
It was blood money.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.570
It was painful, painful.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.710
And I ended up very angry and
upset at a lot of the people

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.930
that I blamed for
that, and still want

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.100
to do what I can do to
repair those relationships.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:51.084
So it's hard-- emotionally
and intellectually, I just

00:46:51.084 --> 00:46:52.250
don't want things going bad.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:53.610
And if they did
go bad, I'm going

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.110
to try to fix at
some point in time.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.320
Because we're all still
in the same environment.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.730
I mean, the residue from
negativity and people

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.720
paying you back is brutal.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.480
It's just really--
and on top of that,

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.882
I don't want to reputation.

00:47:04.882 --> 00:47:06.590
Because then that
reputation gets around.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.089
If you're quick to
pull the trigger,

00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:10.617
even if somebody deserved
it, people find out about it.

00:47:10.617 --> 00:47:12.450
And then they're reluctant
to deal with you.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.685
So many more people
judge your actions

00:47:14.685 --> 00:47:16.560
that are not directly
involved in the action.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.450
And I like to say, the most
important person watching me

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.430
is not the person
in the interaction,

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.170
but somebody is watching
how I conduct myself.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.860
And they're going to try-- and
the most powerful people sit

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.010
back and study you
for a long time

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.990
before they trust you to put
you in really phenomenal deals.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:36.120
So I'm not a big
believer in retaliation.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.870
I'm just not.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.790
Yeah, well, there's
an old saying.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.210
It was attributed to Goldman
Sachs, you know, greedy, yes,

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.262
but long term greedy.

00:47:46.262 --> 00:47:48.932
You know, short term,
you can go after them.

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:53.070
Long term, your most
valuable commodity is time.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.870
Everybody in here
has one commodity

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.900
that's exactly equal to
Warren Buffet's, exactly equal

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.950
every single day.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.840
He's got 24 hours, and
we've got 24 hours.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.570
So your most valuable
commodity is time.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.540
Step back, and what's your
rate of return of investment

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.860
of chasing a bad debt
versus cutting your losses

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.980
and moving on?

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.090
Psychologically,
you've been cheated.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:18.170
That person has hurt you.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.790
And you want to pay them back.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.940
And revenge is a dish best
served cold, as they say.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.390
But if you're going to be
long term greedy, the best

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.890
return on the investment of
that scarce commodity of time

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.190
that you have, that 24
hours a day, nothing more,

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:39.400
chasing a bad debt, or moving
on and going on to a better

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.470
opportunity-- I've seen a lot
of companies that have really

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.450
begun to turn the corner
in their profitability

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.680
when they understood how to
cut their losses and move on.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.620
Very easy to say,
very hard to do.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.970
I'm still working on that now.

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.620
I know intellectually that
cutting my losses and moving on

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.690
is a smarter move.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.909
I'm not saying I
can always do it.

00:48:58.909 --> 00:49:00.450
MAIRIN CHESNEY: For
the last minutes,

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:01.870
I'd like to turn it over to you.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.590
You said you have
a story for us.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.240
CHRIS VOSS: All right, so yeah.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.190
I was asked not that long
ago if I learned negotiation.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.710
You know, I grew up in Iowa.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:12.910
I'm a small town Iowa boy.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.620
And I am the son of a
hardworking blue collar

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.450
parents, Richard and Joyce Voss.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.510
And I think my mom is a
tough Midwestern woman,

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.180
tough Midwestern woman.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.357
I remember the-- I think
the first negotiation

00:49:26.357 --> 00:49:26.940
I was ever in.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.330
Because my dad was
like the SWAT team.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:29.580
My mother was the nurturing.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.010
You know, dad punished you.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.820
Mother was nice to you.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:38.060
And, you know, he had the belt.
And one time I got in trouble.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.450
I'm sure it was my
sisters got me in trouble.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.710
It probably wasn't
my fault. I had

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.530
an older sister, two younger.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.140
And so I was-- my
mom said, you know,

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.120
do you want me to punish you, or
do you want dad to punish you?

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.800
Dad had the belt. And this
seemed like a no-brainer.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.270
There's no way that mom could
hit it as hard as he could.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.728
And on top of that,
she didn't even

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.630
have a belt as far as I knew.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:03.200
So I remember saying
to her, yeah, you know,

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.680
you can punish me.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.430
And she's like, go to the
closet and get the yardstick.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:09.090
And I was kind of
like, holy cow,

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.209
this was not part of
the original agreement.

00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:13.000
And I don't remember
exactly what happened.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.820
But that was one of the things
that I learned early on,

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.945
you know, that the nurturing
person could be a very

00:50:16.945 --> 00:50:19.300
tough person at the same time.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:23.380
So I will share with you
one of my favorite jokes.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.467
What's the difference between
an Iowa mom and a terrorist?

00:50:27.467 --> 00:50:28.925
You can negotiate
with a terrorist.

00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:31.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.778
And my mother hates that joke.

00:50:32.778 --> 00:50:34.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:36.600
MAIRIN CHESNEY: Well,
thank you for sharing that.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.700
Thank you all for coming.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.360
And thank you for
being here today.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.410
[APPLAUSE]
