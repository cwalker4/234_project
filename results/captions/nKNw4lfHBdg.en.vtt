00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.550
It takes a very specific sort of person to
look at everything the world has to offer

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.160
and say: “Yeah, give me some money and I
will fight all of that.”

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.889
Some call these people mercenaries.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.070
Others use different, more colorful expressions.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.390
But most people can agree that these guys
have pretty… interesting lives, to put it

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.390
mildly.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.390
We’re not going to glorify the profession
of shooting other people for money.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.750
Some of these people have done pretty terrible
things.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.210
We’re just going to tell their stories,
to show how different people end up in one

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.510
of the strangest professions in the world
— and what that profession sometimes turns

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.170
them into.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.500
10.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.890
Frederick Russell Burnham

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.420
Frederick Russell Burnham was truly old school:
A fearless adventurer-mercenary who took part

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.379
in some of the grittiest wars of the late
19th and early 20th centuries.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.269
The stories of his prowess are so legendary
that they are frankly a little hard to believe.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.870
It’s said that he once outran a horse in
a 22-mile race to deliver a message.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.329
The writer of King Solomon’s Mines, who
was a friend of Burnham’s, said that the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.820
man was more of an action hero than anyone
in his books.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.130
Another friend, Robert Baden-Powell, cited
him as an influence when he created the Boy

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.130
Scouts.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.900
Even Teddy Roosevelt was so impressed by Burnham
that he specially invited him to join the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.900
Rough Riders.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.350
No matter what you think of these stories,
Burnham was certainly always where the action

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.350
was.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.729
His glorious mustache could be spotted in
the Apache Wars, or serving as the chief of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.150
scouts for the British Army in the Second
Boer War.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.899
He took part in the Mexican Revolution, and
was one of only three survivors of the Shangani

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.840
Patrol, Rhodesia’s version of the Alamo.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.790
There was no telling where the man would pop
up next: You could find him in any corner

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.630
of Africa, or cowboying it up in Tombstone,
or casually panning for gold in Klondike.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.009
What’s more, he achieved a great many of
these accomplishments before he even turned

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.009
35.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.110
Of course, all of these adventures did not
necessarily mean that Frederick Russell Burnham

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.110
was a nice man.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.500
He was a shameless lifelong racist, and he
treated his family as little more than an

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.560
afterthought: Burnham missed the births of
all his three children, and often left his

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.680
wife alone with them while he was off adventuring.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
9.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.579
South Africa’s Elderly Mercenaries

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.040
In the 1980s, Leon Lotz was one of the Koevoets
(“Crowbars”), ruthless paramilitary cops

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.460
fighting for the white South African leaders.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.860
Like many people like him, Lotz got into the
mercenary lifestyle after the Apartheid regime

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860
fell.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.770
He finally met his end like he had lived:
In a conflict in northern Nigeria, possibly

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.880
because of friendly fire from a tank.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.700
Here’s the strange part: This happened in
2015.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.860
Leon Lotz was fighting in the frontlines at
the ripe old age of 59.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.300
He was not alone, either.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.090
That year, approximately 300 former soldiers
of Apartheid were still fighting in Nigeria,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.570
despite the fact that some of them are in
their early 60s.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.510
There’s a very simple reason behind this
strange phenomenon: Money, or more specifically,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.860
a lack thereof.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.640
“Former Apartheid thug” is not a marketable
skill in most non-mercenary circles, so tons

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.570
of these people became soldiers of fortune.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.060
It‘s the only skill they have, so if they
don’t make enough money for a comfortable

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.880
retirement or otherwise fall on hard times,
it’s what they return to.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.840
Don’t take this to mean that they’re nice
old guys who are just trying to make ends

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.840
meet.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.700
They’re often literal relics of a time gone
by — unrepentant racists who never really

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.190
got around to updating their mental clocks
beyond South Africa’s segregation heyday

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.720
— though the ones who are still active tend
to be professional enough to not let that

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
show.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.700
Being old doesn’t mean that these people
are bad at their job, either.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.090
On the contrary: They’ve been doing it for
a very long time, and still consider themselves

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.380
fit enough to do it.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.500
The people they were fighting in Nigeria found
this out the hard way, as the elderly South

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.750
Africans played a large part in turning the
tide against the militant group Boko Haram,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.230
who were trying to sabotage the country’s
election.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.230
8.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.230
Frank Camper

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.440
There’s a very special type of mercenary
who trains other mercenaries and claims he

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.400
doesn’t care what they do with the skills
he teaches them.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.660
That type of mercenary is called Frank Camper.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.170
In the 1980s, Camper operated The Mercenary
School in Jefferson County, Alabama, where

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.160
he trained soldiers of fortune from all over
the world.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.780
He was always a divisive figure: Some say
that he was a very capable and effective trainer,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.800
while others insist that he’s a fraud and
his training consists of little more than

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.030
campfires and sing-song in the woods.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.941
Regardless of which version you want to believe,
he was leading a double life: Apart from being

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:20.040
a mercenary trainer, Camper was also a dedicated
informant to the FBI and Army Intelligence.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.950
These dual roles sometimes put him in strange
situations, where he both helped instigate

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.110
a crisis and prevent the same crisis.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.410
He once trained a group that attempted to
kill India’s prime minister.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.140
When he learned what they were up to, he immediately
leaked the information and foiled their plans.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.900
He has done the same to smugglers and professional
right-wing assassins.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.410
When one of his students later bombed a plane
in India, he declared he’d do everything

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.410
in his power to catch the guy.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.820
The fact that Camper helped foil a number
of terror plots doesn’t take away the fact

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.300
that he was still the guy who had trained
said terrorists, among other unsavory people.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.200
From his point of view, he didn’t think
he was doing anything wrong on his school:

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.450
“I train people in combat,” he said.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.540
“People I have trained are fighting in many
parts of the world—Lebanon, South Africa,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.420
the Philippines and Central America.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.720
They pick their own sides.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.820
I don’t instruct in politics or doctrine.”

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.960
However, politics weren’t on his side.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.290
He made those comments in 1985, on the same
week President Reagan criticized countries

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.950
that hosted terrorist camps, which didn’t
exactly do him any favors.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.030
And although he insists that he never trained
the plane bomber — or anyone else, for that

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.830
matter — in explosives, it’s worth mentioning
that he was jailed in 1986 for a different

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.550
bomb plot in California.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.240
He has since moved on to a new, presumably
safer career of selling computers.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.240
7.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240
Simon Mann

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.620
“Wonga Coup” sounds like a bad mobile
phone game featuring mildly copyright-infringing

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.620
irate avians.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.000
However, it was a very real attempt to overthrow
the leadership of Equatorial Guinea — and

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.010
Simon Mann was right in the middle of it all.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.700
Mann was a well-connected British ex-SAS dude
who had dug his roots deep into the mercenary

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.700
business.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.080
In 2004, he took a mission to replace President
Obiang of Equatorial Guinea with a man called

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.070
Severo Moto Nsa, who lived in exile in Spain.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.389
Mann says that he was told that things were
extremely bad under Obiang, and the regime

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.190
desperately needed to be changed.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.600
This proved to be untrue.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.950
Instead, Mann was arrested in Zimbabwe, during
the very first part of his mission.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.950
He had been trying to replace a surprisingly
healthy regime that very much objected to

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:21.950
his antics.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.900
He and several co-conspirators found themselves
in various prisons, and the whole coup turned

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.970
out to be a wistful attempt to gain access
to Equatorial Guinea’s significant oil riches.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.140
What’s more, British heavy-hitters such
as Sir Mark Thatcher, the son of former prime

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.700
minister Margaret Thatcher, were implied to
be in on the plot.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.200
Mann ultimately escaped the situation with
far less damage than he could have sustained.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.680
After serving four years of his 34-year sentence
in Zimbabwe, he was extradited to Equatorial

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.950
Guinea, and eventually pardoned by President
Obiang, the very man he had attempted to overthrow.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.300
Since then, Mann has worked for Obiang on
occasion.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.980
He has also been very vocal about his view
that Sir Mark Thatcher is far more implicated

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.760
in the Wonga Coup than he admitted in 2005,
and also maintains that the whole thing was

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.590
masterminded by a London-based businessman.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.590
6.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.440
Costas Georgiou and the 1976 Mercenary Court
Case

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.940
The year 1976 saw a rare event where mercenaries’
African antics actually turned against them

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.480
on a global scale, as former British Army
man Costas Georgiou and 13 of his cohorts

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.720
were brought to justice.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.639
Thanks to the civil war in Angola, various
mercenary groups had been running the country

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.740
ragged, and the public was desperate to see
them gone.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.910
Georgiou and others had been hired to fight
against the war’s power faction, MPLA, so

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.990
they made natural targets for a show of power
by the country’s leaders.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.110
Although the men stayed largely hidden from
the public until their sentences were given,

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.630
the case went to great pains to ensure worldwide
attention.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.190
Tens of thousands of Angolans attended protests
against the mercenaries, and the trial at

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.590
the Luanda Palace was translated to multiple
languages.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.570
A lot of this was probably a show for the
foreign press, who had started to question

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.310
the legitimacy of the trial.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.680
Still, legitimate or not, the mercenaries
walked away with some very heavy-handed sentences:

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.740
Four deaths by firing squad, the others facing
prison sentences of up to 30 years.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.720
While some of the sentences were arguably
justifiable, provided you support the death

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.680
sentence — Georgiou, for instance, had killed
multiple civilians and around 14 of his own

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.400
men — others seemed a little over the top.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.210
For instance, an American man was sent to
face the firing squad… because he had advertised

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.720
in a magazine that he was a mercenary.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.090
Ultimately, the trials did little to pacify
Angola’s situation.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.180
On the contrary: With Cold War superpowers
stealthily backing various parties, the civil

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.110
war continued until 2002, and was once dubbed
“the worst war in the world” because of

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.910
its complete senselessness.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.110
5.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.479
Robert C. MacKenzie

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:46.400
Colonel Robert C. MacKenzie was an expert
mercenary who, despite the fact that his career

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.310
took him to many mercenary-like jobs and contracts,
heavily objected to the word “mercenary.”

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:56.170
In 1965, the 17-year-old MacKenzie joined
the US army and fought in Vietnam, but was

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.120
severely injured while storming Mother’s
Day Hill in 1967.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.870
After a full year in the hospital, he was
sent back to the civilian life with a disability

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.290
rate of 70%.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.970
However, MacKenzie wanted to be a soldier,
no matter what.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.310
He traveled to Rhodesia, and joined their
SAS forces despite of his disabilities.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.970
This proved to be a good career move: Over
the next decade, he rose to the rank of Captain

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.720
and earned numerous medals.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.430
After his Rhodesian stint, he joined the South
African Defense Force to become a second in

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.790
command in Special Forces.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.370
In 1985, MacKenzie returned home, and started
a second career as a longtime correspondent

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.470
for Soldier of Fortune.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.390
For the next 10 years, he saw action all around
the world and wrote well over 40 correspondent

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.820
reports of said action.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.680
In 1995, he accepted a contract that would
end in him meeting his fate in the most international

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.670
way imaginable: After a stint in Bosnia, he
was shot while commanding a troop of Gurkha

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.350
warriors in a war in Sierra Leone.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.650
The reason MacKenzie always disliked the term
“mercenary” was that he never fought for

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.650
the money alone.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.400
He treated “international soldiering”
as a legitimate profession, and only fought

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.990
for causes that he personally approved as
good and just.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.990
4.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.990
Joe Adams

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.760
In the 1980s, Joe Adams worked closely with
Nicaraguan Contras, U.S.-backed rebel groups

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.620
fighting the country’s Sandinista government.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.650
He trained the rebel warriors and even commanded
a Contra contingent of his own.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.960
Even before that, he was a force to be reckoned
with.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.960
His stories of his days as a soldier of fortune
are full of terror and turmoil.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.890
He says that he once threw a man into a volcano.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.400
He has infiltrated cults and tracked down
children.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.930
He has investigated Jimmy Hoffa’s disappearance,
and been imprisoned in distant countries.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.560
He also makes mention of a time when he was
casing a house where someone was eating their

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.910
dead lover’s heart, although he doesn’t
specifically state that this was during his

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.910
mercenary days.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.810
Maybe it’s just the kind of thing that happens
to Joe Adams on a regular Tuesday.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.240
Adams got out of the mercenary game around
1985-86, which proved to be a pretty good

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.260
move: In late 1986, another American he had
been working with was captured by the Sandinistas

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.260
for spying.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.930
The more fortunate Adams moved on to another,
equally cinematic profession and set up Adams

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.540
Investigation, LLC. in St. Louis.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.500
As a grizzled private eye, he solved cases
together with his sidekick, a young 6-foot-4

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.640
rookie investigator named Jason Walz.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.690
He still kept a few souvenirs from his mercenary
days, though … such as an armored tank that

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.390
he stored in a rented garage.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.390
3.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.020
Lynn “The Shadow” Garrison

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.120
When a man is known as “The Shadow,” you
know he’s either a really, really strange

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.460
person or a video game character.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.360
Lynn Garrison definitely fits the former category,
and wouldn’t be entirely out of place in

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360
the latter, either.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.529
The Canadian Garrison has been, among other
things, a military combat pilot, an air mercenary

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:40.460
in Nigeria, an adventurer, a CIA collaborator,
a Hollywood stuntman, and a general international

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.500
man of mystery.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.310
He intensely dislikes being photographed,
and a rare 1993 interview showed that just

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.580
holding a camera near him is an excellent
way to have it violently confiscated and the

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.720
film exposed.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.149
In the 1990s, “The Shadow” emerged from
the, uh, shadows as less of a bloodthirsty

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:59.720
mercenary and more of a crafty “man behind
the scenes” type.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.780
He played a large part in the fate of Haiti,
in a role that he defines as “A friend of

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.780
Haiti.”

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.850
His reports of the country’s exiled president,
Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, painted the

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.210
man as a bloodthirsty voodoo villain who was
fond of disposing of his enemies with a practice

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.920
called necklacing: Placing a gasoline-filled
tire around their necks and setting it on

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.920
fire.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.330
There is some reason to believe that these
reports weren’t entirely accurate, such

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.870
as the fact that the person “The Shadow”
was most commonly seen shadowing was none

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.360
other than the man who had deposed Aristide:
Haiti’s military ruler, Lieutenant-General

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.360
Raoul Cedras.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.460
Still, the CIA and assorted Senators took
his reports seriously, to the point where

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.540
Aristide was freely labeled a “psychopath”
on the Senate floor.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.540
2.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.540
Bob Denard

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.240
French mercenary Bob Denard was one of the
most infamous ‘dogs of war’ in modern

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240
history.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.850
His hands were elbow deep in virtually every
conflict and coup he could reach during his

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.930
40 years of activity.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.560
Denard described himself as a “soldier,
not an assassin,” but his actions did not

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560
always match up.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.209
He was once even accused of planning to assassinate
the French Prime Minister.

00:12:56.209 --> 00:13:00.170
Despite this, he has said that he acts in
the interests of France.The way his country

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.780
kept reducing the prison sentences he kept
getting for the… other stuff he was involved

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.270
in certainly seems to back up this claim.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.370
Denard’s exploits were many, and his tactics
could be… unconventional, to say the least.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.650
He used many names: Sometimes he was Bob Denard.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.459
Other times, Colonel Bako or Mustafa M’hadjou.

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:19.790
Occasionally, he even went by his real name,
Gilbert Bourgeaud.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.470
He once attempted to invade a country with
a small, bicycle-riding army.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.310
And he loved coups.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.110
He loved them very, very much.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.280
After fighting in Indochina, Congo, Gabon
and Yemen, he got his first taste in the coup

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.740
business in 1975, when he staged one in the
poor island state of Comoros, on the east

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.089
coast of Africa.

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:42.959
After his next coup, a failed 1977 attempt
in Benin, he apparently decided to stick to

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.060
what he knows.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.920
He became obsessed over Comoros, and overthrew
the country’s government whenever it didn’t

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920
please him.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.660
Which was often the case.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.310
After Denard’s third Comoros coup in 1989,
France had enough of his antics.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.410
Denard was swiftly deposed to South Africa
and placed in house arrest.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.940
This didn’t last: In 1995, Denard returned
to Comoros with 30 soldiers and staged his

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.080
fourth coup.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.830
This time, France didn’t mess around, and
sent three thousand soldiers to take Denard

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.830
down.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.000
Outnumbered a hundred to one, Bob Denard was
finally forced to concede defeat and break

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.560
the cycle of endless coups.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560
1.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.560
Mad Mike Hoare

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.760
Mike Hoare joined the British Army in 1941
and never looked back.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.240
After walking out of WWII as a Major, he started
a strange metamorphosis that involved being

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.790
a chartered accountant in South Africa, but
ultimately shaped him into the famed mercenary

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.029
known as “Mad Mike.”

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:35.459
He was a strange combination of Robin Hood
and Baron von Munchausen who, in his own words,

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:39.570
“freed the helpless and killed the foolish”
… all for a suitable fee, of course.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.170
Hoare was a very capable soldier and a legitimate
legend in mercenary circles, to the point

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.560
that his autobiography was just called Mercenary.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.899
However, one of his most significant talents
was always storytelling.

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:54.790
He could weave a Hollywood-quality story out
of anything, from a bulldog bite while riding

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.530
a motorcycle to his wife’s nasty case of
cerebral malaria.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.480
Mad Mike roamed all over the world, but his
most famous antics happened in Congo, where

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.010
he led a 600-strong fighting ensemble called
Five Commando.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.649
Mad Mike had some very peculiar demands for
his troops: They had to “love combat”

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:12.800
and “be tremendous romantics.”

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.080
Apart from that, he was very open to anyone.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.029
He even welcomed homosexual soldiers in his
troops, and commented that he “couldn’t

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:21.570
imagine why anyone would boot them from their
army.”

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.390
(Granted, it was mostly because he felt they
fit well in support roles like cooks and orderlies,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.680
but that was still pretty open-minded for
a 1960s military man.)

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.459
One of Hoare’s pet peeves was his profession’s
reputation.

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:35.940
When the brutal and unkempt Belgian mercenaries
known as “Les Affreux” — “the frightful

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.180
ones” — started arriving in Congo around
1961, he immediately disliked them.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.510
Hoare went to great pains to make sure that
his men always wore neat uniforms, treated

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.089
women respectfully, and shaved every day.

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:50.620
(Ironically, the leader of Les Affreux was
none other than Bob Denard.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:55.250
It probably goes without saying that the two
men viewed each other as arch-rivals.)

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.899
In the late 1970s, the aging Hoare slowly
started to distance himself from active mercenary

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:05.310
missions, citing the stabilizing global situation
and new, virtually unbeatable armies in places

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.950
like Rhodesia and South Africa.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.490
Of course, old habits die hard.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.839
He could still easily come up with a detailed
plan to remove Idi Amin from power while casually

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:28.670
sitting at the back seat of a taxi cab…
and jokingly implying that he’s taking offers.
