00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.690
Heey, whats up everyone.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.759
Welcome to my Brexit video, alternative title
: “Reality is often disappointing”.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.840
The video we’re looking at today is from
fake university PragerU.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.049
And ist not about why the UK should leave
the EU, that's an old hat by now, but why

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.280
it voted to leave.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.000
I’ve chosen this one because as soon as
the referendum was over, a lot of talking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.840
points from the pro-Brexit lot got dropped
and exposed as the obvious lies that they

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
were.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.910
But this video, because it came out after
the referendum, only features the bare bones

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.279
of the pro-Brexit side.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.250
It also asks bigger questions like “Is the
EU undemocratic?” or “What does sovereignty

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.520
really mean?”.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.780
To top things of, it's made by Mr. Brexit
himself, former UKIP member Nigel Farage who

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.660
has been doing nothing but agitating for the
UK to leave the EU, so ideally, he should

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.079
offer the best arguments.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.590
So, without stalling or endlessly prolonging
what will ultimately be a very painful experience,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.570
lets dive into the video:

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.480
If one big government is bad, imagine how
much worse two big governments would be.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.560
But that’s what people living in Europe
have had to deal with: their own nation’s

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.290
bloated government and the super-national
government of Europe, now known as the European

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.450
Union.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.450
Bureaucracy times two!

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.280
How’s that for a horror show?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.590
Well, actually, you’ve no idea.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.330
It’s worse than you think.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.990
Believe me—I know, because for seventeen
years, I’ve represented South East England

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.159
as a member of the European Parliament, the
EU’s legislative body.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.750
Okay, big government.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.340
And this is actually another reason why I
like this video about Brexit so much.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.680
It becomes pretty clear from the get go that
this video is designed as propaganda, targeting

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.340
an American audience.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.729
This is why the video starts out with the
“big government” talking point although

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.090
the dichotomy of small vs. Big government
usually isn’t used as a political slogan

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.090
in Europe.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.630
Its predominantly a pejorative in the American
lexicon and doesn’t make much sense in the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.049
context of European governmental bodies since
they’re pretty much all big by American

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.049
standards.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.799
But Farage uses the slogan nonetheless, because
he wants to paint a picture of an overarching

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.919
giant bureaucracy wasting tax money by shoving
papers around.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.889
That doesn’t really work with the EU though.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.810
The percentage of the EU’s annual budget
that goes towards administrative costs is

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.029
about 6%, which is way less than what other
national governments spend.

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.169
Comparing the EU to any national governmental
body in terms of efficiency is going to end

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.299
up in a win for the EU, because its way smaller
and fulfills different functions.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.379
A look at the EU’s costs per capita, makes
this blatantly obvious.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.739
The EU doesn’t pay out social benefits or
any of that which allows it to pour the majority

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.230
of its budget directly back into its member
states, with the biggest chunk going towards

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.340
furthering economic development.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.790
If you’re curious where the money goes that
your country pays in, you can just look it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.319
up by selecting a country in the EU’s Budget
at a glance tool.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.939
Or if you want to know how it might affect
you directly, you can visit “what-the-eu-does-for-me.eu”

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.849
and check out what local projects have been
supported with EU funds.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.989
It's also wrong to think having the EU as
a super national body means significantly

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.909
more bureaucracy for its member states, let
alone times 2.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.719
For instance, because of the common market,
national governments don’t have to negotiate

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.680
trade agreements with one another and because
of free travel there are no border checks

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
anymore.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.650
The Big government slogan is put in this video
to cause a gut reaction from an American audience

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.580
to view the membership in the EU as bad, without
having to justify that claim.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.120
And you could easily use the same big vs.
Small government dichotomy to justify any

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.339
kind of separatist cause.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:35.090
Imagine having to deal with a city administration,
a state government and a federal government

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.659
on top of that!

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.909
Bureaucracy times three.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.829
Ludacris, I tell you.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.249
Let's get Germany back to when we had real
freedom as a patchwork of feudal city states.

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:48.769
But that was just the intro, so let's see
what Nigel Farage has in store for us.

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.150
I was also leader of the UK Independence Party,
or UKIP, where I lead Britain’s efforts

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.159
to leave the European Union.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.909
To their everlasting credit, that’s just
what happened on June the 23rd, 2016: The

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.659
United Kingdom left the European Union.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.849
The world knows it as “Brexit.”

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.389
Just a minor nitpick and some additional information
here.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.129
It's worth mentioning that Nigel Farage has
left UKIP since this video came out of the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.109
parties “anti-Islam fixation” and for
cuddling up to racist fraudster Tommy Robinson

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.310
or Andrew McMaster or whatever pseudonym he
goes by these days.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.710
I’m also not sure why Farage claims the
UK left on June 23ed 2016 or why the video

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.480
is titled in the past tense.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.590
The UK hasn’t left the EU, they just had
a non-binding referendum on if they should

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.370
do it but then again, minor nitpick.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.660
Brexit is a statement of national sovereignty.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.379
Don’t misunderstand me: I like nations.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.379
I like borders.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.419
I like the people that live within those borders
making their own laws.

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.860
But I don’t like it when faceless bureaucrats
make laws for nations they don’t even live

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.860
in.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.860
But that’s what they do in the European
Union.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.880
Imagine a Belgian telling a Brit how much
he can charge his customers—or the reverse.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.120
The EU bureaucrats do this in a myriad of
different ways, all day, every day.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.120
Okay.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.219
First real point, sovereignty.

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.740
And what sovereignty actually means can vary
a lot depending on who you ask, but for the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.990
sake of argument, let's use it as a standing
for self-governance.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.220
So the question is “will the UK have more
self-governance outside the EU than inside.”

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.190
Well, it definitely will have in some regards.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.900
Brushing aside that there are no EU laws on
the books, to whom the UK has not agreed,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.419
there won’t be other nations involved in
the making of laws and regulations.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.840
Or will there?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.419
Looking at the trade talks that have been
going on since the referendum, it becomes

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.120
clear that the former supposed “shackles”
the UK had a say over, will be replaced by

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.819
new ones, with much less leveraging power
on the side of the Brits.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:48.819
The US.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.229
For instance, knows that the UK is in a weak
position at the moment and uses that to push

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.780
for de-regulation of British markets and to
get rid of consumer protection guidelines.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.159
The most recent example being the US insisting
on lifting UK regulations on agricultural

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.009
goods as part of a post-Brexit trade deal.

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.990
This could also reduce the quality of food
for UK citizens since local industry might

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.060
have to lower its standards as well, to stay
competitive with US companies.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.900
And this is not project fear, its reality.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.800
It's happening right now.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.969
The US to UK ambassador recently even felt
obliged to publish and op-ed defending the

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.189
practice of bleaching chicken meat with chlorine,
a practice that has been banned in the EU

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.790
since the late nineties.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.389
And because these regulations are not linked
to access to the world's largest trading bloc

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.930
anymore, the UK doesn’t have much to combat
these demands.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.479
How's that for sovereignty.

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.280
And if the UK wants to continue to sell its
goods on the European market, its will still

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.400
have to abide by EU rules but without having
a seat at the table in terms of what those

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.900
rules actually are.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.620
Or take immigration for example, which I know
was a hot button issue prior to the referendum.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.469
Again, brushing aside that the UK already
had complete control over outside EU immigration

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:59.060
and also asylum policy, it looks like leaving
the EU will have the exact opposite effect

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.919
of what a lot of Brexiteers hoped for.

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.280
While it's safe to say that immigration from
EU countries towards the UK will decline,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.009
in fact that is already happening, immigration
from outside EU countries is rising, at the

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:11.159
same time.

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.460
And here is where we get back to leveraging
power.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.990
Countries like India or China, will couple
trade agreements with easier access to visas

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.650
for their citizens, something we are also
already seeing.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.590
Regarding those “faceless bureaucrats".

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.650
If I want to check who represents me in the
European parliament for instance, I can pretty

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.460
easily look up not only their faces but contact
details and parliamentary activities.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.090
But, in all fairness, people from other EU
member states are involved in drafting and

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.289
passing legislation that affects the UK.

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:41.360
But it's not like those laws only affect the
UK.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.550
They affect the entirety of the EU.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.460
Similar to how MPS in British parliament get
to vote on legislation that not only affects

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.620
the district they represent, but the rest
of the country as well.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.979
You see it right now with Brexit itself.

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:57.910
Scotland for instance voted to stay in the
EU but now are forced to leave regardless.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.310
And sadly there is no body like the EU commission
in the UK in which Scotland could veto important

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.310
decisions.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.000
But I don’t want to get ahead of myself.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.860
It is a conspiracy of the elites.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.660
Who are those elites?

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.699
Well, they’re a bunch of self-important,
overpaid, social engineers with useless college

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:20.620
degrees who have never done a proper day’s
work in their lives and have no connection

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.559
with ordinary, decent people.

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:29.009
I’ll take the good sense of an Italian farmer
or a French baker over the arid intellectualism

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.409
of an EU bureaucrat any day.

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:36.620
Now, there isn’t that much to say here except
that it's trying to frame Brexit as a “ordinary

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.500
people vs. Elites" issue, when I would say
it’s the exact opposite.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.050
The winners of Brexit will be rich people,
who due to the weak pound, will have it way

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.220
easier snatching up property in the UK.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.790
But regardless, if that prediction turns out
to be wrong it's not like Farage’s talking

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.550
point holds much water in the present.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.040
A 2013 study on the EU’s MEPs has found
that the number of elected officials who have

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.500
never been employed outside of politics, comes
in at about 10%.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.280
And while I had a hard time finding matching
data for the British parliament, a 2018 paper

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.420
by the House of Commons library puts the number
of MPS formerly working in politics at 17,1%

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.790
as of 2015.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.060
It's true however, that the EU parliament
has a large share of people from the upper

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.500
categories of the social space, like all parliaments
really.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.459
But there are also exceptions like former
President of the European Parliament Martin

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:26.880
Schulz, who was a bookseller prior to becoming
a politician.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.910
Compare that to Farage himself, who is a former
Broker, definitely a real job there.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.190
BUT if comrade Farage wants to make the case
how financial inequality translates into political

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.560
inequality, I’m all for that.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.740
Power to the people and all.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.990
I doubt that’s what he is going for though.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.610
And this is kind of unrelated but looking
up Farage’s background I got curious about

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.980
some other top Brexiteers, you know, the vanguard
against the out of touch EU elites and what

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.220
I found was reeeeaaally entertaining.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.190
For instance, while Jacob Rees Mogg was out
campaigning in his mid-twenties driving his

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.529
mother's Mercedes Benz he took the family
nanny with him.

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.260
*sigh* what a joke this all is.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.899
And I say these things not as an anti-European;
I love Europe!

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:12.829
It’s a fantastic, exciting, great continent:
different peoples, languages, and cultures.

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:18.560
But these peoples, with their languages and
cultures, have effectively been hijacked by

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.709
a giant, ever-expanding bureaucracy: the European
Union.

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:27.280
People will say, “but isn’t there a parliament,
a European parliament, that represents the

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.510
people of Europe?”

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:34.730
Well, yes, but this body has got no real power;
it can’t make its own laws.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.680
Rather, the power resides with the European
Commission.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.710
They’re unelected and they can’t be removed,
and that’s how absurd the whole thing is.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.221
Before we jump into the EU’s political system,
if “highjacked” means, they joined out

00:10:48.221 --> 00:10:52.860
of their own will to do so because they benefit
from EU membership, I would agree, otherwise

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.149
it's just a lie really.

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.320
Here is where we get to the big one.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.269
The EU commission and parliament.

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:01.610
And the commission has been a target for the
Leave campaign pretty much from the get-go

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.831
portraying it as the tool with which unelected
EU officials rule over EU citizens, who can’t

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:08.440
even vote them out of office.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.740
I don’t want to get into too much detail
on how EU legislation is drafted but it is

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.029
correct that the EU commission ultimately
calls the shorts.

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:20.200
While laws can be requested by the parliament,
the European central &amp; investment bank, 25%

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.030
of member states or the citizens themselves
by gathering signatures or submitting petitions,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.130
the commission doesn’t have to comply with
that.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.690
The parliament for instance can’t push a
law through the commission, no matter how

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.350
big the support is.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.880
And as far as I can see this argument has
been one that convinced a lot of people that

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.829
the EU is ultimately undemocratic and strips
its member states of their sovereignty.

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:44.630
In my opinion that viewpoint stems from a
fundamental misunderstanding of why the commission

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.589
exists in the first place, and what might
that be.

00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:52.700
Drumrolls please.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.210
The EU commission exists to protect the sovereignty
of its member states.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.920
For instance, if a couple of member states
would push for a legislation in parliament

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.550
that is to the disadvantage of another state,
that state can just veto the law via its seat

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.940
on the EU commission.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.519
It's true that the members of the commission
aren’t elected directly, but they have about

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:14.000
as much democratic legitimacy as a minister
on a national level.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.269
In addition, if the commission wants to pass
something, it has to be agreed upon by every

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:19.880
state representative.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.509
In the EU parliament, it's not that way.

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.870
Germany for instance has 99 MEPs, proportional
to the number of its citizens.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.399
A much smaller country like Estonia only has
6.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.759
But through the commission, it could block
legislation it didn’t want to pass despite

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:36.959
its much smaller representation in the EU
parliament.

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:40.699
Further the Commission can only propose laws
in areas where the national governments have

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:42.750
unanimously agreed to allow it.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.440
Put another way, the Commission can only propose
EU laws in areas where the UK government has

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.920
allowed it to do so.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.089
And naturally the EU parliament as well as
other stakeholders also have to approve laws

00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:54.769
put forward by the commission.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:57.650
It's also not true that EU commissioners can’t
be removed.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.209
The European Court of Justice as well as the
EU commission president can force a member

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:05.259
to resign and the EU parliament can even make
the entire commission resign via a vote of

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:06.630
no confidence.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.060
But just so you know, that doesn’t mean
there isn't a case in reforming the system

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.170
with for instance letting the commission president
be elected directly by the people.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.420
There is actually a lot of stuff about the
EU that sucks and I’ll talk about that a

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.970
bit later in the video but the sheer idiocy
by Farage and other Brexiteers doesn’t even

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.699
allow for that kind of nuance.

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:27.130
The European Parliament meets in Brussels.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.639
At least, that’s what I thought when I was
elected there.

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:33.160
But once a month, do you know what happens?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.029
They load the contents of our offices and
papers into big, plastic trunks, and they

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:45.410
put those trunks on lorries, and they drive
them nearly 400 miles down Europe’s motorways

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.250
to a French city called Strasbourg where,
for four days, the contents of our offices,

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:55.230
and our papers, are put into a new office,
and the parliament then sits there.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:00.209
Twelve times a year this back-and-forth happens,
and this from an organization who say they

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:03.420
want to reduce their level of carbon footprint!

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.360
This, from an organization whose accounts
have not been given a clean bill of health

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.550
by the auditors for the last twenty years!

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.399
This…a parliament?

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:15.779
It’s more like a traveling circus.

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:23.519
Now, all of Europe knows that it’s costing
nearly €300 million every year to move this

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:26.580
back and forth from Brussels to Strasbourg.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.470
Sorry I have to chime in here folks but with
these PragerU videos it's very hard to take

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.199
everything point by point.

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:35.389
What is described here as the traveling circus
is actually true.

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:40.230
Although the costs are closer to 114 million
euro annually according to a recent audit.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.009
It’s a waste of money that I think should
not happen.

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:46.129
Funnily enough this was initially done to
save money.

00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:49.920
Back in the fifties, there was no suitable
building available in Luxembourg, the seat

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.930
of the European coal and steel community which
was the predecessor to the EU.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.030
So, they picked Strasbourg and were able to
use the seat of the European Council, to save

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.030
money.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.500
Since then, a lot has happened and more and
more EU institutions have been concentrated

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.589
in Brussels but France does not want to let
go of their only major EU institution.

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:12.149
That said, the EU is not a monolith, most
MEPs actually oppose this and sometimes even

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:13.769
boycott gatherings in Strasbourg.

00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:16.350
So, we’ll see where it goes, I guess.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.759
But just to insert a sense of scale here.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:23.180
If you take the annual costs for moving to
Strasbourg and multiply that times three,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.870
you roughly have the estimated costs for Brexit
according to a study by the Centre for European

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.870
Reform.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.350
Although these numbers are hard to determine,
this estimate falls in line with the ones

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.589
from officials at the bank of England and
the UBS group.

00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:40.990
And when I say costs for Brexit, I mean costs
each week from the time of the referendum

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:46.220
to September 2018 resulting in roughly 20
billion euros up until that point.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.310
That’s just the estimated loss in GDP growth
by the way, not the money the British government

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.689
spends directly.

00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:56.040
Be that as it may, I genuinely have no idea
why they decided to include the records of

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.990
the EU’s court of auditors at that point
in the video.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.040
This court doesn’t judge what money is being
spent for, but the reliability of the financial

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040
records.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.990
So this money being spend on moving to Strasbourg,
in itself has no effect on their assessment.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.300
For the last few years, the court has judged
the records of the EU to be fair and accurate

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.129
but also found that more than 2% of payments
contain errors.

00:16:17.129 --> 00:16:20.899
And these errors usually boil down to stuff
like EU funds not being spent according to

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:25.399
established guidelines like awarding a EU-funded
contract directly without holding a proper

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.860
bidding process.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.389
And guess who is responsible for that.

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:30.090
It’s the member states.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.209
In the UK’s example a 2014 public accounts
committee criticized the following:

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:39.319
“Over the last decade, the UK Government
has incurred at least £650 million in penalties

00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:43.870
to the European Commission because of errors
in how UK public bodies have spent European

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.129
Union funds.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:49.570
EU rules and regulations for spending EU funds
are complex, and this in itself contributes

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.399
to errors; however, UK governments have chosen
to design programmes which have added to this

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:57.740
complexity, driving up the risk of errors
and penalties further.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.070
UK government departments have exhibited a
distinct lack of urgency in tackling complexity

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.300
and reducing the levels of penalties incurred.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.340
HM Treasury has not done enough to hold departments
to account for spending EU funds, nor to encourage

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.850
learning from best practice, nor to lead by
example by improving the quality of information

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.200
available on how well EU funds are spent in
the UK”

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.230
So much for that.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.670
Now let's listen to what Nigel Concludes from
the fact that France is able to block the

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.450
moving of parliament to Brussels entirely.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.770
So why isn’t it reformed?

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:31.230
Well, the way the EU has been structured,
to change that would require changing the

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:38.310
treaties, and to change the treaties would
need all 28 member governments to agree not

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.580
to go to Strasbourg twelve times a year.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.870
And do you know something?

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.390
The French are never going to agree to that,
‘cause it’s in their economic interests

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.380
for the traveling circus to go to Strasbourg.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:54.330
And it shows you that a system of law-making
has been devised where not only can the voters

00:17:54.330 --> 00:18:00.740
not change anything, but the institutions
themselves are pretty much incapable of reform.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.720
Now if you’re like me, you might be a bit
confused by now.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.370
Because apparently, it’s a big problem for
Nigel Farage that member states can dictate

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.290
law to other member states (which they can’t,
for the record) but it's also bad that every

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.670
country has the ability to block changes that
are not in their interest.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.800
I’m starting to think a large portion of
EU criticism by right-wingers is just a inner

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.370
political tool and lacks any kind of substance
or consistency.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:31.770
But were about to be served a real example
of supposed EU tyranny so let's listen in:

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:40.880
The United Kingdom is an island; it’s surrounded
by the sea, and yet, as members of the European

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:48.270
Union, we were only allowed to catch 20% of
the fish swimming in territorial British waters.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.370
What that meant was tens of thousands of jobs
were lost in Britain’s coastal communities

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.830
as we effectively gave away the ability to
look after one of our greatest resources to

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.650
a bureaucracy based in Brussels.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.000
This is the last point Nigel brings up and
it's also a very common one.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.470
But the way this is framed should make your
ears ring from the start really.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.910
Because if Britain was only allowed to catch
20% of the fish swimming in British waters,

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:17.630
implying other EU states take the other 80%
there wouldn’t be any fish left would there.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.000
It's true however that how much fish Britain
is allowed to catch, is subject to a quota,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.020
negotiated on an EU level.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.500
Britain's share in this quota is about 30%
and that is because there is no such thing

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.620
as a “British fish”.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.520
That implication is a red herring.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.540
Fish don’t respect national boundaries and
depending on the fish and time of year they

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.520
move in and out of British waters.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.920
In the case of North Sea herring for example,
most of the juveniles live in the south east

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.620
corner around the German bight, whereas the
adults tend to congregate around the Shetland

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.290
Isles prior to spawning at various sites along
the British coast.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.620
This is why EU countries strike agreements
on how much each member state can catch.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.890
It's also not like it's just 30% that Britain
gets, it depends on the fish really.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:09.170
For example, the UK gets 84% of the North
Sea haddock quota, 81% of the North Sea monkfish

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:15.330
quota and 98% of the west of Scotland prawn
quota; but only 4% of the North Sea sprat

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.330
quota.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.910
Adding to that, these quotas are largely based
around the agreements that existed prior to

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.200
the EU, some even date back to the middle
ages.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.350
So leaving the EU does not mean the UK will
have more control over how much fish they

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.700
catch, they just opt-out of the existing agreement
and will ultimately have to strike another

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.700
one.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.890
But wait, I hear you say.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.760
Can’t the UK just say, these are our waters,
we will catch how much we please, and we don’t

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.910
care about other countries, they can just
stick to their own waters.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.760
Theoretically speaking that’s possible but
here’s where we get to what actually destroyed

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.390
a significant part of the British fishing
industry.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.210
It's called the “cod wars” which were
a series of disputes over fishing rights between

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.900
the UK and Iceland.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.190
Mostly they were kicked off by Iceland going:
“See these waters over there?

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.470
Yeah that’s our fishing territory now”.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.941
At one point it even escalated to ships intentionally
ramming in to one another, British fisher

00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:08.530
boats requiring protection from the royal
navy and Iceland allegedly demanding the US

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.940
to send fighter jets and bomb British ships.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.810
Isn’t history amazing.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.870
In the end all these disputes ended in favor
of Iceland, resulting in thousands of British

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.290
fishermen becoming redundant.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.800
Here you might be asking yourself how a nation
like Iceland, was able to force a naval super

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.830
power like Britain into submission.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.750
It was actually pretty easy for Iceland.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.720
They just threatened to pull out of NATO.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.030
And since Iceland is placed in the Greenland
Iceland UK Gap which was a submarine warfare

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.140
chokepoint during the cold war, the UK had
no choice but to back down.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.080
One more thing regarding fishing rights tough.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.850
It's true that even after the cod wars, small
fishing business that make up the engines

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.560
of a lot of coastal communities have been
declining.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.100
But this is much more likely down to the fact
that the splitting up of the quota, which

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.650
the UK government is responsible for, is mostly
ending in favor of large companies, rather

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.020
than small ones.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.550
Now why am I telling you about the cod wars?

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.660
In my opinion this is the perfect showcase
why “sovereignty” is such a useless term

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.680
surrounding the Brexit discussion.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.430
Britain isn't an empire anymore.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.070
They will have to work with other countries
in an increasing globalized world.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.980
Understanding that is one of the reasons the
EU exists in the first place.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.870
Together, we have a much better chance to
make our own rules and not become prey to

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.250
other world powers imposing their will onto
us.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.270
That's why the domino effect that Nigel Farage
predicts at the end of the video didn’t

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.270
happen.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.090
I want good relations between all the European
nations.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:33.360
I want prosperous, free, and fair trade between
those nations.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.160
But I’ll be damned if I’m going to give
up my rights as a British citizen so that

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.640
some Eurocrat can tell me how to live.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.580
I won’t do it, and I’m certain that across
the continent, ultimately, the French and

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.840
the Italians won’t put up with it either.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.010
I’m Nigel Farage

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.180
The leave camp seems to have miscalculated
who the dominant power in Europe really is

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.110
and that this power will do everything to
protect its member states and demonstrate

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.890
that being in the EU actually means something.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.320
F.I. prior to the referendum when the subject
of the Irish border came up, as rarely as

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.270
that happened, prominent Brexiteers seemed
pretty confident to be able to struck a deal

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.650
with the EU, despite its red lines on the
issue.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.350
Now, it turns out that the EU won't throw
Ireland under the bus and the UK slowly starts

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.790
to realize what being outside the club really
means.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:23.800
And don’t get me wrong there are aspects
about the EU that are genuinely worth of criticism.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.220
We see it right now with the huge opposition
to article 13.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.350
And if you’re mad about that, here’s what
you can do.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:35.260
Keep that anger inside, grow it, care for
it like some kind of rage baby and then let

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.320
it out at the ballot box during the European
elections in May.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.040
Here’s a handy breakdown of which party
voted in favor of it.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.570
Besides that, I would even go as far as to
say the EU project will fail if it doesn’t

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.820
find an alternative to its dysfunctional monetary
policy.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.290
Setting up the EU like I would like to have
it would not only require changing several

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.990
treaties but also the shift away from neo-liberal
politics.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.440
And although movements a springing up that
push for a change like this, it remains a

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.070
gigantic challenge.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.290
But even if the UK would take a significant
swing to the left after leaving the EU, it

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.460
cannot escape the gravitational influence
of Europe.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.450
21st century socialism requires trans-national
cooperation.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:19.310
Brexit as a project of nationalist retrenchment
offers nothing to combat the effects of global

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.430
capitalism.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.270
I always felt like I missed my chance to make
a video about Brexit since I wasn’t making

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.791
videos while the decision was made but as
seen in this video, even now the people who

00:24:28.791 --> 00:24:32.530
pushed for Brexit deny to accept what has
become an obvious truth.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.350
Brexit was and is a giant con.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.260
It’s a dangerous fantasy that won’t solve
Britain's problems and will also make life

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.260
worse for the average person.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.450
And the people who pushed for it and remain
to push for it despite this reality, deserve

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:50.010
to be hounded out of their political careers
for so willingly deceiving the people they

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.950
are supposed to represent.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.710
So that was that.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.610
What kind of put me of about making a video
on Brexit was that the timing always seemed

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.330
wrong since so much is happening and there
are new developments every day.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.661
And with Brexit possibly being postponed now
and Labor backing a second referendum, who

00:25:07.661 --> 00:25:09.039
knows what will happen?

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:11.580
Maybe there will really be a second chance
to decide.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.650
Or perhaps I’ll have to set up some kind
of refugee commune for British left-tubers

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.530
here on the mainland.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.960
Another thing that I couldn’t find a right
spot for in this video is that non-Brits who

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.050
oppose Brexit should keep in mind that a bunch
of people didn’t vote for Brexit or have

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.730
since changed their mind.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.500
With Europe’s growing frustration at Brexit
I’ve repeatedly seen anger over Brexit being

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.720
expressed as sort of casual bigotry and we
shouldn’t ever let that slide.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.330
I think that’s it for today.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.740
If you listened to me ramble over the credits,
you’re probably extremely impressed by the

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.790
names rolling by.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.720
Luckily you can get in on the action by becoming
a Patron via the link in the description.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.230
My last couple of videos we’re light on
history unfortunately but I’m going to make

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.600
it up with the next one, when we’ll talk
about the Crusades.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.110
How exciting!

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.650
Until then, let's just all try to stick it
out and I hope to see you the next time.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:59.510
Have a good one.
