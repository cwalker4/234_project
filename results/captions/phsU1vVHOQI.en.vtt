. &gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK TO FRIDAY NIGHT

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.498 line:92%
BROADCAST. LET'S AGREE FOR THE SAKE OF THE

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.432 line:92%
NEXT CONVERSATION THAT DONALD TRUMP USES THE MOST COLORFUL

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:14.532 line:92%
LANGUAGE OF ANY PRESIDENT AT LEAST IN THE MODERN ERA AND SAYS

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.232 line:92%
SOME OF THE MOST QUESTIONABLE THINGS.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.998 line:92%
AND THAT IS WHERE OUR NEXT GUEST COMES IN.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:25.632 line:92%
JOHN IS A LINGUIST. HE HAS A PH.D..

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:29.532 line:92%
HE TEACHES AT COLUMBIA. HE TOO IS COLORFUL WHEN TALKING

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.898 line:92%
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THIS PRESIDENT

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.065 line:92%
TALKS. THAT'S WHY WE TALKED ABOUT IT

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.532 line:92%
WITH JOHN McWHARTER. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.732 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, BRIAN. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU,

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:50.599 line:92%
WHAT IS YOUR LING WIS TICKS DEFINITION OF THIS PRESIDENT?

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:55.265 line:92%
&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP LINGUISTIKALLY IS UNADORNED.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.332 line:92%
THIS IS THE BASICS. THIS IS WHAT LANGUAGE WAS

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.999 line:92%
UNDOUBTEDLY LIKE WHEN IT FIRST EMERGED AMONG PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.199 line:92%
HAVE WRITING AND WERE FIRST GETTING THEIR VERBAL SEA LEGS.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.199 line:92%
THIS IS WHERE IT STARTED. AND SO IN THAT WAY, AS IN SO

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.065 line:92%
MANY OTHERS, DONALD TRUMP IS AN ORIGINAL.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:13.498 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD MEAN THAT EDUCATION AND SCHOOLING HAS HAD

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:18.565 line:92%
NO EFFECT ON HIS USE OF LANGUAGE WAJ.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.632 line:92%
HE'S QUICK TO REMIEPD US HE WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOLS.

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:27.198 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AND LEARNED NOTHING IN THEM. HE SPEAKS LIKE ONE WHO PAID NO

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.232 line:92%
EDUCATION TO ONE OF THE GOALS OF EDUCATION WHICH IS TO REFINE OUR

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.765 line:92%
SPEECH. HE USES THOSE SAME WAYS OF

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.165 line:92%
SPEAKING IN WHAT MOST OF US USED TO CONSIDER FORMAL.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.898 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IN YOUR LINE OF WORK THEY CALL IT A TAG.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.298 line:92%
WHEN SOMETHING IS ADDED TO THE END OF A TRADITIONAL SENTENCE.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:51.465 line:92%
SO OFTEN HE WILL TAG A SENTENCE WITH BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE ME, AND

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:52.932 line:92%
ENFORCER. SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS LACKING

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.998 line:92%
IN THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:02:00.965 line:92%
IT'S THAT HE'S REINFORCING. ALSO HE'S USING ORAL SPEECH.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.565 line:92%
WE'RE CHECKING TO SEE THAT THE OTHER PERSON

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:06.865 line:92%
WE'RE SAYING, THEY'RE IN THE SAME BOAT WE ARE.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.532 line:92%
THAT'S WHAT "YOU KNOW IS, " THINGS LIKE LOL IN TEXTING.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.798 line:92%
HE DOES THAT, TOO, BUT ONCE

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.432 line:92%
AGAIN IT'S NOT IN TEXTING, HE'S DOING IT IN FORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:22.699 line:92%
WHICH MEANS THAT HE NEVER LEAVES THE REALM OF THE CASUAL WHEN HE

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:27.165 line:92%
SPEAKS. WHICH IS UNLIKE EVEN SAY

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.599 line:92%
INDIGENOUS SOCIETIES WHERE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS READ NG

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.332 line:92%
AND WRITING, THERE'S ALWAYS A HIGH AND LOW WAY OF TALKING.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:38.599 line:92%
THE CHIEF DOESN'T GET UP AND RUN HIS MOUTH, OURS DOES.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:45.165 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A FRIEND OF OUR BROADCAST WHO WORKS FOR THE WALL

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.432 line:92%
STREET JOURNAL AND SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THERE ARE VISUAL

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:53.132 line:92%
AND AUDIO TELLS THAT HE PEPPERS HIS SPEECH WITH WHERE IF YOU

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.298 line:92%
KNOW WHAT'S COMING, YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.498 line:92%
I WANT TO RUN A MONTAGE OF A TRUMP PHRASE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:06.165 line:92%
IN HIS READING OF IT. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW FOR DONALD

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.565 line:92%
TRUMP MEANS I JUST LEARNED. HERE'S THE EXAMPLE.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.865 line:92%
&gt;&gt; FRANCE IS AMERICA'S FIRST AND OLDEST ALLY.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.699 line:92%
OUR FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN RAN HIS FIRST F

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.999 line:92%
CAMPAIGN TORE PUBLIC OFFICE IN 1832.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:23.865 line:92%
GREAT PRESIDENT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW HE

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:26.265 line:92%
WAS A REPUBLICAN, RIGHT? DOES ANYONE KNOW?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.865 line:92%
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WE ARE A

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.765 line:92%
UNBELIEVABLY DIVIDED COUNTRY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S A

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.965 line:92%
UNBELIEVABLY COMPLEX SUBJECT. NOBODY KNEW HEALTH CARE COULD BE

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.832 line:92%
TO COMPLICATED. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LAUGHING, WHY?

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:48.632 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THAT ASPECT OF HIM, I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING PARTICULARLY

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:52.132 line:92%
LINGUISTIC ABOUT IT. HE HAS THE NEED TO BE THE ALPHA

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.132 line:92%
MALE, THE IDEA MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS IS COMING FROM THE

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:58.265 line:92%
SAME WELL. THE IDEA IS HE'S ALWAYS THE ONE

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.465 line:92%
WHO'S ONE STEP AHEAD. IN THAT, FRANKLY, I DON'T FIND

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.265 line:92%
HIM LINGUISTICALLY CHALLENGED AS SOMEBODY WHO'S AUDIBLY

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.932 line:92%
ADOLESCENT FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S A SENIOR CITIZEN.

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:11.532 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT HIS OTHER FAVORITES, BELIEVE ME AND MORE

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:15.065 line:92%
THAN EVER BEFORE, OR MORE THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE?

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.565 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY ONLY -- I'M SORRY

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.698 line:92%
TO SAY IT, BUT THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY THOUGHTS.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:25.665 line:92%
AND SO OFTEN HE'S SPEAKING, AND I THINK HE RUNS OUT OF NEW

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:29.132 line:92%
INSIGHTS SO HE COVERS IT WITH THINGS LIKE BELIEVE ME OR IT

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:33.298 line:92%
CAN'T EVER BE THAT SOMETHING IS BAD, IT'S VERY BAD OR VERY, VERY

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:37.665 line:92%
BAD. THOSE ARE HIS EQUIVALENTS OF

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:39.965 line:92%
ROUGHLY, UM OR SCRATCHING HIS HEAD.

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.632 line:92%
I HI THE CONTENT OF WHAT HE'S SAYING IS SLIMMER THAN THE BULK

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:48.932 line:92%
OF THE VERBIAGE THAT HE SPUS OUT.

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:54.998 line:92%
&gt;&gt; HE'S 71 YEARS OLD NOW PRESIDENT IN A AGE OF INSTAND

00:04:55.133 --> 00:05:00.132 line:92%
TAKENIOUS FACT CHECKING. HE'S NOT USED TO HIS AD-LIB

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:05.465 line:92%
BEING FACT CHECKED IN REAL TIME. DO YOU THINK HE'S BUMPED UP

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.698 line:92%
AGAINST THAT DYNAMIC. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK HE'LL CHANGE IN

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:12.632 line:92%
THAT WAY. HE SIMPLY HAS NO DEODORANT

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.765 line:92%
WEARING SUNDAY BEST WAY OF SPEAKING, THAT INCLUDES YOU HAVE

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.999 line:92%
TO HAVE A MORE RESPONSIBLE SENSE OF TRUTH THAN WHEN YOU'RE JUST

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:24.698 line:92%
BSING WITH YOUR PALS. WHEN WE SPEAK CASUALLY ALL THE

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:28.132 line:92%
TIME WE SAY THINGS WHERE MAYBE IF WE CHECKED UP ON IT THINGS

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:30.332 line:92%
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE

00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:32.865 line:92%
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU CAN'T JUST TALK.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:36.565 line:92%
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE JUST TALKING BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING

00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:40.498 line:92%
YOUR MOUTH, BUT THERE'S THIS OTHER ART THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.732 line:92%
TO MASTER. HE WASN'T NRD THAT SORT OF THING

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:46.998 line:92%
IN SCHOOL. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHOS NUMBER TO

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:52.565 line:92%
THE ARTFUL. HE HAS A NARCOTIC JOY IN

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.598 line:92%
DISMISSAL AND BEE LITTLE MEANT RATHER THAN BUILDING AND

00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:58.432 line:92%
DECORATING. AND SO HE'S GOING TO KEEP

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.265 line:92%
RUNNING UP AGAINST THE WALL. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHEN

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.932 line:92%
YOU'RE PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS WHICH ARE

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:11.965 line:92%
WHAT WE CALL TRUTH THINGS IN LINGUISTIC.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.765 line:92%
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU JOINING THE INTERSECTION OF NARSY SISM AND

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.932 line:92%
LINGUISTIC. &gt;&gt; HE IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:24.632 line:92%
GET SOMEBODY EXTREMELY ARTFUL AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:27.765 line:92%
CLINICALLY NARCISSISTIC AND TALKING ALL THE TIME TO US IN

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.065 line:92%
OUR HOUSES ABOUT SERIOUS THINGS. THAT'S WHAT'S SO STRIKING ABOUT

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.365 line:92%
LISTENING TO THIS PERSON TALK. WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE IS HOW MUCH

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.932 line:92%
WE'VE HAD TO LISTEN TO IT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE UNDER

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:42.632 line:92%
ANY IMPRESSION THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE'RE IN A

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:44.832 line:92%
INFORMAL ERA. IN A WAY, HE'S A PRODUCT OF

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:50.065 line:92%
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE MID '60s AND IN MANY

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.798 line:92%
CASE IT'S IN GOOD WAYS. IN AMERICA YOU AND I WOULD HAVE

00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:58.832 line:92%
HAD TO WEAR DID HE DOORA ASSEN SUITS EVEN ON HOT SUMMER DAYS,

00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:04.265 line:92%
BUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT LEFT WAS YOU PUT SPEECH IN ITS SUNDAY

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.632 line:92%
BEST. ALL OF US FAKE IT TO A EXTENT.

00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:11.632 line:92%
WE COULD HAVE PREDICTED SOMEBODY WOULD COME ALONG WHO WOULD ONLY

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:13.465 line:92%
TALK RATHER THAN SPEAK AND BECOME PRESIDERESIDENT OF THE U

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.165 line:92%
STATES. I DON'T THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.265 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
BE LAST IN THAT
