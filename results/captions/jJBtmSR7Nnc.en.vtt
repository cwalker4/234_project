00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:01.567
- You know the word scapegoat?

00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:03.636
(laughs)

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:06.872
(music)

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:08.874
There's a reason we get
blamed for everything.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.676
(laughs)

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.878
(music)

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.314
Goats are living.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.318
They are a living
bundle of energy.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.421
- They are so perfectly
designed to eat the brush

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.759 align:start size:88% position:13%
and thorny stuff
because they just go...

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.997 align:start size:94% position:6%
- They butt heads and
play king on the mountain

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There's a lot of byproducts
and things that the goats

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.703
are doing besides just eating
vegetation or weed control.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:41.374
- [Lani] This is a fun,
joyful, alive energy

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.211
that is doing the
work on the land.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.612 align:start size:94% position:6%
- A lot of people will
come out here and just sit

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.948
and watch the goats for hours.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.317 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So it's bringing everything
to life and there's a joy

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
that comes with it
but you can't get that

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.220
with a mowing machine.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.156
You can't get it with chemicals.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:00.659 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So the goats are
doing 15 things at once.

- [Narrator] Goats Eat Weeds
on this Farm to Fork Wyoming.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.635
- [Announcer] Production
on Farm to Fork Wyoming

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.838
is made possible with
the generous support

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.139
of viewers like you.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.973
Thank you.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.113
(rooster crows)

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:22.081
- A lot of these weeds are here

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.616
because this land was stressed.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.818
When this, I'm guessing this
housing development came in

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.920
and they, you know,
they kind of rescaped

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.624
and restructured this land
and so when it was disturbed,

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.326
you know, mother nature's
band aid, it's annuals

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:36.495
and it's biannuals and
the succession of plants.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:41.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Our business is goat weed
grazing and our purpose

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.302
is to improve the soil.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:47.073
So, that way, you can
actually control weeds.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.776 align:start position:0%
- You know, so we're after just
improving the soil quality.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:53.345
A lot of people get hung
up on what's above ground,

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.081 align:start size:97% position:3%
as the symptoms, and then they
want a sprayer or something

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.351 align:start size:97% position:3%
to kill what's above ground
and we're focused on promoting

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:03.222
life in the soil to allow the
native desired plants to grow.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.858 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Narrator] Man has
waged war on weeds since

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:08.194
the beginning of agriculture.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.130
Some weeds are put on
the noxious weed list,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.734
outlawed and targeted
with chemical sprays.

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.637
- The description of
what a noxious weed is,

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:21.207
is it's a non native,
very aggressive plant.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:24.877
- [Narrator] Leafy spurge,
Russian knapweed and kochia

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:27.679
have made countless
acres unpalatable

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.582
to cattle, horses and wildlife.

00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:33.019
- Unfortunately,
people have sprayed

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
so many herbicides
that kochia's resistant

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.791 align:start size:84% position:16%
to about every
chemical known to man.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.097
- [Narrator] For these
contract goat herders,

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:47.166
the trick is not to win
the noxious weed battle

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.603 align:start size:94% position:6%
with herbicides, but to
participate in what nature

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.238
is trying to accomplish.

00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:55.174
- [Greg] You have good soil,
you're gunna have good grass.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.176
It's pretty much
impossible not to.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] Recognizing the
importance of the animal,

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.549
plant, soil connection,
these goat herders work

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
to convert weeds into something
that feeds the soil life.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.988 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The goats just happen
to eat the weeds,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.257 align:start size:97% position:3%
but, you know, they manage
the cows, the sheep, the deer,

00:03:12.257 --> 00:03:15.394
whatever you happen to be on
there, I mean, that's required

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:18.264
to have a good, healthy
range, land and soil

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.698
is to actually graze it.

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:21.801
- [Narrator] So they
bring in goats to eat

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:26.071
the invasive plant the cattle,
horses and wildlife will not.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.273
- So these are Cashmere goats.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.909 align:start size:84% position:16%
They, evolution wise,
come from the top

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.612 align:start size:94% position:6%
of the Himalaya mountains
but a lot of weeds

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:36.282 align:start size:97% position:3%
come from Eurasia so, you
know, they have a connection

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:39.051 align:start size:81% position:19%
that cattle and
horses don't have.

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
These have the enzymes and
bacteria that they can utilize

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:46.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
all these insane plants that
cattle and horses can't.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.527
- [Narrator] So the
goal is to augment

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.797
nature's restoration process.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.568 align:start size:94% position:6%
- When you have a
disturbance to any ground

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.973
and, it could be a natural
disturbance, like right now

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:04.043 align:start size:94% position:6%
the floods, hurricane,
drought, fire, that causes

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:10.049 align:start size:97% position:3%
the ground to be bare, mother
nature is gunna rush in

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.550
and protect that.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.053
She sees that there's a
wound, like I get a scab.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:18.524 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's to protect my
surface and keep my boundary

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.961
of my skin intact and,
so, mother nature does

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.697 align:start size:81% position:19%
the same thing
and who does that?

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.465
Our annual weeds.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:28.334
That's their job so they rush in

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:32.638
so you have cheatgrass
here, kochia, sunflowers,

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:36.843
lamb's quarters, tumble
weeds, Russian thistle,

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:40.212
halogeton, all of
those annual weeds.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:44.517
That is their job in plant
succession is to rush in

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.119
and cover that wound
and protect the surface

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.122
and hold your water in.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.224 align:start size:94% position:6%
Next, if you don't do
anything, you're gunna see

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:54.726 align:start size:84% position:16%
biannual plants,
weeds, which would be

00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:58.664 align:start size:84% position:16%
all of the thistles
except Canada thistle.

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:02.668 align:start size:94% position:6%
Common mullein,
houndstongue, dyer's woad.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.837
Takes two years for
it to make a seed

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:08.874 align:start size:97% position:3%
and get that root going down
so it's starting to build

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:11.677 align:start size:84% position:16%
soil structure and
bring other things up.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.078
So that's the biannual.

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:14.747 align:start size:84% position:16%
You have bare ground,
annual, biannual,

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:16.582
then you start to
see perennials.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.284
Often you'll see the
perennial weeds first.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:22.722
Leafy spurge, Russian
knapweed, bindweed,

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:28.294
dalmation toadflax, all of
those that are a big problem.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.630
Canada thistle,
you'll see those.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.467
And then you'll see grass
and then, and this is like,

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:38.337
doing nothing, so, in a dry
environment like Wyoming,

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:42.007
this could be 400 years
for this to progress

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:46.179 align:start position:0%
but it's the natural progression
and then you see brush

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:50.048
and then you see trees.

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:52.118 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] It is the plant
world's way of bringing

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:55.688
trace minerals up to the
surface where the biology

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.490
in the soil needs it.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.992
- Some of these other noxious
weeds we have in the area,

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.494
one of the reasons they can
survive so well is they have

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:05.297 align:start size:84% position:16%
a tremendous root
system and they can go

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:07.499 align:start size:94% position:6%
so much further down
than those normal grasses

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.069 align:start size:88% position:13%
and normal vegetation
does that they can reach

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.872
way down there and
so they'll pull up

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.141 align:start size:97% position:3%
the nutrients that the
other grasses can't get to.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.642
- So, all of these
plant, you know,

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:20.079 align:start size:97% position:3%
they have different purposes
and different skills.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.816 align:start size:88% position:13%
The Astragalus species,
which are vetches,

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.987 align:start position:0%
are the only plant that can
bring selenium up from the soil.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.489
The only plant.

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.458
So they all do their
thing and all the roots

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.259
go to different depths.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.296 align:start position:0%
Russian knapweed and the
knapweeds pull up a lot of zinc.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:40.932 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So, by either trampling
them on the ground

00:06:40.932 --> 00:06:42.735 align:start size:84% position:16%
or on the surface, and
then trampling them

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.438 align:start size:94% position:6%
and putting that nutrients
back into the topsoil,

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:49.642 align:start size:94% position:6%
or by an animal eating
that vegetation, you know,

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.177 align:start size:84% position:16%
as the whole nutrient
cycle starts over

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start size:94% position:6%
with nutrients that nobody
else is able to get to.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.516 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Goats like Russian knapweed
so you have two choices

00:06:57.516 --> 00:07:00.652
if you have a herd
of cattle or horses

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.354 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you have a whole
bunch of Russian knapweed.

00:07:02.354 --> 00:07:05.090
One is you kill it all or go
get something that eats it...

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.158
(laughs)

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:07.292
and use it.

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:09.628 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's a natural resource,
why not use it?

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.964
All I do is recycle it.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Come on nanny,
nanny, nanny, nannies!

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:16.769 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] Greg and
Carolina are actually raising

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.805 align:start size:88% position:13%
meat goats on leafy
spurge, which is one of

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:22.408 align:start size:88% position:13%
the worst weed
problems rancher's face

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.142
in the Devil's Tower area.

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:27.046
- If there's spurge,
they'll eat the spurge

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.580
before the thistle.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.216
Totally addicted to it and
it doesn't take them long.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.952
You don't have to teach
them to eat leafy spurge.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.622 align:start size:97% position:3%
As soon as they take a
bite, it just sends a signal

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.624 align:start size:97% position:3%
to their brain, like,
okay, this is what we want.

00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:41.460
- [Narrator] Sending
yearly goats to market

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.330
is how they're able to make
a profit as contract grazers.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.765 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Greg] Yeah, they
gotta do well, I mean,

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:49.602 align:start size:97% position:3%
majority of our income
comes from selling the meat.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.806 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, we get very
little for grazing contract.

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:57.175
- [Narrator] At 20% protein,

00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:59.611
spurge is a high quality forage.

00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:00.679
- [Greg] They gain great on it.

00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:01.948
- [Carolina] Oh,
yeah, they gain.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.148
- [Greg] Yeah!

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Carolina] But
it's a high protein.

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.185
- They do well on spurge.

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.887
- 20% protein or something.

00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:13.025 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] And these animals
are incredibly adaptable.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:16.762 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Carolina] We like a Spanish
goat with lots of cashmere

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.965 align:start size:97% position:3%
for the winter cause we don't
have a barn or anything.

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:22.701 align:start size:94% position:6%
This is a, you know, we're
totally a range outfit.

00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:26.873 align:start size:97% position:3%
No farm or barn for the goats
to go into in the winter.

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:32.511
We supplement with hay but
they still graze, you know,

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:36.682 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they live off brush
and pine trees and junipers

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:39.485
and we do all that
kind of clean up

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:42.254 align:start size:94% position:6%
which they're really
good at and they love it.

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:44.490
- [Greg] Just cut down a
tree, let them clean it up

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.724
and then haul it out.

00:08:45.724 --> 00:08:47.626
- As soon as they hear
a chainsaw they just...

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:48.827
- Yeah, you know.

00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:50.095 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They just come
running like "ahhh!"

00:08:50.095 --> 00:08:51.296
- Depending on how
much snow we have.

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:53.465 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Forget the alfalfa
hay, pine trees!

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.801
- Yeah, yeah we can call
'em with the chainsaw.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.103
It's pretty bad.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.171 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Narrator] While Devil's
Tower Goats relies on

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:02.274
ranch contracts to raise
their goats for market,

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:06.512
Goat Green LLC has developed
the same Spanish goat breed

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:10.550
to work everything from
open range to city lots.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.451
- We're out in production
agriculture, you know?

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're a service
contracted business.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're not worried
about putting weight

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:18.990
on these animals for
slaughter, you know?

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.659
We want ours skinny and hungry

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:22.694
and a little bit wild, you know?

00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:25.697 align:start size:84% position:16%
We don't want tame,
very heavy, fat goats.

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.499
Very difficult for
our border collie

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:29.502
to herd a tame goat, you know?

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:30.702 align:start size:84% position:16%
They just stand
there and look at 'em

00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:32.537 align:start size:84% position:16%
and, you know, I
want ours to be wild

00:09:32.537 --> 00:09:34.206
and when I bring the
border collie in here

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:37.243 align:start size:97% position:3%
to herd 'em, they understand
that they need to go.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.913 align:start size:97% position:3%
- This herd right now, these
babies are six months old

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:44.483 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they've been on a
truck maybe twelve times,

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.720
they've worked in four states
and they've been on 15 jobs.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.191
They're not even six months
old, so, this is their life.

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.560
Now, some of the older ones in
here have maybe in on a truck

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
500 times and
worked in 15 states

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:03.636
and eaten many, many,
many different plants,

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:06.238 align:start size:81% position:19%
so, one of the
value of this herd

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:10.409
because I don't kill 'em for
slaughter, is their knowledge

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:16.782
and their training and their
ability to eat everything.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:19.484 align:start size:97% position:3%
For instance, poison hemlock,
even though these babies

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:22.888
have never been on poison
hemlock, the mothers have

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:27.059 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the gut system can
process these poisonous plants

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:31.530 align:start size:97% position:3%
that these goats have eaten
over my last 22 years.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.199
The herd has a memory,
the gut has a memory

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:36.235
and the behavior has a memory.

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:39.638
Now, the mama goats here
were right here last year.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
The goats in Cheyenne,
we've been there,

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:44.510
they have a memory and
they know that town.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.878
- We've had the city
of Cheyenne contract

00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:48.647
off and on for about 20 years.

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:50.649
So, there's two creeks
that run through town.

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:53.385
One is Crow Creek,
one is Dry Creek.

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:56.822
We have very narrow
sets here in Cheyenne

00:10:58.189 --> 00:11:01.627
because of the creek,
so, it's kind of...

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.799 align:start size:94% position:6%
Can be a bit dangerous
when something spooks them

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.835
or scares them like
that motorcycle there

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.404
or a helicopter because
there's an air force base

00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:16.609
here in Cheyenne, so, if
something spooks them,

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:18.110
they have nowhere to run.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.645
It's so narrow.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:22.548
So, that's an issue that we
deal with here in Cheyenne.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:25.351
Right along the street, the
highways, the bike paths...

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.686 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Goats know where the water
is, they know the plants,

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:30.689
they know the traffic,
they know the people,

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:31.723
they know everything.

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:33.025
They know the predators.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:36.095
- Also the people
along the bike path

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:40.599
and loose dogs are
our biggest issues.

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:44.170
- So once the goats are
trained, they are very,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.239 align:start size:94% position:6%
very valuable to be alive
and have that memory.

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:47.273
- [Narrator] And they perform
many functions at one time.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
- They're doin' weed control,
fire fuel mitigation,

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.778
flood mitigation,
bank stabilization.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:55.214
Goats will come down to
get a drink and shave off

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.449
some of those steep banks
that you see over here

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:00.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
and get some of the
seeding and vegetation

00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:03.289
along those banks so those
banks don't erode any further

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.158 align:start size:88% position:13%
and create more erosion
and steeper banks.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:09.828
And so we focus along the
creeks where they can't get

00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:13.098 align:start size:97% position:3%
machinery down into, near
the banks and then, you know,

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:16.401
they can't spray herbicides
or pesticides near the water.

00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:19.237
- This isn't necessarily a
fire fuel mitigation job.

00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:22.141
We just came from one
of those, and so you...

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.610
You know, everything is time
management with the goats.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.812 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're just a grazing
tool in order to,

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:30.349 align:start size:97% position:3%
you know, help the land,
whatever you're trying to do.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:33.152 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, the previous contract
with the fire fuel mitigation,

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:36.088
you know, we're reducing
all that vegetation below,

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:37.356
you know, they'll jump up

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:39.524
and eat so it's about
eight feet and below.

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:41.493
So we'll reduce all
that vegetation down
there which is how

00:12:41.493 --> 00:12:45.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
the fire travels and then
we recycle all the nutrients

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:47.932 align:start size:94% position:6%
above ground, we're
recycling into the ground,

00:12:47.932 --> 00:12:49.668
which is 100% organic matter.

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:51.537 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's, you know,
there's no viable seed

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.071
that goes through
a goat's system.

00:12:53.071 --> 00:12:56.141
It's like, .001% chance and
it's because of their narrow,

00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.378
triangular mouths and they
chew, like, in a lateral

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.747
jaw movement, sickle,
kind of like a sickle

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:05.350 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that destroys and crushes
those seeds and so then

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.018
when it through in their
rumen, it's when it passes

00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:09.621 align:start size:97% position:3%
through their system, you're
left with a small pellet

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:13.525 align:start size:94% position:6%
that is completely, you
know, ground up, chewed up

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.661 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there's no
viable seed in there.

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.497
And we try to time it so
that we graze those seeds

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:22.301
and, you know, all of the
flowers above ground of,

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
on the stem and that
way it, you know,

00:13:24.602 --> 00:13:27.172
depletes that plant and
they can't reproduce.

00:13:27.172 --> 00:13:29.708 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] And for ranchers
running cattle, horses

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:33.545 align:start size:94% position:6%
and even sheep, goats
fill a very special niche.

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:35.948
- The goats eat very,
very little grasses

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:39.584
and it's also, sort of like
an instant result, right?

00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:42.287
You see it, like, oh,
wow, you were here?

00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:45.423 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's still all that feed
but the spurge is gone.

00:13:45.423 --> 00:13:47.826
So, a lot of ranchers
have realized, well,

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:50.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
this might be better
than spraying.

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:53.164
We've pretty much tried to
overgraze the leafy spurge

00:13:53.164 --> 00:13:55.834 align:start size:88% position:13%
that goats come through,
they aerate the soil,

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.302
they fertilize it.

00:13:57.302 --> 00:14:01.106
After we come through
cleaning up the spurge,

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:03.742 align:start size:84% position:16%
the other grasses have
a chance to compete

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.411 align:start size:84% position:16%
and maybe out
compete the spurge.

00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:09.347
The challenge with goats
is that you can't just

00:14:09.347 --> 00:14:11.951
turn them out because, you know,

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:15.386 align:start size:97% position:3%
if a fence doesn't hold
water, it doesn't hold a goat.

00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:17.489
So you have to stay with them

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:20.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you get the best
results, we find.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean, you can leave
them in the electric fence

00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:28.400
and move the fence, but, I
think the goats are better

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.736
for the landscape and for...

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:34.105
And it's better
for them to move.

00:14:34.105 --> 00:14:35.974
They love to walk.

00:14:35.974 --> 00:14:37.509
They cover miles.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:41.013
They love to climb, they go
to places up in the rim rock

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:43.948 align:start size:97% position:3%
where there is spurge
where nobody else would go.

00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:45.750
- [Narrator] Where fence
grazing is impractical

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.321 align:start size:97% position:3%
on a large ranch, it's
essential in the city limits.

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:52.224
- Yeah, fencing, it's,
it's funny, you know,

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
herding the goats is
actually easy, you know?

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:56.128
Or a lot easier than this.

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:59.264 align:start size:97% position:3%
Fencing the goats is
difficult but you can't get

00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:03.202
such targeted grazing,
usually, without fencing

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.639
and also, you know, 90%
of what the fence is for

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.308 align:start size:84% position:16%
is to keep predators
and people out,

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:11.410
rather than the goats in.

00:15:12.777 --> 00:15:14.879 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Narrator] And predators
are always an issue.

00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:16.348
- Mountain lions.

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:18.250
- Well, yeah, we have most
problems with mountain lions.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.685
- But the coyotes...

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:23.656 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The coyotes, bob cats,
foxes when the kids are young

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.026
and, of course, the birds.

00:15:28.026 --> 00:15:30.395
We do have some golden eagles
and bald eagles in the area.

00:15:30.395 --> 00:15:32.097
Especially more in the spring.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.133 align:start position:0%
- [Narrator] The predator
challenge is a little different

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:36.401
in the city.

00:15:36.401 --> 00:15:39.705
- See, so this is one of
the risk mitigation here

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:43.442 align:start size:94% position:6%
is kids riding by yellin',
throwing firecrackers

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:46.445
and stuff in at the goats
and that'll spook them out,

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.613 align:start size:94% position:6%
push over the fence and
they run out into the road

00:15:48.613 --> 00:15:49.948
and that's, this is the problem

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.316
working in the city right there

00:15:51.316 --> 00:15:54.352
and off leash dogs is
the biggest problem.

00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:55.954
- [Narrator] Herding
dogs can be a liability

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:58.690
in a city setting, but
they're indispensable

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.258
out on the ranch.

00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:02.260
- So we use two different dogs.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.764 align:start size:84% position:16%
We have the herding
dog that helps us herd

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:11.737
and we have the guardian
dogs and they don't herd

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.806
but they protect the herd

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.010
and that's mostly instinctive.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.148 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's pretty amazing that
these dogs are with the herd

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:27.619
24/7 and really protect
them and not kill them.

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:31.056
So, when they see a
vulture or anything,

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:34.126 align:start size:94% position:6%
they know the
distinction and they know

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:37.428 align:start size:97% position:3%
that that's a threat,
while if a duck flies over,

00:16:37.428 --> 00:16:40.632
they don't even look up
and same with snakes.

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:43.301 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, and they see a snake,
they know it's a threat

00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:45.703
and, of course, you
know, mountain lions,

00:16:45.703 --> 00:16:47.606
and everything else, coyotes.

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:51.143
They know it's a threat and
they're very, very brave.

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:55.414
They go out and they announce
the presence with the barking

00:16:55.414 --> 00:17:00.184 align:start size:97% position:3%
which helps keep the predators
at bay most of the time.

00:17:00.485 --> 00:17:02.353
- [Narrator] Under
some circumstances

00:17:02.353 --> 00:17:05.090
Donny also uses a guardian dog.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.393
- And then occasionally,
we'll have an akbash...

00:17:08.393 --> 00:17:11.196
Is what we run as
a herd protector.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.565 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Narrator] But neither
operation succeeds

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.467
without it's herd dogs.

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:19.304
- The weeds are smarter
than the good plants,

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.874
if you're gunna look
at it that judgmentally

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.776 align:start size:94% position:6%
and the only thing smarter
than a weed is a goat

00:17:24.776 --> 00:17:27.212 align:start position:0%
but the only thing smarter
than a goat is a border collie.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.680
(laughs)

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.882
- We use purebred border
collies and they're the key

00:17:30.882 --> 00:17:32.884 align:start size:88% position:13%
to the whole operation,
is a good dog.

00:17:32.884 --> 00:17:35.687
You have to have a good dog
to run a business like this.

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:36.888
Goats are herd animals,

00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:39.724 align:start size:84% position:16%
so instinctively
they stick together.

00:17:39.724 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start size:84% position:16%
Cattle, sheep, they'll
kind of stray out,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.728
go off on their own.

00:17:43.728 --> 00:17:46.799
I can use one dog per
thousand head of goats.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.601
You know, me, one well
trained, well trained dog

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:52.037 align:start position:0%
and, you know, you say a
thousand, fifteen hundred head,

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:54.039
that's enough to run them.

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:56.141 align:start size:97% position:3%
You have a very difficult
time doing that with cattle.

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.576 align:start size:97% position:3%
I love working with the
dogs and the border collies.

00:17:58.576 --> 00:18:01.680 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're a magnificent animal
that are so intelligent.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.648 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's a pleasure to work
with them everyday.

00:18:03.648 --> 00:18:05.016
- But that's why
I have all this...

00:18:05.016 --> 00:18:07.385
You know, I have all
these intelligent goats

00:18:07.385 --> 00:18:09.488
and then the dogs to that
and, really, my only job

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:12.090
is to feed the dogs
and open the door,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.193
camper door, so that
they can go to work.

00:18:15.193 --> 00:18:17.930
(laughs)

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:18.897
Sign the contracts.

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.765
(laughs)

00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:22.334 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Narrator] So this
orchestration of animals

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:25.571
is the herders way
to work with nature.

00:18:27.238 --> 00:18:29.908
- So, it's a different paradigm.

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:33.612
Chasing symptoms would have
you go out trying to kill

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:36.214 align:start size:97% position:3%
this thistle and that
kochia and that every year.

00:18:36.214 --> 00:18:37.148
Well, look what happens.

00:18:37.148 --> 00:18:38.617
You go back to bare ground.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.253
Well, now succession has
to start all over again.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:44.622 align:start size:97% position:3%
When you use chemical
herbicide, you're coming in

00:18:44.622 --> 00:18:47.658
to try and kill something
and the first thing you do

00:18:47.658 --> 00:18:50.828
is kill the fungi in the soil

00:18:50.828 --> 00:18:52.664
and to have a healthy grassland,

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:54.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
you must have fungi
bacteria ratio

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:57.101
of one to one in the soil.

00:18:57.101 --> 00:18:59.070 align:start size:84% position:16%
When you spray,
you kill the fungi.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.573 align:start size:97% position:3%
It goes heavy load bacteria,
which is weed problem.

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:04.643 align:start position:0%
Look at the kochia here,
that's overload of the bacteria

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:07.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the soil and
people can't see that.

00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:09.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
- This approach where
you say well, it's here,

00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:13.018
let's find a balance
and make sure that all,

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:16.688
everything gets a
chance to be there.

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:19.391 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Narrator] Today, most land
managers integrate mowing

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:23.061
and herbicides for weed
control but grazing goats

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:25.597
is becoming more
and more common.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:27.766
- We've been working
towards restoring lands

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:30.668
for 20 years now and
in an urban setting

00:19:30.668 --> 00:19:32.737 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the city of Fort
Collins, what we've seen

00:19:32.737 --> 00:19:36.308
is that it's difficult
in smaller landscapes

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.578
to really replicate the
impacts and the grazing

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:43.982
and the ecological processes
that historically happened

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:48.153
and so while we approach
restoration with reseeding

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.958
and mowing and all the
real classical integrated

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:56.327 align:start position:0%
pest management type
approaches, the one that's hard

00:19:56.327 --> 00:19:58.864 align:start size:84% position:16%
to really replicate
is the grazing.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:02.601 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Also, you know, irrigating
up above the banks.

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.402
They're split hoofed,
light weight animals,

00:20:04.402 --> 00:20:07.973 align:start size:88% position:13%
so they till the soil
as opposed to compact it

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:10.809
and that allows a lot of
the moisture and nutrients

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:13.711
and fertilization, you know,

00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:15.881 align:start size:88% position:13%
for these native species
and plants to grow.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.716
- [Narrator] There is
no machine or chemical

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:22.087
that can replicate what
animals do so elegantly.

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:24.522
- If we're feeding the
microbes underground,

00:20:24.522 --> 00:20:27.491
we're building that
fungi bacteria ratio

00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:29.627
and bringing it into balance.

00:20:29.627 --> 00:20:31.396
All the microbes are being fed.

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:35.067
This is getting broken down
and turned back to carbon

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:38.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
and nitrogen and sulfer
and put back down.

00:20:38.302 --> 00:20:40.004 align:start size:84% position:16%
See, when it's
standing up like this,

00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:41.973
this does the soil no good.

00:20:41.973 --> 00:20:45.244 align:start size:84% position:16%
Has to be soil contact
and trampled in.

00:20:46.744 --> 00:20:48.980
So the hoof action of the
goats is a very big deal.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.382 align:start size:94% position:6%
So they recycle
everything right in place.

00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:54.086
- In this dry climate,
unless there's something

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.087 align:start size:84% position:16%
breaking down all
that plant material,

00:20:56.087 --> 00:20:59.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
it is just deposited on
the surface and over time,

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:02.894 align:start size:97% position:3%
it doesn't break down
quickly and so we don't get

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:05.763
the sun exposure on the
soil and so that limits

00:21:05.763 --> 00:21:09.300 align:start size:97% position:3%
for production and the
diversity of grass production

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.802
that we'd like to see.

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:15.573
- That's what I do with these
goats, is, hurry up and eat

00:21:15.573 --> 00:21:18.343 align:start size:88% position:13%
all of these weeds,
recycle them in the gut,

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.379 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then put 'em right
back on the ground

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:23.281
as pure organic fertilizer
and there's some right there

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:27.452 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that is a perfect,
organic bunch of nutrients,

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:31.856
so, if you could, with your
perfectly calibrated eyes,

00:21:31.856 --> 00:21:35.126
see that recycled whatever
they're eating behind us,

00:21:35.126 --> 00:21:37.329 align:start size:84% position:16%
you would see carbon,
nitrogen, sulfur,

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.830
boron, magnesium, calcium.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.900
You would see those nutrients.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
So those are nutrients
put right back in.

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:48.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And, so, we can, in some
areas, bring cattle in

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:50.775 align:start size:84% position:16%
as we do at Soapstone
and Bobcat Ridge

00:21:50.775 --> 00:21:53.378
but in these real
small, urban areas,

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:55.814
we're much more limited
in the types of animals

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:59.450 align:start position:0%
that we could use to graze
and, it's great to have someone

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.419
like Lani that we can,
that we can reach out to

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:03.889 align:start size:88% position:13%
and have her come in
and provide the service.

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:06.057
- [Narrator] The eventual
goal is to bring about

00:22:06.057 --> 00:22:08.559
a self sustaining plant system.

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:11.062 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And every land owner's
different in what they want.

00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:13.432 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Narrator] In
restoration projects,

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:16.968 align:start position:0%
like the Cattail Course Natural
Area here in For Collins,

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:21.038
seeding grassland companion
plants might be a benefit.

00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:23.275
- We don't have any
legumes in here.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.678 align:start size:97% position:3%
Legumes are broad leaves
that fix nitrogen in the soil

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:29.481
and grasses take a lot of
nitrogen, so, let's get

00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:33.018 align:start position:0%
some broad leaved plants in
here who are fixing the nitrogen

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:36.487
and then we feed the soil such
that the microbes are working

00:22:36.487 --> 00:22:38.456 align:start size:84% position:16%
underneath to help
them fix more nitrogen

00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:41.692 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we start building
a living system

00:22:41.692 --> 00:22:45.163
with all these plants who
are all doing their jobs.

00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:49.100
I always call the biannual
thistles the prep chefs.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.335
They're the prep chefs.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:51.703 align:start size:81% position:19%
Why would you kill
the pref chef?

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.871
(laughs)

00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:56.575 align:start size:97% position:3%
He scrubs the vegetables
and cuts them and goes home.

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.509
The bare ground where you
have that disturbance,

00:22:58.509 --> 00:23:01.579
it must heal, like your scab.

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.548
It must heal and
have the nutrition

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.550
before it can move forward.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.318 align:start size:81% position:19%
You can't just
plant grass there.

00:23:07.318 --> 00:23:07.351
- [Narrator] Though goats
might improve conditions

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.656
- [Narrator] Though goats
might improve conditions

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:14.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
for grass production,
they can still be

00:23:14.058 --> 00:23:15.793
a tough sell in cattle country.

00:23:15.793 --> 00:23:17.229 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They definitely have
a stigma, it seems.

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:20.465 align:start position:0%
Especially with cattle ranchers
and we're cattle ranchers

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:23.268
by background so when we
were kids and everything,

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:25.469
everyone says, you know,
"oh, you know, we don't,

00:23:25.469 --> 00:23:26.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
there's no goats
allowed on the property"

00:23:26.504 --> 00:23:27.838
or whatever and the stigma

00:23:27.838 --> 00:23:30.408
usually comes from, you
know, goats locked up

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:32.777
in a yard that jump
on cars and eat paint

00:23:32.777 --> 00:23:34.011
and things like that, you know?

00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:35.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, yeah, they have that
stigma with the goats

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.682
but that's just like anything.

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:39.817
That's like a border collie
that's not given it's purpose

00:23:39.817 --> 00:23:42.587
or allowed to do what
it's intended to do.

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:44.489
Children are the
same way, you know?

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:47.492 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's, it's, you channel
their energy and what they do

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:51.896 align:start size:97% position:3%
to some sort of positive
action and then they're okay.

00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:53.265
- You, you're the head nanny.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start size:81% position:19%
You tell them what
a goat's like.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.503
- Oh, goats, they are curious.

00:23:59.804 --> 00:24:01.405
They're very social.

00:24:01.405 --> 00:24:03.507
You, you can train
them for anything.

00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:05.510
They just cover a lot of ground.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.912 align:start size:88% position:13%
- They will cover a
lot more ground than...

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.846
- Than sheep or cows

00:24:08.846 --> 00:24:10.148
- Especially the cows.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:13.017 align:start size:88% position:13%
I used to be able to
set down a bunch of cows

00:24:13.017 --> 00:24:14.953
or bulls, put them in
an area and go back,

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:16.354
check on 'em five days

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.323 align:start size:84% position:16%
and know exactly in
the area they'd be in.

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:20.725
If you did that with goats,
you're liable to gat a call

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.293
from the Canadian Mounties.

00:24:22.293 --> 00:24:23.828
- It's what we do as a company,

00:24:23.828 --> 00:24:26.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
is all we do is manage
these goats and let them do

00:24:26.964 --> 00:24:29.100
what they need to do and
what they do naturally

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.568
and we'll just manage them.

00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:33.805 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Narrator] It's a
matter of stewardship.

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:36.374 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It's undoing the wrongs
that have been done

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:40.979
in the last 100 to 500 years
of how this land has been used.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:43.148 align:start size:81% position:19%
Over grazing by
cattle and horses,

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.382
you get all these problems

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:46.718
because horses and
cattle don't eat them

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:51.689
and it's been overgrazed
and now cut up by ranchets

00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:55.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
and subdividing and
roads and fence lines.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:59.597
Permanent fence lines are
so terrible of destroying

00:24:59.597 --> 00:25:01.699
the flow of energy on the land

00:25:01.699 --> 00:25:04.535 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the flow of the livestock,
the flow of the wildlife,

00:25:04.535 --> 00:25:06.070
the flow of everything.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.975
It disrupts that, so, to try
to counterbalance the wrongs

00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:14.378
I want to bring the
exact opposite back.

00:25:14.378 --> 00:25:16.781
So, I bring a big herd of goats.

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:19.984 align:start size:97% position:3%
Cattle and horses are grazers
and they eat all grass.

00:25:19.984 --> 00:25:23.388 align:start size:97% position:3%
Goats are browsers and
grass is their last choice.

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:25.823
- The goats eat one thing,
the cows eat the other thing

00:25:25.823 --> 00:25:27.658 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that way you're
really taking advantage

00:25:27.658 --> 00:25:29.827
of what you have on your ranch.

00:25:29.827 --> 00:25:33.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're increasing
your, your livestock.

00:25:33.097 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're increasing
your profitability,
your carrying capacity

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.037 align:start size:88% position:13%
and hopefully your
bottom dollar, you know?

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:42.006
You just have more way to
sell, more meat to sell.

00:25:42.006 --> 00:25:43.340
That's kind of where we're at.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.110
Some people just, it's
not for them, you know?

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.179
Goats are just a tool
in the toolbox, right?

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:50.014 align:start size:94% position:6%
And there's many different
ways of managing land.

00:25:50.014 --> 00:25:51.616
This is just one of them.

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:54.151
- So what I want to build
with this living machine

00:25:54.151 --> 00:25:56.387 align:start size:97% position:3%
I have here, and, by the
way, they're self propelled,

00:25:56.387 --> 00:25:59.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
is, bringing all these
things into balance

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.926
and everything you can't see.

00:26:01.926 --> 00:26:05.129
You can't see joy,
really, but you can,

00:26:05.129 --> 00:26:07.097
when these animals are
playing and they're...

00:26:07.097 --> 00:26:10.535
You can tell they have
purpose and these dogs.

00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:14.706 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's joyful and it's, it's
fun and people like to see it.

00:26:15.773 --> 00:26:17.776
(music)

00:26:20.978 --> 00:26:24.682
So, the management should be
the highest intrinsic value

00:26:24.682 --> 00:26:27.852
of the land and then
the byproduct would be

00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:31.122 align:start size:84% position:16%
how rich this is,
how beautiful it is.

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:32.056
The aesthetic value.

00:26:32.056 --> 00:26:33.624
How much life it supports.

00:26:33.624 --> 00:26:35.392
How much water it can hold.

00:26:35.392 --> 00:26:38.863
The land outta function like
a giant sponge to hold water.

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:41.399
That means the soil is
full of organic matter

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:44.969 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then can hold all the
water available to the plants.

00:26:44.969 --> 00:26:47.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, that's what we
should be managing for.

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:50.041 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I mean, this didn't
come to be by not grazing.

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:53.377 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, the bison, the
deer and the elk all started

00:26:53.377 --> 00:26:55.346
this whole trend of eating it.

00:26:55.346 --> 00:26:59.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
The whole cycle's
starting again, creating
a good range land

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.052 align:start size:94% position:6%
so, by not eating it, it's
probably actually doing

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:03.788 align:start size:81% position:19%
more harm than
grazing it by far.
