00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:02.845
GO TO JAIL.

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:05.314
FIRST TONIGHT, LET'S SAY YOU

00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:06.716
DISAGREE WITH THE POLITICAL

00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:08.951
VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE

00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:12.922
COUNTRY, THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS,

00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:14.924
THE TESLA DRIVERS, THE

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.692
PROSECUTORS AND SPY CHIEFS YOU

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:18.060
SEE ON TELEVISION OPINING ABOUT

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:18.394
THINGS.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:20.096
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS SHOW,

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:22.365
YOU'LL PROBABLY NOT ALL THAT

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.634
IMPRESSED ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:26.102
YOU DON'T WISH THEM PERSONAL

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:26.402
HARM.

00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:27.803
BUT YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE DONE

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:31.040
A GOOD JOB FOR AMERICA.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:32.675
YOU MIGHT HAVE VOTED FOR DONALD

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:35.578
TRUMP TO MAKE THAT VERY POINT.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.545
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED WHAT

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:38.314
THESE PEOPLE THINK OF YOU FOR

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.550
VOTING THE WAY THAT YOU DID, FOR

00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:45.321
DARING TO BE INSOLENT AND

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:45.721
DISOBEDIENT?

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:48.424
HOW WOULD THEY PUNISH YOU IF

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:50.660
THEY GOT THE CHANCE?

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.194
EVER THINK OF THAT?

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:56.299
WONDER NO MORE.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.967
MANAFORT HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD

00:00:57.968 --> 00:00:58.601
OF ANY KIND.

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:00.536
HIS SENTENCE IS CONSIDERABLY

00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:01.704
LONGER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:04.040
FOR THE CHARGES HE PLED TO.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:06.309
BY THE TIME MANAFORT GETS OUT OF

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.811
PRISON, HE WILL BE ELDERLY,

00:01:08.812 --> 00:01:11.981
BROKE, AND DISGRACED.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.118
BUT FOR OUR RULING CLASS, THAT'S

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.588
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH PUNISHMENT.

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:19.822
THEY BELIEVE HE MUST DIE IN

00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:20.223
PRISON.

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:21.357
ANYTHING LESS CANNOT BE ALLOWED.

00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:22.659
&gt;&gt; SHOCKING NEWS.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.326
&gt;&gt; SHOCKING.

00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:26.797
AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, I'M

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:27.431
EMBARRASSED.

00:01:27.432 --> 00:01:29.833
AS AN AMERICAN, I'M UPSET.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.736
&gt;&gt; THIS JUDGE HAD A HARD-ON FOR

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:34.538
THE MUELLER PROBE OVERALL.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.339
&gt;&gt; IT'S A SERIOUS CRIME AND HE

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.208
GOT A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.043
PEOPLE SHOULD BE OUTRAGED.

00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:44.080
&gt;&gt; I FIND THIS JAW DROPPING.

00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:46.383
&gt;&gt; IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:47.417
LENIENT SENTENCE

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:54.224
&gt;&gt; MANAFORT GOT THE SPECIAL

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:56.726
CLUBBY WASHINGTON ELITE FRIENDLY

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:57.093
TREATMENT.

00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:58.094
&gt;&gt; PAUL MANAFORT MUST DIE.

00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:02.299
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DEMANDING.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.369
ROBERT MUELLER AGREES WITH THEM.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.472
MUELLER ASKED THAT MANAFORT

00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:10.106
RECEIVE UP TO 24 YEARS IN

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:13.376
PRISON, MORE THAN TWICE THE

00:02:13.377 --> 00:02:14.144
AVERAGE MURDERER IN THIS COUNTRY

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:15.278
SPENDS BEHIND BARS.

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.347
THAT'S A DEATH SENTENCE.

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.149
KEEP IN MIND THAT AL CAPONE ONLY

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.354
GOT 11 YEARS FOR CHARGES

00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:24.888
SIMILAR.

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.957
IS THERE A SINGLE PERSON IN

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:27.657
AMERICA WHO BELIEVES THAT

00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:29.359
MANAFORT WOULD BE GOING TO JAIL

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.097
IF HE HADN'T RUN DONALD TRUMP'S

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:34.698
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN?

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.334
EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNOWS

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:37.901
THAT.

00:02:37.902 --> 00:02:40.370
THERE'S A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO

00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:42.773
ARE GRATEFUL THEY DIDN'T TAKE

00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:43.707
THE JOB.

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:46.310
THE JUDGE IN THE CASE CLEARLY

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.778
UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.078
HERE.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.147
HE REMINDED THOSE WATCHING THAT

00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:52.649
MANAFORT WAS, QUOTE, NOT BEFORE

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.551
THIS COURT FOR NOT HAVING

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:58.655
ANYTHING TO DO WITH COLLUSION

00:02:58.656 --> 00:02:59.923
WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:01.291
THAT'S TRUE.

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.794
NOBODY HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH A

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:04.995
CHARGE RELATED TO RUSSIAN

00:03:04.996 --> 00:03:05.362
COLLUSION.

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:06.030
THAT'S A FACT.

00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:08.198
THAT'S NOT AN OPINION.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.566
THERE'S NO DISPUTE ABOUT IT.

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:11.201
SOMEHOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:13.337
STILL OUT THERE LYING ABOUT

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:14.204
THIS, PROBABLY BECAUSE NOBODY IN

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:16.340
THE PRESS CALLS THEM ON IT.

00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:19.209
WATCH YOUR ELECTED OFFICIAL SAY

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.444
SOMETHING TOTALLY UNTRUE IN THE

00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:22.112
MOST SELF-RIGHTEOUS POSSIBLE

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:22.379
WAY.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.382
&gt;&gt; THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD BE

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:26.850
JUSTIFIED IN FEELING THAT THERE

00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:29.286
IS SOME MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.

00:03:29.287 --> 00:03:31.155
MANAFORT POTENTIALLY THREATENED

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:32.189
OUR VERY DEMOCRACY, THE

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.491
PRINCIPLES OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:35.426
&gt;&gt; THIS NEWS CAME OUT ABOUT

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:36.394
MANAFORT AND I'M TICKED OFF

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:37.328
ABOUT THIS.

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.963
&gt;&gt; WERE YOU SHOCKED?

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:41.966
&gt;&gt; THIS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:44.335
CAN'T SURPRISE ME ANYMORE.

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:47.205
&gt;&gt; I THINK I SPENT MORE DAYS IN

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.340
DETENTION IN HIGH SCHOOL THAN

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:50.575
JUDGE ELLIS THINKS THAT MANAFORT

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:53.344
SHOULD SPEND IN JAIL.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.546
&gt;&gt; CORY BOOKER IS VERY TICKED

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.081
OFF THAT MANAFORT MAY NOT DIE IN

00:03:57.082 --> 00:03:59.584
JAIL FOR CHEATING ON HIS TAXES.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.820
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE SAME

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:05.656
CORY BOOKER THAT RECENTLY SPENT

00:04:05.657 --> 00:04:09.327
HOURS ON THE SENATE FLOOR

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:11.996
WAGGING HIS FINGER OVER MASS

00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:13.831
INCARCERATION AND OUR BROKEN

00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:14.732
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:17.268
YET THAT'S ALSO THE SAME CORY

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.570
BOOKER WHO NOW IS OUTRAGED THAT

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.140
A TAX CHEAT ISN'T GETTING THE

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.274
DEATH PENALTY.

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:26.310
HAS HE EVER CHEATED ON HIS

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.111
TAXES?

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:27.512
HOPE NOT.

00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:30.782
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:32.984
IF ANY OF THESE HYENAS HAS

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:35.486
FUDGED A DEDUCTION OR VIOLATED

00:04:35.487 --> 00:04:37.355
OUR BANKING LAWS.

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:38.723
SOMEBODY SHOULD CHECK.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:41.326
THIS ISN'T ABOUT TAXES,

00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:41.693
OBVIOUSLY.

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:44.662
CORY BOOKER KNOWS THAT WELL.

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:47.131
IT'S ABOUT USING POWER TO CRUSH

00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:50.001
YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:52.570
MANAFORT IS SENTENCED FOR

00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.038
FAILING TO REGISTRATION UNDER

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.608
THE FOREIGN ACT OF 1988.

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:59.877
IT'S LIKE HAYLEY'S COMET HERE IN

00:04:59.878 --> 00:05:00.511
WASHINGTON.

00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:02.614
IN THE SPACE OF 50 YEARS,

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:08.453
BETWEEN 1966 AND 2015, THE DOJ

00:05:08.454 --> 00:05:09.654
CHARGED A TOTAL OF SEVEN PEOPLE,

00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:10.755
JUST THREE OF THEM WERE

00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:12.257
CONVICTED.

00:05:12.258 --> 00:05:13.391
MEANWHILE, THE MOST POWERFUL

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:17.329
FOREIGN LOBBYIST IN WASHINGTON
