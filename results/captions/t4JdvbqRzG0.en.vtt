00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.103
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE UFO CASE THAT
DOMINATES ALL OTHERS. BUT IT MAY

00:00:10.103 --> 00:00:14.103
ONLY BE HALF THE STORY.
&gt;&gt; ROSWELL HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:20.570
AN AMAZING MYSTERY.
&gt;&gt; IN JULY 1947, SOMETHING

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.100
CRASHES OUTSIDE OF ROSWELL,
NEW MEXICO. AND DAYS BEFORE,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.400
STRANGE OBJECTS ARE SIGHTED NEAR
THE LOCAL ARMY AIR FIELD.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.100
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE OFF THE CORNER OF
THAT HANGAR THERE.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.700
&gt;&gt; NOW, THE ROSWELL MYSTERY
TAKES AN INCREDIBLE TURN.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.700
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.500
THERE WASN'T ONE CRASH BUT 2.
&gt;&gt; WELL, AT FIRST, I WASN'T SURE

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.070
IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
A UFO CRASH. BUT I STARTED

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670
FINDING THINGS.

&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.107
&gt;&gt; NOTHING OF THIS SHAPE
AND FORM.

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:04.270
&gt;&gt; AFTER 61 YEARS, A NEW WITNESS
STEPS FORWARD.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.200
&gt;&gt; MAKES CHILLS RUN DOWN
MY BACK.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100
&gt;&gt; THE REAL STORY BEHIND ROSWELL
WAITS TO BE UNEARTHED.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.530
&gt;&gt; IF I WANTED TO GET RID OF
MY UFO DEBRIS, THIS WOULD BE

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.230
A NICE PLACE TO PUT IT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS CASE NUMBER 47402--

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.030
THE REAL ROSWELL.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.117
&gt;&gt; EARLY JULY 1947,
ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, IS A QUIET

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:43.770
CITY OF JUST 26,000 PEOPLE.
THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.700
ARE RANCHERS OR MILITARY
BASED AT THE NEARBY

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.030
ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD.
LITTLE DO ANY OF THEM KNOW,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.870
THIS SLEEPY TOWN IS ABOUT TO
RECEIVE A WAKE-UP CALL.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:05.103
[WIND WHISTLING]
ON JULY 6, LOCAL RANCHER

00:02:05.103 --> 00:02:09.100
MACK BRAZEL REPORTS TO THE LOCAL
SHERIFF THAT HE HAS FOUND

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.110
STRANGE DEBRIS ON THE RANCH
WHERE HE WORKS.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.400
MAJOR JESSE MARCEL FROM
ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD IS

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.103
SENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE.
HE TAKES AS MUCH OF THE DEBRIS

00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:28.170
AS HE CAN FIT IN HIS TRUCK
BACK TO THE BASE.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.770
ON JULY 8, THE ARMY ISSUES
A STATEMENT THAT THEY ARE IN

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.530
POSSESSION OF A FLYING SAUCER.
BUT AFTER THE DEBRIS IS FLOWN TO

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.570
DALLAS, TEXAS, THAT AFTERNOON
FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS, THE ARMY

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.500
STATES THE DEBRIS IS NOTHING BUT
A MISIDENTIFIED WEATHER BALLOON.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.670
THE STORY QUICKLY FADES
FROM MEMORY.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.730
BUT IN 1978, STANTON FRIEDMAN,
A RETIRED NUCLEAR PHYSICIST,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.000
INTERVIEWS JESSE MARCEL,
WHO HAS A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
TAKE ON THE STORY.
MARCEL REVEALS TO FRIEDMAN THAT

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.430
WHAT WAS SAID THAT AFTERNOON
IN DALLAS ON JULY 8, 1947,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.430
WAS ACTUALLY A COVER STORY.
WHAT HE HANDLED WAS DEFINITELY

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:21.100
NOT A WEATHER BALLOON.
THE ROSWELL MYSTERY EXPLODES.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.230
IN THE 15 YEARS FOLLOWING

WITH JESSE MARCEL, CRIES OF
COVER-UP AND CONSPIRACY CLOUD

FINALLY, IN 1994, THE GOVERNMENT

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.430
DECIDES TO TELL ALL.
THE AIR FORCE ISSUES AN OFFICIAL

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.000
REPORT SAYING THAT THE DEBRIS
RECOVERED AT ROSWELL WAS FROM

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.070
A TOP-SECRET PROGRAM CALLED
PROJECT MOGUL. THESE CLASSIFIED

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.170
EXERCISES WERE USED TO SPY ON
SOVIET MISSILE AND BOMB TESTS.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.770
FOR MANY, THE LONGSTANDING
DEBATE OVER WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.230
1947 IN ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO,
IS PUT TO REST. BUT SOME

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.700
ARE NOT CONVINCED.
NOW, THERE IS ANOTHER CHAPTER

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.200
TO THE ROSWELL STORY. IN RECENT
YEARS, MORE AND MORE UFO

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.430
RESEARCHERS ARE PAYING CLOSER
ATTENTION TO A SECOND REPORTED

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.330
CRASH THAT HAPPENED THE SAME
WEEK AS ROSWELL, 250 MILES AWAY

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:30.430
ON THE PLAINS OF SAN AUGUSTIN.
61 YEARS AFTER THESE EVENTS,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.700
TIME IS RUNNING OUT. RESEARCHERS
RUSH TO COLLECT TESTIMONY AND

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.117
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE BEFORE IT
DISAPPEARS FOREVER.

00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:45.030
DR. TED ACWORTH WILL INVESTIGATE
THE ALLEGED SECOND CRASH SITE

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.500
IN THE PLAINS OF SAN AUGUSTIN.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FAMOUS CASE.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.430
IT'S ROSWELL. IT'S PROBABLY
THE DOMINANT UFO CASE OF

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.117
ALL HISTORY.
&gt;&gt; BILL BIRNES WILL MEET WITH

00:04:55.117 --> 00:04:59.500
A RESEARCHER WHO'S FOUND A NEW
WITNESS FROM THE ORIGINAL CRASH

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.107
SITE--ONE WHO MAY HAVE SEEN AND
HANDLED THE ACTUAL DEBRIS.

00:05:03.107 --> 00:05:08.103
&gt;&gt; ROSWELL HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR
ME AN AMAZING MYSTERY THAT,

00:05:08.103 --> 00:05:12.107
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID,
I'VE WANTED TO SOLVE.

00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:15.107
&gt;&gt; AND PAT USKERT WILL SEARCH
FOR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT IS

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:19.570
RUMORED TO BE HIDDEN ON REMOTE
RANCHES OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.770
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ULTIMATE
UFO EVENT TO ATTEND, BILL.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.430
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HERE. I'M REALLY EXCITED

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.230
ABOUT THIS.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHEN--YOU WANT

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.270
TO STUDY ABOUT UFOs IN
THE UNITED STATES, YOU COME

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.120
TO ROSWELL, AND THIS IS WHERE
YOU BEGIN.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.100
&gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE.
&gt;&gt; BILL BEGINS BY MEETING

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.400
ROSWELL RESEARCHER
DENNIS BALTHASER, A LOCAL

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.500
CONTACT WHO DETAILS THE NEW
DIRECTION THE INVESTIGATION

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.900
HAS TAKEN.
&gt;&gt; THERE'S AN URGENCY ABOUT

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.330
THIS. WHAT IS THE URGENCY?
&gt;&gt; WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.570
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT
ARE IN THEIR EIGHTIES--IF

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.530
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE--THAT WERE
HERE, AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.900
NOTHING PHYSICAL, REALLY, FOR
THE ROSWELL INCIDENT.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.330
IF THERE IS METAL OUT THERE--
AND I'M SURE THERE IS, BECAUSE

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.070
OF THE NUMBER OF GUYS THAT WERE
AT THE CRASH SITE TO HELP CLEAN

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.830
IT UP--IT COULD BE KEPT
ANYWHERE. I THINK LOOKING AT

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.110
THE PLAINS OF SAN AUGUSTIN AND
ROSWELL AS A COMBINATION--OR

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.117
EVEN SEPARATELY--I THINK THAT
NEEDS TO BE WORKED SOME MORE.

00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:19.870
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA OF A SECOND
CRASH SITE IN THE ROSWELL

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.730
INCIDENT IS A THEORY STARTING
TO GAIN TRACTION.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.330
THIS POSSIBLE SECOND SITE,
LOCATED IN THE PLAINS OF

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.430
SAN AUGUSTIN, IS APPROXIMATELY
250 MILES FROM THE MAIN

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.230
ROSWELL CRASH SITE.
AND THIS SITE COULD PROVIDE

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.030
MUCH-NEEDED EVIDENCE TO BACK UP
THE ROSWELL INCIDENT.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.170
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROPONENTS OF
THIS THEORY IS STANTON FRIEDMAN,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.117
THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATOR WHO
BROKE THE ROSWELL CASE WIDE OPEN

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:54.530
30 YEARS AGO.
&gt;&gt; I HAD HEARD THE FIRST STORY

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.117
ABOUT ROSWELL, AND I HAD HEARD
THE FIRST STORY ABOUT THE PLANS

00:06:56.117 --> 00:07:02.770
OF SAN AUGUSTIN. AND I FOLLOWED
UP ON BOTH, OF COURSE, AND FOUND

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.100
SUFFICIENT OTHER EVIDENCE TO
BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.600
2 SITES.
&gt;&gt; WHERE DOES IT LEAD US WITH

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.570
RESPECT TO MULTIPLE CRASH SITES?
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU NEEDED TO SEE

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.730
THIS SITE--SEE HOW BARREN IT IS,
THE STRANGE AREA IT IS--AND

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.730
NOTICE THAT ANY PILOT WOULD COME
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAINS

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.030
INSTEAD OF HIT ONE OF THOSE
MOUNTAINS AROUND THERE. HEH.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.120
MAKES SENSE. THAT'S WHAT
PILOTS DO.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.530
&gt;&gt; THE STORY OF THIS OTHER CRASH
HAPPENS IN EARLY JULY 1947 AS

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:32.570
WELL, THOUGH THE EXACT DATE IS
STILL HOTLY DEBATED.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.200
A MAN NAMED BARNEY BARNETT
ALLEGEDLY DISCOVERS A DOWNED

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.330
CRAFT, INCLUDING DEAD ALIEN
BODIES, EARLY ONE JULY MORNING.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.230
HE CLAIMS THE MILITARY ARRIVES
AT THE SITE SOON AFTER HE DOES

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.070
AND ORDERS HIM TO KEEP QUIET
ABOUT WHAT HE'S SEEN.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.670
&gt;&gt; REMEMBER, BARNEY WAS
A WORLD WAR I VETERAN. HE WORKED

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.107
FOR THE SOIL CONSERVATION
SERVICE. IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:57.270
TO EXPECT HIM TO JUST
GO TALKING.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.070
&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT WE HAVE IS A STORY
THAT BARNEY BARNETT WAS ON

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.930
THE PLAINS OF SAN AUGUSTIN...
&gt;&gt; FOUND WRECKAGE. THERE WERE

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.730
PEOPLE THERE, INCLUDING
AN ARCHAEOLOGIST, AND INCLUDING

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.200
STUDENTS. AND THE MILITARY
CAME ALONG--TOLD EVERYBODY TO

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.330
SHUT UP. AND THEY MEANT IT VERY
STRONG. REMEMBER, THIS IS '47.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.110
&gt;&gt; AND YOU SHUT UP WHEN YOU WERE
TOLD TO SHUT UP.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.700
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; BUT WHY WOULD THERE BE 2 UFO

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.730
CRASHES SO CLOSE TOGETHER DURING
THE SAME WEEK? IS IT POSSIBLE

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.100
THEY ARE LINKED IN SOME WAY? THE
THEORIES BEHIND THESE ALLEGED

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.600
CRASHES NEED FURTHER ANALYSIS
BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION VISITS

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.200
EITHER SITE.
&gt;&gt; DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.330
THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THESE
DEBRIS FIELDS? ARE THEY

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.700
SCATTERED RANDOMLY ACROSS
ONE KIND OF AREA, OR ARE THEY

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.100
IN LINE, OR...
&gt;&gt; WELL, MOST OF THE DEBRIS

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.030
FIELDS ARE AROUND ROSWELL. THEY
ARE AROUND THE MAIN CRASH SITE.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.100
HOWEVER, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
200 MILES AWAY ON THE PLAINS OF

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.000
SAN AUGUSTIN.
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, IT SEEMS PRETTY

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.120
UNLIKELY--THAT SECOND CRASH SITE
200 MILES AWAY--THAT IT COULD BE

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.430
SOME SORT OF PRIMARY VEHICLE
THAT HIT AND THEN BOUNCED.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.730
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY
VEHICLES BEING ABLE TO BOUNCE

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.110
OR DEBRIS BOUNCING LIKE THAT.
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM. ANOTHER THEORY

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.770
IS THAT THERE WERE 2 CRAFT
THAT MAYBE SOMEHOW COLLIDED

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.700
IN MIDAIR AND CREATED A SORT OF
A CUE BALL EFFECT WHERE ONE

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.500
CRAFT EXPLODED, RAINED DEBRIS
DOWN OVER THE ROSWELL AREA,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.117
AND THE SECOND CRAFT--
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:16.400
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY--WAS SORT OF
CUE-BALLED OVER TO THE PLAINS OF

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.100
SAN AUGUSTIN.
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.600
&gt;&gt; AND SO, WE HAVE BASICALLY
2 CRAFT AND 2 CRASHES.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.830
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.
&gt;&gt; LINKING THE 2 CRASHES

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.100
AT ROSWELL AND SAN AUGUSTIN
WILL BE A KEY FOCUS OF

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.900
THE INVESTIGATION. TOM CAREY,
A RESEARCHER OF THE ORIGINAL

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.830
CRASH, HAS UNCOVERED A STUNNING
NEW WITNESS WHO CLAIMS HE WAS AT

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:43.870
THIS SITE--A STAFF SERGEANT AT
ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD IN 1947.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:49.030
HIS NAME IS EARL FULFORD.
&gt;&gt; I CALLED EARL FULFORD 3 YEARS

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.530
AGO. HE WAS JUST A FACE IN
THE BASE YEARBOOK. I CALLED HIS

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.530
NUMBER, AND HIS WIFE ANSWERED.
AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, SHE

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.830
SAID, "I'M GLAD YOU CALLED. HE'S
READY TO TALK."

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.170
&gt;&gt; CAREY IDENTIFIED EARL THROUGH
THE OFFICIAL BASE YEARBOOK FROM

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.670
1947. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE
HAS EVER SPOKEN ABOUT THE EVENTS

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.030
HE WITNESSED.
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO GET YOU

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.570
INVOLVED WITH THIS ROSWELL
INCIDENT AFTER YOU WERE ON

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.570
THE BASE?
&gt;&gt; WELL, UH, IT HAPPENED. WE

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.670
WORKED OVER HERE IN THE NEXT
HANGAR. AND ABOUT 2 OR 3 WEEKS

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:27.600
BEFORE THE INCIDENT, THE PEOPLE
IN TOWN, ESPECIALLY, AND SOME

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.370
AIRMEN HERE ON THE BASE STARTED
SEEING OBJECTS IN THE SKY.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.900
&gt;&gt; WHERE WERE THE OBJECTS?
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE OFF THE CORNER OF

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.930
THAT...HANGAR THERE.
&gt;&gt; EARL DESCRIBES THE OBJECTS

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:48.030
AS UNLIKE ANY AIRCRAFT HE HAD
EVER SEEN.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.870
&gt;&gt; WE LOOKED UP, AND THERE WAS
3 UP THERE. THEY WERE CIRCULAR

00:10:52.870 --> 00:11:00.500
AND...HUNG MOTIONLESS.
AND WE PROBABLY WATCHED THEM FOR

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:07.030
A COUPLE MINUTES. AND THEY
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.107
&gt;&gt; AND THIS WAS BEFORE ANYTHING
EVER HAPPENED ON THE--

00:11:09.107 --> 00:11:16.370
&gt;&gt; YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS
WITHIN DAYS, MAYBE A WEEK,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.107
WHEN THE CRASH OCCURRED.
&gt;&gt; THIS DESCRIPTION DOESN'T

00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:23.530
MATCH THE APPEARANCE OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S PROJECT MOGUL

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.200
BALLOONS, WHICH HAD EXTREMELY
LONG TRAINS OF VARIOUS MATERIALS

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.000
AND WERE USED PRIMARILY AT HIGH
ALTITUDES. MILITARY SERVICEMEN

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.870
WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO SEE THEM
SO LOW IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.770
BUT SPOTTING THE STRANGE ORBS
IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.430
EARL'S STORY.
&gt;&gt; THE NEXT DAY, SERGEANT

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:48.330
ROSENBERG CAME IN THE MESS HALL
AT 5 A.M. AND GOT 12 OR 15 OR

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:54.230
MAYBE 20 OF US AND LOADED US UP
ON AN ARMY BUS AND TOOK US TO

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:59.900
THE DEBRIS FIELD ABOUT 70 MILES
NORTH OF ROSWELL.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.200
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT DID YOU DO THERE?
&gt;&gt; PICKED UP SOME DEBRIS OF

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.530
A VERY UNUSUAL SHAPE AND FEEL
AND APPEARANCE.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.830
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE DEBRIS THAT
EARL FULFORD AND OTHER

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.770
VOLUNTEERS PICKED UP IN 1947?
THE ANSWER MAY STILL LIE HIDDEN

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:25.270
BENEATH THE DESERT.
&gt;&gt; SHOW NO FEAR.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.530
&gt;&gt; IN ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, A NEW
WITNESS TO THE ROSWELL INCIDENT

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.200
HAS COME FORWARD FOR THE FIRST
TIME. EARL FULFORD,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.530
A STAFF SERGEANT AT ROSWELL
ARMY AIR FIELD IN 1947,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.430
FINDS HIMSELF RECRUITED FOR
CLEANUP DUTY. BUT THIS IS

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:54.330
NO ORDINARY CLEANUP.
PAT AND BILL ARE BRINGING EARL

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.170
AND RESEARCHER TOM CAREY TO
THE ORIGINAL ROSWELL CRASH SITE

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.900
TO GET FIRSTHAND DETAILS ABOUT
THE DEBRIS RECOVERED THERE ON

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.000
JULY 8, 1947.
WHILE THEY HEAD TO THE FIRST

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.900
SITE, TED IS PREPPING THE
INVESTIGATION'S NEXT STEP--

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.100
A VISIT TO A POSSIBLE SECOND
CRASH SITE ON THE PLAINS OF

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:22.530
SAN AUGUSTIN 250 MILES AWAY.
&gt;&gt; EARL, IF I WANT TO GO TO

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.570
THE CRASH SITE, WHICH WAY DO
I WANT TO TURN NOW?

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.100
&gt;&gt; YOU TAKE A LEFT RIGHT THERE
ON THAT ROAD. IT'S IN A HIGH

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.570
AREA LIKE THAT OVER THERE.
&gt;&gt; OK. WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.770
GOING BACK?
&gt;&gt; I FEEL ELATED TO BE ABLE TO

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.730
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AT
82 YEARS OLD.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:54.570
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
&gt;&gt; SHOW NO FEAR.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.030
&gt;&gt; AFTER NEARLY 3 HOURS OF
DRIVING, INCLUDING AN HOUR

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.120
OFF-ROAD, THE TEAM ARRIVES AT
THEIR DESTINATION.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.030
THIS IS THE FAMOUS ROSWELL
CRASH SITE. ON THIS BARREN

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.100
LANDSCAPE, MANY CLAIM HISTORY
WAS MADE. RIGHT HERE, FOR THE

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.330
FIRST AND, SO, FAR ONLY TIME,
THE UNITED STATES MILITARY

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:23.120
ADMITTED TO FINDING A UFO, ONLY
TO CHANGE ITS STORY DAYS LATER.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.600
&gt;&gt; SO, EARL, DO YOU REMEMBER
THIS SITE?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.600
&gt;&gt; YES. WE PICKED UP
MATERIAL HERE IN ABOUT

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.200
A ONE-SQUARE-MILE AREA.
&gt;&gt; SO, YOU WERE HERE PRETTY MUCH

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.270
THE WHOLE DAY?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THE BIGGER PART OF

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.770
A DAY.
&gt;&gt; EARL DESCRIBES THE FIELD AS

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:44.330
A FAN SPREADING OUT OVER ONE
SQUARE MILE. AND ACCORDING TO

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.530
HIM, THE DEBRIS WAS EVERYWHERE.
&gt;&gt; VEHICLES ALL DROVE UP AND,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.270
LIKE, FORMED A CIRCLE. WE
STARTED WALKING IN ONE

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:58.100
DIRECTION. WE WENT ABOUT 10, 12,
15 APART--WHERE I COULD SEE WHAT

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.200
YOU COULD SEE, AND YOU COULD SEE
WHAT I COULD SEE--SO WE WOULDN'T

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.000
MISS ANYTHING. WELL, I SEEN SOME
TYPE OF MATERIAL OR METAL OR

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.330
SOMETHING THAT LOOKED, UH,
SORT OF LIKE ALUMINUM. IT WAS

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.170
SHREDS AND PIECES.
&gt;&gt; NOW, WHEN YOU PICKED IT UP

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.530
AND TRIED TO PUT IT IN YOUR
SACK, WHAT HAPPENED?

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.430
&gt;&gt; WELL, MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
WAS GREAT SURPRISE. WHEN

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:28.107
I PICKED UP A PIECE AND I WADDED
IT UP TO PUT IN MY BAG, AND

00:15:28.107 --> 00:15:32.107
BEFORE IT GETS THERE, IT
CAME BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE.

00:15:32.107 --> 00:15:35.107
&gt;&gt; WOW.
&gt;&gt; AND I TOOK IT OUT AND

00:15:35.107 --> 00:15:40.530
I WADDED IT UP AGAIN, AND
SAME THING.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.830
&gt;&gt; OTHER WITNESSES HAVE
EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.200
PEOPLE BROUGHT DEBRIS BACK FROM
THIS VERY SITE. BUT EARL WAS

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.230
THERE AT THE BEGINNING. HE SAW
THE MATERIAL ON THE GROUND. HE

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.070
EXPLAINED THE SHOCK WHEN HE
PICKED UP A PIECE OF WHAT LOOKED

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.100
LIKE FOIL, TARNISHED CHROME
FOIL, CRUSHED IT IN HIS HAND,

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.110
WENT TO PUT IT IN THE SACK, AND
IT POPPED OPEN AGAIN.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.770
ABOUT HOW MANY PIECES DO YOU
THINK THAT YOU GATHERED IN YOUR

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.230
OWN GUNNYSACK?
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY I PICKED UP

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.110
10, 12, MAYBE 15 PIECES. BUT
ONCE IT WENT IN THOSE BAGS, WE

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.107
NEVER SEEN IT AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT ARMY

00:16:19.107 --> 00:16:22.400
PERSONNEL TOOK POSSESSION OF
THE BAGS?

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.500
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE MILITARY POLICE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS THE LAST TIME EARL WILL

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.870
SEE OR HERE OF THE DEBRIS.
&gt;&gt; THEY TOLD ME UP THERE IF

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:39.330
I SHOWED ANYONE OR TOLD ANYONE,
I WAS IN DEEP TROUBLE.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.270
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOTTEN A NEW
PERSPECTIVE ON ROSWELL TODAY,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.070
BECAUSE EARL FULFORD WAS ABLE TO
EXPLAIN TO US WHAT IT WAS LIKE

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.120
BEING HERE. NOW WE CAN GO TO
THE NEXT STEP.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.200
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL HAVE
ANY LUCK FINDING ANY MORE

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.930
WITNESSES, AND I DON'T THINK WE
CAN FIND A WITNESS BETTER THAN

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.930
EARL FULFORD. SO, THE THING
I WOULD WANT TO DO NOW IS SEE

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.430
IF THERE'S ANY WAY WE CAN
COME UP WITH EVEN THE SMALLEST

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.570
BIT OF DEBRIS.
&gt;&gt; WITH THIS FIRSTHAND

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.570
INFORMATION FROM EARL, TED LOOKS
AT CREATING AN EXPERIMENT WITH

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.600
CONVENTIONAL MATERIALS TO SEE IF
ANYTHING THAT WAS UNCONVENTIONAL

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.170
AT THE TIME MIGHT EXPLAIN WHAT
THESE CREWS WERE PICKING UP.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.870
THE FACT THAT THE MILITARY GOT
TO THIS SITE QUICKLY AND REMOVED

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.730
THE ALLEGED DEBRIS HAS
FRUSTRATED UFO RESEARCHERS FOR

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:32.170
YEARS. BUT WHAT IF THEY WERE NOT
THE FIRST TO ARRIVE? THERE ARE

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.117
RUMORS THAT LOCAL RANCHERS LIKE
MACK BRAZEL GOT TO THE CRASH

00:17:35.117 --> 00:17:40.230
SITE BEFORE THE MILITARY. AND
ACCORDING TO TOM'S RESEARCH,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.530
THEY MAY HAVE ACTUALLY COLLECTED
SOME OF THE WRECKAGE AND HIDDEN

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.070
IT IN NEARBY CAVES.
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.107
SEE IF THERE'S ANY TRUTH TO
THESE STORIES, MAYBE IN

00:17:49.107 --> 00:17:53.030
THE CAVES.
&gt;&gt; PAT HEADS OUT TO MEET

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:57.030
SUE MANIS, A LOCAL RANCHER
WHOSE FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE SINCE

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.110
THE ROSWELL INCIDENT.
&gt;&gt; SO, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.700
WHO COME OUT HERE LOOKING FOR
THE DEBRIS.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.120
&gt;&gt; OH, YES.
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE'D LIKE TO TAKE

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.830
A STAB AT INVESTIGATING THIS
OURSELF. AND WE'RE HOPING MAYBE

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.070
YOU CAN HELP US FIND SOME OF
THESE CAVES.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.930
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WILL TRY TO HELP YOU
FIND SOME OF THE CAVES. SOME ARE

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.600
EASY TO FIND. SOME ARE CAVED IN.
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.530
THAT MAYBE SOME OF THIS DEBRIS
IS IN THE CAVES?

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:25.900
&gt;&gt; WHERE THERE'S RUMOR, THERE IS
A POTENTIAL FOR THE TRUTH.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.200
&gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO SUE'S FAMILY,
HER UNCLE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.120
AT THE CRASH SITE. SHE POINTS
PAT IN THE DIRECTION OF A NEARBY

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.170
CAVE--ONE THAT HER UNCLE
SUPPOSEDLY VISITED OFTEN.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.600
ONE THEORY IS THAT HE MAY HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SOME OF

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.110
THE DEBRIS WITH HIM AND HID IT
THERE FOR SAFEKEEPING.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.200
PAT HEADS OUT TO SEARCH...
AND AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.107
FINDS A PROMISING SITE.
&gt;&gt; IF I WANTED TO GET RID OF

00:18:54.107 --> 00:18:59.117
MY UFO DEBRIS, THIS WOULD BE
A NICE PLACE TO PUT IT. WHEW.

00:18:59.117 --> 00:19:03.830
&gt;&gt; PAT'S DESCENT MUST BE
CAUTIOUS. THE ONLY THING TO

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:10.570
SECURE HIS LINE TO IS A SMALL
PIECE OF DESERT BRUSH.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:14.107
THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED ROUTE
DOWN INTO THE CAVE.

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:18.830
&gt;&gt; UHH. GOT IT.
&gt;&gt; AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:32.330
WHAT MIGHT BE INSIDE.
&gt;&gt; DAMN IT.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.170
WHEW. OK. WELL...WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:40.100
IN HERE.
[GRUNTING]

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.120
WELL, I'VE JUST DISCOVERED THAT
THE RUMORS ARE TRUE. THERE ARE

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.100
UNDERGROUND CAVES HERE NEAR
THE MACK BRAZEL DEBRIS FIELD.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.930
AND THESE WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE
FOR PEOPLE TO STOW AWAY THIS

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.100
DEBRIS IF THEY WANTED TO HIDE IT
FROM MILITARY PERSONNEL. WHETHER

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:05.670
OR NOT THE DEBRIS IS ACTUALLY
DOWN HERE, UH, WE'LL SEE.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.330
I CAN TELL FROM THIS LAYER OF
SILT HERE THAT THIS IS ALL

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.330
PROBABLY RAIN DRAINAGE THAT
PROBABLY COMES THROUGH THIS

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.030
TUNNEL. WE CAN SEE IT ON
THE OUTSIDE. THIS IS AS FAR AS

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:21.730
THE TUNNEL GOES. ALL I HAVE IS
HARD WALLS OF QUARTZ AND A SILTY

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:29.830
FLOOR. THAT'S ALL I'VE FOUND
DOWN IN THIS CAVE.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.100
&gt;&gt; MANY DON'T REALIZE THAT THESE
CAVES BELOW THE DESERT EVEN

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.500
EXIST. AND PAT'S DISCOVERY OF
A CAVE NEAR SUE'S RANCH PUTS

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.370
THE RUMORS INTO PERSPECTIVE.
NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE IDEAL

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.170
HIDING PLACES--THESE CAVES
ARE EVERYWHERE.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.170
&gt;&gt; WHEW. THESE RANGES ARE
SO VAST, IT MIGHT TAKE MONTHS

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.930
TO FIND ALL THE CAVES
AROUND HERE THAT ARE AROUND

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.107
THE DEBRIS FIELD.
&gt;&gt; DESPITE THIS CONFIRMATION,

00:20:56.107 --> 00:21:00.770
AFTER 60 YEARS, THE ALLEGED
FIRST CRASH SITE STILL HAS NOT

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.770
YIELDED ANY DEBRIS.
BUT THE FIRST PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.670
THAT COULD POINT TO A UFO HAS
EMERGED FROM THE SECOND CRASH.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:19.870
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE ORGANIC FORM.
&gt;&gt; FOR YEARS, THE ROSWELL CRASH

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:25.670
HAS DOMINATED THIS TINY CITY
AND THE NEARBY RANCHES.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.870
BUT FEW HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO
ANOTHER ALLEGED UFO CRASH STORY

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.730
250 MILES WEST IN THE PLAINS OF
SAN AUGUSTIN THAT REPORTEDLY

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:40.900
HAPPENED THE SAME WEEK OF
JULY 1947. THE INVESTIGATION'S

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.030
NEXT STEP IS TO VISIT THE SECOND
CRASH SITE AND DETERMINE IF IT

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.870
HAS ANY CONNECTION TO ROSWELL.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO MEET WITH

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.870
ART CAMPBELL, RESEARCHER WHO'S
BEEN STUDYING THIS SECOND SITE

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.930
THOROUGHLY. APPARENTLY, THERE'S
ALL KINDS OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.100
HERE TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY OF
A SECOND CRASH SITE. BASICALLY,

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.120
I'M HERE TO LOOK AT IT AND SEE
IF THERE'S ANY CREDENCE TO THIS.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.100
&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS
SITE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.200
A UFO CRASH?
&gt;&gt; WELL, AT FIRST, I WASN'T SURE

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.370
IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
A UFO CRASH. BUT I STARTED

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.230
FINDING THINGS.
&gt;&gt; CAMPBELL UNCOVERS SEVERAL

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:22.330
DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS DURING A DIG
IN 1995. HE CROSS-REFERENCES HIS

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.900
DIGS LOCATION WITH THE STORY OF
BARNEY BARNETT, WHO CLAIMED TO

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.730
HAVE FOUND A UFO CRASH SITE IN
THIS AREA IN JULY 1947.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.370
&gt;&gt; BARNEY BARNETT WAS A LOCAL
SOIL CONSERVATION ENGINEER. AND

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.330
HE HAD A DISTRICT THAT WAS
70 MILES LONG, 72 MILES WIDE.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.107
AND HE WAS ASSIGNED TO HELP
FARMERS WITH CONSERVATION

00:22:44.107 --> 00:22:48.270
PROJECTS. IT WAS IN ONE OF
THE MAIN HIGHWAYS HE DROVE ON--

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.600
SAW SOMETHING GLINTING IN
THE SUN. HE TOLD FRIENDS AND

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.670
RELATIVES HE THOUGHT IT WAS
A PLANE CRASH. AND HE KNEW A WAY

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.100
IN. SO, HE DROVE OVER THERE AS
FAST AS HE COULD GET THERE AND

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.103
CAME OVER A SMALL RISE AND
LOOKED DOWN ON THIS UFO,

00:23:01.103 --> 00:23:05.670
GLINT ON ONE SIDE, DOUBLE
BODIES OUTSIDE.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.230
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE VEHICLE AND THE BODIES?

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.110
&gt;&gt; HE WAS THERE PROBABLY
A HALF-HOUR OR 45 MINUTES, AND

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.107
SOME ARCHAEOLOGISTS CAME UP.
&gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO BARNETT'S

00:23:13.107 --> 00:23:18.370
ACCOUNT, THESE ARCHAEOLOGISTS
ARE RETURNING FROM A NEARBY DIG

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:23.070
WHEN THEY STUMBLE UPON BARNEY
AND THE UFO CRASH SITE. IN HIS

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.107
RESEARCH, CAMPBELL LOCATED
CORROBORATING DOCUMENTS FOR

00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:31.070
BARNETT'S CLAIM.
ACCORDING TO THIS LETTER FROM

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.110
THE PEABODY MUSEUM AT HARVARD
UNIVERSITY, ARCHAEOLOGIST

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.600
HERBERT W. DICK WAS WORKING
AT BAT CAVE IN THE PLAINS OF

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.120
SAN AUGUSTIN IN THE SUMMER OF
1947. BAT CAVE IS IN CLOSE

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.730
PROXIMITY TO THE SITE WHERE
ART PERFORMED HIS DIG.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.870
&gt;&gt; THEN THE ARMY DROVE UP IN
SEVERAL VEHICLES--SAID, "OH,

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.000
THIS SIGHT IS SECURE," AND
CHASED THEM OFF.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.120
&gt;&gt; AND AGAIN, THIS WAS
A COMPLETELY SEPARATE CRASH

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.730
SITE. HE DIDN'T SEE THE CRASH
AT ROSWELL.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.000
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT
SOMETHING CRASHED IN THE PLAINS

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.570
OF SAN AUGUSTIN?
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. SO, THE THEORY IS

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.570
THAT SOME CRAFT CRASHED INTO
THIS, HIT YOU, CRASHED IN

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.670
THE EARTH. IT WOULD HAVE LEFT
A LONG GOUGE, WOULDN'T IT HAVE?

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.500
&gt;&gt; YES. I BET THE GOUGE WOULD BE
MAYBE ABOUT 200 FEET LONG.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.830
&gt;&gt; AND DO YOU THINK MIXED UP IN
THE SOIL HERE WOULD BE SOME

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.600
COMPONENTS OF THE VEHICLE
OR WRECKAGE?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.730
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE,
YES. WHATEVER IT WAS CAME INTO

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:34.930
THAT SAGEBRUSH AND CUT A SWAB
TO IT.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.570
&gt;&gt; THE SITE HAD NUMEROUS
ARTIFACTS THAT CAMPBELL

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.200
COLLECTED AFTER PERSISTENT AND
THOROUGH DIGGING. THIS IS

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:50.600
THE FIRST TIME HE'S BEEN BACK
TO THE SITE IN ALMOST 5 YEARS.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.900
HE SPECIFICALLY REQUESTS THAT
THE ACTUAL LOCATION NOT

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:06.500
BE REVEALED.
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.900
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN THIS
STUFF AT ROSWELL. RESEARCHERS

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.200
HAVE RESEARCHED ROSWELL FOR
YEARS. BUT THIS IS ALL NEW

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.930
INFORMATION. NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE
KNOW ABOUT THIS SITE HERE IN

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.830
SAN AUGUSTIN. SO, WE'LL BE
THE FIRST TO REALLY INVESTIGATE

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.100
THIS AREA WITH ART CAMPBELL.
SO, YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.120
WHERE BARNEY BARNETT SAID
THE CRASH WAS.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.930
&gt;&gt; YES. I AM.
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.000
ARCHAEOLOGISTS? IS THIS ALSO
WHERE THEY SAW THE OBJECT?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.200
&gt;&gt; THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS CAME FROM
THIS DIRECTION. THAT'S WHERE

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.730
BAT CAVE IS.
&gt;&gt; BUT THE PRESENCE OF BAT CAVE

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.370
WAS JUST CIRCUMSTANTIAL. SO,
ART TURNED TO AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.120
DIG TO FIND PHYSICAL PROOF OF
A CRASH.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.370
&gt;&gt; SO, IN THEORY, UH, THE OBJECT
CAME AND CRASHED IN FROM

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.570
WHAT DIRECTION?
&gt;&gt; A FLAT DIRECTION FROM

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.200
THE NORTHEAST.
&gt;&gt; AND RIGHT CAME--AND CRASHED

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.730
THROUGH HERE.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.170
FIGURE, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; BEFORE HIS EXCAVATION,

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:02.270
CAMPBELL TOOK AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS
OF THE AREA. SEVERAL FORMER

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.270
WATER CHANNELS CAN BE SEEN
MOVING ON A SOUTHWESTERN COURSE.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.670
BUT CAMPBELL NOTICED A SEPARATE
GAP MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.770
DIRECTION OF THESE NATURAL
COURSES AND FOCUSED HIS

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.103
DIG HERE.
&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU DETERMINE THAT

00:26:15.103 --> 00:26:18.117
THIS AREA HERE WAS A TRENCH?
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SOIL WAS

00:26:18.117 --> 00:26:24.070
DIFFERENT. I HAD 21 TEST HOLES
DUG ONE EVENING, 7 UP EACH SIDE

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.117
OF THE SAGEBRUSH, AND ONE DOWN
THE CENTER WHERE WE'RE STANDING.

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:29.230
THE SOIL IN THE CENTER OF THIS
WAS DIFFERENT.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.430
&gt;&gt; AND THAT GAVE YOU SORT OF
THE HUNCH THAT SOMETHING WAS

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.870
GOING ON HERE?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.100
&gt;&gt; THE WAY ART DESCRIBES THE
CASE IS, THE VEHICLE CAME IN.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.100
YOU CAN SEE A BIT OF, YOU KNOW,
WHAT SEEMS TO BE AN ALLEY

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.570
THROUGH THE SAGE. IT COULD BE
NATURAL. IT COULD BE CAUSED BY

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.700
SOME EFFECT--FOR EXAMPLE,
A FILLED AREA WHERE THE SAGE

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.100
DOESN'T WANT TO GROW BACK INTO.
SO, IT'S RELATIVELY CONSISTENT.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:58.170
THAT COULD BE A NATURAL EFFECT.
I CAN'T PROVE IT EITHER WAY.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.117
&gt;&gt; BUT ONE OF THE ARTIFACTS THAT
ART UNCOVERED IN HIS DIG MAY

00:27:01.117 --> 00:27:06.530
PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PROOF.
&gt;&gt; LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THESE

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.200
ARTIFACTS YOU RECOVERED.
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A PIECE I FOUND

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.110
UNDER THE SAGEBRUSH THAT KICKED
THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION OFF.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.100
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. HUH. LOOK AT THAT.
&gt;&gt; I WAS OUT HERE DIGGING.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.900
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING, UH, IN A SORT OF

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.270
AN ORGANIC FORM OR MELTED.
&gt;&gt; CAMPBELL UNCOVERS

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.330
THE ARTIFACT IN THE SAME GAP
THAT HE BELIEVES INDICATES

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:31.570
A UFO CRASHED HERE. IT IS
SMOOTH, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND APPEARS

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.430
TO HAVE MELTED OR COLLAPSED IN
ON ITSELF.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.500
&gt;&gt; DIDN'T DARE THINK IT WAS
ANYTHING UNUSUAL. I TOOK IT UP

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.200
TO THE RESTAURANT HERE AND PUT
IT IN FRONT OF 2 CATTLE

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.100
INSPECTORS. AND THEY SAID, "THAT
AIN'T NO PART OF NO COW." AND

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.230
THEN I WAS OFF AND RUNNING WITH
MY RESEARCH.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.030
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM. HAVE A LOOK AT THAT.
&gt;&gt; WOW. THAT IS REALLY

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.100
WEIRD-LOOKING.
&gt;&gt; WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IS

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.400
GET THIS ARTIFACT BACK TO THE
LAB AND TEST IT. I MEAN, TO ME,

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.330
IT'S THE MOST INTRIGUING ASPECT
OF THIS CASE. YOU KNOW, FIRST

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.110
THING--I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S
MADE OF. IS IT ORGANIC? IS IT

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.830
INORGANIC? AGAIN, WE'RE JUST
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.000
UNUSUAL HERE. OR IS IT
ALL EXPLAINABLE?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.670
&gt;&gt; WITH THE FIELDWORK COMPLETE,
THE INVESTIGATION MOVES TO

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.400
AN EXPERIMENT THAT WILL PUT BOTH
THE GOVERNMENT EXPLANATION AND

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:23.070
THE EYEWITNESSES TO THE TEST.
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT SOMETHING THERE.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.107
&gt;&gt; IN 1947, FOR ONE DAY,
THE U.S. MILITARY SAID THAT IT

00:28:31.107 --> 00:28:37.117
HAD RECOVERED A FLYING SAUCER.
DAYS LATER, THEY RECANT. THEN,

00:28:37.117 --> 00:28:43.500
IN THE 1990s, THEY ADMIT
SOMETHING DID CRASH. BUT IT WAS

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:50.000
A TOP-SECRET MILITARY EXPERIMENT
CALLED PROJECT MOGUL.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.070
AFTER VISITING 2 ALLEGED UFO
CRASH SITES, THE INVESTIGATION

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.120
IS ATTEMPTING TO TEST
THE GOVERNMENT EXPLANATION FOR

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:04.100
THE ROSWELL INCIDENT--A PROJECT
MOGUL BALLOON.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.200
PAT IS MEETING WITH
MICHAEL KEANE, A MILITARY

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.830
TACTICS EXPERT AND LECTURER AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:16.100
CALIFORNIA TO DISCUSS THIS
MUCH-DEBATED ANSWER FOR ROSWELL.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.930
&gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME,
THE UNITED STATES HAD A MONOPOLY

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.330
ON ATOMIC WEAPONS. BUT WHAT IF,
UNKNOWN TO THE UNITED STATES,

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.770
THE SOVIETS HAD ACQUIRED
AN ATOMIC BOMB? WHAT WE REALLY

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.730
FEARED WAS AN ATOMIC
PEARL HARBOR OR A NUCLEAR 9/11.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.930
AND SO, WE UNDERTOOK A CRASH
PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT MOGUL.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.330
&gt;&gt; AND MOST PEOPLE THAT HAVE
LOOKED INTO ROSWELL KNOW ABOUT

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.230
PROJECT MOGUL. BUT MAYBE YOU CAN
GIVE ME SOME DETAILS AS TO WHY

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.930
THAT'S SUCH A VALID EXPLANATION.
&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T JUST ONE BALLOON.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.330
IT WAS A STRING OF 20 TO 30
WEATHER BALLOONS FOLLOWED BY

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.870
AN EXTENSIVE PAYLOAD FOLLOWED BY
MAYBE HALF A DOZEN RADAR

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:53.700
REFLECTORS. IT WAS AN
EXTENSIVE OPERATION.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.330
&gt;&gt; ORIGINALLY, PROJECT MOGUL
USED LONG STRINGS OF RUBBER

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.000
WEATHER BALLOONS TO CARRY
MICROPHONES AND RADIO

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.330
TRANSMITTERS. THESE TOOLS WERE
SENT HIGH INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:09.230
LISTEN FOR SOUND WAVES FROM
SOVIET MISSILE AND BOMB TESTS.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.330
&gt;&gt; THIS IS PROBABLY CLOSE TO
700 FEET LONG, WHICH IS, YOU

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.670
KNOW, GREATER THAN HALF
THE HEIGHT OF THE EIFFEL TOWER.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.110
&gt;&gt; BUT WOULD IT REALLY LOOK LIKE
DEBRIS? I MEAN, THESE GUYS

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.830
CLEARLY DESCRIBED VERY STRANGE
DEBRIS THAT THEY'VE NEVER

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.000
SEEN BEFORE.
&gt;&gt; AS PART OF THE PAYLOAD

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.070
DROPPED OFF, THE BALLOON COULD
RISE AGAIN. WINDS COULD DRAG IT.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.200
IT COULD FALL AGAIN. IT COULD
CREATE MULTIPLE TYPE OF DEBRIS

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.770
SITES--OR AN EXTENSIVE DEBRIS
FIELD, FOR THAT MATTER.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.070
&gt;&gt; SO, THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN THESE
MULTIPLE CRASH SITES.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:38.870
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. SURE.
&gt;&gt; IF THE MOGUL BALLOON IS THE

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.870
REAL EXPLANATION FOR ROSWELL,
THEN EYEWITNESSES WHO HANDLED

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:46.530
THE DEBRIS SHOULD BE ABLE TO
IDENTIFY THE MYLAR FOIL USED IN

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.100
THE RADAR REFLECTORS.
BUT MANY DESCRIBE A STRANGE

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.107
MEMORY METAL THAT IS BOTH
LIGHTWEIGHT AND ABLE TO RETURN

00:30:54.107 --> 00:31:04.107
TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM. WHAT DID
THESE WITNESSES HANDLE?

00:31:04.107 --> 00:31:07.120
AT WONDERWORKS, A SPECIAL
EFFECTS HOUSE LOCATED IN

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.900
LOS ANGELES, BILL HAS BROUGHT IN
2 EYEWITNESSES FOR THE TEST--

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.100
EARL FULFORD, WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE
HANDLED THE DEBRIS AT THE

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:21.100
ALLEGED FIRST CRASH SITE, AND
JESSE MARCEL JR., WHO SAYS HE

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.107
HANDLED MATERIAL WHEN HIS
FATHER, MAJOR JESSE MARCEL,

00:31:24.107 --> 00:31:29.107
BROUGHT SOME OF THE DEBRIS HOME
FROM THE CRASH SITE.

00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:32.830
&gt;&gt; WE'VE COLLECTED A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT SEEM TO

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.600
MATCH ROUGHLY THE DESCRIPTIONS
FROM OUR 2 WITNESSES. WE'RE

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.110
GONNA BRING IN EACH WITNESS
INDEPENDENTLY AND SEE IF THEY

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:43.230
CAN POSITIVELY I.D. THE MATERIAL
THEY WERE HANDLING BACK IN 1947.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.500
&gt;&gt; I GOT A HANDFUL OF DIFFERENT
METALS HERE. WE'RE STARTING OFF

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.830
WITH .032 MAGNESIUM--SAME WITH
STEEL, ALUMINUM, ALSO STEEL. BUT

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.600
THIS IS IN .005. YOU CAN SEE
IT'S QUITE FLEXIBLE AND FLAT.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.110
THIS IS ACTUALLY CARDBOARD AT
.032--AND .005 ACETATE WITH KIND

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:04.870
OF AN ALUMINUM FINISH TO IT.
AND THIS IS MYLAR, ALSO WITH

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.100
AN ALUMINUM FILM TO IT.
&gt;&gt; EARL, THE FIRST SUBJECT, IS

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.670
BROUGHT IN TO LOOK AT
THE MATERIALS.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.500
&gt;&gt; TAKE A TURN ON EACH PIECE
AND TELL ME YES OR NO--

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.500
DOES IT LOOK OR FEEL LIKE
THE PIECE OF METAL FROM 1947?

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:24.170
&gt;&gt; NO. IT'S A LITTLE TOO THICK.
&gt;&gt; LET'S DO THE NEXT ONE.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:30.600
&gt;&gt; THIS ONE...IS TOO HEAVY.
THE COLOR IS CLOSE, BUT WEIGHT

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.100
IS TOO MUCH.
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.530
&gt;&gt; THIS MATERIAL, NOW, WAS
ALMOST WEIGHTLESS.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.900
&gt;&gt; LET'S DO THE NEXT ONE.
&gt;&gt; TOO STIFF.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.670
THIS ONE IS CLOSER,
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:50.107
I COULD FOLD IT UP.
THIS ONE DOESN'T RESEMBLE IT

00:32:50.107 --> 00:33:00.870
IN ANY WAY.
THIS ONE FEELS MORE LIKE

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:06.530
THE MATERIAL. THE MATERIAL WE
GOT, WE COULD WAD UP, AND IT

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.100
WOULD POP BACK JUST ABOUT LIKE
THAT'S DOING NOW.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.430
&gt;&gt; THIS ONE, YOU FEEL LIKE
THE THICKNESS IS ABOUT RIGHT,

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.270
THE WEIGHT--
&gt;&gt; THICKNESS AND THE WEIGHT--

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.120
&gt;&gt; AND THE STIFFNESS?
&gt;&gt; MAKES CHILLS RUN DOWN

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:24.900
MY BACK.
&gt;&gt; NOW, LET'S GET THIS LAST ONE.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.103
&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY NOT.
&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT

00:33:29.103 --> 00:33:32.000
WAS REALLY INTRIGUING TO ME,
WHICH IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.117
TRIED TO CRUMPLE IT UP, PUT IT
BACK IN YOUR BAG. CAN YOU TRY

00:33:35.117 --> 00:33:42.530
ACTUALLY DOING IT AND SEE IF YOU
CAN GET THAT SAME EFFECT?

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:50.430
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT SOMETHING THERE.
THAT'S DEFINITELY...AS CLOSE AS

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:54.200
WHAT I'VE SEEN.
&gt;&gt; THE ACETATE SEEMS TO BE

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.107
A CLOSE MATCH FOR WHAT EARL
EXPERIENCED. BUT ACCORDING TO

00:33:58.107 --> 00:34:03.430
THE OFFICIAL ROSWELL REPORT
RELEASED IN 1994, THIS TYPE OF

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.530
ACETATE WAS NOT USED IN THE
CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECT MOGUL

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.430
BALLOONS. ONLY ACETATE TAPE WAS
USED, WHICH BARES NO RESEMBLANCE

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:16.830
TO THE FORM OF ACETATE BEING
TESTED. BUT IF A BALLOON DIDN'T

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:22.103
CRASH AT ROSWELL, WHAT DID?
ANOTHER EYEWITNESS MAY CONFIRM

00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:27.120
OR DENY THE FINDINGS SO FAR.
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE HAVE ONE MORE

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.400
WITNESS--ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
OF THE ROSWELL WITNESSES--

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.170
JESSE MARCEL JR.
&gt;&gt; THE NIGHT THAT MY DAD BROUGHT

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.117
THE MATERIAL HOME, I LOOKED AT
ALL THIS MATERIAL ON THE FLOOR.

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:40.117
THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS,
"LOOK AT THIS, 'CAUSE YOU'LL

00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:43.110
PROBABLY NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN."
&gt;&gt; NOW, REMEMBER, THIS IS

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:47.670
A BLIND TEST. SO, LET'S NOT LEAD
ON ABOUT ANY OF THESE EARLY

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.100
FINDINGS WITH EARL.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A SHEET METAL. NOW,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.500
WHAT I SAW WAS NOT REALLY LIKE
A SHEET METAL. IT WAS MORE LIKE

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.370
A FOIL. SO, THIS IS MUCH
TOO THICK.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.170
&gt;&gt; TOO THICK?
&gt;&gt; NOW, THESE ARE SHEET METAL.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.570
WHAT I SAW, THE FOIL, WAS NOT
SHEET METAL.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.000
THIS IS GETTING CLOSE TO THE
FEELING OF THE THICKNESS OF IT.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.930
IT WAS NOT AS SHINY AS THIS,
THOUGH. IT WAS A LITTLE MORE

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:15.430
DULL THAN THIS. BUT THIS IS
CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL THICKNESS.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.270
&gt;&gt; LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT
THIS ONE LAST.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.900
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THIS IS VERY
INSUBSTANTIAL. THIS IS, LIKE,

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.500
A REAL THIN FOIL.
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.103
&gt;&gt; THE FOIL THAT I SAW WAS MUCH
THICKER THAN THIS. BUT

00:35:23.103 --> 00:35:26.900
ACTUALLY--IT HAD ABOUT THE SAME
WEIGHT, THOUGH. IT WAS THICKER,

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.900
BUT ABOUT THE SAME WEIGHT--
&gt;&gt; ALMOST WEIGHTLESS.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.730
&gt;&gt; AS THIS. IT WAS ALMOST
WEIGHTLESS. SO, IT COULD FLOAT

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.120
DOWN LIKE THAT IN THE AIR.
&gt;&gt; BUT DOES THE ACETATE ALSO

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.730
DISPLAY THE MEMORY METAL
PROPERTIES THAT JESSE'S

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.230
FATHER DESCRIBED?
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO TRY AND

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:47.730
CRUMPLE IT?
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T STAY CRUMPLED.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.230
&gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT HE DESCRIBED?
&gt;&gt; YEAH. THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.070
HE DESCRIBED.
&gt;&gt; UNBEKNOWNST TO EITHER OF

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.930
THEM, BOTH EARL AND JESSE HAVE
IDENTIFIED ACETATE AS

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:02.000
THE MATERIAL CLOSEST TO WHAT
THEY HANDLED BACK IN JULY 1947.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.330
&gt;&gt; THE AMAZING THING WAS,
IS THAT BOTH OF THEM ZEROED

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.700
RIGHT IN ON THE ACETATE.
IT'S PLAIN AS DAY TO ME THAT

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.120
THEY BOTH FOUND THE THICKNESS,
THE MALLEABILITY, AND THE

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.370
OVERALL WEIGHT OF THE ACETATE TO
BE, LIKE, A ONE-TO-ONE MATCH.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.107
THIS HAS BEEN REALLY PRODUCTIVE.
WHEN YOU THINK OF PEOPLE

00:36:18.107 --> 00:36:22.230
BACK IN 1947 HANDLING ACETATE,
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.100
REVOLUTIONARY MATERIAL
BACK THEN.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.870
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE AMAZING THING FOR
ME, IS THAT IT WAS THE SIMPLE

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.120
SOLUTION. WE KEPT LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING MORE EXOTIC.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.400
&gt;&gt; ACETATE IS A POPULAR
COMPONENT IN FILM STOCK,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.730
ADHESIVE TAPE, AND SYNTHETIC
FABRICS. AS EARLY AS 1910, IT

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.270
WAS USED AS A GLUE-LIKE LIQUID
TO COAT AND STRENGTHEN FABRIC

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.110
AIRCRAFT WINGS AND FUSELAGES.
BUT ACETATE IN A STRIP OR SHEET

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:52.430
FORM WAS NOT USED IN ANY KNOWN
AIRCRAFT IN THE 1940s.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:56.170
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ACETATE IN
A PROJECT MOGUL BALLOON. SO,

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.100
WHAT DID WE PROVE TODAY? WE DID
PROVE SOMETHING. WE PROVED THAT

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.120
2 WITNESSES WHO DIDN'T KNOW
EACH OTHER, WHO WERE THERE AT

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:08.000
THE TIME, IDENTIFIED THE EXACT
SAME MATERIAL.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.330
&gt;&gt; IF THE UNKNOWN MATERIAL
HANDLED BY EYEWITNESSES WAS

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:17.230
ACETATE, IS IT FROM AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT CLASSIFIED PROJECT?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:21.500
THIS STRANGE ARTIFACT COULD SHED
MORE LIGHT ON WHAT HAPPENED AT

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.870
2 DIFFERENT SITES IN NEW MEXICO
IN 1947.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.770
&gt;&gt; IT MUST HAVE BEEN
AN EXPLOSION.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.870
&gt;&gt; 2 EYEWITNESSES WHO CLAIM TO
HAVE HANDLED DEBRIS IN ROSWELL

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:41.070
HAVE IDENTIFIED ACETATE AS
THE CLOSEST MATCH FOR WHAT THEY

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:47.100
SAW IN 1947. BUT ACETATE WAS
NEVER USED IN A PROJECT MOGUL

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.270
BALLOON. IN EFFECT, THESE
WITNESSES HAVE ALL BUT

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.107
ELIMINATED THE GOVERNMENT'S
MOGUL BALLOON EXPLANATION.

00:37:54.107 --> 00:38:00.100
SO, THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS,
WHAT CRASHED IN 1947, AND WHAT

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.930
WAS IT MADE OF?
IF THE SECOND CRASH IN

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:09.230
SAN AUGUSTIN IS TRULY LINKED TO
ROSWELL, THE FINAL ANALYSIS OF

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:13.120
THIS ARTIFACT MAY HOLD
THE ANSWERS.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.930
TED BRINGS THE ARTIFACT TO
SEAL LABS IN LOS ANGELES AND

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:22.430
DR. ARUM KUMAR, A METALLURGY
AND SAMPLE PROCESSING EXPERT,

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:25.930
FOR A CLOSER EXAMINATION.
&gt;&gt; I BROUGHT THE SPECIMEN IN.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.570
BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO SHOWING
IT TO YOU. HERE IT IS.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.930
&gt;&gt; WOW. WHAT IS IT?
&gt;&gt; THIS CAME OUT OF AN

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.930
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG. AND THE SITE
MAY HAVE BEEN A CRASH SITE.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.117
WE'RE NOT SURE. THIS IS ONE OF
THE MORE UNUSUAL OR DIFFICULT TO

00:38:38.117 --> 00:38:41.107
EXPLAIN ARTIFACTS--CAME UP AT
THE SITE.

00:38:41.107 --> 00:38:43.110
&gt;&gt; IT DOES LOOK PRETTY UNUSUAL.
&gt;&gt; AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:47.070
A SENSE OF WHAT IT COULD BE.
IS IT ORGANIC? IS IT MAN-MADE?

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.930
IS IT NATURAL?
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE'LL TEST IT AND

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.110
FIGURE THIS OUT. I THINK WE
SHOULD DO A VARIETY OF TESTS

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:57.270
ON THIS.
&gt;&gt; THESE TESTS WILL HELP PROVE

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.100
CONCLUSIVELY WHAT THE OBJECT IS
MADE OF.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.030
THE ARTIFACT IS SMOOTH TO THE
TOUCH AND, AT JUST 4 OUNCES, IS

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.100
EXTRAORDINARILY LIGHTWEIGHT. BUT
INITIAL LOOKS REVEAL SEVERAL

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:14.100
CRACKS AND FOLDS THAT SUGGEST
THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE LAYERS TO

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.700
THE OBJECT.
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:23.270
FOLDS AND SORT OF CREVICES.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.430
THIS BEFORE?
&gt;&gt; NOTHING OF THIS SHAPE

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.370
AND FORM. OBVIOUSLY, IT LOOKS
PRETTY UNUSUAL.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:31.100
&gt;&gt; THE CRACKED, OPEN AREAS OF
THE FISSURES MIGHT HAVE SOME

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.570
MATERIAL DOWN INSIDE THAT WE
COULD PULL OUT.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.230
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; WHILE TED AND DR. KUMAR TAKE

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.730
A CLOSER LOOK INSIDE THE OBJECT,
2 SAMPLES OF THE ARTIFACT ARE

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.110
TESTED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE
OBJECT IS MADE OF, AS WELL AS

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:49.400
ITS MELTING POINT.
KNOWING WHAT TEMPERATURE IS

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.120
NEEDED TO MELT THE OBJECT COULD
GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE CONDITIONS

00:39:52.120 --> 00:40:00.230
THAT LED TO IT TAKING THIS FORM.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE THIS OBJECT HERE

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.100
WE NEED TO EXAMINE IN
THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.230
&gt;&gt; ALSO, IF--YOU KNOW, IN SOME
OF THESE CREVICES, IT LOOKS TO

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:13.570
BE SOME BITS OF MATERIAL OR
A POWDER DOWN THERE.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.330
&gt;&gt; TED AND DR. KUMAR LOCATE
A FEW PARTICLES TO EXAMINE FROM

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:22.830
INSIDE THE OBJECT. RUNNING THESE
PARTICLES THROUGH THE SCANNING

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:29.330
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE SHOWS A
BREAKDOWN OF ITS BASIC ELEMENTS.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:34.100
&gt;&gt; OK. SO, WHAT WE SEE HERE IS
A LARGE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AND

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.530
CARBON, WHICH WILL BE COMPONENT
FROM THE ORGANIC MATERIAL.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:40.000
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.
&gt;&gt; AND IT ALSO CONTAINS QUITE

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.730
A BIT OF, UH, FILLER MATERIAL,
SO TO SAY. A BIT OF THIS

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:49.870
MATERIAL COMES FROM SAND AND
SOIL AND DIRT AS WELL.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.107
&gt;&gt; NOTHING ANOMALOUS IS FOUND
FROM THE PARTICLE INSIDE

00:40:52.107 --> 00:40:57.500
THE OBJECT.
BUT THE RESULT OF THE ARTIFACT'S

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.400
MAKEUP PROVE SURPRISING.
&gt;&gt; HEY.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.530
&gt;&gt; HI.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU FIND?

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.900
&gt;&gt; I GOT A NICE, CLEAN SPECTRUM
AND JUST RAN IT THROUGH

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.330
THE DATABASE. AND IT'S
CLEARLY POLYETHYLENE.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.120
&gt;&gt; POLYETHYLENE?
&gt;&gt; AND EVEN MORE SO, IT HAS

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.120
A HIGH MELTING POINT. IT HAS
ABOUT 130 DEGREES C, WHICH MEANS

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.170
IT'S HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD THAT COME FROM?

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.730
WHAT WOULD BE--COMMON
CONTAINERS OR...

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.670
&gt;&gt; TUPPERWARE.
&gt;&gt; BUT HDPE, OR HIGH-DENSITY

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.770
POLYETHYLENE, ISN'T USED
COMMERCIALLY IN PRODUCTS LIKE

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.117
TUPPERWARE UNTIL THE EARLY
1960s. AND THE MATERIAL ITSELF

00:41:32.117 --> 00:41:38.730
ISN'T OFFICIALLY INVENTED UNTIL
1953, 6 YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:44.370
CRASHES AT ROSWELL AND
SAN AUGUSTIN.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.070
IF ART CAMPBELL FOUND
THE ARTIFACT AT THE SITE OF

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.930
THE SECOND CRASH, IT EITHER
FOUND ITS WAY TO THE MIDDLE OF

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:56.670
THE DESERT SOMETIME AFTER 1953,
OR IT'S PART OF A CRASH THAT

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:02.117
HAPPENED 6 YEARS BEFORE
ITS INVENTION.

00:42:02.117 --> 00:42:08.900
TODAY, HDPE IS NOT ONLY USED IN
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS BUT ALSO TO

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.000
MAKE FUEL TANKS AND AIRCRAFT
WINDOWS. HOW COULD SOMETHING

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.230
WITH SUCH A HIGH MELTING POINT
BECOME SO DEFORMED?

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.570
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS FOUND IN THE DESERT
IN NEW MEXICO, WHICH IS HOT, BUT

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.070
NOTHING GETS THAT HOT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S 250 DEGREES

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.330
FAHRENHEIT? SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
&gt;&gt; EVEN IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.120
SO, WE KNOW THIS DIDN'T
MELT JUST BASED ON

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.103
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

00:42:30.103 --> 00:42:33.070
&gt;&gt; IT MUST HAVE BEEN PUT INTO
A FIRE OR AN EXPLOSION OR

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.120
SOMETHING TO ELEVATE ITS HEAT.
&gt;&gt; YES. THAT'S TRUE.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.103
&gt;&gt; PROJECT MOGUL DIDN'T USE
ACETATE OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL

00:42:40.103 --> 00:42:45.110
LIKE IT. AND NOW, THE REMOTE
SITE OF A SECOND CRASH CONTAINS

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:49.270
MATERIAL THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IN
AN EXPLOSION.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.830
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THE DESERT
ENVIRONMENT IN THAT AREA NEVER

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:56.370
GETS OVER 110, 120 DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT. BUT WE ALSO KNOW

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:01.570
THAT HDPE DOESN'T MELT BELOW
130 CELSIUS. SO, I WONDER, HOW

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.100
DID THIS OBJECT GET MELTED IN
THE DESERT THERE? IT WOULD HAVE

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.530
TO HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LIKE
A FIRE OR AN EXPLOSION TO REACH

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.110
THOSE TEMPERATURES.
&gt;&gt; THIS PROVIDES AN ENTIRELY NEW

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.430
PERSPECTIVE. FOR YEARS,
THE GOVERNMENT DENIES ANYTHING

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:21.770
HAPPENED AT ROSWELL BUT THEN
ADMITS TO SECRET TESTS. NOW,

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.120
THIS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE RAISES
SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THOSE

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.100
FINAL EXPLANATIONS.
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU PUT ALL THE PIECES

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.270
TOGETHER--MULTIPLE CRASH SITES,
INCREDIBLE WITNESSES THAT CAN

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.200
FINALLY COME OUT AND TELL THE
TRUTH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS--

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.270
YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S JUST
TOO BIG TO BE A SIMPLE COVER-UP

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.030
OF A MILITARY ACCIDENT.
&gt;&gt; AND THE MOGUL EXPLANATION

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.120
ALSO CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR
EARL FULFORD'S SIGHTING

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.170
DAYS BEFORE THE CRASHES
EVEN OCCUR.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:52.500
&gt;&gt; EVEN BEFORE THE UFOs HIT THE
GROUND, THEY WERE THERE IN THE

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:59.103
AIR. AND FOR ME, THAT EXPLAINS
THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG ALL THESE

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:04.117
VARIOUS CRASH SITES THAT THERE
WAS MORE THAN ONE CRAFT.

00:44:04.117 --> 00:44:10.000
&gt;&gt; 61 YEARS AFTER THE INCIDENT
AT ROSWELL, NEW EVIDENCE

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.100
CONTINUES TO EMERGE. IS THIS
A DIFFERENT MILITARY PROGRAM

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:20.330
STILL CLASSIFIED TODAY...
OR IS THE GOVERNMENT STILL NOT

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:26.000
TELLING US THE TRUTH ABOUT
UFO CRASHES IN NEW MEXICO?
