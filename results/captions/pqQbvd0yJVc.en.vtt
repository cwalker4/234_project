00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.019
Long before the rise of Darth Sidious and
Vader, in the age of the Old Republic, a human

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.210
was born in the Outer Rim of the galaxy.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.480
A male child with force sensitivity, discovered
at an early age and accepted into the Jedi

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
Order.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.630
This young man would grow into a powerful
Jedi Knight, trained by a number of wise Masters

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.000
within the order providing a bounty of information
to feed his insatiable hunger for knowledge,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.440
Taught by so many varied and experienced mentors
like

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.670
Masters Kreia, Master Zhar Lestin, Master
Dorak and Arren Kae

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
He learned about Force Bonds and many other
uncommon subejects.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.220
As a Padawan, he befriended another powerful
force user named Alek, rising to the rank

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.080
of Jedi Knight together, though all considered
Alek the lesser of the two.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.970
The young Jedi also gained popularity through
his natural charisma and charm, skills which

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.110
became of great use to him throughout his
future endeavors.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.740
In the year 3964 Before the Battle of Yavin,
The Mandalorian Neo Crusaders attacked the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
Outer Rim world of Vanquo, the first major
attack against a Republic protected world,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.360
though they had been conquering non republic
worlds for over a decade.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.010
This would begin a series of invasions bringing
the Mandalorian wars directly into Republic

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.010
territories.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.210
And while the government responded by sending
the galactic fleet to counter Mandalorean

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.190
Advances, the Jedi did not involve themselves,
with the council believing they should not

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.550
engage the war.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.210
As a young Jedi Knight, the former apprentice
of Master Kreia stood in opposition to the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.190
Council, believing it was their moral duty
to help those now suffering at the hands of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.310
the Mandaloreans.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.880
The passion with which he spoke on the issue
started to make him a media celebrity, earning

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.740
him the nickname Crusader, described as a
lone Jedi defying the stubborn council, and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.770
working to save the suffering masses.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.979
His friend Alek was the first to join in his
efforts, but they were soon joined by other

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.369
jedi, persuaded by the Crusader’s arguments.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.450
No longer willing to plead for the council’s
authority, The Crusader and his followers

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.299
went on a scouting mission to assess the situation.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.280
Alek and the others were then left on the
planet Suurja, while the Crusader investigate

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.299
Onderon and its moon Dxun.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.640
Yet during their separation, Mandalorians
captured those on Suurja, bringing them to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.060
the planet Flashpoint, where the scientist
Demagol experimented on jedi.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.440
The Crusader, discovering their capture, returned
to the Council to inform them of all he had

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.670
learned and was given authority to rescue
his followers.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.510
But it proved unnecessary, as a former Jedi
Padawan named Zayne Carrick was able to free

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.500
them, while he rescuing a friend who had also
been captured and brought to the facility.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.720
When the Crusader was reunited with his followers,
they returned to the Core, and found that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.349
they were more popular than ever.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.819
The Revanchist* movement as it was known,
had grown to see the Crusader, as their courageous

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.400
and intractable leader.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.410
Embracing the role, he took on the name of
Revanchist and continued to fight for the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.550
council to authorize their participation in
the war.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.200
Helping his arguments, was the story of the
planet Cathar, once a thriving alien world,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.860
which the Revanchist argued had been attacked
by the Mandaloreans a decade earlier, explaining

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.630
why everyone on the planet had suddenly vanished.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.590
In addition there was the Battle of Serroco,
where Mandalore the Ultamite, leader of the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.870
Neo Crusaders, unleashed nuclear weapons against
his enemies, wiping out the world’s cities

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.890
and population.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.330
Yet the Council still refused to enter the
war, even issuing arrest warrants for the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.819
Revanchist and his followers.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.230
Alek, now going by the name Malak to avoid
arrest, risked capture by returning to Coruscant

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.610
and the Jedi Council, testifying on the behalf
of his friend Zayne Carrick, who had rescued

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.820
him from Flashpoint, and who was falsely accused
of crimes against the Jedi.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.750
When his testimony was concluded, he was not
arrested, but instead allowed to leave with

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.610
a final message of warning to the Revanchist,
demanding that he cease his unsanctioned activities

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.209
and return to the Core.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.010
Malak then travelled to Cathar were his people
continued to investigate the disappearance

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.410
of their population only to discover that
he had been followed by a party of Jedi who

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.710
descended onto Cathar and Chastised the rebels,
demanding their disbandment.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.459
Yet as they argued, the Revanchist found a
mandalorian mask, hidden under the sand, and

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.650
as he picked it up, all of the Jedi present
had a shared vision of the past, seeing the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.269
Cathar population hearded towards the sea
by attacking Mandaloreans under Cassus Fett.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.930
When a lone female Mandalorean attempted to
plead for their lives, Cassus told her they

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.270
had to die, for dishonoring the Mandalorians
decades earlier during the Great Sith War.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.400
And so the army opened fire, killing all of
the Cathar who lined the beach as well as

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.380
the female Mandalorean, who stood with them
in the end.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.630
When the Vision ended, the Revanchist realized
this was the courageous woman’s mask, and

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.889
so put it on, taking on the name of Revan
and vowing to wear the mask until all Mandalorians

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.370
were brought to justice for their crimes.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.560
Having witnessed the atrocity themselves,
the Jedi who had come on the Council’s behalf

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.729
were no longer able to adequately defend their
position of non intervention, and while the

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.800
council still refused to enter the war completely,
they were persuaded by Revan into a compromise,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.840
which deputized a small Mercy Corps as part
of the Republic military, allowing for individual

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.990
Jedi to join the war effort without need for
the council to authorize the entire Jedi Order’s

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.990
involvement.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.690
This Mercy Corps fell under the command of
Revan himself, who led them to a number of

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.840
early victories, proving an excellent strategist
and military mind.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.530
After their participation in the Battle of
Duro in 3962 BBY, Revan and Malak were praised

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.340
for their efforts, with Revan promoted to
Supreme Commander, and given control of 1/3rd

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.560
of Republic forces.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.940
Yet as the war dragged on, both Revan and
Malack became more detached from the horrors

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.810
and atrocities being commited.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.150
And started making cold, calculating decisions,
often matching the brutal tactics of the Mandaloreans,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.020
with a policy of achieving victory at all
costs.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.860
During the course of the war, Revan and Malak
discovered an ancient Rakata* ruin on Dantooine,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.060
passing a series of tests by droid guarding
to be allowed access to the inner chamber.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.060
Malak, sensing that this was a turning point
for them, warned Revan that the Council may

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.150
banish them for entering, but he continued
on and so malak followed.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.540
Within the ruins they found a star map, revealing
part of the location to a space station called

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.780
the Star Forge.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.580
Intrigued, Revan investigated further, discovering
another star map on the planet of Kashyyk

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.940
and even visiting the Sith homeworld of Korriban
seeking more information.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.770
Eventually he discovered the Trayus Academy,
an ancient sith academy within the planet

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.759
of Malachor V, all the while teaching his
new found knowledge to his friend Malak, slowly

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.979
turning both to the dark side.

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.930
Revan and Malak, now under the influence of
the Dark Side, continued to fight for the

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.979
Republic against the Mandaloreans, freeing
captives in the Taris Undercity, and battling

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.350
Cassus Fett in Jaga’s Cluster.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.300
No longer concerned with Republic casualities,
Revan ordered his forces under Jedi Knight

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.860
General Meetra Surik, to attack Onderon and
Dxun, using a astrategy that left 10 republic

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.139
soldiers killed for every mandalorian.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.770
Yet Revan’s ruthless cunning took a toll
on his hated enemies, leading to a campaign

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.270
on Althir III which destroyed a large part
of the Mandalorian army.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:05.160
By 3960 BBY Revan had commissioned the creation
a superweapon called the Mass Shadow Generator,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.180
built by Zabrak engineer named Bao Dur.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.630
Determined to end the Mandalorian threat once
and for all, he laid a trap for them at Malachor

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.150
V, sending heavy republic forces to lure them
into a final confrontation.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.910
When Revan arrived at the battle, Mandalore
the Ultamite challenged him to single combat,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.670
and so they duelled aboard the Mandalore’s
ship where Revan struck him down.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.400
Yet as the Mandalore lay dying, he removed
his mask, saying that he had been manipulated

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.970
into starting this war by a red skinned Sith,
and suggesting Revan travel to the planet

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.290
Rekkiad to confirm the story.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.820
After his death, Revan took the Mandalore’s
mask as a war prize, and understood he must

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.550
learn the truth behind the man’s final words.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:49.889
As the battle raged on, General Meetra Surik
obeyed orders and activated the Mass Shadow

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.630
Generator, creating an enormous gravitational
force, pulling nearly all surrounding ships,

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.860
directly onto Malachor’s surface, destroying
the planet and its population.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.240
Though it came at a heavy cost to the Republic,
the Mandalorean Neo Crusaders were crushed

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.160
into defeat, with the last survivors quickly
offering their unconditional surrender.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.910
Conveniently, many of the Jedi and Republic
officers who died at malachor V were noted

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.680
critics of Revan’s policies who were now
unable to continue their opposition.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.919
The Mandaloreans were stripped of their weapons
and armor, and with their people scattered

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:26.569
and culture devastated, many turned to bounty
hunting and mercenary work.

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:31.160
After the war, Revan continued down his dark
path, completing construction of an assassin

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.229
droid designated HK 47, using it to stealthily
eliminate opponents rather than confront them

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.229
openly.

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:42.430
And while the former Supreme Commander quickly
moved on from the tragedy at Malachor V, back

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.829
on Coruscant the Jedi Council was outraged,
believing his actions monstrous and demanding

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:52.829
that Revan, Malak and Meetra Surik return
to face punishment for their crimes.

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:57.670
Meetra, whose Force powers were suppressed
after the trauma of sensing so many lost lives

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:03.379
on Malachor, was the only one of the three
to obey the council and return to face judgement,

00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:05.610
resulting in her exile from the Order.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.329
Revan and Malak meanwhile, ignored the council
and travelled to Rekkiad, investigating the

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:15.910
deceased Mandalores claims, finding the tomb
Sith Lord Dramath the Second and a datacron

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.089
revealing the location of the planet Nathema
where they might continue their search for

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:21.089
the truth.

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:25.589
But before leaving Rekkiad, Revan hid the
Mask of Mandalore, within the tomb of the

00:09:25.589 --> 00:09:27.339
deceased Sith Lord.

00:09:27.339 --> 00:09:32.079
Continuing their investigation, they discovered
Nathema was completely barren of the force,

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:37.959
learning about a powerful Sith Lord who lived
during the Great Hyperspace war of 5000BBY,

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:42.920
surviving the Jedi and Republic victory, and
gathering remaining sith Lords upon Nathema

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.339
to conduct a powerful dark side ritual.

00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:49.769
But what Sith Lord Vitiate failed to mention,
was that the ritual would destroy all life

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:53.709
on the planet, using their force energy to
make himself immortal.

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:58.279
Vitiate then led the last of his followers
to the forgotten world of Drummond Kaas and

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:03.970
re-established the Sith Empire in this isolated
region, with himself as Emperor.* Revan and

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.550
malak soon came to realize that it was this
long forgotten Sith Emperor who had been manipulating

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.950
the galaxy from the shadows, using Mandalore
the Ultamite to wage war against the Republic,

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.220
as a test of the ruling government’s strength,
and as a prelude to invasion.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.720
They then decided to assassinate Vitiate themselves,
rather than warn the republic of his plans,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.439
infiltrating the palace with the help of a
guard named Yarri, only to discover it was

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:31.910
a trap, with the Emperor using his powers
to enter their minds and turn them to his

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.060
cause.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.869
Initiating them into the Sith Order, they
were hence forth known as Darth Revan and

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:41.079
Darth Malak, sent back to Conquer the Republic
in the name of the Emperor.

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:45.339
To aid them in their mission, they were told
to make use of the Star Forge, an automated

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:50.379
shipyard, providing them with an unending
supply of ships, droids and many other machines

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:51.379
of war.

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:55.259
As Revan prepared for his invasion of the
Republic, he recorded a holocron, filling

00:10:55.259 --> 00:11:00.350
it with his personal thoughts on the darkside
and the relationship between master and apprentice.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:05.139
This device was left on the planet Lehon and
was discovered thousands of years later by

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:10.170
Darth Bane, proving crucial in his development
of the Rule of Two philosophy which fundamentally

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.360
transformed the Sith Order.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.040
Once in possession of the Star Forge, Revan
and Malak broke free of the Emperor’s control,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.319
proclaiming themselves leaders of a new Sith
Empire, with Revan as Master and Malak as

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:23.319
apprentice.

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:27.509
They then re-established a Sith Academy upon
Korriban, training a new generation of Sith

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:29.920
Lords to serve under their command.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.259
With most remembering Revan and malak as Jedi
heroes who defeated the mandaloreans, and

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:39.220
few seeing a difference between the Jedi and
Sith order, the approaching conflict came

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.860
to be known as the Jedi Civil War, seeing
the first battle fought at Foerost in 3958

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.420
BBY, when the new Sith Empire attacked an
important Republic shipyard, capturing a large

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.629
portion of their fleet.

00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:56.630
Yet Revan’s strategy called for more than
direct military engagement, ordering the assassination

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.879
of many prominent Republic figures, in order
to cripple their leadership while keeping

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:05.940
the military and political structure of government
intact so he might easily assume power when

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.540
victory was complete.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.589
Outraged by Revan’s treachery, the Echani
General Yusanis challenged him to single combat,

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:15.999
but was ultimately defeated and killed by
the Dark Lord.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:18.299
Revan then continued with his grand plan.

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:22.910
focusing heavily on capturing Jedi, in order
to torture and turn them to the dark side.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.329
In addition the he allied with the Czerka
corporation, offering them an exclusive contract

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:28.759
with the Sith Empire.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:32.990
And while the invasion of the Republic was
proceeding well, a rift began to develop between

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.239
the more strategic Revan and his apprentice
Malak who valued brute strength.

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:41.720
Their disagreement over how to fight the war,
led Malak to see his master’s actions as

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.939
signs of weakness.

00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:48.350
This insult led to a duel between them, wherein
Revan struck Malak down, removing the man’s

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.360
jaw with a strike of his lightsaber.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.889
The Sith apprentice survived, but was forced
to wear a prosthesis for the rest of his life.

00:12:54.889 --> 00:13:00.350
And while Revan had momentarily regained control,
his dream of ruling a united Sith empire soon

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.319
came to an end, when a republic trap in the
outer rim, led to a Jedi invasion of his ship,

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:08.040
soon becoming surrounded by his light side
enemies.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.389
Revan, undettered, was prepared to fight them
all, but his apprentice malak sensing the

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:17.029
situation, and eager to become the new Dark
Lord of the Sith, betrayed his master, launching

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.399
a devastating attack.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:23.249
As the ship came under fire, the Jedi Bastilla
Shan used the chaos of the moment to knock

00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:27.670
Revan unconscious, fleeing from the ship together
and using her abilities to create a force

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.089
bond between them.

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:33.540
Revan was then taken to Dantooine, where the
Jedi Council healed his wounds, but also performed

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.809
a ritual to wipe his mind of all memories,
giving him a new identity as a Republic Soldier,

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:43.019
so his skills might serve to defeat the Sith
Empire he once ruled.

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:48.489
As a republic soldier, the man formerly known
as revan was assigned to the ship Endar Spire,

00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:51.560
placed under the command of Jedi Padawan Bastila
Shan.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.369
But it was not long before the ship came under
attack by the new Dark Lord of the sith Darth

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:57.369
Malak.

00:13:57.369 --> 00:14:02.129
As the ship was boarded, most made their way
to escape pods, but Revan and his bunkmate

00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:07.679
Trask Ulgo stayed behind, searching for their
commander to ensure her safety, only to discover

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:09.410
she had already left the ship.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:14.230
They then encountered Darth Bandon, the new
sith apprentice of Dark Lord Malak, and Trask

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.829
so selflessly sacrificed himself, attacking
Bandon and sealing the door behind him, in

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:21.569
the hopes of buying Revan time to escape.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:25.949
Revan was then contacted by Captain Carth
Onasi, informing him that they were the last

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:31.449
2 on board, then escaping together, only to
crash land on the nearby planet of Taris.

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:35.279
Taking refuge in the South Apartment of the
Upper city, they embarked on a mission to

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.169
find Bastila Shan and return to the service
of the republic.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:43.481
During their time on the planet, they befriended
a Twilek woman named Mission Zao, helping

00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:48.720
her rescue Zaalbar, her wookie companion,
who was so grateful he swore a lifedebt, joining

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.410
Revan in his travels, with Zao following close
behind.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:58.009
They finally found Bastila Shan held in a
cage unconscious by a criminal named Brejik

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:02.799
of the Black Vulkars, who held her as a prize
to be awarded to the winner of swoop bike

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:04.779
race, which revan entered and won.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:10.350
Yet the plan ultimately failed and was about
to turn violent when Shan awoke and emerged

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.059
from the cage, attacking her captors.

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:17.680
Revan and Shan fought side by side and were
victorious, reuniting with Carth Onasi and

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.870
the others to figure out a way off the planet.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.749
And so they made a deal with a mandalorian
named Canderous Ordo to steal the ship Ebon

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:26.509
Hawk so they might escape.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:32.550
Revan then purchased a T3-M4 droid to help
in the mission, and the group proved successful,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.499
taking the ship off planet and into hyperspace.

00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:39.859
Bastila then ordered that they travel to Dantooine,
where Revan had a private meeting with the

00:15:39.859 --> 00:15:44.339
Jedi Council, who continued to hold back the
secret of his origins, but could not deny

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:46.999
his ever increasing force capabilities.

00:15:46.999 --> 00:15:51.179
They also told him the strange dreams and
shared visions he’d been having had created

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:56.449
a force bond with Bastilla Shan, who, though
a Padawan herself, was tasked with observing

00:15:56.449 --> 00:16:00.269
his Jedi training, to ensure he did not return
to the dark side.

00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:04.869
After several weeks, the Padawans were sent
to investigate nearby ruins, where a vision

00:16:04.869 --> 00:16:07.639
revealed Revan once visited with Malak.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:11.709
Passing the required tests, they gained access
to the inner chamber and found a part of a

00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:16.249
star map, which mentioned several other planets
where the rest of the map could be found.

00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:20.519
This was how Revan and Malak discovered the
Star Forge, which allowed them to build their

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.169
Sith Empire.

00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:26.319
Returning to the council, they were then assigned
to locating the rest of the map fragments,

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.579
so they might find Malak and destroy his Empire.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:34.279
Before leaving Dantooine, they were joined
by Jedi Knight Juhani who joined their crew.

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:38.660
Eager to serve Revan after he selflessly helped
her during his time on the planet.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:44.359
They then travelled to Tatooine, where Revan
bought a droid designated HK 47 to join his

00:16:44.359 --> 00:16:49.060
crew as they recovered the next piece of the
star map.* Yet after its retrieval they were

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:54.309
confronted by the bounty hunter Calo Nord,
who was hired by Malak to find Revan and his

00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:55.309
people.

00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:57.799
With the Dark Lord now aware of Revan’s
survival.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:02.920
The Jedi Padawan and his crew then defeated
the Bounty Hunter, leaving Tatooine and travelling

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.140
to the wookie planet of Kashyyyk.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.270
There Revan met a grey jedi named Jolee Bindo,
who recognized the former sith lord, but did

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.770
not reveal what he knew.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.850
Bindo then joined Revan’s crew and helped
him find the Star Map on the planet.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:21.880
Moving on to the planet of Manaan, the Jedi
Padawan came to participate in a murder trial,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.500
representing an old friend of Bindo named
Sunry, attempting to help his defense.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.230
Afterwhich they recovered the next star map
fragment only to be attacked by Darth Banon

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.480
and his minions.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.610
Revan engaged the Sith apprentice and struck
him down, then leaving the planet, headed

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.769
for Korriban to find the final piece of the
Star Map.

00:17:39.769 --> 00:17:44.740
Yet as they made their way to the sith homeworld,
the Ebon Hawk was attacked and captured by

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.460
the Imperial ship Leviathan, led by Saul Karath,
Carth onasi’s former republic commander,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.380
now serving the Sith Empire.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.620
And while Revan was tortured for information,
he never broke, and was eventually rescued

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.950
along with the rest of his crew by one of
his companions who had stayed behind, and

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.950
hid from Imperial forces waiting for the right
time to come to their aid.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.909
And so Revan, Shan and Onasi confronted Karath
on the bridge of his ship, killing the man

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:11.130
and his guards.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.750
But as he lay dying he whispered a secret
to Carth Onasi, informing him of Revan’s

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.750
true identity.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:21.230
Though stunned, Onasi did not reveal what
he learned and so they continued their escape

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:26.620
until intercepted by Darth malak who had just
arrived, confronting his former Sith Master

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.919
and at last revealing the truth behind Revan’s
identity.

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:34.539
They then engaged in a duel, where Revan proved
a stronger warrior, but Malak, was able to

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:39.590
use his force powers to overcome Revan’s
superior fighting skills, and nearly killed

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:44.059
him, but was stopped by Bastila Shan, who
took over the battle, sacrificing her self

00:18:44.059 --> 00:18:45.320
so he might escape.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.750
And while he desperately wanted to save her,
he and Onasi barely managed to escape with

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.550
their own live, returning to the Ebon Hawk
and informing them of all that occurred.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.760
To Revan’s surprise, they all were able
to accept the truth of his past, realizing

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.280
he was not the same man anymore.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.179
Continuing on to Korriban, Revan and Bindo
posed as sith recruits, in order to enter

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:09.590
the Academy and gain access to restricted
areas.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.299
Revan then located the final star map fragment
within the tomb of an ancient dark lord, and

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:18.799
had to fight his way to the Ebon Hawk, after
it was discovered he was not a sith.

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:23.300
With the Star Map now complete, the Ebon Hawk
followed it to the Unknown regions, where

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.850
they found the Star Forge surrounded by the
Sith Fleet, sending the coordinates to the

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:29.850
Republic.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.909
But the ship was soon spotted and forced to
land on the nearby planet of Lehon where Revan

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:39.000
came to be confronted by Bastila Shan, his
former Jedi Master, now the Sith apprentice

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.300
of Darth Malak.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.409
Revan learned that she’d been defeated by
Malak during their duel, then captured and

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:47.290
tortured until she fell to the dark side.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.570
Bastila engaged Revan but proved unable to
defeat him, fleeing the confrontation.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:56.390
The former dark lord then returned to Ebon
Hawk and participated in a coordinated attack

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.880
with Republic forces, boarding the Star Forge
directly, where Revan once again engaged Bastila

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.159
Shan, defeating her 3 times, until she begged
him to end her suffering.

00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:11.440
But he refused to kill her, instead convincing
her to return to the light side, and expressing

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.559
his feeling of love for her, which she returned.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:19.559
Revan then moved on to confront Darth Malak,
at last defeating his former apprentice* and

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.779
striking him down.

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:25.279
With the war all but over, Revan and his crew
were invited to Lehon where they were greeted

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:26.850
as heroes.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.669
For his efforts, Revan received the Cross
of Glory, known to be the highest possible

00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:32.799
honor within the republic.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:37.590
After the destruction of the Star Forge and
defeat of Darth Malak, the remnants of the

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.210
Sith Empire turned against each other, allowing
for the Republic to defeat and scatter the

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.840
last of their forces.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.610
With the war over, Revan and Bastila Shan
both turned down offers to return to their

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:54.330
training within the Jedi Order, instead getting
married and retiring from public life, taking

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:59.899
t3m4 and HK47 to live with them in an apartment
on Coruscant.

00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:03.610
Revan felt that his knowledge of the force
and the relationship between the dark and

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.350
light side gave him a unique perspective far
beyond that of a Jedi padawan.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:13.149
He also came to realize that emotions and
relationships could prove a source a strength,

00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:17.590
like when his wife Bastila was pulled back
from the darkside through their love for each

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.590
other.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.350
And so Revan took this new understanding of
the force to the Jedi Council, in the hopes

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.139
of teaching them what he’d learned.

00:21:24.139 --> 00:21:28.799
But they outright rejected his ideas, with
some even threatening to banish Revan from

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.200
the Order entirely.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.919
In the end they feared the public outcry over
banishing a republic hero, and so allowed

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:39.310
Revan and Bastila to remain members of the
Jedi order on the condition that they keep

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.140
their beliefs and marriage private, making
no efforts to spread their teachings.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.799
Revan did not want to fight with the council
and so agreed to their terms.

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:52.080
Although Revan was happy in his new life,
he became haunted with nightmares of a planet

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.740
covered by storms.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.070
Revan still had not recovered all the memories
he’d lost after the ritual performed by

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.070
the Jedi Council, but he came to believe these
dreams were related to his past and the journey

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.940
he’d taken with Malak into the uncharted
areas of the galaxy after the Mandalorian

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.940
Wars.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.820
He then contacted his old friend Canderous
Ordo and met with him to discuss the dreams

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.380
and find out any information he could about
Mandalore the Ultamite and his reasons for

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.139
invading the Republic.

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:24.850
Revan believed that it might in some way be
connected to the war waged by Revan and Malak

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.620
when they returned to the known galaxy as
sith Lords.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.779
After their meeting Revan wished to contact
his old friend Meetra Surik travelling to

00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:35.230
the Jedi Archives in search of information.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:40.271
There he was confronted by Jedi Master Atris,
who informed him of Meetra’s fate, having

00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:45.389
cut herself off from the Force after the battle
of Malachor V and her exile from the Order

00:22:45.389 --> 00:22:47.850
when she returned to face judgement.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.220
Revan was deeply saddened by what he learned
and left the temple, unsure if he’d ever

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.889
see his old friend again.

00:22:53.889 --> 00:22:58.840
Less than a month later, Canderous contacted
Revan and revealed that the Mandalorian Clans

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.539
were gathering upon the planet of Rekkiad,
searching for the Mask of their fallen leader

00:23:03.539 --> 00:23:08.830
Mandalore the Ultamite, so that a new ruler
might take his place and unify their people.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:14.020
Revan understanding the threat a united Mandalorian
army might pose, made plans with Canderous

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.090
to travel to Rekkiad and join in the search.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.830
Revan hoped that that Bastila would join them
on the mission but when he returned home he

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.000
discovered she was pregnant, and soon they
were arguing about Revan wanting to leave

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.160
them to go on this dangerous mission.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.240
In the end, he convinced Bastila that his
visions were related to sense a larger threat

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.970
looming and it was his duty to investigate
and stop it if he can, so that their child

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.289
might live a long life of peace.

00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:43.370
After spending one last night with his wife,
Revan along with t3m4 joined Canderous and

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:48.570
boarded the Ebon Hawk, journeying to Rekkiad
where the Mandalorian reunited with his people

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.879
in Clan Ordo.

00:23:49.879 --> 00:23:54.820
In order to hide his identity, Revan was introduced
to them as a mercenary named Avner who’d

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.860
come to help them find the mask.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.769
Revan then met a proud and ferocious woman
named Veela Ordo, leader of the clan and wife

00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:03.140
of Canderous.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.749
After experiencing more dreams and memories
of his past, Revan realized Clan Ordo was

00:24:07.749 --> 00:24:12.559
searching in the wrong area of the planet,
and so Canderous convinced them to move, engaging

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:15.879
in battle with another clan to claim the new
area.

00:24:15.879 --> 00:24:19.760
Revan then led a group of them to find the
tomb of the ancient sith lord Dramath the

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.200
Second, and there recovered the mask of mandalore.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.809
Unfortunately Veela then turned against Revan,
claiming she knew his true identity, and the

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:29.370
Mandalorians attack.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.659
Canderous was forced to choose between his
wife and friend, ultimately shooting Veela

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:34.659
through the chest.

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:38.789
Canderous then stood silently near the bodies
for a time, before he and Revan gave them

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:40.100
a proper burial.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.690
Having also discovered a datacron in the tomb
of the sith lord, Revan decided he must next

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.030
travel to the planet Nathema to learn more
about his own past.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.580
And rather then ask Canderous to join him,
he instead told the Mandalorian to claim the

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.200
mask of Mandalore for himself, so that he
might unify the clans and prepare them to

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.720
defend the republic from whatever outside
threat was approaching.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.779
In this way they might regain the honor lost
from their war of aggression.

00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:09.429
Canderous agreed and took up the mask, becoming
mandalore the Preserver and the two went their

00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:13.440
separate ways, each determined to see their
task completed.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.059
Revan and t3m4 then took the Ebon Hawk to
Nathema, where he became overwhelmed by visions

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.059
and flashbacks.

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:25.860
Unfortunately Darth Nyriss and Lord Scourge
of the Drumond Kass based Sith Empire were

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.789
already present in the area when he arrived.

00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:32.399
Attacking the Ebon Hawk and forcing it to
crash land on the planet.

00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:37.220
Recovering his injured body, Nyriss recognized
Revan as one of the men captured by the Emperor

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.350
years earlier.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.820
And came to suspect he’d been twisted to
the Emperor’s will, then sent back to the

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.820
republic on a mission.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.929
Nyriss was member of sith faction planning
to overthrow their leader, and was therefore

00:25:47.929 --> 00:25:52.899
intrigued by the possibility Revan had somehow
overcome the Emperor’s influence, locking

00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:58.230
him away on Dromund Kass, to be interrogated
and tortured by Scourge for information.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.889
The Dark Lord quickly realized Revan honestly
did not remember much of his own past and

00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:07.930
so Nyriss lost interest over time, but Scourge
did not, fascinated by the human’s power

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.549
and experiences.

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:14.049
As a result the two often spoke, exchanging
their insights into the force.

00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:18.450
During his incarceration, Revan lied to Scourge,
telling him he’d seen a vision of the future

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.380
where he would be released from prison.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.950
And though Scourge was skeptical he knew Revan
had unique and impressive powers, and so did

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.760
not discount the possibility.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.720
Revan was kept drugged at all times to suppress
his use of the force, but in time began to

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.539
develop an immunity, summoning small amounts
of force energy to attempt contacting his

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:37.539
wife.

00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:42.090
But instead he was granted a vision of his
old friend Meetra Surik, realizing she would

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.240
be the one coming to his rescue.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.340
For 3 years, Revan was imprisoned on Drumond
Kass, during which time his loyal droid t3m4

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:56.639
managed to repair the ebon hawk and fly it
off Nathema and into galactic space where

00:26:56.639 --> 00:26:58.480
it was found by Meetra Surik.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.120
The former Jedi, undergoing her own journey
of redemption and self-acceptance, had been

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.460
slowly learning to use the force again while
working with a number of old allies and friends

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.539
of Revan to defeat a new threat to facing
the galaxy.

00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:15.559
The last remnant of the Sith Empire under
Revan and Malak had been united under Darth

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:21.090
Traya, Sion and Nihilus, but were ultamitely
defeated by Meetra and her allies.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:26.440
She then left republic space determined to
find Revan and help him in any way possible.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:32.139
Finding t3m4, the droid played a video for
Surik, showing her the red skinned sith who’d

00:27:32.139 --> 00:27:33.730
taken Revan from Nathema.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.759
And so she followed his trail to Dromund Kass
and made inquiries, alerting Scrouge who met

00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:40.990
her with and a party of armed soldiers.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:45.019
When he learned she was a jedi, he came to
realize that Revan’s vision of rescue was

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:49.990
coming true and so merely watched as Meetrak
killed the soldiers, then offering to ally

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.090
together.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.710
Meetra was skeptical, but eventually agreed
and so Scourge went to the Emperor, revealing

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.480
that Nyriss was part of a plot against him
along with other members of the Dark council.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.539
This led the emperor to send his forces to
raid the fortress where Revan was being held,

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:09.950
distracting the guard and allowing for Meetra
and Scourge to make their way to the prison

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:10.950
cell.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.590
There they found Revan and two soldiers of
Nyriss, who’d been convinced by the former

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.169
Sith Lord to switch sides.

00:28:16.169 --> 00:28:20.749
Scourge gave Revan the antidote to remove
the effects of the mind numbing drugs supressing

00:28:20.749 --> 00:28:25.990
his powers while Meetra, overjoyed at seeing
her old mentor once more, presented his mask.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:30.779
But when Revan took it, all of the memories,
so long surpressed in his mind came rushing

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:34.710
back, incapacitating him and causing him to
collapse on the ground.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.830
Unfortunately Nyriss then arrived, murdering
the 2 soldiers, and using her powerful darkside

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.580
abilities to defeat Scourge and Meetra.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.550
But just as she prepared to finish them off,
taunting them with her power, Revan rose from

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:52.179
the ground wearing his mask and declared “I
am Revan reborn.

00:28:52.179 --> 00:28:53.909
And before me you are nothing.”

00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:58.940
Nyriss then launched a massive burst of purple
lightening towards them, which Revan absorbed

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:04.649
and reversed consuming her in lightning storm
until all that remained was a pile of ash.

00:29:04.649 --> 00:29:10.200
Retreating back to a safe location, Scourge,
Meetra, Revan and T3m4 planned to continue

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.419
in their attempts to assassinate the Emperor.

00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:17.769
They decided to pose as associates of Scourge,
who would use his position to bully the guards

00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:20.080
into allowing him an audience with the emperor.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.440
And once the doors were open they would attack.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.049
However when they put the plan into motion,
Revan was recognized by the Guard Yarri who’d

00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:29.990
been part of the plot to capture him three
years earlier.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.570
And so Meetra and Scourge were forced to stay
behind battling the guards outside the main

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.019
chamber, while Revan ran in determined to
kill the Emperor.

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:42.580
The former Jedi and Sith Lord made a valiant
effort, able to use his knowledge of the light

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.779
and dark side to pose a serious threat, even
surprising the emperor with his abilities.

00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:52.789
But the Sith once known as Vitiate was more
powerful than anyone Revan had ever faced,

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:56.619
and overcame him with a powerful darkside
lightening attack, that might have killed

00:29:56.619 --> 00:30:02.570
him, if not for T3M4 who charged against the
Emperor, attacking him with a flamethrower.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:07.450
And while he succeeded in distracting the
enemy and saving his master, Vitiate immediately

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.129
destroyed the droid.

00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:13.370
Scourge and Meetra, having finished with the
others then rushed to Revan’s side, and

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.899
the three prepared to charge against the Emperor.

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:20.539
But then suddenly Scourge was struck by a
force vision, and all became clear.

00:30:20.539 --> 00:30:23.129
Revan was not the one who would destroy the
Emperor.

00:30:23.129 --> 00:30:27.380
That task was to be completed by another,
and Scourge must be alive to help in that

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.610
future effort.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:33.440
And so as Meetra and Revan stepped forward,
Scourge stepped to the side, stabbing Meetra

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.860
through the heart, killing her instantly.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.480
Revan, distracted and distraught by her death
was then left vulnerable to the Emperor who

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.249
crippled him with an attack.

00:30:42.249 --> 00:30:46.799
After the battle, his defeated but still living
body was taken to a specially constructed

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:51.669
prison within Maelstrom Station, kept alive
by machines and sith Alchemy.

00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:56.549
Scourge meanwhile, claimed he was only pretending
to be with jedi, using that position to lure

00:30:56.549 --> 00:31:01.080
them to the Emperor, who he believed was the
only one powerful enough to defeat Revan.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.850
Vitiate was satisfied with this response,
and rewarded Scourge by making him the Emperor’s

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.769
Wrath, in charge of executing the enemies
of the Emperor.

00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:13.489
He was also granted Immortality through a
dark side ritual, which gave him eternal life

00:31:13.489 --> 00:31:17.299
at a cost of keeping his body in constant
and unending pain.

00:31:17.299 --> 00:31:21.679
However Scourge would eventually grow numb
to the agony, as well as emotions becoming

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:25.120
singularly focused to act as weapon of the
Emperor.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.730
For 300 years, Revan was held as a prisoner,
tortured savagely and used as a source of

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:35.539
force energy for the emperor, even linking
minds to learn all he could about the Republic

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:37.019
and their defenses.

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:41.230
During the years of torment, Revan was given
comfort and support by the force ghost of

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.389
Meetra Surik, who’d stayed with Revan after
her death.

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:48.570
With her help and through the power of his
will, Revan was able to reverse the mental

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:53.580
connection, allowing him to influence the
Emperor in small ways, but enough to prevent

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.970
him from launching a war against the Republic
for centuries.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:02.600
In this way, Revan could ensure his wife and
son lived out their lives in peace.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.779
During the 300 hundred years of Revan’s
imprisonment, his legend remained strong throughout

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:12.409
the galaxy, with a secret society dedicated
using his teachings to change the Empire forming

00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:13.690
on Drumond Kass.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:18.970
The Emperor meanwhile, discovered a darkside
ritual known as essence transfer, and abandoned

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:24.279
his physical form in favor of moving his consciousness
through various host bodies, corrupting them

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:27.779
with his dark side powers and then discarding
one for another.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:31.860
The body which he chose to inhabit became
known as the Emperor’s Voice.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:37.489
Yet even with all his power Vitiate was unsatisfied
with life as a Sith Emperor, seeing past the

00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:42.960
dogma and doctrine to understand the force
was more than what the Sith or even Jedi believed.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.620
He then heard about a force known as the Eternal
Fleet, an armada of automated ships which

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.730
wreaked havoc in Wild Space.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.870
Leaving a part of himself behind to control
the Emperor’s Voice, his consciousness went

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:58.369
in search of the Eternal fleet, eventually
travelling into the unknown regions, and finding

00:32:58.369 --> 00:33:00.009
the planet of Zakuul.

00:33:00.009 --> 00:33:04.779
Here the Emperor took over the body of a warrior
named Valkorion, and used him to create a

00:33:04.779 --> 00:33:08.869
new Empire, built without the constraints
of jedi and sith philosophies.

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:14.500
An Eternal Empire, ruled by an immortal Emperor,
who trained the Knights of zakkul, a new class

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.570
of Force wielding warriors armed with lighsaber
pikes, and trained to see the force as a tool

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.519
for justice and nothing more, used only to
enforce the law.

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:28.379
The being once known as Vitiate ruled both
the Sith Empire under the Emperor’s Voice

00:33:28.379 --> 00:33:33.320
and the Eternal Empire under Valkorion at
the same time, splitting his attention between

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.320
them.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.529
For three centuries the galaxy was afforded
peace through Revan’s suffering, but the

00:33:38.529 --> 00:33:45.340
Emperor eventually went through with his original
plans, invading the republic in 3681 BBY,

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.820
initiating the Great Galactic War.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.159
To his disappointment the Sith Empire was
unable to achieve a quick victory, and so

00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:56.360
the war dragged on for 28 years, until Revan’s
influence at last convinced the Emperor to

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.950
end hostilities.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:04.820
And so in 3653 BBY, Sith representatives met
with republic officials on Alderaan to discuss

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:10.520
terms, while imperial forces simultaneously
invaded and sacked Coruscant, allowing for

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.100
the delegation on Alderaan to demand the surrender
of the Republic.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.780
And so they signed the treaty of Coruscant
declaring the Empire victorious.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.179
Though the war was over with the republic
forced to make several territorial concessions,

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:27.919
the galaxy was still divided between the two
powers, leading to years of cold war.

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:32.669
Always seeking more power and terrified of
death, the Emperor began to have notions of

00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:37.570
a new dark side ritual which would wipe out
all life in the galaxy, leaving him to rule

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.330
in the void, unchallenged and immortal.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.350
Although Revan suffered greatly, he believed
his imprisonment was essential to keeping

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.770
the Emperor subdued.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:50.200
But the force ghost of Meetra Surik knew her
mentor and friend was withering away, and

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.359
could not control the Emperor forever.

00:34:52.359 --> 00:34:57.360
And so she left him for a time to visit Jedi
master Oteg of the Repubic, convincing him

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.020
to organize a strike team, rescuing Revan
from his prison.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.859
Meetra having done her duty, gave Revan some
final words of advice and encouragement, before

00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:08.590
finding peace and becoming one with the force.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:13.480
The former Sith Lord, then proceeded to inform
the jedi high council of all he knew concerning

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:18.089
the Imperial threat, before setting out to
find his old droid hk47.

00:35:18.089 --> 00:35:22.849
He also was able to recover his mask from
the Order of Revan on Drumond Kaas, but chose

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:26.430
not to associate with them, because their
reverence was unnerving.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:31.020
And so he made his way to the Foundry, an
Ancient Rakatan manufacturing facility whose

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.260
location he’d known for many years, but
was able to shield from the Emperor during

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.440
the years of torture.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.980
Revan, determined to end the Sith threat once
and for all, then began building an army of

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.560
extermination droids designed to wipe out
everyone of Sith ancestry throughout the galaxy.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.950
But the Emperor learned of his plans and sent
a team of elite warriors which made their

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:56.190
way through the facility, destroying HK47
before confronting Revan and slaying him in

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.500
a final battle.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.300
Revan’s long and complicated life, saw him
embrace both the light and darksides of the

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:07.520
force, and so when at last he died, his spirit
split in two, with his light side half desiring

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.240
to become one with the force, while his dark
side half clung to the physical world, remaining

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.960
attached to his body.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.760
Fueled by his hatred for the Emperor and desire
for vengeance.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.460
Darkside Revan then decided to embrace the
Revanites of Drumond Kass, taking direct control

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:26.400
of the order and turning them into an extremist
and fanatical cult.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.700
Under his leadership, they managed to infiltrate
both the Empire and Republic, placing many

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.140
of their agents in positions of power.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.660
Ordering the creation of an infinite army,
the Revanites began implanting Rakatan technology

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.270
into organics bodies, creating powerful cyborg
warrior.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:46.849
However the project was destroyed in its early
stages by both Republic and Imperial forces.

00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:51.130
Learning that the Emperor’s consciousness
was in hiding on Yavin 4, Darkside Revan set

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:56.240
out to finally destroy his hated enemy, conducting
a ritual to restore the Emperor’s physical

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.480
body, making him vulnerable to attack.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.950
But again a joint Republic and Imperial coalition
arrived to upset his plans engaging the Revanite

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.609
forces in the area.

00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:10.099
Unfortunately, only the Emperor benefitted
from the massive loss of life that followed,

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:14.240
using their deaths to regain his strength,
allowing his consciousness to leave the planet

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.900
and continue his campaign to rule the galaxy.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.630
In the end, Darkside Revan was defeated by
the coalition, which included two of his descendants

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.849
in Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan and her son
Theron Shan.

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:29.670
He was then confronted by his light side half
which convinced him to accept death and become

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.700
one with the force.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:36.710
The 2 halves merged and Revan’s body disappeared,
leaving only his mask and lightsaber.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:41.280
After his death, the former Jedi and Sith
Lord’s legacy continued on, influencing

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.730
both light and darkside users for thousands
of years.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.930
His own descendants became powerful figures
in the republic and jedi order, while his

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:54.200
holocron and personal writings went to shape
the future of the Sith Order, with Darth Bane,

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.440
founder of the rule of 2 philosophy basing
much of his work on Revan’s teachings.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.380
The Cross of glory earned for saving the Republic
was placed in a Republic Foundation Museum,

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.600
while his mask became a trophy for future
sith lords.
