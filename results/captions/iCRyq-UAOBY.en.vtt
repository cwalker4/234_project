00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.300
What is the stuff of legend?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.910
Is it making a game winning shot?

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.030
Is it revolutionizing an industry or a country?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.950
Super-human efforts lead us to placing men
and women on pedestals for all to admire and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.200
aspire to.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.150
What is more super-human than fighting off
a group of enemy combatants by oneself?

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.100
That is the stuff of legend.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.340
Unfortunately, as time has passed, many legends
have been forgotten.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300
Men who have done the unthinkable on the battlefield,
with some even living to tell the tale.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.690
Our list consists of soldiers who have shown
other-wordly courage and loyalty to cause

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.730
and country.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.149
Here are 10 incredible stories of warriors
who took on the enemy all alone.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.890
10.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.840
Aníbal Augusto Milhais

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.899
Conflict: World War I

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.370
Born in Portugal in 1895, Milhais is viewed
as the most important soldier in his nation’s

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.370
history.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.570
Drafted when he was only 20, Milhais was ushered
from his small village to the front line of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.789
the Portuguese Second Infantry division.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.880
The legend of Anibal Milhais began during
the Battle of Lys.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.040
Portuguese involvement in World War I was
mostly centered in Belgium with British and

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.620
Portuguese soldiers defending the area from
invading German divisions.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.780
With casualties growing – 1,938 men killed,
5,198 wounded, with an additional 7,000 taken

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.890
prisoner – Milhais was in charge of one
of the machine guns.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.110
As the Germans continued their advance against
retreating soldiers, Milhais defended against

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.540
the assault by laying down intense fire, causing
many German casualties.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.721
Instead of retreating with the other soldiers,
he continued firing, covering the full the

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.110
retreat of Portuguese and British alike despite
coming under heavy attack.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.220
Milhais continued firing at his post until
he ran out of ammunition.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.490
If that wasn’t enough, Milhais would again
come to the rescue of Belgian troops, standing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.270
alone with his machine gun, and covering another
group of retreating troops.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.590
Not a single casualty was reported.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.260
As a result of heroic efforts, Anibal Augusto
Milhais was awarded the highest military honor

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.990
in the country.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.990
9.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.990
Lone Viking

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.970
Conflict: Battle of Stamford Bridge

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.530
The Norse were being pushed back by the Saxon
Army, their morale was low, and they struggled

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.150
to reorganize their ranks as their enemy breathed
down their necks.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.640
Out of the chaos, a lone Viking emerged.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.290
He pushed his way through his retreating brethren
and faced the Saxon army on a bridge that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.819
had the width of three men.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.230
Our lone Viking was a large man with wide
shoulders, wearing a helmet that covered his

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.170
nose and metal that draped across his chest.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.780
According to legend, he stepped out toward
the middle of the bridge by his lonesome with

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.569
his fellow Vikings organizing their famous
shield wall defense.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.290
The Battle of Stamford Bridge was the result
of the Norse army pillaging and burning English

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.359
towns like Scarborough and York.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.231
While enjoying the spoils of their victories
near Stamford Bridge, the English Saxon Army

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:47.769
marched 180 miles in four days to face them.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.030
After the great Viking king, Harald Hardrada,
was killed in the battle, the Vikings seemed

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.420
destined to be routed by the Saxons.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.040
However, our lone Viking had other ideas.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.599
Both sides share the account of the heroic
effort.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.150
A lone man standing on the bridge as the Saxons
came upon him.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.840
Our legend swung his battle axe, killing each
man that stepped forward, and remained unmoved

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.749
from his position despite the many arrows
lodged across his torso.

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.209
Finally, a Saxon soldier, who went below the
bridge, stabbed the Viking up through the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.209
wooden slats.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.769
However, it wasn’t until our lone Norseman
took at least 40 Saxon troops from the field

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.560
of battle and rallied his Vikings.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560
8.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560
Dian Wei

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560
Conflict: Battle of Wancheng

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.139
One of the earliest conflicts on our list
is the Battle of Wancheng, where Dian Wei

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.209
made himself one of the most famed warriors
in the Eastern Han Dynasty.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.370
After fleeing his home, Wei managed to impress
a regional commander and eventually was promoted

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.370
to Commandant.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.249
The role put him in charge of the safety of
warlord Cao Cao, commanding his personal guards.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.150
Dian Wei would take this responsibility to
heart.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.860
After Cao Cao led the successful invasion
of a province, the warlord, Zhang Xiu, immediately

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.860
surrendered.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.430
Pleased with Xiu’s surrender, Cao Cao threw
a party for Zhang Xiu and his men.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.480
However, a historical rendition of “The
Red Wedding” ensued with Zhang Ziu rebelling

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.970
and launching a surprise attack on Cao’s
unprepared forces.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.579
Many of Cao’s men would be killed as he
retreated with a few horsemen, however Dian

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.969
Wei did not flee.

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.310
He stood tall and fought.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.029
Wei had about a dozen men and were greatly
outnumbered.

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.620
Wei fought to the death allowing Cao to escape.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.450
Legend has it that Dian Wei lay on the ground
for several minutes, but the enemy soldiers

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.030
were too afraid to approach him.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.360
Feared even after death – Wei’s story
will live on.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.360
7.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360
Ben L. Salomon

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.270
Conflict: World War II

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.390
The United States entry into World War II
changed the lives of thousands of young Americans.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.270
Ben L. Salomon had just graduated from college
when he was drafted into the Army.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.970
Salomon had an opportunity to never see the
horrors of war.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.760
Stationed in Hawaii as a dentist, he would
have received an honorable discharge without

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.780
seeing the battlefield.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.330
However, when a medic was killed in the line
of duty, Salomon volunteered to take his place.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.480
Salomon and the 2nd Battalion managed to complete
their objective of clearing a coastal area

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480
stronghold.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.840
However, it seemed inevitable that they would
face a strong counter-attack.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.460
Soon after, Japanese Army commander General
Saito ordered all remaining Japanese soldiers

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.860
would “advance to attack the American forces
and will all die an honorable death.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.810
Each man will kill ten Americans.”

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.580
Deployed as a paramedic, Salomon had set up
close to the shoreline, making him vulnerable

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.970
to a possible attack.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.480
Soon after the Japanese counter-attack began,
the station was overwhelmed with more than

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.670
thirty wounded.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.590
Salomon had to juggle to save the most seriously
wounded while fighting off Japanese soldiers

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.010
who entered the aid tent.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.970
The station was soon overwhelmed with Japanese
attackers.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.850
Salomon forced his men to leave the station
while he fought off the Japanese.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.700
The last living memory of Ben L. Salomon was
his him taking over the machine gun after

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.720
the gunner died.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.030
He managed to take out an incredible 98 enemies
before himself being killed, his body reportedly

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.260
riddled with up to 76 bullet holes.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.160
Shakespeare’s quote comes to mind in the
manner of Salomon’s death: “Cowards die

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.510
many times before their deaths; the valiant
never taste death but once.”

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.510
6.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.510
John R. McKinney

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.850
Conflict: World War II

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.870
The war in the Pacific has often been characterized
as one of the most brutal campaigns American

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.710
soldiers have had to endure.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.121
Surviving the war is a feat in itself, but
being awarded the Medal of Honor (that’s

00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:05.600
him on the left in the photo above, receiving
the award) places Sergeant John R. McKinney

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.140
in the halls of legends.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.700
While fighting in the Philippine Islands,
McKinney was part of a unit tasked with defending

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.900
an outpost that would become overrun with
Japanese forces.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.260
As the outpost was being captured, McKinney
received a blow to the head by a saber.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.780
Despite his injury, he seized his rifle, struck
the attacker with the butt of his weapon,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.300
and killed another Japanese soldier who had
entered the post.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.070
McKinney noticed that the machine gun operator
was injured and had to be carried away.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.500
Soon after, it came under the control of the
Japanese.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.680
What follows is nothing short of legendary:
McKinney managed to kill ten Japanese soldiers

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.710
who were huddled around the machine gun, shooting
three of them while bludgeoning to death the

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.710
rest.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.130
In a bitter irony, the machine gun proved
to be inoperable and McKinney was left with

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.520
just his rifle to defend against the ongoing
Japanese advancement.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.580
Still, he managed to singlehandedly secure
the area.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.990
By the time more US troops arrived, the encounter
was already over.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.050
They counted 38 dead Japanese around him with
two more at the side of a mortar 45 yards

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.050
away.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.050
5.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.050
Sempronius Densus

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.070
In a list comprised of military immortality,
what would our list be without the inclusion

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.050
of a tale of Roman conspiracy and heroism?

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.030
The conspiracy would come in the form of Marcus
Otho, a rival of Densus’ deputy, who would

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.130
conspire to kill deputy Piso Licinianus and
Emperor Galbus.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.830
One Roman Centurion, Sempronius Densus, proved
to be the only man willing to stop Otho’s

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.830
plot.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.990
In 69 AD, Emperor Galbus and his deputy Licinianus
were being paraded down the streets of Rome

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.060
when the plot unfolded.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.470
A large group of men surrounded the proceedings
and attacked the Emperor.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.990
While other Centurions fled or even joined
the attackers, Densus fought off as many men

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.150
as he could, refusing to give up his position.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.800
Finally, he was overcome and killed, but his
heroics live on in Roman lore.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800
4.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800
Saito Musashibo

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.130
Conflict: Battle of Gojo Bridge

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.620
The range of life experiences of Saito Musahibo
is hard to imagine.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.290
Not many film characters even manage to have
the character arc of Saito Musashibo.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.590
At an early age, he joined the Buddhist Monks
of Japan until he was thrown out for unruly

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.590
behavior.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.520
Somehow his schooling as a monk included the
ways of the samurai.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.590
It was not long after this that Benkei, for
some unknown reason, stood alone at Gojo Bridge

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.780
killing every man that attempted to pass.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.580
In the end, nearly 1,000 swords lay at his
feet.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.100
Finally, Benkei was defeated by Minamoto no
Yoshitsune and a partnership that has remarkable

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.020
parallels to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid developed.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.950
For four years, Benkei and Yoshitsune lived
as outlaws before ultimately finding themselves

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.450
surrounded in the castle of Koromogawa, just
like their fictional counterparts.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.620
With their fate sealed, Yoshitsune chose to
end his own life with ritual suicide.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.760
Benkei, on the other hand, was having precisely
none of that.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.561
He continued his efforts to hold off the advancing
soldiers to keep them from his friend, while

00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:40.779
archers rained arrows down upon him.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:44.800
Benkei’s reputation led to many soldiers
fearing to cross the bridge to confront him.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.009
Eventually, the soldiers noticed that the
giant warrior – who supposedly stood 6-foot-7

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:50.600
– was no longer moving.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.069
Some of the soldiers finally managed to muster
up enough courage to take a closer look, and

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:58.360
realized that he was dead, yet had somehow
managed to stay on his feet anyway.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360
3.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360
Simo Hayha

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.069
Conflict: Winter War

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:06.379
Our list is filled with ordinary men who were
thrust into war and became the stuff of legend.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.660
The case of Simo Hayha is no different.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.550
A farmer and hunter, Hayha joined the Finnish
Army when he was just twenty.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:18.350
By the end of the war, he would claim responsibility
for the deaths of more than 500 Soviet troops.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.620
In 1939, when the Soviet Union invaded Finland,
Hayha decided to join the military and fight

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.190
off the Soviet expansion.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.529
Geography played a major part in the war with
a major portion of the fight taking place

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.060
in wooded areas.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.600
As a result, Simo Hayha was able to take cover
and hide in the thick forest while targeting

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.889
Russian soldiers.

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:40.899
Eventually, Soviet soldiers became terrified
of the man and nicknamed him “The White

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:44.149
Death,” as he was wearing a white camouflage
uniform.

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:48.139
Reports show that the Russians made a concerted
effort to kill Hayha, even compromising the

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:51.389
life of many soldiers just to eliminate the
great sniper.

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:55.319
After the failure of a team of soldiers, the
Russian army sent a group of snipers to eliminate

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:57.449
Simo Hayha, but this too failed.

00:09:57.449 --> 00:10:02.430
Hayha would compile a kill total that would
seem only plausible in video games.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:07.959
Finally, in March 1940, one Soviet soldier
managed to shoot Hayha through the jaw, but

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:08.959
he survive.

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:12.389
Simo Hayha recovered and managed to live to
the ripe old age of 96.

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:13.389
2.

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:14.540
Yogendra Singh Yadav

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.850
Conflict: Kargil War

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.220
One of the oldest unresolved conflicts in
the world is the struggle for Kashmir between

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.730
India and Pakistan.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.639
Since the end of British rule and the creation
of India and Pakistan, wars have been fought

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:27.480
over the small region of land.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.670
The Kargil conflict began in 1999 with Pakistani
troops and Kashmiri militants crossing the

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.089
Indian border.

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:38.220
Yogendra Singh Yadav was only 19 years old
when the war started.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.740
His unit’s mission was to reach the top
of Tiger Hill, and capture three strategic

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.740
bunkers.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.689
Naturally, the bunker sat at the top of a
cliff face that was nearly 17,000 feet high.

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:51.129
What did the 19 year old Yadav do?

00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:52.779
He led the assault, of course.

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:56.069
They installed ropes that would allow them
to climb the cliff face and also provide a

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:58.269
means for future assaults, should they fail.

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:00.790
Halfway up the cliff face, it seemed like
they would.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.540
The platoon commander was killed along with
two other soldiers.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.980
Yadav himself was shot three times in the
groin and the shoulder.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.089
However, he willed himself forward, climbing
the remaining 60 feet and reaching the bunkers.

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:16.459
Upon reaching the top, Yadav lobbed a grenade
into the first bunker and killed four men.

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.490
After neutralizing the first bunker, Yadav
charged forward towards the second with enemy

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.360
soldiers firing on him.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.050
Somehow, he managed to kill the four armed
enemy soldiers.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.569
He and two other soldiers managed to secure
the bunker and allow the rest of his unit

00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:29.970
to reach the summit of the cliff.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.110
Yadav and his unit were able to capture all
three bunkers and India would go on to win

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.110
the war.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.110
1.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.110
Alvin York

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.680
Conflict: World War I

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.690
What makes Alvin York’s exploits so astounding
is the fact that he was initially denied his

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.600
conscientious objector application.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.740
A pacifist, York had to be convinced that
the duty of a Christian during war is to fight.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.269
And fight he did.

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:56.249
In 1918, Alvin C. York reportedly killed over
20 German soldiers and helped capture an additional

00:11:56.249 --> 00:12:01.610
132 at the head of a small detachment in the
Argonne Forest near the Meuse River in France

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.709
during World War I.

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:06.529
A passage from his diary shows his inner turmoil
and courage in battle.

00:12:06.529 --> 00:12:10.360
At this point, we feel the best course is
to just let Sergeant York tell his own story…

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.939
“[T]hose machine guns were spitting fire
and cutting down the undergrowth all around

00:12:13.939 --> 00:12:14.939
me something awful….

00:12:14.939 --> 00:12:15.939
I didn’t have time to dodge behind a tree
or dive into the brush, I didn’t even have

00:12:15.939 --> 00:12:17.350
time to kneel or lie down….

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.490
As soon as the machine guns opened fire on
me, I began to exchange shots with them.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.139
In order to sight me or to swing their machine
guns on me, the Germans had to show their

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:29.279
heads above the trench, and every time I saw
a head I just touched it off.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:31.110
All the time I kept yelling at them to come
down.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.940
I didn’t want to kill any more than I had
to.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.240
But it was they or I.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.170
And I was giving them the best I had.”

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.990
Alvin York would return home an American hero,
and would later earn the Congressional Medal

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.990
of Honor.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.610
So incredible were his deeds that both France,
Italy, and Montenegro also honored his remarkable

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.610
courage.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:13:02.820
His story was later turned into a movie starring
Gary Cooper.
