00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
Welcome to Japan Treasure Hunters I'm
Jonathan Lucas and today is a great day

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.379
for me and a couple of my other friends
that are out here.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.380
We are on a Iwo Jima again as we all know Iwo Jima was like the main focal

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.660
point in the Pacific and the reason why
is because this was an airfield and this

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.330
gave the United States a close enough
margin to Japan in order to attack and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.340
then be able to receive airplanes back
here if they were damaged ultimately

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.809
saving lives. Unfortunately it took a lot
of lives to take this island so right

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.040
now I'm standing on Mount Suribachi and as you can see the the big

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.780
memorial to where the flag was raised.
Right over here this is where Sergeant

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.539
Ganoust actually took the famous film
right here and the actual flag was

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.680
raised right over there.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.690
Suribachi is ours.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.229
So this place is very very very surreal,
you, you don't know the feeling and and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.430
and the thought that goes through and
especially once you come around over.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.520
Here you're gonna look at this beach
area and looking at this beach area, this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.100
whole ocean right out here was filled
with 800 ships, which to me is amazing

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.210
anyway, it's just the logistics and then
if you look at the beach now it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
actually raised up about a hundred
meters or so and there's actually two

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.580
lips and and the landing craft when they
came on they came up to the first one

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.700
right there and that's the one that you
see on all the films where where the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.979
Marines stopped and they had to go up
the hill and just try to picture this in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.970
your mind that seventy-three three years
ago seventy-three years ago this was all

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.590
desolated there was no green anywhere. So now you know you can see some buildings

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.530
over there that's where the actual
airfields at now but you can see that

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.040
just this little piece of island was
that important that we take so this time

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
on Japan Treasure Hunters we're gonna go hit all try to hit all the shrines all

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.920
the memorials and a lot of sites of
interest that I think that you would

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.690
like to see because not everybody can
come out here and do this.  So I'm ready

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.609
to hit it and let's go.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.540
All right so we're still on top it's
Suribachi here and you can see there's

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.260
there's a couple other monuments for the
Japanese soldiers that were here.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.579
we are actually gonna walk down over here a little bit and there's a bunker over

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.400
here that's a that they used to shoot
towards the beach Suribachi was filled

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.590
with caves tunnels and the second
command post that the actual command

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.799
post.  Will go into that cave later but
this was like the main part that that

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.439
the Marines had to take.  In order to take
this it took them four days in order to

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:02.200
get from the beach up to here and the
fifth Marine Division H company is the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.239
one that actually came up here and did
this so bless their souls.  Absolutely

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.659
amazing I was in the military I never
had the chance to fight but just being

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.609
here and seeing the sand and and imagine
not being able to see your enemy where

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.449
they're coming from
is just mind-blowing. It's incredible so

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.080
let's go check out this bunker.  Alright
so we took a little walk down the trail

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.009
here to come down here to where the gun
emplacements were, you can see over here

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.340
there's there's two guns that were
pointed down towards the beach over here,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.150
and sitting up here is just like it's
still surreal to see the water and the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.940
beach and just everything thinking that
there was 800 ships out here sending

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:54.220
Marines in at 9 o'clock in the morning
on February 19, 1945.  But the caves and

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.300
the bunkers on Suribachi have been
closed they've been sealed off for the

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.360
most part and the reason for that is
because we're actually sitting on a live

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.539
volcano right now and right over here is
actually the crater of the volcano you

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:14.260
can look down and you can see actually a
small cone that's kind of steaming up a

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.409
little bit here but it's just it's just
mind-blowing that we're out here on a

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.229
live volcano in the middle of the
Pacific.  Okay so right now we're on the

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.250
west side  of Iwo Jima the West side Beach and I like to call this Beach, The Graveyard of

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.860
Ships because ships behind me that are a bunch ships that were concreted over
over and left out in the water as a

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.770
barrier to keep the ships coming in
help guide the Marines into a certain

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:51.540
area. So that way they were easier
targets.  These actually used to be out in

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.690
the water about 200 yards this, this area
right up here used to be the beach

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.430
actually if water would come all the way
up this far the past seventy-three

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.730
years, the island's raised up that far we're
gonna take a walk down the beach and we're

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.900
gonna have a gander at the ships.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.860
Alright so now we're standing in front
of Painted Rock which is you can see it's a

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.220
carving of the flag-raising on Mount
Suribachi.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.690
Out of all the places on the island this
is my second favorite one to come to

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.550
just because it shows like historical,
it's extremely historic

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.470
you can see names, dates, of course you know there's some newer names and end dates but also

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:40.449
there's one from 1948 which I think is
really amazing.  There's not a name on who

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.949
carved it or how many people carved it
if they just know that it's it's here

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.620
and this is one of the main stops when
you come out here.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.370
Alright so here we are at another
monumental spot on Iwo Jima where at

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:08.680
Oshiro Yama Ichiban Chu which is the first well it's

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:14.080
the big mountain the big castle mountain
first gun emplacement right.  So so

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.970
looking at the gun is actually really
cool because you look right here

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.230
it was hit with the projectile and put
the gun out of commission. So so, right

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:29.080
now we're actually in the bunker where
it was right now and as you can see it's

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.930
just a whole lot of chaos up in here but
if you look out here you can see where

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.760
the gun was pointed and it was probably
hit and when I was hit it moved over

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.690
here because there wasn't anything out
on this side of the ocean it was all on

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:49.600
that side.  So it's it's really pretty
interesting to see it and yeah let me

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.980
get out of the way and get a good shot
of the whole gun.  Yeah it's just amazing

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.050
to see all this stuff that's out here
still.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:57.220
Alright so we came upon this monument
here,  it's it it states the Division

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.240
cemetery this plaque marks the spot of
the cemetery in which sailors and

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.260
Marines of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Marine
divisions who were killed in action

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:13.330
during the battle for Iwo Jima so this
is a this is a very sacred place to the

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:24.520
marines, obviously, but this is all that's
here now, just over overgrowth, trees and

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.660
a little bit of jungle.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:00.720
Al right so here's another book bunker
if you've seen one of my previous videos

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.270
you've seen that I've been in it here
before but I've got a little more time

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:12.060
looking to investigate a little bit
more. So see the stand where they had the

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.709
machine gun and let's get a view of what
the Japanese could see out this hole but

00:12:16.709 --> 00:12:21.839
at this time there was no rocks or
anything or no bushes in the way so it

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:28.709
was all clear grass they could see all
the way to the ocean. This side come back

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:36.810
over here to this side got the actual
machine gunners right here and I can

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:42.450
tell the front was blown out of it but
again if all this foliage wasn't here

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.830
you'd have a straight shot right down
the beach

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.730
had it been terrible that day.
