00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:12.710
Beta risk is the one risk factor you don't
want to be overly exposed to in this kind

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.710
of environment.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.670
The reason GDP growth is so slow, the reason
productivity growth is so slow at the moment,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.910
is because we are at the end of a debt super
cycle.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.210
I know you would like to ask me the question
how could I be wrong.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:44.480
But I can guarantee you that these mega-trends
will unfold.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:01:01.219
I'm a Danish National.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.260
Came home to my wife one spring day in 1986.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.720
I said to her, would you like to move to London?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.830
I've been offered a very interesting job.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.970
That's now 31 years ago.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:23.060
So we have now spent-- we are, for all intents
and purposes, British nationals, but obviously

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.330
with strong Danish roots.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.340
I have work mostly for American investment
banks.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.979
I worked for Goldman Sachs for many years.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.080
I ended up at Lehman Brothers, heading up
the private wealth management division in

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.080
Europe.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.150
Then in 2002 I decided to start my own business,
which is now into 17, 18 years.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.820
That business was mostly in multi-family office
business, but gradually-- especially after

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.630
the financial crisis in 2008-- we have increasingly
become institutional.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:10.739
And today the biggest client base for our
business today is the UK corporates pension

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.260
fund base.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.000
The end game could unfold in a number of different
ways.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.310
But let me back up before we get to the end
game.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.299
Let me explain why I think the world has changed
quite dramatically in recent years.

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.730
The typical investor today doesn't really
care about the long-term.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.510
For most investors, long-term means next Monday
morning and not next year or the year after.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.099
And therefore, some of the longer term structural
trends that I have focused on in my book are

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.680
being largely ignored and neglected by investors.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.379
And that's actually an opportunity set for
those investors who are prepared to dig a

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.319
little bit deeper and prepared to structure
their portfolio according to what is going

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.459
to unfold over the next 10, 20, 30 years.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.310
The end game can unfold in a number of different
ways.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.569
If you go back to one of the six structured
mega-trends that I discussed in the book,

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.870
it's what I call the end of the debt super
cycle.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.260
The last debt super cycle ended in the 1940s--
late '30s, early '40s.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.150
And that basically reset the clock.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.169
Debt to GDP has been rising constantly since
1946.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.819
And I'm arguing in my book that we are now
approaching the end of the current debt super

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.819
cycle.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.510
If you go back in history to 300, 400 years,
you can find a number of debt super cycles.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.859
It's not an unknown phenomenon.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.741
We typically build up debt, something happens,
everything collapses, and we start all over

00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.741
again.

00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:57.180
And that's precisely what we are at now.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.010
We are at the tail end of the current debt
super cycle.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.150
That, combined with a number of other factors,
will potentially end up in what I call the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:16.850
perfect storm-- a prolonged period of low
GDP growth, low returns on equities.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.650
And for that reason investors need to think
fundamentally differently in terms of how

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.939
they structure their portfolios for many years
to come.

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:34.639
The way I structure portfolios, first of all,
it is quite different from the way most people

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.699
do it.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.071
Most people think of portfolio construction
as how much do I allocate to equities, how

00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:43.750
much to allocate to bonds.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.259
They think of asset classes when they talk
to their portfolios.

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.039
I don't think of asset classes.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.310
I think of risk pockets.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.069
I operate with four risk pockets-- beta risk,
alpha risk, credit risk, and gamma risk.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.449
And gamma risk is basically everything else.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.009
And what I think is important for investors
to understand is that if the six structured

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:17.939
mega-trends unfurled the way I think they
will over the next several years, the worst

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.020
pockets you can invest in is the beta pocket.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.360
Beta risk is the one risk factor you don't
want to be overly exposed to in this kind

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.360
of environment.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.510
However, the vast majority of investors are
more exposed to the beta pocket than to any

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.910
of the other pockets that I just mentioned.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.710
And therefore, you need to think very, very
differently about portfolio construction when

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.380
you take this into consideration.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.849
When you invest passively, you basically are
exposed to what I call the beta factor.

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.639
Do markets go up or do they go down or do
they stay flat?

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.689
The great advantage of investing passively
is really to reduce your cost on a pre-cost

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.280
basis.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.289
Active managers don't underperform.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.539
That's a myth and it's a complete untruth.

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.430
Active investors on a pre-cost basis perform
in line with the market, because they are

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.650
the market.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.169
After costs, they underperform because costs
to active managers-- it's a significant factor

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.349
in when you calculate total performance.

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.749
When you invest passively, you obviously reduce
your costs significantly.

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:44.289
And therefore, more and more investors have
decided to invest passively.

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.600
Because that way they can perform more closely
in line with the market.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.300
Passive investing-- you will basically buy
the market.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.110
If the market goes up, the weight has gone
up the last 30 years-- about 10%, 11% a year--

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.319
you will be fine.

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.960
But markets will not go up 10% or 11% per
year over the next 20, 30 years.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.889
Markets will go up a fraction of that, if
at all.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:18.470
I reckon that a global equity portfolio over
the next 20, 30 years would probably do pretty

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.800
much a zero return-- maybe a very, very modest
positive return.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.280
So anywhere between 0% and 3%, which basically
means that if you invest passively that's

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.300
all you can hope for.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:39.159
If you invest in some of the strategies that
I will come back to later, you can improve

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:45.500
those kind of returns significantly.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.599
We are six years into the current debt super
cycle.

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:50.870
We are coming to the very end of this.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:59.039
The reason GDP growth is so slow, the reason
productivity growth is so slow at the moment,

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:01.930
is because we are at the end of the debt super
cycle.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.969
Because the closer we get to the end, the
more indebted the world is.

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:12.320
The more capital is used to service existing
capital, to service the existing debt, I should

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.879
say.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:19.699
And therefore, instead of using the capital
we have at our disposal for productivity enhancing

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:23.949
purposes, we use debt to service existing
debt.

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:27.110
And that obviously cuts back on productivity
growth.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.930
The second one, and probably the biggest one,
is the retirement of the baby boomers.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:40.430
Baby boomers are those who were born between
1945 and the early 1960s.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.420
The baby boomers have now started to retire
in large numbers.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:50.390
And when baby boomers retire, you obviously
reduce the size of the workforce.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.740
And when you reduce the size of the workforce,
you reduce economic growth.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.829
I'm probably mostly worried about the retirement
of the baby boomers, and let me tell you why.

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:06.550
Economic growth, GDP growth, is a must in
a world that is as indebted as the world is

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.839
today.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:14.351
And with declining workforce for many years
to come, we know that economic growth will

00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:16.330
be very, very pedestrian.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:23.089
We know that the European workforce will decline
by about 0.6% per annum, which basically means

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:29.370
that unless productivity grows by at least
0.6% per annum, we also had negative GDP growth

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.440
in the eurozone.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:38.510
The US is by far the least impacted market
by this factor.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:43.950
The US workforce will continue to grow by
about a quarter of a percent per year.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:51.000
The third factor of my six structural mega-trends
is what I call the declining spending power

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.180
of the middle classes.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:04.440
Vast centers of the Western world's population
has seen a flattening, or even worse, decline

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.769
in spending power over the last few years.

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.240
It started in America.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.380
The Americans saw a decline in spending power.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.079
Then it moved to Europe.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:21.380
And the countries mostly affected in Europe
over the past 10 years is the UK and Italy.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:27.820
And obviously when the spending power is reduced,
economic growth declines.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.320
And there's absolutely nothing on the near
term horizon that suggests that the spending

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.060
power will improve anytime soon.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:45.920
The fourth mega-trend that I have focused
on in my book is what I call the rise of the

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920
East.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.840
But I'm less convinced that the rise of the
East will actually lead to a decline of the

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840
West.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:00.150
It could lead to a decline of the West, but
probably only in relative terms.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:08.870
As living standards improve in the East, as
people start to spend more money, looking

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:16.250
for good returns on the capital will increasingly
look to the East for new opportunities.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.589
And therefore, more and more capital will
seek to escape from the west and look to the

00:11:21.589 --> 00:11:26.110
East for the opportunity set that is now being
offered over there.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:34.010
And therefore, even if it doesn't have a major
effect on GDP growth in the West that the

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:41.690
East is rising, then it will definitely have
an effect on the capital at our disposal.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.759
And that will affect productivity and GDP
growth.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:50.149
Another structural mega-trend that I have
discussed in the book is what I called the

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:52.319
death of fossil fuels.

00:11:52.319 --> 00:12:00.079
There is a very strong desire to electrify
everything we do-- electrify transportation,

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:04.520
electrify heating our homes, electrify everything.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.490
And the death of fossil fuels is really a
consequence of that other trend.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.010
Alternative energy forms are increasingly
on the agenda for governments around the world.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:20.370
And alternative energy forms are perfect for
electrification.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:31.160
And that will drive a even stronger need and
desire to increase electrification.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.910
And that will basically kill the need for
fossil fuels.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.339
But let me back up on that for a second.

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:39.790
Fossil fuels won't die completely.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.440
Oil won't disappear, at least not in our lifetime.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.860
And the reason for that is the need for oil
in the chemical industry.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:55.260
My last structural mega-trend is what I called
mean reversion of wealth to GDP.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:04.329
Wealth to GDP is a macroeconomic identity
that many people are way off.

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:12.230
Wealth to GDP in society all over the world,
is relatively constant.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.070
Wealth is basically the sum of all households.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:23.260
And the three big drivers of wealth in households
are property, equities, and bonds.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:30.589
And total wealth to GDP in society, as I said
before, it's long-term constant.

00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:38.550
However, since the great financial crisis
where wealth the GDP came back to its long-term

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:45.740
mean value, wealth to GDP has escalated out
of control, so to speak.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:53.829
Today in the US, where wealth to GDP is about
3.75 times-- in other words, wealth is 3.75

00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:59.920
times higher than GDP-- now, as of today,
the number is about five times.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:11.579
So one could argue that wealth in the US would
have to come back by about 25% to 30% in order

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:16.040
to get back to the levels that will re-establish
the long-term mean value.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:22.060
If you go back-- if you think about the logic
behind this, it's actually quite simple.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.250
Think of wealth as capital, and think of GDP
as output.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.800
Wealth to GDP is then capital to output.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.180
In other words, how much capital does it take
to generate one unit of GDP?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:43.399
And the wealth to GDP ratio then becomes a
capital efficiency ratio.

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:50.360
In other words, if the wealth to GDP ratio
in the US is lower than it is in Europe, it

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:56.250
basically means that capital efficiency in
the US is better than it is in Europe.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.620
However, all over the world we are now above
the long-term mean, which basically means

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.550
that either property, equities, or bonds,
or a combination of the three will have to

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:10.070
come down in years to come.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.579
Think about how they interact with each other.

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:22.370
One could argue that the last one-- the minimum
version of GDP-- is actually the end game

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.889
of the combination of all the other mega-trends
It's a little bit different.

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:28.829
It's not necessarily a trend.

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:36.449
It's potentially more of an outcome that is
of a result of the retirement of the baby

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:39.640
boomers, the end of the debt super cycle,
et cetera.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:48.750
And therefore, I categorize the mean reversion
idea or trend a little bit differently than

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.360
I do the other ones.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.480
I'm probably more worried about people not
paying any attention to this than anything

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.480
else.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:03.160
I'm staggered, to tell you the truth, how
ill informed many investors are about these

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.220
trends.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.670
They are all literally set in stone.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.730
I know you would like to ask me the question
how could I be wrong, but I can guarantee

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.510
you that these mega-trends will unfold.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.740
It's just a question of time.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.990
I don't issue many guarantees.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.620
My compliance manager will tell me that I'm
not allowed to issue guarantees.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:28.730
But when it comes to structural trends, it's
pretty much a given that they will unfold.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.460
And therefore, it's staggering how little
attention people pay to it.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:39.500
The retirement of the baby boomers-- one could
argue that we could relatively easily fix

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.500
that problem.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.899
I would be very surprised if any country around
the world is prepared to go in the footsteps

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:52.310
of Angela Merkel and do what she did last
year or a year before.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.019
To tell you the truth, they could fix an awful
lot of problems for an awful lot of countries

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:58.839
if we let in more immigrants.

00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:02.629
But there's no appetite for that at the moment.

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:09.280
In terms of women joining the workforce, the
numbers just don't add up.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.240
When we get to a ratio of women to men in
the workforce, in the active workforce of

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:21.630
about 9 to 10-- so for every 10 men, we have
nine women-- the numbers flatten.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:28.540
The first countries in the world that reached
this level of 9 to 10 was the three Scandinavian

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.910
countries and Holland.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:36.740
And in all four countries the numbers have
flattened since it doesn't go any further.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.870
So don't ever assume that for every 10 men
in the workforce will have 10 women.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.280
It just doesn't happen.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.370
And therefore, if you look at where we are
in other OECD countries around the world now,

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:57.460
we are so close to the 0.9 number, that you
can't expect anything meaningful to happen

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.570
on that front.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.781
The only country that is significantly away
from 0.9 is Japan.

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:05.580
Japan is at 0.7.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.210
So for every 10 men in the Japanese workforce,
you only have seven women.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:17.200
But having said that, if you then dig a little
bit deeper again and look at the Japanese

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.800
workforce, you will find that women under
40 are at 0.9.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:28.490
Only women above 40 are at 0.7, which basically
means that you would have to persuade the

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.010
oldest Japanese women to join the workforce.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.740
And that is not very likely to happen.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:39.010
The Americans have something that we didn't
really have in Europe, called echo boomers.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.590
The echo boomers are the children of the baby
boomers.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:49.530
And for that reason, when we get to the mid
2020s-- so seven, eight years from now, nine

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:56.810
years from now-- the GDP growth rate in the
US will start to pick up again.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.950
Because the echo boomers will start to kick
in.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.840
In Europe, that won't happen.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:06.910
And therefore, the slow economic growth that
I'm predicting for Europe will last at least

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:12.020
to 2050.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.270
It will fix a few things.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:21.930
Problem number one, people don't want to work
till they are 75 or 80.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:27.390
Working until they're 69 or 70 is not going
to fix many problems.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:32.300
I know in Denmark, my home country, the unions
are having a mega-fight with the government

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:38.060
at the moment, trying to persuade the government
that don't take away from our members what

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.160
they have earned over a lifetime.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.460
This is something they have earned over many,
many years.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.070
And they are entitled to retire when they're
65.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.660
Don't touch that.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.280
And that is an argument that you hear again
and again and again, not only in Denmark,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.500
but all over the place.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.640
So that's the first problem.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:02.180
The second problem is that old people are
not as productive as young people are.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.370
Productivity peaks when people in their '30s.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.100
Then it stays relatively flat for about 10
to 15 years.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:16.220
But when people reach their mid '50s, productivity
growth goes on a steep decline.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.390
And by the time they are 65 or 70, they are
significantly less productive than they are

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:27.240
when they are at their best.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.700
So how long could this take before it all
unfolds, before it all and unravels?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.090
The true answer is, that nobody knows.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:42.990
The pension industry in the Western world
is divided up between defined benefits and

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.220
defined contributions.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:50.530
In many countries around the world, defined
benefits still account for a very significant

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.900
proportion of total pension plans.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:02.490
In the UK, as an example, we have-- between
state pensions, local authority pensions,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:10.011
and corporate pensions, the three main components
of pension plans here in the UK-- we have

00:21:10.011 --> 00:21:18.350
10 trillion pounds of unfunded pension schemes,
which is basically between five and six times

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.420
UK GDP.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:29.270
Unless interest rates start to rise meaningfully,
the UK DB pension model will collapse at some

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.270
point.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:41.560
Given the enormous amount of unfunded pensions,
I would say within the next five to 10 years.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:49.630
So could we survive not with GDP growth, but
with GDP being relatively stable?

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.670
I would like to offer two answers to that
question.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:02.230
Extreme amounts of indebtedness in the Anglo-Saxon
world, the lack of pension schemes amongst

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:11.230
many citizens in the Anglo-Saxon world, requires
for GDP to grow unless the ship will definitely

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.490
sink.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:21.780
In the other parts of the world-- take Germany,
where personal savings are extraordinary solid

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.270
and robust-- I don't think we need GDP growth.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:36.130
The view in my family is that yes, we will
definitely survive without GDP growth as long

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.070
as we can protect what we already have.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.630
We don't need to improve things.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.760
But I'm sure you can find millions of people
around the world who wouldn't subscribe to

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760
that view.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.950
And therefore, there are different answers
to that question depending on which part of

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:54.830
the world you live in and how indebted you
are.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.080
So what should investors really invest in,
given what we have just talked about?

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:06.610
Let me go back to the for risk pockets that
I mentioned much earlier-- beta risk, alpha

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.020
risk, credit risk, and gamma risk.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:19.790
If I'm just about right that global equities
in the years to come will deliver no more

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:27.960
than low single digit returns, the one risk
pocket you want to be overly exposed to is

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.110
the beta risk pocket.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.980
And that is, as I said earlier, that is the
one risk pocket that everybody is exposed

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.600
to at the moment.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.130
But let's start with a plain, vanilla investor.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:45.470
Let's start with the investor who tends to
invest in only bonds and equities.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:53.640
Bonds, I don't think, belong in my portfolio
to any significant degree.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:59.290
Bonds will deliver at best, zero returns.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.290
At worst, modest negative returns.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:10.160
I think interest rates will rise very modestly
in the years to come, but not at all as dramatic

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.860
as some people talk about.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:19.500
If I'm right that interest rates stay low
for many years to come, investors will increasingly

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.010
look for income in equities.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:33.860
And therefore, you should look at income equities
as an alternative to true growth equities.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:40.160
But let me put a warning flag in the ground
right now.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.240
A lot of companies pay income without being
able to afford it.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.640
A lot of companies take on debt to pay those
attractive dividends.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.400
So you need to do your homework.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:59.990
But I would be very surprised if high dividend
equities, if income generating equities, won't

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:05.000
outperform growth equities over the next 10
to 20 years.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.420
Another option is to look at style as another
factor.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.260
Style is really growth versus value.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:22.140
Growth has done spectacularly well against
value over the last many years.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.970
As I expect a modest rise in interest rates
in years to come, value should outperform

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:28.970
growth.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.370
So that's the first reason.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:38.960
Second reason is that after many, many years
of underperformance, value is now extremely

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.170
attractively priced relative to growth.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.450
And it is at the very low end of the range.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:53.140
So for a retail investor, I would focus on
those two factors-- income and value.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.550
For the more sophisticated investor, I would
look at other opportunities.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:03.730
Is one of my favorite strategies is what I
call trade finance.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:11.360
International trade is increasingly between
emerging markets and developed markets.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:19.210
And because of restrictions put on commercial
banks, commercial banks are increasingly finding

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.760
it difficult to finance that international
trade.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:29.260
And that has inspired a whole new industry
to pop up in the underforest of the alternative

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.170
investment would called trade finance.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:37.120
The credit risk you take in trade finance
is not overly dramatic, but you still get

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.410
very attractive returns.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:47.170
Returns are on average, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, depending
on which part of the world you look at.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.440
And you can typically access your capital
in a few months' time.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.140
If you're prepared to go further out that
curve, out the liquidity curve, and lock up

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.640
your capital seven years-- you can get even
higher returns.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:08.470
One of my favorite traits further out the
curve is aviation leasing.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:14.380
Basically, leasing commercial aircraft to
airlines around the world.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:22.070
Given the growing living standards in Asia,
more and more Asians travel by plane and more

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:28.190
and more airlines around the world choose
to lease aircraft rather than buying them.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.900
And the reason for that is very simple.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.660
Commercial airlines need not to tie up too
much of their working capital.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.590
And buying the aircraft ties up a huge amount
of working capital.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:44.330
And therefore, commercial airlines increasingly
lease rather than buy.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.480
When I first joined this industry back in
the mid '80s, only 3% to 4% of commercial

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.050
aircraft were leased.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.360
The rest were bought.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:59.360
Today it's about 35% of all commercial aircraft
that are leased, and that is a-- it's a trend

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.350
that benefits from the end of the debt super
cycle.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.150
It's a trend that benefits from the rise of
the East.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.240
And you can get some very attractive returns.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:16.470
But the negative is that you need to tie up
your capital for five, six, seven years.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:24.350
There is one risk that should never be underestimated,
and I learned this in 2008.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:29.410
I learned it the hard way, because I got burned
myself.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:41.640
When the S... hits the fan, the worst thing
you can be in terms of your portfolio construction

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:51.380
is that your duration of your assets is shorter
than the duration of your liabilities.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.630
In other words, you have a mismatch between
assets and liabilities.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:03.290
In other words, if a trade finance fund's
offers quarterly liquidity to investors but

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:11.190
the underlying loan book is tied up for at
least six months, then as long as times are

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:17.370
good, as long as everything is hunky dory,
he can meet his redemption request.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:22.470
Because there's always money coming in that
he can use to pay the money going out.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:34.520
But that day we run into the problems we have
talked about today, the day that and we suddenly

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:41.680
have to hit the brakes-- then I can guarantee
you there would be more redemptions than incoming

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.260
investors.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.730
And when that happens, you don't want to have
a mismatch between assets, and liabilities.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:54.360
And therefore, I cannot warn investors strongly
enough about this risk.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:00.610
I learned in 2008 that this is the easiest
way to lose your shirt in these markets--

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.320
if there is a mismatch.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.650
And therefore, only invest in things that
are properly matched when it comes to assets

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:12.890
and liabilities.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:21.370
The problem we have today is that investors
think that the sort of returns we have delivered

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:29.400
or we have received since the start of the
great bull market is sort of the norm.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.540
And that's what we should expect going forward.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.060
Nothing could be further from the truth.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:40.510
So rule number one if we don't want to disappoint
ourselves, is be realistic.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.520
Look at the long-term.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:48.300
Look at what sort of returns have equities
delivered over the long-term, and not just

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:55.230
in the last 35 years, that have been extraordinarily
benign for global equities.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:01.610
Secondly, construct your portfolio with the
little twists and tweaks that we have talked

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.980
about today.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.800
If you do that, I think you can do more than
2% to 3% per annum.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.910
You can probably do 5%, 6%, 7% per annum.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:45.830
And that should be enough not to make you
too depressed.
