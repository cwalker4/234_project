00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.579
BUT IT DIDN’T WORK.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.047
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:02.648
NOTE, THESE TACTICS DIDN’T WORK.

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:03.683
&gt;&gt; Laura: PEOPLE NEED TO PAY,

00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:05.385
YOU DON’T WANT TO GO THROUGH

00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:05.818
THIS AGAIN.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.820
&gt;&gt; WE’RE PREPARED TO GO THROUGH

00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.056
IT AGAIN, THEY AREN’T GOING TO

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:10.823
INTIMIDATE US AND TELL US HOW TO

00:06:10.824 --> 00:06:12.225
VOTE.

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:13.860
THEY HELPED US WIN THIS VOTE.

00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:15.862
THEIR TACTICS ACTUALLY HELPED US

00:06:15.863 --> 00:06:16.663
UNIFY OUR PEOPLE AND WIN THIS

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:17.997
VOTE.

00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:19.299
THEY’RE GOING TO HELP US WIN A

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.033
MONTH FROM NOW ON NOVEMBER 6,

00:06:20.034 --> 00:06:21.735
TOO.

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:22.869
&gt;&gt; Laura: DO YOU THINK YOU’LL

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.470
PICK UP SENATE SEATS?

00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:24.938
&gt;&gt; I HOPE SO.

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:25.672
THIS UNDERSCORES HOW IMPORTANT

00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:27.107
IT IS.

00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:28.308
WE HAVE A CLOSE MARGIN.

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.577
VERY CLOSE MARGIN.

00:06:30.578 --> 00:06:31.711
I’D LIKE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA

00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:33.013
REPUBLICAN SENATORS.

00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:34.347
&gt;&gt; Laura: LET’S TALK ABOUT THE

00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:35.782
MEDIA’S ROLE IN ALL OF THIS,

00:06:35.783 --> 00:06:37.384
AMPLIFYING CHARGES.

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:39.786
WE HAD ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO

00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:41.788
PLAY FROM SUSAN COLLINS WHEN SHE

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.690
TALKED ABOUT THE RAPE ROOMS AND
PLAY FROM SUSAN COLLINS WHEN SHE

00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:45.757
TALKED ABOUT THE RAPE ROOMS AND

00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:45.425
THESE WORDS THAT WERE BEING

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:46.760
THROWN AROUND AGAINST THIS

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:47.227
ESTEEMED JUDGE.

00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:50.097
LET’S WATCH.

00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:52.566
&gt;&gt; THE ALLEGATIONS THAT WHEN HE

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:55.669
WAS A TEENAGER JUDGE KAVANAUGH

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.005
DRUGGED MULTIPLE GIRLS AND USED

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:01.708
THEIR WEAKENED STATE TO

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:05.646
FACILITATE GANG RAPE.

00:07:05.647 --> 00:07:09.049
THIS OUTLANDISH ALLEGATION, WAS

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.386
PUT FORTH WITHOUT ANY CREDIBLE

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:14.688
SUPPORTING EVIDENCE AND SIMPLY

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:15.389
PARROTED PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.124
OTHERS.

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.426
&gt;&gt; Laura: INCLUDING THE MEDIA,

00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:20.194
CELEBRITY PORN LAWYER.

00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:21.295
&gt;&gt; I CAN REMEMBER WHEN THAT SORT

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:25.466
OF THING WAS NOT PUT ON THE AIR.
&gt;&gt; I CAN REMEMBER WHEN THAT SORT

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:27.600
OF THING WAS NOT PUT ON THE AIR.

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:28.269
PEOPLE DIDN’T JUST PEDDLE

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.971
NONSENSE WITH NO CORROBORATION.

00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:32.106
THAT EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM.

00:07:32.107 --> 00:07:34.242
A LOT OF SENATE DEMOCRATS WOULD

00:07:34.243 --> 00:07:35.009
MAINSTREAM THAT STUFF RIGHT INTO
A LOT OF SENATE DEMOCRATS WOULD

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.143
MAINSTREAM THAT STUFF RIGHT INTO

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.310
THEIR DISCUSSIONS.

00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:38.012
AND TRY TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY

00:07:38.013 --> 00:07:39.280
THAT IT SOMEHOW HAPPENED.

00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:40.314
NO CORROBORATION AT ALL.

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:41.883
JUST RUMORS.

00:07:41.884 --> 00:07:44.552
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:47.488
&gt;&gt; Laura: SENATOR MURKLEY FROM

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:50.091
OREGON WAS UPSET, AND SAID THIS.

00:07:50.092 --> 00:07:52.093
&gt;&gt; CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE CHAIR OF
OREGON WAS UPSET, AND SAID THIS.

00:07:52.094 --> 00:07:54.160
&gt;&gt; CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE CHAIR OF

00:07:52.094 --> 00:07:54.128
THE COMMITTEE, AND MITCH

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.466
McCONNELL, THE MAJORITY LEADER.

00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:00.135
[BOOING]

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:02.170
THEY SAID THERE’S NO

00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:03.171
CONTEMPORANEOUS EVIDENCE TO

00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:04.806
SUPPORT THE WOMEN WHO CAME

00:08:04.807 --> 00:08:05.573
FORWARD.

00:08:05.574 --> 00:08:08.943
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:10.312
&gt;&gt; Laura: WELL, WHAT ARE WE

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:11.046
MISSING HERE, SENATOR?

00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:11.713
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW WHAT HE’S

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:15.350
TALKING ABOUT.

00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:16.651
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO

00:08:16.652 --> 00:08:18.954
CORROBORATE ANY OF THE

00:08:18.955 --> 00:08:19.588
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDGE

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:21.356
KAVANAUGH.

00:08:21.357 --> 00:08:22.357
MAYBE HE’S ON A DIFFERENT

00:08:22.358 --> 00:08:23.859
PLANET, NOT SURE.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.327
&gt;&gt; Laura: RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU

00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:26.762
LOOK BACK ON THIS LAST, YOU

00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:28.030
KNOW, COUPLE OF WEEKS AND YOU

00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:31.533
HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE RUN OF

00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:32.834
CONFIRMING CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES,

00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:33.402
DISTRICT JUDGES.

00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:34.770
BUT THIS EXPERIENCE, LESSONS

00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:37.439
LEARNED FOR THE REPUBLICAN

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.107
PARTY, THE SENATE, MAYBE THE

00:08:39.108 --> 00:08:41.276
PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD.

00:08:41.277 --> 00:08:43.912
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE HAVE REAFFIRMED IN

00:08:43.913 --> 00:08:46.849
THIS COUNTRY YOU’RE PRESUMED

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.817
INNOCENT, THE PRESUMPTION IS IN

00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:50.419
FAVOR OF INNOCENCE.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.954
WE ALSO RELEARNED THAT YOU

00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:54.089
CAN’T -- YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.926
MOBS TO INTIM DATE YOU.

00:08:56.927 --> 00:08:59.328
AND I THINK A GOOD LESSON FOR

00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:00.696
US EXCITED ABOUT THE NOVEMBER

00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:02.465
US, UNIFIED THE CONFERENCE, MADE

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:03.632
ELECTION, WAS GOOD FOR THE

00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:04.967
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THAT

00:09:04.968 --> 00:09:06.135
THESE PEOPLE WERE STOOD UP TO

00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:06.869
AND THEY DIDN’T GET AWAY WITH

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.403
IT.

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:08.337
THEY DID NOT WIN.

00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:10.439
THAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.274
&gt;&gt; Laura: HOW RADICAL HAS THE

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:13.876
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF TODAY

00:09:13.877 --> 00:09:14.210
BECOME?

00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:15.611
&gt;&gt; PRETTY WILD BUNCH.

00:09:15.612 --> 00:09:17.280
PRETTY CLEAR THEY WERE WILLING

00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.148
TO DO ANYTHING, SAY ANYTHING, TO

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:21.017
TRY AND WIN.

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:23.619
NO BOUNDARIES.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.654
&gt;&gt; Laura: YOU STILL HAVE CLOSE

00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:25.855
FRIENDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS

00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:27.290
AFTER THIS OR EMOTIONS RAW?

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:28.691
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE’LL GET PAST IT IN

00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:31.828
TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS.

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:33.129
BUT IT WAS A TOUGH PERIOD.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.797
A TOUGH PERIOD.

00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:36.699
I HOPE THEY LEARNED A LESSON.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.134
THAT YOU CAN DO THIS KIND OF

00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:39.236
THING BUT IT DOESN’T NECESSARILY
