00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:10.002
&gt;&gt; Martha: JOINED ME NOW FOR

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:11.371
PART TWO OF MY EXCLUSIVE EXIT

00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:12.105
INTERVIEW WITH CONGRESSMAN TREY

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:16.309
GOWDY, WHO IS OPENING UP ABOUT

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.910
LIFE BEYOND THE BELTWAY.

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:18.211
WATCH.

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:19.545
&gt;&gt; Martha: AS YOU GET READY TO

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:21.247
MAKE THIS HUGE CHANGE IN YOUR

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:22.682
LIFE AND LEAVE WASHINGTON, ONE

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:25.084
OF THE THINGS YOU WILL BE

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:26.619
REMEMBERED FOR ARE SOME PRETTY

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.320
TESTY EXCHANGES YOU HAD WITH

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:29.355
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT WE ARE

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.523
SITTING IN.

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:34.127
ONE OF THEM WAS WITH PETER

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:34.460
STRZOK.

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.230
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF

00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:38.197
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WERE YOU

00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:38.531
CORRECT?

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:40.933
&gt;&gt; I DON'T RECALL WRITING THAT

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:41.234
TEXT.

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.703
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT TEXT

00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:46.139
IN NO WAY SUGGESTED THAT I OR

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.408
THE FBI WOULD TAKE ANY ACTION TO

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.345
INFLUENCE THE CANDIDACY OF --

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:55.615
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A FANTASTIC ANSWER TO

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:56.215
A QUESTION NOBODY ASKED.

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:57.216
IF YOU WANT TO REPRESENT WHAT

00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:58.217
YOU SAID ACCURATELY, I'M HAPPY

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:00.119
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I AM

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.856
NOT APPRECIATING --

00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:06.526
&gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:06.926
APPRECIATE.

00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:09.195
I DON'T APPRECIATE HAVING AN FBI

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:10.897
AGENT WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:13.599
AMOUNT OF ANIMUS WORKING ON A

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.333
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 2016.

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:17.036
&gt;&gt; Martha: IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:17.703
YOU LIKED HIM VERY MUCH.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:20.940
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE A KEEN OBSERVER OF

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:25.478
HUMAN NATURE.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.015
AN FBI AGENT I WORKED WITH, WHEN

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:36.756
I THINK OF THE FBI, I THINK OF

00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:38.491
GUYS WHO NEVER, EVER WOULD HAVE

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:39.425
SETTLED ON THE THINGS THAT PETER

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:40.960
STRZOK SAID OR DID.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:41.961
HE IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FBI

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.729
THAT I WORKED WITH, AND HE IS

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.465
NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FBI THAT

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:49.335
YOU AND I DESERVE.

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:50.369
MY ONLY REAL REGRET IS THAT I

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.706
WASN'T TOUGHER ON HIM.

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:56.042
&gt;&gt; Martha: WITH REGARD TO YOUR

00:01:56.043 --> 00:01:57.310
EXCHANGES WITH JAMES COMEY, YOU

00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:58.077
ASKED HIM ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON,

00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:01.781
WHETHER OR NOT SHE HAD SENT

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:03.149
CLASSIFIED EMAILS, WHETHER OR

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.117
NOT THOUSANDS OF THOSE APPEARED

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:06.118
TO HAVE DISAPPEARED.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.853
&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON SAID THERE

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:11.557
WAS NOTHING MARK CLASSIFIED ON

00:02:11.558 --> 00:02:12.725
THE EMAIL SHE SENT OR RECEIVED.

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:13.159
IS THAT YOUR?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.128
&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT TRUE.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.129
SECRETARY CLINTON SAID ALL

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.531
WORK-RELATED EMAILS WERE SENT

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:19.899
BACK TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.334
IS THAT YOUR?

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:22.335
&gt;&gt; NO, WE FOUND THOUSANDS OF

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.237
WORK-RELATED EMAILS THAT WERE

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:26.706
NOT RETURNED.

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:29.575
&gt;&gt; DID HER LAWYERS READ THE

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:32.078
EMAIL CONTENT INDIVIDUALLY?

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.079
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.681
&gt;&gt; IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:36.482
BECAUSE I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH

00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:37.216
UP TOMORROW AFTERNOON, I'M NOT

00:02:37.217 --> 00:02:40.653
GOING TO GO THROUGH ANY MORE THE

00:02:40.654 --> 00:02:41.153
FALSE STATEMENTS.

00:02:41.154 --> 00:02:42.421
&gt;&gt; Martha: HE FELT HE DID NOT

00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:43.789
DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.524
THAT, AND YOU TRY TO GET HIM TO

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:47.727
ADMIT THAT IN THIS ROOM.

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:50.730
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE FAIR, IT IS

00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:52.532
ALWAYS EASY TO LOOK BACK AND SEE

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.133
WHAT AN INVESTIGATOR SHOULD HAVE

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:54.433
DONE.

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:56.736
I WILL ALWAYS BE TROUBLED BY THE

00:02:56.737 --> 00:02:59.205
FACT THAT HE WAS DRAFTING AN

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:07.079
EXONERATION MEMO BEFORE 24 WHICH

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.215
NOTICES                  24

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:09.916
WITNESSES HAVE BEEN INTERVIEW,

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:10.349
INCLUDING HER.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.083
I WILL ALWAYS BE TROUBLED BY THE

00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:11.751
FACT THAT HER CHIEF OF STAFF

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:12.451
SAID BEFORE THE INTERVIEW THAT

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:13.119
THE ONLY CRIME SHE COULD BE

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.719
CHARGED WITH HIS FALSE

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.086
STATEMENT.

00:03:14.087 --> 00:03:14.787
THEY'D ALREADY MADE UP THEIR

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:15.087
MINDS.

00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:17.957
WE WILL NEVER SURVIVE IF PEOPLE

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.525
THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENT

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:20.226
JUSTICE FOR THE RICH AND THE

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:23.095
FAMOUS ON THE POWERFUL THEN FOR

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:24.764
SOME PRIVATE IN THE ARMY WHO MAY

00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:26.299
HAVE ALSO MISHANDLED CLASSIFIED

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.699
INFORMATION.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:38.044
THE BEAUTY OF US IS THAT LADY

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:38.644
LIBERTY DOES NOT WEAR A

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:39.011
BLINDFOLD.

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:39.645
&gt;&gt; Martha: DO YOU THINK HE

00:03:39.646 --> 00:03:40.079
WENT TOO HARD?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.646
&gt;&gt; A COUPLE, HONESTLY.

00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:41.347
NOT THAT I WENT TOO HARD.

00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:46.485
THERE WAS A DHS HEARING ON VISAS

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:48.754
AND THERE WAS A SECOND AMENDMENT

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:52.959
COMPONENT TO IT, AND IT IS NOT

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.994
THE WOMAN'S FAULT THAT THEY SENT

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:56.128
HER.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.930
I NEVER RAISED MY VOICE, IT'S

00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:00.066
JUST, IN HINDSIGHT, WAS SHE THE

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:01.400
BEST WITNESS FOR ME TO USE, TO

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:03.202
QUIZ ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE

00:04:03.203 --> 00:04:04.604
IS ANY OTHER FACT PATTERN WHERE

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:05.538
THE GOVERNMENT TAKES YOUR RIGHT

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.541
AND YOU HAVE TO PETITION?

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:12.311
IT IS GOOD TO REMEMBER --

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:13.546
ACTUALLY, IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE A

00:04:13.547 --> 00:04:15.481
WIFE AND KIDS, AND IT'S GOOD TO

00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:18.184
REMEMBER THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:18.618
FAMILIES, TOO.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:20.386
AND WHILE THIS MAY BE A SPORT

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:22.488
FOR SOME OF US AND WE CAN GO EAT

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:24.023
DINNER THAT NIGHT AND I'LL GET

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:26.492
OUR FEELINGS HURT, BUT FOR OF

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:28.027
THE WITNESSES, THIS WILL BE

00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:29.328
THEIR ONLY MOMENT ON YOUTUBE.

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:31.897
IT WILL BE THE ONLY MOMENT ON

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:34.266
TELEVISION, AND DID YOU TREAT

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:34.667
THEM FAIRLY?

00:04:34.668 --> 00:04:38.404
AND I THINK ON BALANCE, I DID,

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:41.440
OR I TRY TO, AND THERE WERE A

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.174
COUPLE OF OCCASIONS WHERE IF I

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:42.908
HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN I

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.511
WOULD'VE ASKED THE SAME

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:47.079
QUESTIONS BUT IT WOULD'VE

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.447
DIRECTED IT TO ANOTHER WITNESS.

00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:50.116
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU ARE LEAVING

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:51.484
WASHINGTON, IN PART, BECAUSE YOU

00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:52.985
SUGGESTED THERE IS A FRUSTRATION

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:54.220
WITH THE WAY THINGS WORK HERE.

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.722
WHAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW?

00:04:56.723 --> 00:04:59.992
&gt;&gt; HUMAN NATURE.

00:04:59.993 --> 00:05:04.230
THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IS THAT

00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:06.465
COMPROMISE HAS AN INCREDIBLY

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:07.800
SMALL CONSTITUENCY AND WE HAVE

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:12.371
BOUGHT INTO THE NOTION THAT YOU

00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:15.474
CAN MAKE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE

00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:16.909
WITH 51% OF YOUR FELLOW

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.276
CITIZENS.

00:05:17.277 --> 00:05:18.010
DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:18.310
TOUGH.

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:19.745
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH, BUT

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:20.513
I DON'T THINK IT IS SUPPOSED TO

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:24.550
BE DYSFUNCTIONAL.

00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.520
WHEN I MENTIONED HUMAN NATURE, I

00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:29.922
WOULD LIKE TO SEE US APPLY THE

00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:30.990
SAME RULES TO OUR FRIENDS AS WE

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:33.659
DO TO OUR ENEMIES.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.361
IF WE WERE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT

00:05:35.362 --> 00:05:36.228
THIS ADMINISTRATION DOING

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.964
SOMETHING, WE SHOULD BE EQUALLY

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:39.699
CURIOUS WHEN OUR OWN

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.168
ADMINISTRATION DOES IT, AND WHEN

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.071
WINNING BECOMES THE ULTIMATE

00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:46.505
OBJECTIVE, THEN YOU BECOME A

00:05:46.506 --> 00:05:47.506
RELATIVIST, AND I DON'T WANT TO

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.408
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE DOING

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.709
THAT.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.309
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT WAS THE

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.579
MESSAGE OF THE MIDTERMS?

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.013
&gt;&gt; OH, BOY.

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:59.618
UNMET EXPECTATIONS...

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.089
CAREFUL HOW YOU FRAME ISSUES,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.794
RHETORIC MATTERS.

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:09.528
I THINK IF YOU WERE TO LAY OUT A

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:10.262
POLICY POSITION OF REPUBLICANS,

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:12.131
I THINK YOU WOULD FIND MAY BE

00:06:12.132 --> 00:06:13.132
HALF AND A SLIGHTLY MORE THAN

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:13.833
HALF WOULD SAY, OKAY, WE ARE

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:15.901
WITH YOU.

00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:19.071
WHEN YOU FACTOR IN HOW WE COME

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:20.072
ACROSS SOMETIMES, I THINK

00:06:20.073 --> 00:06:25.444
PARTICULARLY AMONG FEMALE VOTER

00:06:25.445 --> 00:06:26.879
VOTERS, THEY SAY, I DON'T CARE

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.680
HOW GOOD YOUR IDEAS ARE, YOU

00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.015
DON'T SEEM LIKE A VERY GOOD

00:06:30.016 --> 00:06:30.850
PERSON.

00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:33.819
I THINK WHAT YOU BELIEVE AND HOW

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.954
YOU COMMUNICATE IT ARE EQUALLY

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:37.189
IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO DO MUCH

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.924
BETTER JOB OF HOW WE

00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:39.325
COMMUNICATE.

00:06:39.326 --> 00:06:40.626
&gt;&gt; Martha: ANY REGRETS ABOUT

00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:41.927
YOUR DECISION TO LEAVE?

00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:43.562
&gt;&gt; NO MA'AM.

00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:43.863
NINE.

00:06:43.864 --> 00:06:44.530
&gt;&gt; Martha: &gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT

00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:46.332
IS NEXT FOR YOU?

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:48.901
&gt;&gt; I WILL PRACTICE LAW IN A FIRM

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:50.169
AT SOUTH CAROLINA THAT I HAVE A

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.470
HISTORY WITH, AND MORE

IMPORTANTLY WITH TWO LAWYERS

00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:55.074

00:06:55.075 --> 00:06:56.275
LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I AM TO

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:58.477

00:06:58.478 --> 00:06:59.512
THINGS WITH MATTERS TO ME EVERY

00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:00.713
BIT AS MUCH AS WHAT I DO, AND

00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:03.949
WHEN YOU FIND PEOPLE OF

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.683
UNASSAILABLE CHARACTER THAT YOU

00:07:04.684 --> 00:07:08.020
ENJOY BEING AROUND, I WOULD

00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:10.356
RATHER DIG DITCHES THAN PRACTICE

00:07:10.357 --> 00:07:12.324
LAW WITH PEOPLE THAT I DON'T

00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:13.893
KNOW AND LIKE AND RESPECT.

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:15.494
WE ARE GOING TO PRACTICE LAW,

00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:17.530
I'M GOING TO SHOCK THE WORLD AND

00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:19.899

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.332

00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:22.868
&gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY ABOUT HIM, HE'S A

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.137
LOT MORE INTERESTING THAN I AM.

00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:26.772
BUT I THINK -- JIM WANTS TO ASK

00:07:26.773 --> 00:07:28.908
ME A BOOK ABOUT HOW TO ASK

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:29.275
QUESTIONS.

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:32.511
HOW TO ELICIT THE TRUTH WITH

00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:33.746
ASKING QUESTIONS, AND I WANT HIM

00:07:33.747 --> 00:07:38.083
TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT HIS LIFE

00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:43.522
AND HOW HIS UPBRINGING

00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:44.123
INFLUENCED HIS POLITICAL

00:07:44.124 --> 00:07:44.523
ORTHODOXY.

00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:46.492
TO ME AND I TAUGHT A CLASS AT

00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:48.527
CLEMSON FOR STUDENTS.

00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:49.895
HE'S GREAT, HE'S THE NICEST

00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:51.931
TEACHER IN THE WORLD AND I --

00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:55.301
&gt;&gt; Martha: AM NOT?

00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:57.169
&gt;&gt; WELL, THESE ARE FRESHMAN IN

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.503
COLLEGE.

00:07:57.504 --> 00:07:58.103
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

00:07:58.104 --> 00:08:00.172
SOCRATIC METHOD IS.

00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:01.407
I'VE GOT TO DIAL IT BACK A

00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:03.709
LITTLE BIT.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.811
AND BE A BETTER HUSBAND, A

00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:06.245
BETTER FATHER.

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:07.046
BOTH OF OUR KIDS ARE AT HOME NOW

00:08:07.047 --> 00:08:08.681
AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE

00:08:08.682 --> 00:08:09.281
STARTING THEIR CAREERS.

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:11.550
I THINK OUR DAUGHTER IS GOING TO

00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:13.085
GO TO LAW SCHOOL, GOD SAVE US

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:14.253
ALL IF THAT HAPPENS.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:17.056
MY SON FINISHED LAW SCHOOL, BUT

00:08:17.057 --> 00:08:18.290
HE IS GOING TO GO INTO

00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.091
REAL ESTATE.

00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:21.393
JUST BE A BETTER HUSBAND, A

00:08:21.394 --> 00:08:21.827
BETTER FATHER.

00:08:21.828 --> 00:08:23.696
I'VE GOT ONE-THIRD OF LIFE.

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:25.497
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU SAID ONCE A

00:08:25.498 --> 00:08:27.199
FEDERAL JUDGESHIP CHECKED ALL OF

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.067
YOUR BOXES.

00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:29.535
IS THAT STILL TRUE?

00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:31.503
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM, IT DID.

00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:32.271
LINDSAY AND TIM PLAYED IT RIGHT

00:08:32.272 --> 00:08:33.505
IN FRONT OF ME.

00:08:33.506 --> 00:08:36.141
THEY SAID, WE HAVE TWO OPENINGS.

00:08:36.142 --> 00:08:37.142
DO YOU WANT TO?

00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:38.143
THE PERSON WHO KNOWS ME THE BEST

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:40.913
IN LIFE, WHO ALSO DOESN'T FOLLOW

00:08:40.914 --> 00:08:42.314
POLITICS, IS MY WIFE.

00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:44.717
SHE SAID, YOU WILL BE LONELY,

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:46.018
YOU LIKE BEING AROUND PEOPLE.

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:50.589
YOU LIKE BEING AN ADVOCATE, AND

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.891
I SAID THANKS BUT NO THANKS, AND

00:08:51.892 --> 00:08:53.259
THEN LINDSAY CALLED BACK AND

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.593
SAID, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING?

00:08:54.594 --> 00:08:56.829
IT'S WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.229
RIGHT HERE.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.764
AND THEN DON BEGAN CALLED, THE

00:08:58.765 --> 00:09:01.667
PRESIDENT'S FORMER LAWYER

00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:03.135
CALLED, AND HE SAID ARE YOU SUR?

00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:06.505
AND I SAID, NOT ONLY AM I SURE,

00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:06.972
I AM AT PEACE.

00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:10.910
THEY FILLED IT WITH A GUY I HAVE

00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:13.112

00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:14.480
FANTASTIC JUDGE AND A BREAK FOR

00:09:17.617 --> 00:09:18.083
&gt;&gt; NEVER.

00:09:18.084 --> 00:09:20.085
I WILL GET BACK INTO POLITICS IF

00:09:20.086 --> 00:09:21.453
TIM SCOTT RUNS FOR PRESIDENT,

00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:22.955
