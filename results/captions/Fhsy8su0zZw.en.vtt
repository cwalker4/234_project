Sen. Kamala Harris Mouths Off On Senate Floor Gets Wrecked By FBI Director Christopher Wray

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.429
Thank You director ray I want to thank
you and the men and women of your agency

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
for the work you do every day I think
I'm the only member of this committee

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
who is also a member of Senate Judiciary
Committee and I'd like to talk with you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.320
about the the Cavanaugh hearings so I
wanted I just want to be clear about how

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.360
the system works when the FBI was given
the direction to do the background

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
investigation as it related to dr.
Ford's allegations

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.070
that's an instruction that goes to the
FBI from the White House is that correct

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.690
not from the Senate that's correct
and when the FBI was directed than to do

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.360
that that investigation as it relates to
those specific allegations was the FBI

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.750
given full discretion or was the scope
of the investigation limited by the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.490
direction you received from the White
House well senator I want to be a little

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
bit careful what I can can talk about in
this setting I'm not asking you for the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
content of the Investing understood
understood there are MO use and other

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.420
things that go back aways the govern
this but I think it's important I would

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.770
say this it's important to understand
that the unlike most investigations like

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.250
the sort that you and I and Senator
Jones have all been familiar with

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.540
traditional Criminal Investigations
National Security Investigations a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.799
background investigation is very
different and that is done our only

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.720
Authority is as requested by the
adjudicating the White House in this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.310
case is the White House and I have a lot
to cover and so if we can be as succinct

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.790
as possible I appreciate it and I know
there was there a lot of details and I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.570
appreciate your point so in this
situation was your direction limited in

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.939
scope or were you given full direct
discretion to investigate whatever your

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.610
agency thought was appropriate to figure
out what happened I think I would say

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.770
that our investigation here are
supplemental update to the pre

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.850
his background investigation was limited
in scope and that that is consistent

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.110
with the standard process for such
investigations going back quite a long

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.930
ways and was did you receive this
directive in writing there's been lots

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.730
of communication between as is standard
between the FBI's Security Division and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.920
the White House's office and I would
expect that there would be written

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.510
communications but I can't speak to that
here can you find the direction and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.290
provide it to this committee the
documents I would have to see what would

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.240
be appropriate okay and who from the
White House communicated the directive

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.350
was I said the communication between the
FBI and the White House for nominations

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.910
including judicial nominations is
through the FBI's Security Division

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.450
which has background investigation
specialists and the White House Office

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.590
of security and that's where the
communication always is and I've spoken

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
with our background investigation
specialists and they have assured me

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.900
that this was handled in the way that is
consistent with their experience and the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.690
standard process did they did anyone in
your agency receive any direction about

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.930
the scope of the investigation directly
from Don again well I can't speak to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.820
what anybody throughout the organization
might have received instructions on my

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.030
understanding is that the communications
occurred between the White House's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.250
Office of Security and the FBI Security
Division do you know who determined that

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.260
the FBI would not interview judge
Cavanaugh or dr. Ford or the list of

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.080
40-plus witnesses again I would say what
I said at the beginning which is as is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.270
standard the investigation was very
specific in scope limited in scope and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.520
that that is the usual process and that
my folks have assured me that the usual

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.380
process was followed and did the FBI
look into allegations as to whether

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.970
Judge Cavanaugh lied to Congress during
his testimony that's not something I

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.140
could discuss here thank you thank you
god bless you and God bless america
