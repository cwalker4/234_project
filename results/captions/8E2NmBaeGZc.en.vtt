CAN YOU DO A GOOD IMPRESSION OF
LEAH RINLI.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.068
&gt;&gt; NO, SHE THINKS SHE IS DOES.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:21.207 align:start position:0%

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.091 align:start position:0%
TIME.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:16.762 size:88% position:44%
NOW LEAH, TELL ME, I IMAGINE
BEING A DEAR CLOSE FRIEND OF

J.LOS COMES WITH SOME SORT OF
INTRUSION ON YOUR LIFE WHAT IS

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.200
IT LIKE WHEN ARE YOU CONSTANTLY
BEING SURROUNDED BY PAPARAZZI

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:24.704 size:88% position:44%
AND THINGS LIKE, THAT IS IT
INSANE TO BE IN A FRIENDSHIP

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:25.772 align:start position:0%
LIKE THAT.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.941 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS, CUZ
I WAS THE PROTECTER.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.676 size:81% position:41%
I FELL LIKE HER PROTECTER.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.078 align:start position:0%
AND WE WENT SHOPPING OR

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.312 align:start position:0%

ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN 20 PAPARAZZI

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.252 size:81% position:41%
PULLING U-TURN AND PUTTING
PEOPLE'S LIVES IN DANGER.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.087 size:81% position:41%
SO I BECOME HER PROTECTER.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.888 size:84% position:42%
AND ST LIKE A ONE-MAN SHOW.

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
I'M LITERALLY IN THE CAR PULLING
U-TURNS AND MY [BLEEP], LIKE

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.596 align:start position:0%
[BLEEP] OR THIS OR THAT, I'M
SWEATING.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.132 align:start position:0%
I PUT MAKEUP ON BECAUSE I KNEW I
WOULD PROBABLY BE FOLLOWED

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:57.136 align:start position:0%
TRYING TO GET TAPONS OR
WHATEVER.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.404 size:75% position:38%

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:00.773

&gt;&gt; LIKE OH, DOUCHEBAG, BUT IN IS
A WHOLE OTHER LIFE, RIGHT, AND

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.916 align:start position:0%
THEN I LOOK OVER AT HER LIKE I'M
SWEATING.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
MY MAKEUP IS-- AND SHE'S JUST
LIKE, YOU KNOW, SCROLLING

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.790 align:start position:0%
THROUGH INSTAGRAM OR JUST NO
CARE IN THE WORLD.

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:20.493 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; James: I GUESS IT IS JUST
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:23.863 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU GET USED TO IT AND YOU
HOPE NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:24.830
MOST TIMES EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.031 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; James: SURE.

00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:29.468 align:start position:0%
DO YOU THINK, CUZ CELEBRITY
CULTURE HAS CHANGED A GREAT DEAL

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.270
LIKE IN THE AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:32.504 align:start position:0%
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.308
DO YOU THINK IT'S WORSE NOW OR
WAS IT WORSE WHEN EVERYTHING WAS

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.876 align:start position:0%
JUST ABOUT TABLOIDS?

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.444 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S BOTH.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:43.582
I HATED WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
VOICE, JUST TAB LOISD, YOU WERE

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.786
JUST GETTING KIND OF ALL OF THIS
NEGATIVE, CRAPPY INFORMATION ALL

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.054 align:start position:0%
THE TIME.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.755
NOW AT LEAST YOU GET TO KNOW US
A LITTLE MORE ON SOCIAL MED WHAT

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:51.891 align:start position:0%
BUS WE GET TO SPEAK FOR
OURSELVES.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.260 size:84% position:42%
AND I LIKE THE INTERACTION.

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:56.529
BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY
MORE CHANNELS WITH THE INTERNET

00:04:56.562 --> 00:05:00.599
THERE ARE SO MANY MORE WROWTD
LET'S, IT IS MORE PAPARAZZI.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:02.635
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR CONTENT, EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:03.836 align:start position:0%
LOOKING FOR CONTENT.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:08.974
SO YOU KNOW, IN A WAY IT WAS
WORSE AND NOW IT'S STILL WORSE.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:12.111
&gt;&gt; YOU GET TO SAY-- NO, BUT YOU
GET TO ANSWER, AND YOU GET TO

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.012 align:start position:0%
SAY, AND PEOPLE.

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:14.314 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT BETTER, FOR SURE,
