Oprah: OUR NEXT SESSION IS WITH A RHODES SCHOLAR,

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.720
A WHITE HOUSE FELLOW, AND A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.250
I FIRST MET WES MOORE SEVEN YEARS AGO ON THE "OPRAH" SHOW --

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.490
I MET SO MANY PEOPLE THERE.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.460
I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY HIM

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.430
THROUGH HIS INTENSELY PERSONAL WRITINGS

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.760
AND SO MUCH OF HIS OTHER WORK.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.200
HE SHINED AN UNFLINCHING LIGHT

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.770
ON HOW ENVIRONMENT AND CIRCUMSTANCE

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.570
AND PERSONAL WILL CAN SHAPE THE TRAJECTORY OF OUR LIVES.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.540
WES' SESSION IS TITLED

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.150
"THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR JOB...

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.250
AND YOUR WORK."

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.030
All: GOOD MORNING.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.600
IT IS A -- IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DISTINCT HONOR TO BE HERE.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.500
AND THIS MOMENT BRINGS ME BACK TO A MOMENT

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.170
THAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO WHEN I REMEMBER I WAS SITTING

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.680
ON THE NEW YORK SUBWAY -- THE TRAIN --

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.910
AND FOR THOSE OF Y'ALL WHO KNOW THE NEW YORK SUBWAY,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.750
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SARDINE CAN, YOU KNOW,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.150
EVERYBODY PACKED IN, RIGHT?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.490
BUT THIS TIME WAS ACTUALLY REALLY QUIET.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.520
AND THE REASON IT WAS REALLY QUIET

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.430
WAS BECAUSE IT WAS AROUND 10:30 AT NIGHT,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.530
AND SO THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THIS TRAIN.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.630
AND IT'S 10:30 AT NIGHT, AND I WAS JUST COMING BACK FROM MY JOB

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.440
THAT I HAD JUST SPENT 14 1/2 HOURS WORKING AT.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.840
THAT JOB WAS ON WALL STREET.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.780
THAT JOB WAS AN INVESTMENT BANKER, ALL RIGHT?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.880
WELL, I'D JUST COME ONBOARD, AND I WAS LEARNING ABOUT

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880
ALL THIS STUFF AND LEARNING ABOUT SWAPS

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.220
AND EXOTIC DERIVATIVES AND CONVERTIBLES --

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.120
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CAR AND IT WASN'T.

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.160
AND I WAS SO PROUD TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE THERE

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.660
BECAUSE IT WAS A SPACE

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.160
AND IT WAS A PLACE THAT EVERYBODY TOLD ME

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.130
IT WAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT PLACE TO BE.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.500
THAT EVERYONE TOLD ME HOW PROUD THEY WERE THAT I WAS THERE.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.970
WHEN THEY SAID, "YOU KNOW, THAT'S AMAZING

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.070
THAT YOU'RE DOING ALL THAT WORK AND YOU'RE DOING ALL THAT STUFF,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.110
STUFF THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS,"

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.580
AND I REMEMBER ONCE I HAD A CONVERSATION

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.910
WITH MY GRANDPARENTS.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.850
MY GRANDFATHER WAS A MINISTER UP IN THE SOUTH BRONX,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.380
AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A PUBLIC-SCHOOL TEACHER

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.550
FOR 28 YEARS.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.860
AND I REMEMBER ONCE, I WENT TO GO SEE THEM,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.360
AND I'M EATING ALL THESE JAMAICAN DELICACIES --

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.030
MY GRANDFATHER WAS FROM JAMAICA AND MY GRANDMOTHER

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.560
WAS BORN IN CUBA, CAME FROM JAMAICA --

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.730

AND MY GRANDFATHER KIND OF SAYS TO ME IN BETWEEN MY BITES,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.810
AND HE SAYS, "SO, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO?"

AND MY GRANDMOTHER KIND OF SAVED ME AND SHE STOPPED ME,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.820
AND SHE SAID, [Jamaican accent] "DEAR, YOU KNOW HE'S A BANKER."

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.260
[ Normal voice ] AND THEN SHE SAYS,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.660
"IN FACT, I WANT TO GO TELL MISS JOHNSON

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.690
TO GO DO HER CHECKS WITH HIM."

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.970
MISS JOHNSON WAS THEIR 80-YEAR-OLD NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.000
MISS JOHNSON AND THE CHECKS THAT MY GRANDMOTHER WAS TALKING

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.270
ABOUT WAS MISS JOHNSON'S SOCIAL-SECURITY CHECKS.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.480
MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.010
THAT IF MISS JOHNSON HANDED ME HER CHECK,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.410
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.850
MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IF MISS JOHNSON CAME DOWN

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.420
TO MY OFFICE TO HAND ME HER CHECK,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.120
SECURITY WOULDN'T HAVE LET HER INTO THE BUILDING.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.730
THAT WAS MY REALITY.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.130
THIS PLACE THAT EVERYONE WAS SO PROUD OF ME BEING THERE

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.370
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO DIFFERENT, SO FOREIGN,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.040
SO EXCITING FROM ANYTHING THEY HAD KNOWN BEFORE,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.610
AND ESPECIALLY WHY THAT MATTERS

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.610
IS HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHERE I CAME FROM

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.580
AND HOW FAR I CAME -- HOW FAR I'D COME.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.250
EXACTLY 13.2 MILES.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.160
BECAUSE 13.2 MILES FROM MY OFFICE

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.790
DOWN ON WALL STREET WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE BRONX

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.860
THAT I SPENT MUCH OF MY CHILDHOOD IN.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.670
13.2 MILES FROM MY OFFICE DOWN ON WALL STREET WAS A COMMUNITY

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.400
THAT WAS CHRONICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.510
AND THE SHAME ABOUT IT IS, FOR EVERYBODY WHO CAME UP

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.780
IN THAT COMMUNITY, WE KNEW IT.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.420
13.2 MILES FROM THAT OFFICE WAS A PLACE AND A SPACE

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.190
WHERE THIS IDEA OF HOPE AND THIS IDEA OF EXPECTATIONS

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.690
COMPLETELY PARALLELED ONE ANOTHER,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.100

ALL OF US FROM OUR COMMUNITIES --

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.760
THAT WE ARE NOT PRODUCTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTS,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.340
BUT THAT WE ARE PRODUCTS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.440
AND THAT THE EXECRATIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE OF OURSELVES

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.080
DON'T COME FROM NOWHERE.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.950
THEY COME FROM THE EXPECTATIONS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OF US,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.820
AND WE INTERNALIZE THEM AND WE MAKE THEM OUR OWN.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.120

...AND I PRAISE GOD FOR HER, I REALLY DO.

"OUR MOTHER WORE SWEATERS SO WE COULD WEAR COATS."

TO GO WORK AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.240

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.300
I FELT LIKE AT THAT MOMENT, LAURYN WAS SINGING TO ME.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.210
LIKE, SHE'S MY FIRST CELEBRITY CRUSH, RIGHT?

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.480
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.010
AND I'M LAYING ON THE COUCH...

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.250
AND LAURYN'S TALKING TO ME.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:44.420
WELL, I FELT LIKE I FOUND MYSELF SO OFTEN TRYING TO FIND MY PEACE

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.860
IN MY BUSINESS CARD.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.030
I FELT MYSELF TRYING TO FIND MY PEACE IN THE FACT THAT

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.070
WHEN I MET PEOPLE AND THEY ASKED ME WHAT I DID,

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.770
THAT HOPEFULLY THE ANSWER THAT I WOULD GIVE THEM WAS SOMETHING

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.000
THAT WAS INTERESTING ENOUGH FOR THEM

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.070
TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION,

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.710
INSTEAD OF FORGETTING MY NAME 30 SECONDS LATER.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.880
I FOUND MYSELF IN A PLACE WHERE I WAS BEING CALLED TO TASK

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:19.620
WHERE I WAS ACTUALLY VALUING MY WORTH BY MY EMPLOYER.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.590
"AND EVERY TIME I TRIED TO BE WHAT SOMEONE ELSE THOUGHT OF ME,

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.230
SO CAUGHT UP I WASN'T ABLE TO ACHIEVE.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.670
BUT DEEP IN MY HEART, THE ANSWER -- IT WAS IN ME.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:34.670
SO, I MADE UP MY MIND TO DEFINE MY OWN DESTINY."

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.980
DAVID GRAEBER'S AN ANTHROPOLOGIST,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.340
AND HE'S AN ACTIVIST.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.010
AND HE ONCE MADE A STATEMENT WHERE HE SAID,

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:46.980
"HUGE SWATHS OF OUR WORLD ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN JOBS

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.690
THAT THEY SECRETLY BELIEVE SHOULD NOT EVEN EXIST."

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.960
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.070
THE MORAL PAIN OF THAT REALITY IS SEVERE --

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.100
A SCAR ACROSS OUR COLLECTIVE SOUL.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.840
WHERE I FIND MYSELF TRYING TO FIND MY VALUE IN MY JOB,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.180
WHAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.520
WAS I NEEDED TO FIND MY VALUE IN MY WORK.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.020
AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE A JOB WAS MY OCCUPATION.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.360
MY WORK WAS WHEN MY GREATEST PASSIONS

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.690
BEGAN TO START OVERLAPPING WITH THE WORLD'S GREATEST NEEDS,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.570
AND I CHOSE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:40.200
I CHOSE TO START GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF FINDING MY WORK.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.210
AND SO, THE WORK THAT WE DO NOW

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.540
IS VERY MUCH A REACTION TO THAT PROCESS.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.310
THE WORK WE DO NOW IS VERY MUCH A REACTION TO THAT JOURNEY,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.580
BECAUSE ONE THING I BELIEVE ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE DO

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.150
IS THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO IS NOT SOMETHING --

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.580
THAT'S NOT A CONCLUSION.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.450
OUR WORK IS OUR JOURNEY.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.860
OUR WORK IS A PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW --

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.230
WHY WERE WE HERE,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.500
AND HOW DO WE THEN FULFILL THAT LANE

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.600
AND FULFILL THAT PURPOSE TO MAKE IT MEANINGFUL AND WORTHWHILE

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.340
THAT WE WERE EVER HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.340
AND SO, I THEN STARTED GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.910
AND STARTED STUDYING AND UNDERSTANDING,

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.240
AND I STARTED REALIZING

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.880
THAT ACTUALLY GOING AND FINDING MY WORK

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.680
REALLY CAME DOWN TO THREE DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.680
EVERY TIME I WANTED TO FIND MY WORK,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.810
I HAD TO GO TO THE I.C.U.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.520
RIGHT? NOT THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.920
FIRST THING I HAD TO DO WAS IDENTIFY, THEN I HAD TO CALCIFY,

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.690
AND THEN I HAD TO UNIFY.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.160
I HAD TO GO THROUGH MY I.C.U. TO FIND MY WORK.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.700
FIRST, IDENTIFY --

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.270
IDENTIFY THE FACT THAT YOUR WORK IS NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.240
SOMEONE COULD GIVE YOU THE MOST IMPASSIONED SPEECH

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.370
ABOUT WHY THIS THING IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.670
BUT IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.110
THAT MAKES YOUR HEART BEAT A LITTLE BIT FASTER,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.550
IT'S NOT YOUR WORK.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.150
YOU KNOW, I'LL HAVE PEOPLE -- WHETHER IT IS VETERAN'S ISSUES

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.620
OR WHETHER IT IS REFORMING THE CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.520
OR WHETHER YOUR ISSUE IS EDUCATION OR YOUTH OR SENIORS

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.320
OR THE ENVIRONMENT --

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.730
WHATEVER IT IS, THE IDENTIFICATION

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.830
OF YOUR WORK BECOMES A VERY PERSONAL PROCESS.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.830
I HAVE PEOPLE COME UP TO ME, IT'S LIKE, "WES, LISTEN.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.230
I COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.640

FOR BELIEVING IN THE EASTERN BAY OWL.

I THINK THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.080
IT'S NOT MY WORK.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.350
I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.820
IT'S JUST NOT MY WORK."

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820
THE IDENTIFICATION OF THAT THING

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.090
THAT MAKES YOUR HEART BEAT JUST A LITTLE BIT FASTER

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.000
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR WORK IS A VERY PERSONAL PROCESS.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.540
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE DAY.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.540
IT'S THE ISSUE OF YOUR LIFE.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.280
CALCIFY -- THAT THE GOAL IS NOT TO START SOMETHING,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.420
THE GOAL IS TO END SOMETHING.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.150
OFTENTIMES, WHEN PEOPLE COME UP TO ME, THEY'RE LIKE,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.850
"LISTEN, WES. YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING ABOUT STARTING

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.190
A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION."

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.990
THE VERY FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE I GIVE THEM

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.290
IS, "DON'T START A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION YET."

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.630
ALL RIGHT?

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.160
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OUT THERE, REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.000
AND YOUR DILIGENCE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.230
HERE'S THE TRUTH --

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.030
THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER 40,000 ORGANIZATIONS

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.870
IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW THAT SERVE VETERANS,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.980
WHAT WE CALL "VSOs" -- VETERAN SERVING ORGANIZATIONS.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.340
OVER 40,000 ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.450
CALL THEMSELVES VSOs.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.810
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW AS A PERSON

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.550
WHO WORKS VERY ACTIVELY ON THESE ISSUES,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:42.950
THERE ARE NOT 40,000 ISSUES THAT VETERANS FACE.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.620
BUT WE HAVE 40,000 VSOs WHO ARE ALL WORKING TO HELP THIS CAUSE.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.160
MY POINT IS THIS --

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.200
YOUR GOAL SHOULD NEVER BE TO START SOMETHING.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.970
YOUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO END IT.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.840
AND SOMETIMES, THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.270
FOUNDING SOMETHING --

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.540
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PULLING SOMETHING TOGETHER,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.180
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, I KNOW PEOPLE

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.950
WHO BRING THEIR WORK TO THEIR JOB EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.020
I THINK OF MY MAN DEREK, WHO'S A BARBER,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.550
OVER IN WEST BALTIMORE, WHO CAME UP

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.620
IN ONE OF THE TOUGHEST AREAS IN WEST BALTIMORE,

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.120
WHO NOW STILL HAS HIS BUSINESS

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.730
IN ONE OF THE TOUGHEST AREAS OF WEST BALTIMORE.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.930
NOW, HIS JOB IS THAT HE'S A BARBER.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.930
HIS WORK IS THAT HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION,

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.170
PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG BOYS

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.440
AND PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG BOYS OF COLOR.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.100
SO, WHEN THEY COME INTO HIS BARBER SHOP,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.670
AND IT'S ALL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.840
IF YOU COME INTO MR. DEREK'S BARBER SHOP

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.840
AND YOU BRING A BOOK,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.920
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A FREE CUT.  

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.080
I THINK ABOUT PEOPLELIKE YOLANDA, WHO HER JOB --

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.720
SHE'S A MAKEUP ARTIST AND SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL MAKEUP ARTIST,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.720
BUT HER WORK IS HELPING WOMEN

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.530
WHO ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.460
AND WHAT SHE DOES IS SHE TAKES HER TALENTS

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.900
AND SHE TAKES HER GIFTS

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.870
AND SHE WILL NOT JUST PHYSICALLY HELP,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.370
BUT ALSO MORALLY AND SPIRITUALLY HELP WOMEN WHO,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.710
AT THAT TIME AND AT THAT MOMENT,

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.340
MIGHT BE AT THE LOWEST POINTS OF THEIR LIVES,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.250
AND REMIND THEM OF JUST HOW BEAUTIFUL AND WORTHY THEY ARE

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:18.450
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE TRIED TO ROB THAT FROM THEM.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.790
I THINK ABOUT WOMEN LIKE LISA,

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:25.190
WHO WORKS AS A CORPORATE ATTORNEY.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.400
BUT HER WORK ARE VETERANS,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.000
AND SO SHE GOES AROUND HER OFFICE

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.370
AND GOES TO ALL THE BIG CORPORATE LAWYERS WHO HAVE SUITS

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.200
THAT THEY PROBABLY HAVEN'T WORN IN YEARS,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.700
AND SHE GOES AND COLLECTS SUITS,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.870
SHIRTS, BELTS, TIES, ET CETERA, AND THEN SHE GIVES THEM

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.840
AND WORKS WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT ARE MAKING SURE THAT

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.110
AS VETERANS ARE TRANSITIONING OUT

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.710
AND GOING TO LOOK FOR JOBS,

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.320
THAT THEY CAN COME OUT AND LOOK THE PART

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.220
WHEN THEY'RE GOING FOR THEIR JOB INTERVIEWS.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.160
THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT STARTING SOMETHING,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.390
BUT IT'S ABOUT ENDING SOMETHING.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.490
AND THE THIRD THING, THE "U," IS UNIFY --

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.970
THIS IDEA THAT THE PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE TRYING TO HELP,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.000
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE CONVERSATION

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.040
AND NOT JUST SUBJECTS OF THE CONVERSATION.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.540
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER ONCE WORKING WITH A UNIVERSITY

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.810
WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THEY'RE GONNA DO

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.550
INSIDE THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY CALL HOME.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.680
AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WE HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.180
WHO ARE WORKING ON OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE,"

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.020
AND THEY STARTED PUTTING ALL THESE NAMES.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.520
"AND WE HAVE THE FOREMOST EXPERTS IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT,"

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.720
DR. SO-AND-SO AND SO-AND-SO."

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.830
AND I SAID, "MAN, THAT SOUNDS GREAT."

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.530
AND I SAID, "HOW MANY PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.200
DO YOU HAVE ON YOUR WORKING GROUP?"

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.830
AND THEY KIND OF LOOKED AT EACH OTHER,

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:44.000
AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WELL, WE HAVE DR. SO-AND-SO TO..."

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.270
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.270
IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING SURE THAT OTHER PEOPLE

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.640
ARE INVOLVED IN THAT CONVERSATION,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.440
PARTICULARLY THE PEOPLE WHERE YOUR WORK OVERLAPS

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.480
AND YOUR WORK ALIGNS,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.650
YOUR ALTRUISM WILL BE SEEN AS SOMETHING ELSE.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:06.590
YOUR ALTRUISM WILL BE SEEN AS PATERNALISM.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.460
WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.670
OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF OUR WORK,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.510
IT COMES WITH A SPACE, AND IT COMES WITH AN URGENCY.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.010
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS COMING UP

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.140
AND I WAS SENT OFF TO MILITARY SCHOOL --

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.580
MY MOTHER THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA, FOR SOME REASON.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.450
IT WAS, MAMA.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.190
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.020
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD THIS COLONEL THERE,

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.920
A GUY NAMED COLONEL BILLY G. MURPHY,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.860
WHO WAS A THREE-TIME VIETNAM VETERAN.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.960
HE WAS OUR COMMANDANT OF CADETS,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.330
AND THIS DUDE WAS AS TOUGH AS NAILS.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.930
MY BUDDIES AND I USED TO LAUGH, SAY,

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.100
"I THINK WE ONLY SAW HIM SMILE ONCE,"

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.270
AND I THINK IT WAS AN ACCIDENT WHEN WE SAW HIM SMILE.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.440
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.670
BUT WE LOVED HIM 'CAUSE HE LOVED US.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.940
BUT ONE DAY, HE CALLED THE ENTIRE CORPS OF CADETS TOGETHER

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.880
FOR AN EVENING FORMATION, WHICH WAS WEIRD.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.210
BUT IT WAS AT 8:00 AT NIGHT ON A SUNDAY NIGHT.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.450
AND WE HAD NOTICED THAT HE WAS LOSING WEIGHT REALLY QUICKLY.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.290
IN FACT, THE UNIFORM THAT HE WAS WEARING --

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.650
IT WAS STARTING TO FIT SO BIG

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.660
THAT IT ACTUALLY STARTED TO EVEN LOOK LIKE

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.630
IT WAS HIS FATHER'S UNIFORM OR SOMETHING.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.760
AND HE CALLED THE ENTIRE CORPS OF CADETS TOGETHER,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.500
AND WE WERE ALL SITTING INSIDE THE PEWS.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.100
AND HE WAS STANDING UP IN THE PULPIT.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.900
AND HE GOT UP IN THE PULPIT, AND HE TOLD US

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.870
THAT HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.940
AND THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.840
SO THIS, IN ESSENCE, WAS HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.510
BUT HE SAID SOMETHING TO US THAT DAY THAT I WILL FORGET.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.180
HE JUST LOOKED OVER US, AND HE SAID,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.120
"WHEN IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE HERE..."

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.390
"WHETHER IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE THIS SCHOOL,

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.430
WHETHER IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE YOUR JOB,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.360
WHETHER IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.870
OR WHEN IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE THIS PLANET..."

00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:01.740
"MAKE SURE THAT IT MATTERED THAT YOU WERE EVER EVEN HERE."

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.440
"MAKE SURE THAT IT MATTERED THAT YOU WERE EVER EVEN HERE,"

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.910
BECAUSE NONE OF US ARE PROMISED ANYTHING.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.850
WE'RE NOT PROMISED MORE DAYS OR MORE WEEKS OR MORE YEARS.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.250
NO ONE HAS EVER TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.690
AND WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, WES?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.060
YOU'VE GOT 6,515 DAYS LEFT, SO YOU CAN PACE YOURSELF."

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.360
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.560
RIGHT?

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.730
WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE,

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.230
"YEAH, I'M-A GET TO THAT ONCE I GET PROMOTED,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.070
I'M-A GET TO THAT ONCE I GET TENURE,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.070
I'M-A GET TO THAT ONCE I RETIRE,

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.800
I'M-A GET TO THAT ONCE MY KIDS MOVE OUT,"

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.040
WHO HAS PROMISED YOU ANYTHING?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.080
SO THE ONLY THING THAT WE KNOW IS THAT WHILE WE'RE HERE,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.020
LET'S ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING WITH IT...

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.620
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.960
...THAT, WHILE WE'RE HERE,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.060
LET'S LOVE, AND LET'S LOVE A LITTLE HARDER.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.600
WHILE WE'RE HERE, LET'S PUSH, AND LET'S PUSH A LITTLE FASTER.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.900
WHILE WE'RE HERE, LET'S GIVE, AND LET'S GIVE A LITTLE MORE.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.770
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE...

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.510
LET'S GET TO OUR WORK.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.340
BLESS YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:18.220

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.720
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.590
GREAT JOB.
