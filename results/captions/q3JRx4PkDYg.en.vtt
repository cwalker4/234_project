00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.240
We have already said then there were five crew positions.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.070
Ian has already taken us through the driver's position.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.020
What we have done now is pop across to the right of the driver and we are now in the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.150
radio operator or the bow gunner positions.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.070
So the bow gunner was exactly the same person that operated the radios.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.140
Quite clearly on the left there you can see the original radios that came with Tiger 131.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.290
Various combinations of radios obviously depended on whether it was a command

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.230
vehicle or not.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.100
Short wave usually, however the command vehicles have the ability to actually do a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.000
longer signal and more high powered.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
Very simple in this position here and actually it's quite comfy and quite roomy.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.090
You can see directly in front of me is one of our, the first of our two MG34's.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.020
Obviously the other one is mounted coaxally with the main armament.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.210
The set up for it is quite simple.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.150
The interesting thing to note of course for the MG34 was, slightly different to the ones

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.050
that were ground mounted or mounted on armoured vehicles, was the fact that the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.050
barrels on the armoured vehicle ones were three quarters armoured.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.060
So that was just to protect it against shrapnel etc.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.060
A very simple brow pad, that the bow gunner used to use there and also very simple

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.120
singular sighting system that was used to aim it.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.250
You will also notice, as Ian mentioned before there, also to the front of me you can see

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.100
the transmission assembly right down at the front there.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.150
So obviously, as Ian said, when you are driving it incredibly noisy

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.180
not only for the driver but also for the bow gunner.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.270
Across to the right hand side, storage.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.290
You can see where the rounds where kept there and also there are various storage

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.020
positions all over.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
We will look at some of those later on for the main armourment rounds.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.070
The majority been held actually inside the turret, under the turret floor.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.290
And as Ian pointed out on the driver's cab, one of the filler points for the final drive.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.000
So obviously one in the driver's cab and this is the one across the right hand side

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.150
For the other side.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200
We've now, I've moved down from the commander's station into the gunner's station,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.250
so directly beneath where the commander would sit.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.260
As you can see not a great deal of room.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050
Just the right of me of is the breach and the breach assembly.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.100
Straight in front, ahead of the gunner is the gunner's sight and in this case

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.290
it's the 9 Bravo binocular type sight.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.150
Quite a very simple and very effective sight.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.000
Gave you 2.5 times magnification and a field of view of 25 degrees.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.240
The gratical pattern was also quite simple and hopefully we will be able

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.010
to give you a close up of that later on.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.010
In essence, it consisted of a number inverted "v"s on the gratical pattern.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.240
Moving across from that and directly located underneath where the breech is,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.090
you can see we have got the elevation hand wheel.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.010
The means that the gunner can elevate and depress the main armourment.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.190
And another important part of the elevation hand wheel of course

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.090
is on the other side we've also got the trigger which is used by the gunner

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.180
when firing the main armourment.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.150
A couple of very important things on the floor directly beneath the gunner,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.150
we've got a number of foot pedals.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.080
One of them is a rocker type pedal and this was the means for

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.010
power traverse for the Tiger 1.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.170
So pushing forward and putting down with your heel on there would turn

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.010
the turret left and right on the power traverse as well.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.120
And it was possible at full speed to do a complete 360 in 60 seconds on Tiger 1.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.210
And the final pedal for the gunner down on the gunner's position

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.130
is a very simple pedal there that fires the MG34.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.280
So that's the means that he does it.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.180
Although apparently not particularly reliable

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.290
as obviously it is relying on a number of linkages, linking up to the MG34.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.040
Moving across to the left hand side of the gunner's station,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.210
one of the most important things was the Azimuth Indicator.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.120
Exactly the same as we mentioned already on the commander's station.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.040
The Azimuth Indicator again numbered from 1 to 12 so again it's the way that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.030
the commander and the gunner can link up,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.170
commander could lay the gunner on quite quickly using that.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.000
Vision block on the left hand side there.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.220
We saw from the outside of the turret the vision block

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.240
and obviously the periscope that we've got there.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.020
Directly above that where two breathing tubes.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.080
The breathing tubes, the only reason for them was it was just a means that the air,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.030
the crew could get fresh air using the breathing tubes as opposed to putting on

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.250
and wearing the full respirators or gas masks which obviously was quite problematic.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.040
And finally we have the emergency gun firing circuits.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.000
So if there were problems there is still a means for them to get the primer charged

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.090
that would set of the primer for the main armourment.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.140
And the final thing to mention in the gunner's station then

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.230
is obviously the traverse hand wheel.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.280
If there was a problem and we couldn't use power traverse

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.270
there is the ability there to use the traverse hand wheel.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.170
Before it could be used there is, although you won't get to see it,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.150
underneath the turret seal there is a locking lever

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.040
that needs to be disengaged on there.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.030
Ok, now I'm looking at the commander's station.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.260
You can see there the angle that I am actually sat at the moment

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.280
it's quite limited for space in here.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.010
Working our way around, obviously you've got the seat

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.280
which is just underneath the camera at the moment there.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.040
You've also got the traverse gear box.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.180
Located on the traverse gear box was a hand wheel for the commander.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.290
This was the auxiliary hand wheel for the turret traverse.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.280
You can also see there, we mentioned about the smoke grenade discharges

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.070
on the outside of the vehicle this is one of the control panels to fire one of the banks.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.030
And located underneath there is just three buttons that actually fire

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.110
the smoke grenades dischargers.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.290
Various storage located around where the commander would sit.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.050
Storage for the gas masks.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.270
Storage for a flare pistol and also any storage for small arms as well.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.020
And then also, we're going to rotate round at the moment,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.160
you can see where we pointed on the outside of the turret you've got the port

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.140
there where the commander could fire a small arms actually outside.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.110
Located around a number of vision blocks.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.170
Six vision blocks as we pointed from the outside.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.070
And also if you went up you might be able to make out the Azimuth Indicator.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.040
Located or numbered 1 to 12 on the interior of the commander's cupola turret room

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.100
there just at the top.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.090
Last thing to point out in the commander's station.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260
You've got this thin metal shield here.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.180
The only reason that the shield was put there was to prevent,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.180
or in the eventuality of flash- back in the turret

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.270
that would give the commander some protection.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.080
We are now in the loader's station and a few of the key things to point out.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.110
Now obviously one of the big things about the Tiger 1 as we mentioned earlier on,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.270
was the fact that the gun was absolutely so potent the 88 millimeter.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.120
A few keys things to point out on the breech then.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.190
One of the most obvious things there you can see the transit bar.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.140
And all the transit bar did was hook the breech up when the gun

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.060
was not in combat use to prevent damage to it as well.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.040
As we said before the recoil was a real problem for the 88mm,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.130
fitting it on to the chassis.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.140
So what they did was actually put a recuperator and a buffer on there

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.100
to absorb some of that recoil.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.170
One of the things I will point out to you at the moment is also the recoil indicator.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.180
Another couple of key things on there

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.200
just to the floor there you can see there is a catcher tray.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.250
All that did was actually catch the empty cases when they came out of the breech.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.240
And also just to the right of the breach there was a safe/ fire lever.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.220
Again very very simple design, it just meant that

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.160
the loader had to make sure it was in the fire position

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.180
otherwise the electric circuit wouldn't be completed prior to firing.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.280
Moving our way across to the right you can see, although not fitted at the moment,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.000
was the mounting for the MG34.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.010
Again reports of lots of lots of problems with the MG34 on Tiger 1

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.250
as far as stoppages were concerned.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.010
Also you notice just to the right of the mount there, there is the number 2.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.190
You may have noticed as we have been going round

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.140
there are various numbers located in Tiger 131.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.060
It is numbered 1 to 14, and all that meant was it was the 14 checks

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.130
that before Tiger 1 did deep wading that would have to be done beforehand.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.290
So there's 14 things that had to be dealt with

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.080
before it could submerse or do deep wading.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.190
Moving our way across to the right there, you'll also see again it's marked number 8,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.090
one of the vision blocks we saw from the outside there,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.070
so the loader had a pretty poor field of view from the inside there.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.140
The loader did have his own seat, it's in the stowed position at the moment,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.230
it just swings out and folds down there.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.190
And also there's storage.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.250
Now the storage on Tiger 1, it was capable of carrying 92 rounds.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.190
The rounds themselves were usually an equal split between the high explosive

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.020
and armoured piercing.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.240
Various storage positions.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.290
There are some storage positions underneath the floor.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.210
There is also some next to the driver

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.120
and there are also some storage positions on the seals

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.110
located round the outside there.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.140
You can just see at the moment one of the rounds located in there.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.060
Clipped into position.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.060
And very easy to get to.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.030
As we mentioned before was the hardest thing by far with the Tiger

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.140
was actually re-stowing it after they had run out of ammunition.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.270
Moving our way across to the right.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.110
We have also got another gas mask on there and you can see now

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.090
the inside of the emergency or escape hatch

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.140
with a very very good thing to have in use,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.230
it was very very heavy as we said before.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.110
And also you can see just to the top right of that,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.030
we looked at it from the outside of the turret,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.140
we have also got the ventilation fan.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.240
And also on the right hand side we have the gun balance spring casing.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.020
Which in essence is just an over -sized damper.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.210
And finally in the loader's station,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.140
I'm just moving across here you can see there is a leather pad there.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.130
That was just too actually buffer some of the rounds

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.020
as they were ejected from the breach.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.240
And also as we've already pointed out there, the catching the emptied projectiles.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.180
And what I mentioned before there really in essence a recoil indicator

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.080
which interestingly enough has sort of not changed in design much to too many tanks.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.050
All the recoil indicator was, we've already said, it hydraulically assisted the breach.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:42.080
It was just an indication there of how far and well the fluid was reacting for the recoil.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.000
It could recoil up to 620mm, but the marker on there would go up to 580,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.020
after that it would have a cease fire mark on there

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.090
just to tell you there were problems.
