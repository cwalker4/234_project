00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:05.171
WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO "THE LATE
SHOW."

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.140
I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.844
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IS
HERE.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.047
COURTESY OF ROBERT MUELLER
COMING DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:19.719 align:start size:88% position:13%
CHIMNEY WITH A SACK FULL OF
SUBPOENAS!

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MR. PRESIDENT, I GOT YOU AN

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.422
EARLY CHRISTMAS GIFT, TOO.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.693
I JUST HOPE THEY'RE NOT TOO BIG
ON YOU.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:39.739
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, ON

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.642
FRIDAY, FORMER
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.444
MICHAEL FLYNN PLEADED GUILTY TO
LYING TO THE F.B.I.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.080
AND IT TURNS OUT, THAT'S AGAINST
THE LAW.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.814 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
"DID YOU KNOW THAT?

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.284
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:55.055
MOST OF THEM WORK FOR ME."

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.756
( LAUGHTER )
BUT FLYNN'S NOT THE ONLY ONE IN

00:00:56.756 --> 00:01:00.126
MUELLER'S CROSSHAIRS BECAUSE, IN
COURT, HE SAID THAT HE'S AGREED

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.228
TO COOPERATE WITH THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL'S OFFICE.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.365 align:start size:88% position:13%
WOO-HOO!

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.101
HE'S SINGING LIKE A CANARY!

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.705
WELL, ACTUALLY, MORE LIKE
AN ANGRY SHAVED EAGLE.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.746
YES, FLYNN IS TURNING ON HIS OLD
FRIENDS.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.014
IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING GOES,
"SNITCHES GET SIGNIFICANT TIME

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.616 align:start size:88% position:13%
OFF THEIR FEDERAL PRISON
SENTENCE."

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.587
'CAUSE HE WAS FACING AN
ALL-YOU-CAN-SERVE JAIL BUFFET

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.090
FOR CHARGES, INCLUDING FAILING
TO REGISTER AS A FOREIGN AGENT,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.626 align:start size:88% position:13%
MONEY LAUNDERING, AND
KIDNAPPING.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.961
SO, TO SAVE HIS OWN HIDE, HE HAD
TO GIVE SOMEBODY UP.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.397 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHO?

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:43.436
WELL, "IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A
LOT LIKE KUSHNER!"

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:48.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BECAUSE AFTER THE ELECTION,

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.612
"KUSHNER IS SAID TO HAVE ORDERED
FLYNN TO CONTACT RUSSIA."

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.681 align:end position:100%
THAT THREE-STAR GENERAL MUST
HAVE BEEN HONORED TO GET ORDERS

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.650
FROM A NO-STAR SON-IN-LAW.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.220
KUSHNER WANTED RUSSIA TO BLOCK A
U.N. RESOLUTION CONDEMNING

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.257 size:88% position:44%
ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.693
AT THE SAME TIME, OBAMA HAD JUST
PUT SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA FOR

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.796
TAMPERING WITH THE 2016
ELECTIONS, AND FLYNN CALLED THE

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:13.366 align:end position:100%
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR AND SAID,
"PLEASE DON'T RESPOND TO OBAMA'S

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:18.605
SANCTIONS, ONCE WE GET IN THERE
WINK, WINK, NOD, NOD."

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:23.676
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE
POLICY UNTIL YOU'RE IN OFFICE.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.679
WE ONLY HAVE ONE PRESIDENT AT A
TIME.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:32.018 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEN IT WAS OBAMA, NOW IT'S
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.158 align:start size:88% position:13%
STRONG LEADER.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.292 size:84% position:42%
VERY STRONG LEADER.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.393 size:81% position:41%
LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:48.902 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.637
AND NOT ONLY THAT, FLYNN COULD
AVOID JAIL TIME BY PARTICIPATING

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.572
IN COVERT LAW ENFORCEMENT
ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS WEARING A

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.607 align:start size:88% position:13%
WIRE.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.608 size:88% position:56%
"MICHAEL FLYNN'S A GOOD GUY.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.611 size:84% position:42%
VERY GOOD LISTENER.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:02.382
SOMETIMES HE ASKS ME TO SAY
THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:07.020
DIRECTLY INTO HIS CORSAGE."

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
VERY NICE.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.955 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO THOUGHTFUL.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.390 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.891
IN FACT, THE WHITE HOUSE IS
PARANOID, AND EVERYONE THINKS

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.895
THEY'RE BEING RECORDED.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.964
THAT'S TERRIBLE, AND FLYNN FELT
BAD ABOUT IT, SO THIS MORNING HE

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.833
APOLOGIZED BY SENDING THEM AN
EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:26.339
( LAUGHTER )
MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS SITUATION

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:31.945
CAN'T GET WORSE, TO WHICH TRUMP
SAID, "HOLD MY BEER."

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:36.316 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
HE DOESN'T EVEN DRINK BORE.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.519
ON SATURDAY, HE TWEETED, "I HAD
TO FIRE GENERAL FLYNN BECAUSE HE

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.188
LIED TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AND
THE F.B.I."

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:49.596 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING --
TRUMP'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.631
KNOWN FLYNN LIED TO THE F.B.I.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:56.703
BECAUSE, THE DAY AFTER HE FIRED
FLYNN,

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.870
F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SAYS
YOU TOLD HIM TO GO EASY ON

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.339 align:start size:88% position:13%
FLYNN.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:04.944
THAT WOULD BE AN ADMISSION TO
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:13.219
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BIG -- BIG OBSTRUCTION OF

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.821
JUSTICE FANS HERE TONIGHT.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.056
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.491
GET OUT OF ONE LIE AND YOU
ACCIDENTALLY TELL A MUCH WORSE

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.492 align:start size:88% position:13%
LIE.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.262
"BABY, I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
TEXTING WITH MY EX LAST NIGHT, I

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:27.433
WAS TOO BUSY SLEEPING WITH YOUR
MOM.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
AND YOU KNOW MOMMA DON'T LET

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.811
PHONES IN THE BOOM BOOM ROOM ."

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.646 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT NOW TRUMP'S PEOPLE ARE

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:40.947 align:start size:88% position:13%
SAYING HE DIDN'T WRITE THE
TWEET.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.248
IT WAS WRITTEN BY TRUMP ATTORNEY
AND NORSE GOD OF SADNESS, JOHN

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.851 align:start size:88% position:13%
DOWD.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.719 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, MAN!

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.621
&gt;&gt; Stephen: VERY POWERFUL.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.659
SO THEY'RE SAYING TRUMP'S LAWYER
WROTE A TWEET IN THE VOICE OF

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.830
HIS CLIENT, WITHOUT THE CLIENT'S
PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE, A TWEET

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.932
IN WHICH THE CLIENT INDICTS
HIMSELF FOR OBSTRUCTION OF

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:04.804 align:start size:88% position:13%
JUSTICE.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.607 size:88% position:44%
THAT IS MALPRACTICE.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.809
I CERTAINLY HOPE JOHN DOWD HAS A
LAWYER THAT'S WAY BETTER THAN

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
JOHN DOWD.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.048 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, NO ONE BELIEVES THIS.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.116
EVEN SUPPORTERS OF THE
ADMINISTRATION CALLED IT "SLOPPY

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.885 size:78% position:39%
AND UNFORTUNATE."

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.521
"SLOPPY AND UNFORTUNATE," BY THE
WAY, ALSO ERIC AND DON, JR.'S

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:26.125
SECRET SERVICE CODE NAMES.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:35.735 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
EVERYBODY LOVES THOSE BOYS.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.805 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND NOW DOWD IS SAYING IT
DOESN'T MATTER WHO WROTE THE

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:42.141 align:end position:100%
TWEET BECAUSE THE "PRESIDENT
CANNOT OBSTRUCT JUSTICE BECAUSE

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:45.945
HE IS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:50.183
EXPRESS HIS VIEW OF ANY CASE."

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:54.587 align:start size:88% position:13%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
OR, AS NIXON SAID, "WHEN THE

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:57.290 align:end position:100%
PRESIDENT DOES IT, IT IS NOT
ILLEGAL ...ALSO, IF YOU'RE USING

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.258
THE SAME DEFENSE AS ME, YOU'RE
TOTALLY SCREWED BECAUSE I WAS A

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.427 align:start size:88% position:13%
CROOK."

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:21.180
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S A FINE LINE FROM THIS TO

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
AHHH!

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.449 align:start size:88% position:13%
AHHH!

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:23.649 align:start size:88% position:13%
AHHH!

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:24.884
SO THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER SEEMS
TO BE TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.320 align:start size:88% position:13%
DAMNING TWEET.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.989
BUT DOWD ISN'T THE ONLY ATTORNEY
WHO WOULD DO THIS FOR A CLIENT.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:35.395 size:88% position:56%
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AD.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.997
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES?

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:41.167
&gt;&gt; AND THE MORON WHO CONFESSED
GUILT ON TWITTER?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:45.138
&gt;&gt; THEN YOU NEED THE SERVICES OF
GALINO AND FONZ.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:48.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE DON'T JUST DEFEND YOU IN
COURT, WE'LL TAKE YOUR

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:51.244
CONFESSION AND SAY WE WROTE IT
FOR SOME REASON.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.912 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE'LL TAKE THE HEAT FOR THE
TWEET!

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.414
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.850
WHATEVER CRIME YOU COMMIT, WE'LL
SAY WE DID IT.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.484 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; AND BADLY.

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.519 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT WAS US.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.920 align:start size:88% position:13%
ARMED ROBBERY?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.156
&gt;&gt; GUILTY AS CHARGED.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:06.025
CAUGHT STANDING OVER A DEAD BODY
