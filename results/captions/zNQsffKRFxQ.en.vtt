00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.100
- How are we doing tonight?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.330
- Good.
How are you?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.400
- Good.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.100
Officer Steere, Warwick
Police Department.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.370
I'm just stopping you.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.130
You were having a little
trouble maintaining your lane,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.800
up there, on the highway.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.930
- Oh-- I'm so sorry.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.130
- Just wanted to make
sure you're OK to drive.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.070
- Yes.
Thank you.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.500
I am.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.900
- I'm having a little
trouble hearing you.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.270
So when you get your license,
if you just step out,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.400
I'll talk to you back here.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.900
That way we don't have
to yell across the car.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.530
- I would prefer
not to step out.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.530
Do I have to step out?
- All right.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.600
Well, you are going to step out.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.970
Yeah.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.670
OK?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.230
[dramatic music]

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.500
I guess you're having trouble
hearing me from that side, too.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Why don't you step out for me.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.870
- I'm not having trouble.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.130
I'm just trying to find my ID.
- All right.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.270
I'll let you get
that in a minute.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.770
You need to follow
directions, OK?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.400
So why don't you
just step out for me.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.430
- May I have a minute?

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.230
- I'm asking you to step
out of the car, right now.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.900
So open the door, and
step out of the car.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.130
All right?

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.270
Because I believe you're
driving under the influence.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.200
- No, I'm not.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.000
- No?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.800
- No.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.200
- Why do I smell alcohol?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.670
- I don't know.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.470
- All right.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.600
Step out of the car, please.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
I'm not asking you.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.470
I'm telling you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
- Um, excuse me--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.830
- Come on out of the car.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.430
- Excuse me--

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.430
- All right.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.470
You know I'm a police
officer, right?

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.570
- Yeah.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.800
- And I'm telling you
to exit the vehicle.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.230
I want you to step over
to the side, over there.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.470
We're going to walk
over to the curb,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.570
and we're going to
have a conversation.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.570
That's all it's got to be.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.200
- We can have a
conversation right here.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.030
- No.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.900
You're getting out of the car.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.800
[radio chimes] Bob, the
plate's going to be [audio out]

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.500
No.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.870
- Listen--

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.400
- Well, don't make me touch you.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.330
All right?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.600
I don't want you
taking off on me.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.330
Step out of the car.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.800
- Step out of the car.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.530
-

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.200
- I'm telling you to
step out of the car.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400
All right?
- Please--

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.830
- Step out of the car.
- You're hurting my wrist.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.130
- I'm not trying
to hurt your wrist.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.370
But you're not going to shut
a door when I think you're

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.470
driving under the influence.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.930
- I'm just trying to
put it behind the line.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.230
- Let me ask you
this-- do you have any

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.600
type of mental
illness, or anything,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.570
you're taking medication for?

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.500
- No.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.070
- Then step out of the car.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.870
- No, thank you.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.670
- Step out of the car.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.800
- Please don't pull me.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.070
- Then do what I'm
asking you to do.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.970
- Please don't pull me.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.930
- Listen-- how much have
you had to drink tonight?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.800
- Not a lot, at all.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.430
- What's "not a lot?"

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.470
- Two drinks.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.730
- Two drinks?
What were they?

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.900
Beer, or alcohol?
- Beer.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.770
- Like, hard alcohol?

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.570
- Beer.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.700
- How long ago was that?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.100
- Uh, what time is it?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.800
Can I please have my hand back?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.030
- Well, then step
out of the car,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.570
and I'll be more than happy
to let go of your wrist.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.400
[radio chatter]

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.170
- Do you want to
get pepper sprayed?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.600
- All you need to do
is get out of the car.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.230
- I would like my
attorney, please.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.000
- Well, you're going to
have that opportunity.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.830
Trust me.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830
But right now, like I said,
no one here is going anywhere.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.200
- I'm not a threat.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.370
- You're going to get out of
this car, one way or another.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.500
- I am not a threat.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500
I have no weapons.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.730
- Do you want to
physically remove her?

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.870
Or do you want to spray her?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.670
- I have nothing.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.630
I have nothing.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.600
- Step out of the car.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.000
I will, if you let me gather--

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.970
if-- excuse me!

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.770
- It's not an option.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.700
- This is not--

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.130
- Step out of the car.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.500
You need some help
pulling her out?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.430
- Yeah.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.470
- You shouldn't
be pulling me out.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.270
- OK.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.270
You know what?

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.300
Last chance, and
you're getting sprayed.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.130
- You have two feet.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.270
Just walk.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.330
- All you've got to do
is get out of the car.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.130
- I am asking--

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.930
- This is all unnecessary.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.300
- I understand that
it's-- please stop--

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.100
- Come on out.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.030
Come on out.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.100
- Please stop--
you're hurting me!

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.900
- Then stand up--

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.830
- I have asked you to stop--

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.670
- --and act like an adult.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.730
- Excuse me-- excuse me--

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.600
- Stop.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.530
- This is against my will.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.330
- Yes.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.670
You're under arrest.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.970
[radio chatter]

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.430
- You put yourself
in this position.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.370
You could have-- this
could have been very easy.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.170
- I didn't do anything.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.070
I've asked you to please stop--

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.930
[inaudible]

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.270
[radio chatter]

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.630
- So 15 minutes
into the stop, we

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.170
finally got her out of the car.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.400
But there was a
reason why she didn't

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.730
want to get out of
the car-- because she

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.070
knew she was impaired.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.930
We'll read her her rights,
and we'll get her out of here.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.770
Get her back to the station.
