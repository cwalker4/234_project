00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:06.068
&gt;&gt;&gt; GOING NOWHERE, DOING

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.238
NOTHING, HOPELESSLY DIVIDED AND

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:10.472
NOW, CHASING DOWN THE RABBIT

00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:11.473
HOLE OF SOCIALISM.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.342
THAT IS THE DEMOCRAT PARTY

00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:13.909
TODAY.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.277
AMERICA NEEDS SOME DAMAGE

00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:16.145
CONTROL SURELY.

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:16.879
LOOK AT THIS.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.580
HOUSE DEMOCRATS WERE SUPPOSED TO

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.983
VOTE TODAY ON A MEASURE

00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:22.117
CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:23.852
THEY CAN'T AGREE ON THE WORDING.

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:24.253
WHAT?

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:25.954
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:28.390
CONDEMN ANTI-SEMETISM YOU

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:29.692
SHOULDN'T BE IN CONGRESS.

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:31.794
SPEAKER PELOSI HAS LOST CONTROL.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.128
WEDNESDAY, THE HOMELAND SECURITY

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.663
CHIEF ALERTED CONGRESS TO THE

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:36.632
CRISIS ON THE BORDER.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.634
A MILLION ILLEGALS WILL ARRIVE

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:39.501
THIS YEAR.

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:42.204
THAT, SHE SAYS, QUOTE, WILL

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:43.639
OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM ENTIRELY.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.175
BUT THE DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO DO

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:46.542
ANYTHING.

00:00:46.543 --> 00:00:48.744
NO WALL, NO IMMIGRATION

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:49.445
ENFORCEMENT EITHER.

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.013
THEY WILL DO NOTHING.

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.014
GET THIS.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:53.282
THERE ARE REPUBLICANS IN THE

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:55.551
SENATE WHO WILL VOTE AGAINST THE

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:56.719
PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.119
DECLARATION.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.289
TALK ABOUT FIDDLING WHILE ROME

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.589
BURNS?

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.858
WE SHOULD CALL THIS THE NERO

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:03.225
CONGRESS.

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:04.993
WHAT DO YOU THINK CONGRESSMAN

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:06.528
JERROLD NADLER, I'M SORRY,

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:07.930
NADLER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WILL

00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:10.065
BE DOING FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS?

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.100
DESPERATELY REQUIRING TO

00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:12.267
UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENT WITH

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:13.335
ROUND AFTER ROUND OF

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:14.737
INVESTIGATION, HEARINGS, PROBES

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:15.637
AND SUBPOENAS.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:17.606
NOT INTO RUSSIA'S ROLE INTO THE

00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:18.340
ELECTION.

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:19.742
OH, NO, INTO THE PRESIDENT'S

00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:21.143
BUSINESSES AND HIS FAMILY.

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.712
THE OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR.

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:29.551
FIND SOME DIRT AND UNDERMINE THE

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:30.252
THAT'S IT.

00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:33.122
ON TOP OF THIS THE LOOMING 2020

00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:33.489
ELECTION.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.092
I KNOW IT IS STILL 21 MONTHS

00:01:37.093 --> 00:01:37.393
AWAY.

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.361
DID YOU KNOW DEMOCRATS BEGIN IN

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:41.930
JUNE THIS YEAR?

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:43.065
14 CANDIDATES ALREADY DECLARED,

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.333
MORE TO COME.

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:45.501
IMAGINE THE CIRCUS WHEN THEY'RE

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:46.635
ALL ON THE STAGE?

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.437
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING WILL GET

00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:50.172
DONE IN CONGRESS WHILE THEY'RE

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:51.473
JOCKEYING FOR POSITION.

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:52.708
NOTICE I HAVEN'T MENTIONED

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:53.742
SOCIALISM WHICH IS ALSO

00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:54.576
SPLITTING THE PARTY.

00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:56.712
A DYSFUNCTIONAL PARTY IN A

00:01:56.713 --> 00:01:57.479
DYSFUNCTIONAL CONGRESS AND

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.283
AMERICA HAS TO PAY THE PRICE.
