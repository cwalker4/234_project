DETERMINED BY WHAT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE ATTORNEY

00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:30.060 line:92%
PRESENTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:06:30.061 --> 00:06:32.662 line:92%
GENERAL. THERE IS NOTHING THAT REQUIRES A

00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:34.531 line:92%
THERE IS NOTHING THAT REQUIRES A PUBLIC STATEMENT TO GO OUT FROM

00:06:34.565 --> 00:06:37.067 line:92%
PUBLIC STATEMENT TO GO OUT FROM THE SPECIAL COUNCIL’S TEAM

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:39.002 line:92%
THE SPECIAL COUNCIL’S TEAM SAYING WE HAVE TO DELIVER A

00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:41.271 line:92%
SAYING WE HAVE TO DELIVER A REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:06:41.305 --> 00:06:42.572 line:92%
REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I THINK WILLIAM BARR WILL GET

00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:44.841 line:92%
I THINK WILLIAM BARR WILL GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:47.878 line:92%
THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS. &gt;&gt; CHUCK, I BELIEVE, I THINK WE

00:06:47.912 --> 00:06:49.680 line:92%
&gt;&gt; CHUCK, I BELIEVE, I THINK WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD GET SOME

00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:50.881 line:92%
WERE TOLD WE WOULD GET SOME GUIDANCE FROM DOJ.

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:52.249 line:92%
GUIDANCE FROM DOJ. WE JUST WOULD NOT HAVE ANY IDEA

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:53.884 line:92%
WE JUST WOULD NOT HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT WAS IN THE REPORT

00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:54.284 line:92%
WHAT WAS IN THE REPORT IMMEDIATELY.

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:57.988 line:92%
IMMEDIATELY. &gt;&gt; BUT I THINK JOHNSON’S

00:06:58.022 --> 00:06:59.189 line:92%
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK JOHNSON’S INSTINCTS ON THIS ARE RIGHT.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.158 line:92%
INSTINCTS ON THIS ARE RIGHT. HERE IS WHY.

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:02.993 line:92%
HERE IS WHY. THE MUELLER REPORT IS REQUIRED

00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:04.161 line:92%
THE MUELLER REPORT IS REQUIRED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.

00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:06.697 line:92%
TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. IT IS NOT IN THE ATTORNEY

00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:08.132 line:92%
IT IS NOT IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S INTEREST TO KNOW HE

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:08.699 line:92%
GENERAL’S INTEREST TO KNOW HE RECEIVED IT.

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:10.734 line:92%
RECEIVED IT. ONCE WE KNOW HE RECEIVED IT WE

00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:12.502 line:92%
ONCE WE KNOW HE RECEIVED IT WE START HAMMERING ON HIM, WHAT

00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:17.207 line:92%

00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:17.908 line:92%
WILL YOU DO, WHAT WILL YOU MAKE PUBLIC?

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:22.279 line:92%
PUBLIC? AND SO THOROUGH, IT IS ENTIRELY

00:07:22.313 --> 00:07:23.513 line:92%
AND SO THOROUGH, IT IS ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE, BUT IT IS PLAUSIBLE

00:07:23.515 --> 00:07:26.617 line:92%
PLAUSIBLE, BUT IT IS PLAUSIBLE THAT HE TRANSMITTED IT AND WHEN

00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:28.052 line:92%
THAT HE TRANSMITTED IT AND WHEN HE DOES I IMAGINE THEY’RE NOT

00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:30.287 line:92%
HE DOES I IMAGINE THEY’RE NOT GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT.

00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:32.222 line:92%
GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT. I DON’T KNOW HOW THAT HELPS THE

00:07:32.223 --> 00:07:33.423 line:92%
I DON’T KNOW HOW THAT HELPS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT WOULD WANT

00:07:33.425 --> 00:07:36.427 line:92%
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT WOULD WANT TO TO READ IT, REFLECT ON IT,

00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:38.229 line:92%
TO TO READ IT, REFLECT ON IT, AND DETERMINE WHAT COULD BE

00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:40.565 line:92%

PROPERLY TRANSMITTED TO THE CONGRESS AND MADE PUBLIC.

00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.337 line:92%

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S MARCHING ORDERS THAT GOVERNOR THIS REPORT

00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:52.042 line:92%

INVOLVED. ONE OF THOSE IS PAUL MFRT.

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:17.702 line:92%
ONE OF THOSE IS PAUL MFRT. THIS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG HE

00:08:17.736 --> 00:08:20.071 line:92%
THIS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG HE WILL END UP STAYING IN PRISON.

00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:22.139 line:92%
WILL END UP STAYING IN PRISON. TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT

00:08:22.141 --> 00:08:23.474 line:92%
TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT EXPLICITLY RULE OUT THAT PAUL

00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:26.143 line:92%
EXPLICITLY RULE OUT THAT PAUL MANAFORT WOULD NOT BE GIVEN A

00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:28.679 line:92%

00:08:34.353 --> 00:08:36.788 line:92%
YET. HE GOT A LENIENT SENTENCE.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.691 line:92%
HE GOT A LENIENT SENTENCE. HE IS LOOKING AT AN ADDITIONAL

00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:41.592 line:92%
HE IS LOOKING AT AN ADDITIONAL TEN YEARS.

00:08:41.627 --> 00:08:45.062 line:92%
TEN YEARS. THE JUDGE THERE COULD RUN IT

00:08:45.097 --> 00:08:47.999 line:92%
THE JUDGE THERE COULD RUN IT CONSECUTIVELY AND HE STILL HAS

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.501 line:92%
CONSECUTIVELY AND HE STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE, WHETHER OR

00:08:50.503 --> 00:08:53.605 line:92%
SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE, WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WILL PARDON

00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:55.273 line:92%
NOT THE PRESIDENT WILL PARDON HIM IS ANOTHER MATTER, BUT HE

HIM IS ANOTHER MATTER, BUT HE SHOULD NOT BE DANCING IN THE

00:08:57.877 --> 00:08:58.510 line:92%
SHOULD NOT BE DANCING IN THE OCCASION YET.

00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:02.814 line:92%
OCCASION YET. &gt;&gt; I DON’T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:10.822 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I DON’T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT MR. TRUMP WILL BARR DON HYMN ATP

00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:11.289 line:92%
MR. TRUMP WILL BARR DON HYMN ATP SOME POINT.

00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:15.126 line:92%
SOME POINT. SO I BELIEVE THAT PAUL MANAFORT

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.229 line:92%
SO I BELIEVE THAT PAUL MANAFORT WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.831 line:92%
WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE FEDERAL CHARGES, WHAT DOES HE

00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:23.234 line:92%
FEDERAL CHARGES, WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO LOSE IF HE PARDONS HIM.

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:26.437 line:92%
HAVE TO LOSE IF HE PARDONS HIM. &gt;&gt; I THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS

00:09:26.439 --> 00:09:29.140 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS HIM LEAVING OFFICE.

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:31.042 line:92%
HIM LEAVING OFFICE. BUT HE HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF HIM.

00:09:31.043 --> 00:09:32.677 line:92%
BUT HE HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF HIM. HE FEELS THIS INVESTIGATION HAS

00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:34.112 line:92%
HE FEELS THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN A WITCH HUNT.

00:09:34.113 --> 00:09:35.347 line:92%
BEEN A WITCH HUNT. SO WHY WOULD DONALD TRUMP ALLOW

00:09:35.348 --> 00:09:38.150 line:92%
SO WHY WOULD DONALD TRUMP ALLOW HIM TO STAY IN JAIL.

00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:39.618 line:92%
HIM TO STAY IN JAIL. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT MIKE FLYNN?

&gt;&gt; ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH TRUMP.

00:09:44.757 --> 00:09:49.628 line:92%
