00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.720
In this episode we're exploring the largest abandoned building we've ever set foot in: this monumental steel works

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.880
However, not everything goes according to plan...

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.880
(loud banging noises)

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
That's a lot of razor wire

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.260
Going in we had a feeling that this exploration was going to be extremely difficult to pull off

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.860
Our feelings were affirmed when we encountered this razor wire fence still over half a mile from the building

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.440
We squeezed under the fence having no idea what other physical obstacles we would face along the way

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.140
So we're getting pretty close now and this place has security that drives around the building, multiple vehicles

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.900
We don't know how to get in the building from your address

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.060
So we're gonna have to find a way in without being seen

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.100
And we've got a pretty wide area to cross also

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.880
This might be a little difficult

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.160
As we made our approach we ducked under cameras and hid behind anything we can find. Scanning for security the entire time...

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.180
We only had to search the perimeter of the building for a few minutes before finding a possible entrance: a downed razor-wire fence

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
You're on razor wire careful

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.620
'Did it cut you?'

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.380
No...I think....

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.360
Let's get in

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.780
Someone came here before us and opened it up

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.280
-This may not even go inside
-It's boarded over

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.020
Success. And opening into the main building we were in...

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100
Watch her right here

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Get down Get down!

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.520
He said something

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.300
I know

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.220
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.320
They're pulling away

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.280
(noise)

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.700
We don't know for sure if they're all gone

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.480
It's probably just a normal security check. They get out of the car and look at the windows. Or the openings...

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.580
No, I don't think they saw us coming in, right?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800
Or the cameras, yeah

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600
We will just be dead silent

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.820
This place is amazing

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.860
And scary

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.240
Those pots are huge though. Go stand at the bottom of that pot

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:19.140
It's crazy those things have been moved around the ceiling in here probably carrying molten steel

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.200
The steelworks was constructed in the early 1960s and operated for nearly five decades

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.280
It shut down permanently shortly after the global recession of 2009

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.440
Since then, efforts to salvage metal and machinery resulted in the mill being slowly picked apart, but much of it remains intact

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.880
It's been spared of heavy

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.220
vandalism and graffiti as well, as a watchful eye has been kept in the building to protect the massive amount of scrapable metal that remains

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.220
inside...

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.040
That's wide open on that end

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:24.680
I love how the orange tarp there makes the color of the light the same color as molten steel. It's very fitting...

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.180
Ok we are now going to attempt going up these stairs as quietly as possible

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.700
Ooo, it's shaking

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.000
Unreal...

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:17.700
Even if you were looking at just this view...you would say this is a giant warehouse...and then you turn around

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.040
And you're on the second floor of it already

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.840
That thing looks crazy... (loud noise) What the fuck?....

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.040
Do you really think we're alone in here?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.720
Those are some crazy fucking noises dude, they're so loud

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.140
This piece of machinery here is monstrous though

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.420
(random noises in background)

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.580
Or going down stairs...

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.860
(hammering continues)

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.900
It sounds like it's multiple directions it's coming from

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.280
Coming in and looking for us maybe

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.580
It all sounds like the roof though

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.960
It's getting crazy

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.020
-Or the way to be picking up outside...
-What?
-Or the weight can be picking up outside...

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.700
(loud thump)

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.500
Like...it sounds like there's people on the roof...

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.360
All that clicking started recently though

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.560
(loud noise)

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.660
(more loud noises)

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.600
I'm gonna look this way

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:22.680
(more loud hammering)

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.120
-Is that inside for sure?
-I don't know

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.280
What if it's scrappers?

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.200
Security's tight here though. We almost got caught

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.820
Or these cou-  I don't think there's srappers here. It would be too crazy for scrappers. Yeah, you can't get stuff out of here

00:13:51.520 --> 00:14:04.180
(really loud banging)

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.920
There's people right there

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.180
We should get out of here then

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.940
-They're welding or cutting something.
-And probably sealing it up or....

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.420
...they're welding a door shut maybe...or welding bars over something...

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.060
-Maybe
-We can't get trapped in here
-No we can't

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.640
It's nuts they're doing construction here.....and we're just exploring

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.060
It's so crazy

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.080
(more loud banging)

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.720
Look at that coat up there...that was to protect against the molten steel

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.340
Alright, let's move to the other end of the building. Away from the people...

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.760
(more banging)

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.480
We might be getting sealed in here right now, but we'll worry about that later

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.040
As huge as the building is only part of the steelmaking process was carried out here

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.840
It lacks one of the most iconic and important elements of a steel mill: the blast furnace

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.760
Instead of producing molten pig iron on site it was delivered via specialised rail cars from a blast furnace several miles away

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.880
Then it would be refined into steel and turned into various products like slabs and coils

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.600
The blast furnace which supplied this facility is equally massive and is now also abandoned

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.660
A lot of monitors in here...

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.200
I don't like using the light in here...

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.800
'Cause it makes it kind of obvious...

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.640
Is this bright too?

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.220
Yeah

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.020
These are some big things on rails right here...

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.420
There's definitely something going on over there now

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.560
(loud noise)

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.460
Or over there...

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.820
Or right on top of us...

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.300
It's been an awesome job...

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.620
It must feel so cool to pick up those massive pots of steel

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.320
And just move 'em around with a lever...like they're nothing...

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.620
This room is the biggest one yet though, I think...

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.900
Wow

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.280
Holy cow...

They put the fence back up it's bolted up dude

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.160
Stay tuned...
