00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:33.849 line:92%
WRITTEN ANSWERS. WHEN YOU GET WRITTEN ANSWERS

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:36.551 line:92%
WHEN YOU GET WRITTEN ANSWERS FROM A WITNESS, IT’S REALLY THE

00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:38.053 line:92%
FROM A WITNESS, IT’S REALLY THE LAWYERS’ ANSWERS AS MUCH AS THE

00:03:38.054 --> 00:03:38.520 line:92%
LAWYERS’ ANSWERS AS MUCH AS THE CLIENT’S ANSWER.

00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:40.655 line:92%

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS IN REAL-TIME.

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:44.326 line:92%
REAL-TIME. BUT I THINK THE CONSTRAINT THAT

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:45.727 line:92%
BUT I THINK THE CONSTRAINT THAT BOB MUELLER IS OPERATING UNDER,

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:47.162 line:92%
BOB MUELLER IS OPERATING UNDER, HE HAD AN ACTING ATTORNEY

00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:48.263 line:92%
HE HAD AN ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS APPOINTED

00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:50.398 line:92%
GENERAL WHO WAS APPOINTED BECAUSE HE WOULD BE HOSTILE TO A

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:51.967 line:92%
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE HOSTILE TO A SUBPOENA ON THE PRESIDENT.

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:54.169 line:92%
SUBPOENA ON THE PRESIDENT. AND NOW, HE HAS A PERMANENT

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.037 line:92%
AND NOW, HE HAS A PERMANENT ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HAS CHOSEN

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:56.772 line:92%
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HAS CHOSEN FOR THE SAME HOSTILITY TO HIS

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:58.574 line:92%
FOR THE SAME HOSTILITY TO HIS INVESTIGATION, WHO WOULD LIKELY

00:03:58.575 --> 00:03:59.274 line:92%
INVESTIGATION, WHO WOULD LIKELY OPPOSE THAT STEP.

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:04.946 line:92%
OPPOSE THAT STEP. I ALSO THINK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.049 line:92%
I ALSO THINK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FEELS SOME TIME PRESSURE TO

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.350 line:92%
FEELS SOME TIME PRESSURE TO CONCLUDE HIS WORK AND KNOWING

00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:09.484 line:92%
CONCLUDE HIS WORK AND KNOWING THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD DRAG OUT A

00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:10.385 line:92%
THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD DRAG OUT A FIGHT OVER THE SUBPOENA.

00:04:10.387 --> 00:04:11.953 line:92%
FIGHT OVER THE SUBPOENA. THAT MAY BE AN ISSUE, AS WELL.

00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:13.555 line:92%
THAT MAY BE AN ISSUE, AS WELL. I THINK ULTIMATELY IT’S A

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:14.256 line:92%
I THINK ULTIMATELY IT’S A MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE

00:04:14.257 --> 00:04:15.657 line:92%
MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH WOULD

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:18.994 line:92%
BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH WOULD BE TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER

00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:20.229 line:92%
BE TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER OATH.

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:21.764 line:92%
OATH. AS HE’S MADE PLAIN IN THE PAST,

00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:23.899 line:92%
AS HE’S MADE PLAIN IN THE PAST, HE FEELS IT’S FINE TO LIE TO THE

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:25.634 line:92%
HE FEELS IT’S FINE TO LIE TO THE PUBLIC AFTER ALL HE HAS SAID,

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.969 line:92%
PUBLIC AFTER ALL HE HAS SAID, IT’S NOT LIKE I’M TALKING BEFORE

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.803 line:92%
IT’S NOT LIKE I’M TALKING BEFORE A MAGISTRATE.
