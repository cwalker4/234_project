00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's pause here.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.940
I'm driving on the road
that separates Haiti from the Dominican Republic.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.480
Right here.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.940
It's the border that
divides two very different countries.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.840
If you're born in Haiti, you're
2.5 times more likely to die

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.080
as a baby than if you're born in the DR.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.189
You'll be almost ten times poorer and

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.520
you can expect to have a much shorter
life.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.019
I came here to find out how the two

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.760
countries that share this one island can
be so different, with a politically

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.230
volatile and impoverished Haiti on one
side and the stable and relatively rich

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.120
Dominican Republic on the other.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.600
How did this line produce two totally different worlds?

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.200
My journey starts here, at this beach
village in southern Haiti, where Haitian

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.200
merchants, most of them women, are
preparing for a nighttime boat ride.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.890
The women boarding this boat have one goal:
to make it to the border where they will

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.560
be let into a Dominican market, to buy
and sell goods before returning to their villages.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.799
It's international trade at its
most informal. We're taking these boats

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.850
because the next door mountain range
makes the land journey almost impossible.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.700
These worn-out wooden boats have been
making this exact journey twice per week

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.929
for decades and yet the process remains
chaotic and unorganized as if it's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.360
happening for the first time.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.459
All of this energy, time, and effort all to transport

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.880
a handful of goods that, in most
countries, would be shipped in bulk

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.320
inside one of these.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.700
We make this seven-hour journey to the
border town arriving around, 4 am.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.000
The sun rises and we walk to the border
market. This market was established right on the border

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as a partnership between the two nations, to give vendors from both sides

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.180
a place to buy and sell on equal footing.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.500
As we approach the border I quickly realize that's not what's happening here.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.200
So I'm looking across the border right now,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.940
into the market and you can see that
Dominicans are already setting up.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.440
This is one of the big complaints of the
Haitians: they're stuck on this side

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.560
waiting to cross the border and the
border guards are just delaying it and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.480
meanwhile the Dominicans are able to set
up and get the best spots.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.640
These Haitians come from miles away on this grueling
boat journey, that I know now firsthand

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.880
is very grueling, and they get to the
border and the guards stop them for no reason.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.960
They're supposed to open it up for
everyone at the same time.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.180
The guards keep the Haitian women from
crossing, not letting anyone know how

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.420
long it will be. The tension grows and
then finally, hours after the Dominicans

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.360
were allowed to enter, the guards open up
the bridge.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.460
They buy and sell for the day, before
returning to the boats to make the journey home.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.380
The grueling boat journey,
the senseless discrimination, it embodies

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.320
the asymmetry that exists on this island.
Watching it happen, it's impossible not

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.300
to ask how it got like this.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.800
There are a
few key things that explain how this

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.860
island produced two very different
countries, but if you want to get at the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.580
very root of it you have to go back to
when this island was owned by two

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.920
European powers: France and Spain. This
island is actually the first place that

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.740
Christopher Columbus set up a colony in
the new world on his first voyage back

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.040
in like 1490. France wanted a piece of
this island because it was rich in

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.920
resources like sugar and coffee, so they
fought a war with the Spanish and they

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.740
ended up splitting the island in two: one
side would be the Spanish colony of

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.800
Santo Domingo and the other side would
be the French colony, with the same name,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.600
Saint-Domingue, just in French. And that is
the most important part of understanding

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.160
this whole thing, is how these imperial
powers treated their colonial posessions.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.520
The French exploited the
land. They brought in tons of slaves and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.020
they were interested in making Saint-Domingue solely an economic producer.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.800
They destroyed the soil from aggressively
harvesting the same crop year after

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.100
year, and they created a group of very
resentful, overworked, and abused slaves

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.780
that eventually rebelled.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.720
The Spanish had
a different approach. After establishing

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.000
domination on this island by massacring
the indigenous population, they didn't

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.840
exploit it like the French did.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.340
Instead they went to places like Mexico and Peru, to look for gold.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.140
So they didn't bring nearly as many slaves onto this island,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.600
and as a result they weren't nearly as profitable a colony.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.280
Instead, the Spanish integrated with the remaining indigenous population,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.980
by recognizing the native leader's authority and intermarrying with the locals.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.200
The result was a smaller and more racially mixed
population,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.120
with a sustainable economy and a political system,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.860
something totally absent from
France's colony.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.480
This becomes really important in the
early 1800s, when independence comes around.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.900
Haiti declares independence,
fights off the French, and basically

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.200
declares itself the first black, former
slave republic in the world.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.920
They do so with very little framework for a society
and for a government and they also do so

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.920
with land that has been exploited, year
after year, with the same crop which

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.760
basically destroys the fertility of the
land.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.540
And to add to all of that, because

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.740
they were this first black Republic, the
world essentially isolated them.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.020
The United States didn't want to recognize
the independence of a black nation.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.080
They thought it might become a slave empire
and seek revenge.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.340
The French showed up on Haitian shores
soon after independence, and said you owe

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.080
us a debt for all of the assets that you
stole from us when you became independent,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.180
all these economic assets,
you owe us that debt and you have to pay

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.120
it over the next thirty years. This
crippling debt Haiti did pay back over

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.380
years, but it really hampered their
development.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.340
This history doesn't exonerate the dictators and corrupt
politicians that have plagued Haiti's

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.200
development since its independence, but
it helps explain them.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.680
Suffocating embargoes and the independence debt, as
well as the lack of any tradition or

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.420
investment in governmental institutions,
guaranteed Haiti's failure from the

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.380
moment it was born, and a racist world
made sure of it.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.820
That racism isn't just

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.320
embedded into Haiti's history, it is in
fact very alive today.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.160
As I drive up the border, by coincidence my driver is also
a Dominican border patrol official.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.040
We have hours in the car, where he slowly
and cautiously tells me about how

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.640
immigration policy has changed in the
Dominican Republic in recent years.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.800
"Regularization Program".

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.620
That's a euphemism. He's talking about a

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.000
policy of targeting anyone of Haitian
descent, even citizens, rounding them up

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.960
and deporting them.
There's always been anti-Haitian

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.920
sentiment in the Dominican Republic,
usually resulting in racist violence,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.540
but since 2010, that sentiment has been
seeping into legislation. The Dominican

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.780
Constitution that was drafted in 1929,
says that anyone born in the country is

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.560
automatically a citizen, even if your
parents were undocumented immigrants.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.200
This is the same in places like the
United States, but the DR rewrote its

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.640
constitution in 2010, to only give
citizenship to those born on DR soil, to legal residents.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.660
Then, in 2013 the high
court in the DR ruled that this new

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.120
definition would be applied
retroactively. All the way back to

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.920
1929, meaning any citizen who had been
born in the DR to undocumented parents

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.180
would have their citizenship revoked.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.020
More than 200,000 Dominican citizens,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.420
were suddenly stateless.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.560
It is clearly an illegal act, it is an
immoral act, it is a racist act by the

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.380
Dominican government. And it's happening
because these people are black.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.920
Dominican law said that if these
stateless people wanted to stay in the

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.520
DR, they would have to go to a government
office and put their name on this

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.120
foreigner registry. The government gave
these people one year to either get

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.800
their name on the registry or face
deportation.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.080
Over 55,000 have been officially deported since the
June 2015 deadline.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.780
The UN estimates that 128,000
people have voluntarily fled to Haiti,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.400
a country many of them have never lived in.
Some came here to this camp on the

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.620
border, where they've been living in
limbo for years.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.440
The moment I cross into the DR, I start
to see what this crackdown looks like.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.660
On a 75km bus ride, we pass eight
security checkpoints in which security

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.380
personnel board the bus, to eye who was on
it, and in some cases check papers.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.700
But each time we stop, they seem to only
check the papers of the same few passengers.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.420
That's my translator, Pascale.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.500
He's an American
citizen, but everywhere we go in the DR,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.780
security forces keep asking him
for his passport.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.760
Halfway through the journey, we pull off the road

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.020
into a facility where a few young military guys

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.120
are sitting around. And our driver brings
this woman and her two children over to

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.980
the military guys. She's speaking in
perfect Dominican Spanish to them,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.540
claiming that her children are Dominican
and that the driver brought us to this

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.420
checkpoint to turn her in because she's
black.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.220
None of this seems to matter,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.980
she doesn't have her papers and her skin
color seems to be all the guards need to see.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.400
Haiti's land and people were abused
when it was a colony of slaves.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.840
The world then shunned it, with embargoes and
independence debts when it was a new

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.380
nation, and today Haitians in the DR
experience racism that is overt enough

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.180
to be enshrined in law.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.920
As we drive up this very curvy road, I
have the DR to my right and Haiti to my left.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.940
Back when the French were here, this
was the richest colony on earth,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.620
but that came at a price.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.940
Not only to abused slaves, but also to the

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.580
land that they worked. Clear cutting and
single crop planting continued after the

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.080
French left, but instead of being used to
make fancy French furniture, the trees

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.020
were burned to cook food.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.700
This explains what I'm seeing when

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.440
on my right there's lush jungle.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.720
and on my left
there's bare and eroding hillsides.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.740
Zoom out a little bit and it's very clear.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.200
I follow the border road all the way north,
until I hit another market town. I wanted

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.960
to see if the same discriminatory
dynamics played out up here as they did down south.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.160
This market was built
with money from the European Union,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.680
and the UN development program,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.660
with the specific intention of creating a space where communities

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.420
from both sides could come and buy and sell on equal footing.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.520
Rolling through the market, and
once again like we saw in the southern market,

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.040
the Dominicans are first setting up.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.780
I walk to the border and find this

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.280
huge group of people at this gap in the
fence, paying a border guard to get in early.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.660
The dynamic is the same as down
south, only with a few more overt bribes

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.520
and border guards who seem to have no
problem hitting Haitians with a stick.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.760
After hours of waiting for guards to
open the gate for everyone,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.700
the Haitians are finally let in.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.160
This is a story about a border that
separates two vastly different countries,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.460
but it's moreso a story about policy:

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.800
how centuries of racist policies, from

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.760
the French, from the U.S., from the world,
from the DR, can hold a nation back from progressing.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.880
Haiti, this first black
republic, has experienced some of the most

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.100
predatory and racist policy from outside
forces.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.380
For Haitians this story isn't just their history.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.620
It's their present.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.020
It's the stage on which they live their lives.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.940
So, I want to say a big thank you to lululemon,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.940
who is a sponsor for Borders.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.860
They sent me these ABC pants,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.940
which are these really versatile, flexible pants.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.000
They're super sturdy,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.980
and they're meant to be basically used for hiking and for activewear,

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.840
but also around the house when I'm kind of just hanging out,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.120
I've been using them for both as I've been making Borders.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.880
I love them.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.880
Thank you lululemon for sending me these pants,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.760
but more importantly thank you for sponsoring Borders

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.460
and making this happen.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.560
If you want to try out some lululemon ABC pants,

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.980
You could get a pair of your own.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.020
You should definitely check that out.
