00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.703
So you have to-- just the first
thing that comes to your mind,

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:04.620
you say it, and then
you hit this, OK?

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.190
OK.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.270
The first thing that
comes to your mind.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.770
Come on.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.300
Who was your first
celebrity crush?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.056
Diane Lane.

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:09.870
[DING]

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.330
Wow, and then you just
worked with her again.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.090
And I just worked with her.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.589
Yeah.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.885
What's the weirdest thing
you've done to make money?

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:18.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.470
It's also illegal.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.910
[DING]

00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:22.670
So I'm not telling you.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.789
[DING]

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.080
It could come back to haunt me.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.580
[DING]

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.510
All right.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.846
Who do you think is
the sexiest man alive?

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.700
[CHUCKLES] I always
say, I was on the cover

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.344
and I'm still alive.

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:35.885
Right now, I believe
it's Idris Elba.

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:36.150
[DING]

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.761
Yeah.

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:37.260
All right.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080
[CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.580
What is the most rebellious
thing you did as a teenager?

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.180
Oh, at 13, I got really
mad at the parents,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.210
and I'm running away.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840
And as soon as they went,
oh, you are, and they beat me

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.810
to my room to start packing
my bags, helping me,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.480
and then pushed me
out the door, I went,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.890
oh, I don't think
I really want to go

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.196
as bad as I thought I did.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:56.696
[DING]

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.150
Yeah, I wasn't that rebellious.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.280
No, not at all.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.990
What's something you do
that embarrasses your kids?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.080
Sing, hum, and dance a lot--

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.710
[DING]

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.310
--anywhere.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.210
All right.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.540
Besides making love, showering,
swimming, or playing bongos,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.404
what is something else
you enjoy doing naked?

00:01:15.404 --> 00:01:18.771
[LAUGHING]

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800
What were the list of
the first six things?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.720
Making love, swimming,
showering, or playing bongos.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.750
What else do you
enjoy doing naked?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.741
Cooking, if we're not
deep frying anything.

00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:31.703
[DING]

00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:34.590
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.532
What do you usually wear to bed?

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:38.490
So to answer that one
before, the other thing I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.020
like to do besides just--

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.840
sleep--

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.340
[DING]

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.970
--naked.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.990
Naked.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.630
What celebrity can you
do an impression of?

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.380
I don't do impressions
of celebrities.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.100
OK.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.540
[DING]

00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:51.830
There's a lot of anger
when you hit that thing.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.650
What onscreen co-star were
you most nervous to kiss?

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.872
I'm happy to say I'm going back
through a bit of a log here

00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:01.071
of--

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:02.070
That could take a while.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.790
Help me out.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.290
Yeah.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.581
[LAUGHS]

00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.330
Not Diane, because you
had a crush on her?

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.163
We did kiss, but you
haven't seen the movie.

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:09.216
So yes, we did.

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:10.090
That's a good answer.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.590
Thank you--

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.089
OK.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.682
--Ellen.

00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:14.140
Diane Lane, because I did have
a crush on her from Lonesome

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.670
Dove, when she was
Lorrie Darlin'.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.561
So I was kissing myself.

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.270
[DING]

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.781
How did your wife
feel about that?

00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:20.280
Wonderful.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.779
[DING]

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.500
What's a ridiculous
thing you're afraid of?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.540
Oh, backflips.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.010
It's ridiculous, and
I'm afraid of them.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.761
[DING]

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:35.620
I agree with you.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.620
When you can't sleep in
the middle of the night,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.565
what do you do?

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:44.940
Hm, well, I go to this Calm
app and listen to this reading.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.510
Of yourself.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.274
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:48.156
[DING]

00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:51.450
Oh, there's a Calm app, because
his voice is so soothing

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.837
that he actually did--

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:53.670
you have to hear it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.650
Serenity opens in
theaters this Friday.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.680
We'll be right back.
