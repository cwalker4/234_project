CONVERSATION THIS MORNING, CFRA

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:10.786
STRATEGISTS LINDSEY BELL,

00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:13.288
AMERICAN B ENTERPRISE PRESIDENT,

SAVE AMERICA FROM THE CULTURE OF

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:24.299
CONTEMPT.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.601
PERFECT TIMING TO WRITE SUCH A

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:29.705
BOOK WITH ALL OF THE POLARIZING.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:30.505
&gt;&gt; FOR SURE, OVER THE LAST

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:35.477
COUPLE OF YEARS I HAVE SEEN

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:37.846
FREIGHT TRAIN, ONE AND SIX

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:38.714
AMERICANS STOPPED TALKING TO

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:40.349
FAMILY MEMBER OR CLOSE FRIEND

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.818
BECAUSE OF POLITICS SINCE 2016

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.419
ELECTION, WONDERFUL STUFF THAT

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.422
SHOWS THAT WE ARE MORE POLARIZED

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:48.991
THAN ISRAELI AND PALESTINIANS,

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:50.025
THAT'S HOW MUCH WE DON'T

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:51.927
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, I WROTE A

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:56.932
BOOK ON HOW WE CAN BE MORE PER

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:02.371
-- PERSUASIVE AND GUIDEBOOK TO

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.072
DO THAT.

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:09.011
&gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT TRUMP DERANGEMENT

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:09.444
SYNDROME?

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:10.512
&gt;&gt; 93% OF US DON'T WANT TO HATE

00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:14.850
OUR NEIGHBORS, SO WE ACTUALLY

00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:16.218
CAN DISAGREE, WE SHOULD

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.787
DISAGREE, BUT WE CAN DO SO AND

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:20.188
BE HAPPIER AND WIN MORE

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.592
ARGUMENTS IF WE DO IT RIGHT.

00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:25.661
DAGEN: STAY OFF SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:26.995
&gt;&gt; FOR SURE.

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:27.663
DAGEN: EVEN OVER THE WEEKEND

00:01:27.664 --> 00:01:28.397
IT'S THE LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE

00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:32.367
USE FOR ATTENTION, I WAS LOOKING

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:34.536
AT ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:35.971
LITTLE SPEECH AT SOUTH BY

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:37.339
SOUTHWEST AND SHE WAS TALKING

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.208
ABOUT AUTOMATION AND THE USE OF

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.043
THE RISE OF ROBOTS IN THE

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:42.077
WORKPLACE AND SHE SAID, WE

00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:46.081
SHOULD NOT BE HAUNTED BY THE

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:47.449
SPECTER OF BEING AUTOMATED OUT

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.151
OF WORK AND WE SHOULD BE EXCITED

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:50.819
BY IT AND THE REASON WE ARE NOT

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.354
EXCITED BECAUSE WE LIVE IN

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:54.189
SOCIETY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.658
YOU ARE LEFT TO DIE, THAT'S AT

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.395
ITS CORE, IT'S THAT KIND OF

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:03.066
LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE SAY THINGS

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:05.201
FOR ATTENTION AND LET THEM GET

00:02:05.202 --> 00:02:07.570
AWAY WITH IT AND I JUST QUOTE IT

00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:10.607
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM.

00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:11.307
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SOCIAL

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:12.075
MEDIA, ANONYMOUS, THEY SAY

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:13.309
THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T EVER

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.677
SAY IN PERSON AND JUST IN

00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:16.312
GENERAL YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN WHEN

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:18.681
YOU'RE NOT IN PERSON LOOKING

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:20.550
INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S EYES, WE

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.051
DON'T SEE ANOTHER PERSON THAT

00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:23.219
HAS DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW, I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.421
DO RECOMMEND TO TAKE A LOT MORE

00:02:25.422 --> 00:02:26.789
TIME OFF SOCIAL MEDIA, I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.092
RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE WHEN ON

00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:30.693
SOCIAL MEDIA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:33.663
FOR WHAT THEY SAY, MUTE 7%S OF

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:35.365
AMERICANS THAT ARE TRYING TO

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:40.271
FIRING US UP THAT MAKE US ANGRY
