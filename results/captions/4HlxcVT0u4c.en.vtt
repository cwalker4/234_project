00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.637

00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:04.587

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:05.640

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.180
Yeah, last week my wife
cracked up the car,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.013
she hit a deer,

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:09.034
it was in a zoo.

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:10.460
(laughter and applause)

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.810
Oh, my wife took her driver's test,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.643
she was happy.

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:13.630
She got 18 out of 20,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.129

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.576
(laughter and applause)

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:20.393
That's alright, what the heck, you know.

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.040
I tell ya with my wife
there's always something,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.873
you know?

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:23.850
Well, the other day I called her up,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.683
I said to her, honey,

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:26.090
I've been thinkin' about
the last time we had sex,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.030
I'm gettin' excited,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.243
she said, who is this?

00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:32.117
(laughter and applause)

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:33.760
With my wife, I got no sex life either,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.576
just when I get goin' she wakes up.

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:39.237
(laughter and applause)

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:40.150
I mean the other night I told her,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.470
I said don't laugh behind my back,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.494
she said I won't the funny
stuff's on the other side.

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.827
(laughter and applause)

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.380
Man, I tell ya I can't relax, ya know?

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.750
My dog drives me nuts.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.020
My dog, he wants me to mate him,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.853
I wouldn't mate him,

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:58.185
let him go through what I go through.

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:00.800
(laughter and applause)

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.630
My daughter too, she's no bargain either.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.439
In public school she was
voted most likely to conceive.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.640
(laughter and applause)

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.473
My daughter,

00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:08.420
she's been picked up so many times

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.570
she's startin' to grow handles.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.840
(laughter and applause)

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.917
I mean it, kids today
they got it too good,

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:15.330
when I was a kid it was different,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.163
I had it rough.

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:18.557
With Christmas I got
batteries, toys not included.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:21.220
(laughter and applause)

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.530
My old man he didn't help at all.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.677
My old man, we used to
play tag and he'd drive.

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:28.116
(laughter and applause)

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:28.970
I mean are you kidding?

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.070
My old man never liked me.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.903
When he took me hunting,

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:32.349
he gave me a three minute head start.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.160
(laughter and applause)

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.660
And on the way home he'd
tie me to the fender,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.528
put the deer in the car.

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:38.757
(laughter and applause)

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:40.260
I tell you when I was
a kid I was ugly too,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.200
I told my old man he
never took me to the zoo,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.812
he said if they want you
they'll come and get you.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.233
(laughter and applause)

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.066
Are you kiddin'?

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:46.899
I know I'm ugly.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.140
Halloween my wife sends the kids out

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.973
dressed like me.

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:52.786
(laughter and applause)

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:53.677
Are you kiddin'?

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:54.653
You know when you're ugly,

00:01:54.653 --> 00:01:57.177
it's alright, you'll work
it out for cryin' out loud.

00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:58.010
You know when you're ugly.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.357
Last Halloween a kid
tried to pull my face off.

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:03.860
(laughter and applause)

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.155
I mean it, that's the story of my life,

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.016
no respect, I don't get no respect at all,

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:07.887
are you kiddin'?

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:09.407
No respect from anybody, nobody,

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:11.720
it's no easy, are you kiddin'?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.910
No respect at all.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.350
Why I donated to a sperm bank,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.098
now I'm the father of three puppies.

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:18.926
(laughter and applause)

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.130
I don't get no respect from anyone,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.200
well the other night I fell asleep

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.300
with a cigarette in my hand,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.327
my wife lit it.

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:25.780
(laughter and applause)

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.450
I tell ya, it's not easy bein' me.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.080
I called up Alcoholics Anonymous

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.909
they told me it was Miller time.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.759
(applause)

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.259
(jazzy music)

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:47.807
- Your kinda folks, right?

00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:50.618

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:51.759
- You like it out here, don't you?

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:52.592
- Sure, sure.

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:54.240

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.189
That's high class stuff.

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.022

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.250
- Different network.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.601
I'll give ya two guesses.

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:11.050

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.883

Aretha Franklin, queen of soul,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.010

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.080
And Valerie Perrine's in it too,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.350

00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:22.270
(laughter and applause)

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.840
No, but thing's are goin'

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.694
- Good, huh?

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:25.810

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:30.126
(laughter and applause)

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.631
No, but show business is tough, Johnny,

00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:33.464
you know that's tough.

00:03:33.464 --> 00:03:34.490
- - It's a tough business, tough, tough.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.330
- Are you kiddin'?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.163
I mean what's easy?

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:37.370
Everybody has it tough, everybody.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.463
I mean hookers are givin' away toasters.

00:03:39.463 --> 00:03:40.811
(laughter and applause)

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:42.111
- It's the economy I guess.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:42.944
- Everything, everything.

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:43.777
It's a rough racket,

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:44.610

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.443
Everybody's lookin' for love though,

deep love, a lifetime of deep love,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.172
I'm lookin' for a shallow half hour.

00:03:48.172 --> 00:03:49.255
- Well, yeah.

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:51.375

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:52.342

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:53.510
I'm not a shallow guy, are you kiddin'?

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.343
I mean people look at me,

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:55.400
they figure I'm the type of guy

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.740
I get drunk and go to the track, right?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.573
And they're wrong,

00:03:57.573 --> 00:03:59.601
I get high first, then I get
drunk and go to the track,

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:00.434
know what I mean?

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:01.267
(laughter and applause)

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:02.100
No, I'm not a shallow guy,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.933
are you kiddin'?

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:03.812
I'm a good lover, though, with girls.

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:04.777
I make love to a girl

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.400
and she scratches, she screams

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.280
then she realizes I'm not
gonna take no for an answer.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.613
(laughter and applause)

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.701
That's alright.

00:04:16.043 --> 00:04:18.440
No, the girls I get aren't
worth gettin' anyway,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.273

00:04:19.273 --> 00:04:20.530

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.783
You don't get pretty girls?

00:04:33.783 --> 00:04:35.390
- She got a job sittin'
in the front end of trucks

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.583
while they change the rear tires.

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:37.416
- [Johnny] I didn't know that.

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:38.280

- [Johnny] Heavy girl.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:41.612
- When she tried computer dating

00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:42.617
the machine matched her up with Detroit.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:43.770
(laughter and applause)

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.193

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.597
I got jetlag.

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:49.430
Are you kiddin'?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.263
She was fat.

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:51.096
(laughter and applause)

00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:52.505
I mean this girl was fat and ugly.

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:53.338
- Ugly, huh?

00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:54.171

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.004
- How ugly?

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:56.150
Well Christmas they hang
her and kiss the mistletoe,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.177
okay, she's ugly I'm telling ya.

00:04:58.177 --> 00:04:59.217
- [Johnny] That's a bad lookin' girl.

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:00.050
- Ugly chick,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.883
when I took her to the beach

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:01.950
they asked me what I used for bait.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.053
Bait.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.150
(laughter and applause)

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.983
When she walks in the room,

00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:08.870
mice jump on chairs.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.038
Are you kiddin'?

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:10.871
(laughter and applause)

00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:11.704
- That's an unpleasant looking girl.

00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:12.550
- That's enough talk about girls,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.383
let's talk about health,

00:05:13.383 --> 00:05:14.216
