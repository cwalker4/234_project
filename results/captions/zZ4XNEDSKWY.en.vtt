00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- Hey Steve.

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.630
I'm 25, and I'm single,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.630
and I have a stutter, and I'm
trying to find love and stuff,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.060
and I feel that guys

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.743
and people don't really take me seriously.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.630
So, I was wondering,
because I know you talked

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.231
about having a speech
impediment when you were a kid,

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:28.100
and you inspired me, and
you came so far, obviously,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.330
and I look up to that so much,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.450
and I was wondering if you had any advice,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.210
because I don't want men to call it cute.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.400
I wanna be taken seriously.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.960
So, what is your advice for that please?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.793
- Okay.

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:46.400
First of all, let me say this to you:

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.193
Stuttering is curable.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.530
It's nothing physically wrong with you.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.560
See, that's what I had to
learn; I stuttered severely.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.470
I mean, what you're doing
right now is nothing

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.970
to compare to what I was.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.240
I was in a war with it, man.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.090
Let me ask you, and I'm
not knocking therapists,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.630
but most people who work

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.400
with kids who stutter
have never stuttered.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.540
They don't even know the pain, man.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.373
- [Woman] Yes.

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:19.530
- They don't even know
how deep this thing is.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.370
So let me ask you a few questions:

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.260
When you read, do you stutter?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.360
- [Woman] No.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600
- When you talk to
yourself, do you stutter?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440
- [Woman] Not at all.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.097
- When you think out loud do you stutter?

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:30.930
- [Woman] No.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380
- That's because there's
nothing wrong with you.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.720
Now, they've been giving
you all these drills

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.660
and stuff over the years,
words to stay away from.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.420
I went to all of them class;
ain't none of that work, dog.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.253
'Cause you know why?

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:46.700
Once you give a person a
word to stay away from,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.500
don't that tighten your
butt up a little bit?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.430
(audience laughs)

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.690
'Cause hell, how you gonna
stay away from words?

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.696
You can't stop nobody from talking.

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:55.850
- Yes.
- You know what I mean?

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.503
Stay away from S-T sounds;
stay away from P-R sound.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.810
S-T is the worse; once
you say ST, you crying.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080
I don't want you to cry;
I really can help you.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.430
- I know, and it's taking
a lot, 'cause like,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.000
this is I think the first time

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.740
I've really admitted it publicly,
and that's like my fear,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.790
but I thank you so much.
(audience claps)

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.420
This is a lot; I feel empowered by it.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.453
- Okay, listen to this:
Stuttering is all here.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.000
You're okay; you ain't got to let

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.490
nobody try to tell you no different.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.080
What makes you stutter is the anticipation

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.070
that you're going to stutter.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.220
That's the whole lot right there.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.630
That's the one thing
therapists don't know.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.190
So when they give you all these drills

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.400
to study these words and all like this,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.080
they don't even know
what they talking about,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.470
man, this dude is tripping.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.540
I'm finna stutter, so here come a girl.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.415
Come here, can you come here?

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:57.680
- Yeah.
(audience claps)

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.970
- Okay, now listen to me.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.854
Stuttering is curable.

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:05.020
Imma show you just a little
drill I do with kids,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.430
'cause I know how to stop it.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.300
What happens is, you should
not respond to anybody

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.330
until you've said the answer
to yourself three times.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.130
That's for starter, see,
you ain't heard that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.435
at the therapist thing.
- No. (laughs)

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:21.459
- 'Cause they don't know
that move right there.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.850
(audience laughs sparsely)

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.390
I could not talk outside my house.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.010
I flunked out of school 'cause of this.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.380
I'm this vicious man, but look at me now.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.423
So here's the deal.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.590
Your anticipation of
stuttering what stops you,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.140
so I want you to take this mic.

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.403
I'm gonna want you to walk over there;

00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:45.950
Imma walk towards you.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.650
Imma ask you a question;
before you answer the question,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.380
I want you to say it to
yourself three times, slowly,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.940
and when the fourth or fifth time,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.570
when you feel comfortable,
just say it out loud, okay?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.972
- Okay.
- Alright, go over there.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.924
(Steve mumbles)

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:02.832
(audience claps)

00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:05.636
Okay, hold tight, 'cause you
gotta give it a shot first.

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:06.820
(audience laughs sparsely)

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.223
Okay, so, I want you to
walk slowly towards me.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.350
How you doing today?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.830
- I'm good.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.260
- Okay, that's one.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.040
See, you don't say anything until you,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.236
did you say it to yourself?

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:20.182
- [Woman] Yes, three times.

00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:21.015
- Three times?
- Three times.

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:22.040
- And then when you felt good,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.190
you just said it.
- Yeah.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.420
- That's the beginning right there.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.640
Don't talk to anybody until you said

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.360
your response three times
internally, then say it.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.550
Okay, walk towards me.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.677
Okay, who's the president
of the United States?

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.119
- Unfortunately, Trump.

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:41.015
(audience laughs)

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:42.385
- Oh, you doing jokes too?

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.612
(laughs)
(audience claps)

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:47.010
Do you understand?

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.670
- Yes.
- We don't have a lot of time,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.710
but in one hour, I can
stop you from stuttering.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.776
In one hour, you will never stutter again.

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.830
- [Woman] Please.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.950
- Okay, let me tell
you, this is the drill.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.320
This is the first thing I want you to do.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.350
If you could do that in front
of people, it's easy to do.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.870
Second thing I want you to do,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.630
is stand in front of the mirror

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.833
and talk out loud all the time.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.270
Then, I want you to bring a
close friend or relative here,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.973
and have them stand
behind you in the mirror.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.420
Don't look at them; what makes
you stutter is eye contact.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.370
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.370
- You know why?

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.370
Because when you look at
people who know you stutter,

00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:34.127
this how y'all do people who stutter:

00:05:34.127 --> 00:05:36.566
"So how you doing today?"

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.816
(laughing)

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.590
That's what you do,
'cause you can't help it,

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.740
'cause you know you gonna
be there for a while,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.090
and you just trying to wait it out.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.923
How long?

00:05:49.923 --> 00:05:50.756
Come on.

00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:53.660
How long we've been, yes.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.610
But what happens to the stutterer is that

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.557
they see your anxiety,
puts more anxiety in them,

00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:01.813
and then they lock on.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.520
If you just do those things right there,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.390
and then imma get somebody
to give you a schedule;

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.872
imma talk you through a couple of things.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.190
You won't be stuttering
about Thanksgiving.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.023
(audience cheers)

00:06:15.023 --> 00:06:16.250
Okay?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.849
- Thank you.

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.266
- [Steve] Really.
