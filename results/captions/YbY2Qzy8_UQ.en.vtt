00:00:00.456 --> 00:00:02.038
- Do you want to gain muscle instantly?

00:00:02.038 --> 00:00:04.472
Then try Red Cow Muscle Solution.

00:00:04.472 --> 00:00:06.386
This doesn't look healthy.

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:08.303
Just in my mouth? Okay.

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:13.121
Nothing happened.

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:15.983
Of course it did, stupid. Call now.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.816
(whimsical music)

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.478
This one's for all of
you who always wished,

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.548
"Why can't they make a highly suggestive

00:00:30.548 --> 00:00:32.279
workout tool for me?"

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.690
The Shake Weight is a
phallic looking object

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.849
that was initially marketed towards women

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:39.804
as an oscillating dumbbell that claims

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:42.507
it increases the impact of exercise.

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:44.628
At nearly $20 per Shake Weight,

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.121
plus shipping and handling of course,

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:49.238
these things sold rapidly in no small part

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:52.067
due to the viral
commercials that had people

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.331
laughing so hard, they
must have been dying

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:56.983
to know if the product was even real.

00:00:56.983 --> 00:00:58.658
In the first year that it was released,

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.497
the Shake Weight made over $40 million

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:05.291
for Fitness IQ and the
man behind it, Ben Kunz.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.184
In 2011, Consumer Reports released a study

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:11.535
in which they found that doing
the Shake Weight routines

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:13.784
actually burned less calories

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:17.322
than simply walking at a reasonable pace.

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:21.225
So don't waste your money
looking like you're, you know.

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:23.475
Just go for a walk instead.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:27.620
Just in case you didn't feel nerdy enough

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.449
with those pens in your pocket or purse,

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:31.548
now you can wear that ballpoint

00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:34.050
around your neck like a real playa.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.307
What's that, you want more? You got it.

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:38.311
Boom, it's a digital clock, too.

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.260
Nailed it.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.400
Marketed to those who are always dropping,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.617
breaking, or otherwise losing their pens,

00:01:43.617 --> 00:01:47.070
the Magnescribe Pen is a
writing tool that connects

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.310
to a circular clock you
wear around your neck.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.015
Simply by pulling it out of its dock,

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:53.231
you can be writing in seconds,

00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:55.732
like, you know, two
seconds sooner than it was

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.318
if, you know, you had it
in your purse or pocket.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.430
The commercial makes it seem like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.760
this thing is essential for your life.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.153
Why glance at your watch or phone

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:06.334
when you could awkwardly
draw up the string around

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:09.127
your neck and turn the
tiny clock to face you?

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:10.690
Sounds like a good idea to me.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.364
The commercial also fails to address

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.497
what happens when you
ultimately lose the pen

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:17.370
that belongs in the magnet pendant.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.167
Well, you just gotta buy
another one, obviously.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:23.844
Have you ever returned from
a nice walk and thought,

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:26.611
"Man, I wish that walk
could've been more difficult

00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.595
and full of embarrassing mishaps"?

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:30.731
If so, do I have the perfect solution

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:33.128
to your too solid walking problem.

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:34.288
Toning shoes.

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:36.677
This new footwear is
keeping people on their toes

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.242
with different styles such
as rocker bottom sole,

00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:42.978
curved soul, and collapsible heel sole,

00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:46.206
and by promising to aid
in burning more calories

00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:48.938
with each step, improving muscle strength,

00:02:48.938 --> 00:02:50.911
and bettering overall balance,

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:53.256
while making walking, of
course, more difficult.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.565
But of course, studies show
that they don't do those things.

00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:57.915
At all.

00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:01.668
In fact, on May 25th, 2011,
Consumer Reports revealed

00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:04.351
that most types of
toning shoes just created

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.421
increased risks of
injury to their wearers.

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.177
Twisted ankles, muscle
tears, and even broken bones

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:13.140
were becoming common,
with some of the injuries

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.122
actually requiring surgery to fix.

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:17.332
Stick to normal shoes, people.

00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:19.249
There are no shortcuts.

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:23.524
Ugh, isn't preparing pasta such a chore,

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:26.025
all that boiling and waiting patiently?

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:27.508
And don't you just hate all those dishes

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.070
that you have to do after you cook it?

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.467
Well, lucky for you, the Pasta Pro is here

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.634
to make your life much easier.

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:36.451
Basically a pot with
holes in the top of it

00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:37.712
for straining the water,

00:03:37.712 --> 00:03:39.181
this thing's gonna revolutionize

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:41.189
how you soften your noodles.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.696
Just boil, dump, and
then do everything else

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:44.754
you'd normally do.

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:46.531
Of course, the Pasta Pro barely decreases

00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:48.142
any amount of dishes that you have to do,

00:03:48.142 --> 00:03:50.495
merely eliminating the strainer,

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.641
which you probably eliminated anyway

00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:55.413
if you use the lift
the pod lid just enough

00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:58.013
for the water to spill out
but not the noodles approach.

00:03:58.013 --> 00:04:00.076
Still though, how can you go without it?

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:02.413
The best part of this as seen on TV item

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:03.824
is the commercial itself,

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:06.537
which expresses the product's versatility,

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:07.951
which allows it to be used

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:11.065
on either a gas or electric stove top.

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:15.356
You know, like pretty much
every other pot in existence.

00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:16.189
So.

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:21.447
Want to improve your strength,
dexterity, flexibility,

00:04:21.447 --> 00:04:23.682
but without actually working for it?

00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:25.198
Try the Power Bracelet.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.057
This company, whose CEO
and PR team by the way,

00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:29.843
must go through a lot of undergarments

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:31.979
with their pants constantly
catching on fire,

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.333
created some plastic wrist
accessories that promise you

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:39.701
an increase in physical
attributes simply by wearing them,

00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.201
or, at least they did.

00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:43.929
That is, until they were
forced by an Australian

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:46.623
competition in consumer commission ruling

00:04:46.623 --> 00:04:49.306
in 2011 to retract their claims.

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:52.128
They also had to apologize
and pay out around,

00:04:52.128 --> 00:04:53.542
I don't know, somewhere around the tune

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:56.596
of $57 million for false advertising.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.915
The false advertising claimed

00:04:57.915 --> 00:04:59.587
that the enhancements occurred

00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:01.849
due to holographic technology,

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.905
which was basically a sticker
on the front of the bracelet.

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:06.681
How people believed the company's lies,

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.315
I'll never understand, but many did,

00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:12.169
and shelled out around $30 per unit,

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.782
and they sold a whole lot of 'em.

00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:16.699
There's a sucker born every minute.

00:05:19.357 --> 00:05:20.664
It happens all the time.

00:05:20.664 --> 00:05:23.965
A happy newlywed couple are
settling down for the night

00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:27.328
when suddenly one of them
farts, ending the bliss forever

00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.690
in the stench of the possessed element

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.292
that is now hovering around them.

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:33.212
Next thing you know, they're
in a bitter custody battle

00:05:33.212 --> 00:05:35.201
as the divorce papers get finalized.

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.669
If you don't want this to happen to you,

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.047
then you've got to get
the Marriage Blanket.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.773
This ridiculous product
sells for just $29.99

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:42.962
plus shipping and handling,

00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:44.555
and promises to protect your union

00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:47.115
from the bodily functions you experience

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:50.550
by insulating you against
each other's odors.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.556
Made from activated carbon fabric,

00:05:52.556 --> 00:05:55.079
which apparently is
what the military needs

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:58.356
to protect soldiers from
chemical weapon attacks,

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:01.091
the Marriage Blanket
absorbs your flatulence

00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:03.601
and saves you from a nasty divorce.

00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:05.271
Of course, a real
partnership could survive

00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:07.392
a little poopy gas, but
don't go tellin' that

00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:09.037
to all those potential customers.

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:11.008
To them, it's just silly nonsense.

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.340
Legit though, how bad
your farts gots to be

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.934
to make me wanna get a divorce with you?

00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:18.351
Less Taco Bell, more veggies.

00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:25.109
As ripoffs go, few are more
clearly not worth your money

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:27.857
than those which promise
you healthier life

00:06:27.857 --> 00:06:31.879
and the chance to shed those
excess pounds without exercise,

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.911
like by simply, you know, taking a pill.

00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:37.198
However, that's what a number
of TV commercials advertised

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:40.383
for companies like
Enforma Natural Products,

00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:44.033
who in April of 2000
was ordered to settle up

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:46.074
with the Federal Trade
Commission's charges

00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:49.452
and pay $10 million in consumer redress

00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:52.632
after misleading customers
with their products.

00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:54.979
Their products included
Exercise in a Bottle,

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.996
Fat Absorber, Fat Trapper,
and Fat Trapper Plus.

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:01.231
Calling these products miracle drugs,

00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:02.866
the people behind these lies

00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:06.091
actually had the nerve to try it again,

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:09.005
this time falsifying scientific studies

00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:12.175
and violating the court
order by advertising

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:16.877
and selling new products,
Acceleron and Chitozyme.

00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:19.120
In case you didn't know, there's no pill

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.548
that can make you lose weight.

00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:22.861
It's all proper diet and exercise.

00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:24.544
Unless it's a laxative, in which case,

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.320
you'd probably lose a
little bit of weight.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.987
Sorry, that's gross.

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:32.916
Man, when you gotta go,
you gotta go, am I right?

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:35.661
But when you're about to
tee off on that 10th hole

00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:38.910
and that urge to pee creeps
up on ya, what do you do?

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.743
What's that?

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:41.437
You wanna find a toilet, outhouse,

00:07:41.437 --> 00:07:43.545
or bushes like a normal human being?

00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:44.854
Why on earth would you do that

00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:47.873
when there are products
like Uroclub to assist you?

00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:50.814
This incredibly ridiculous
secret pee pee reservoir

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:53.505
makes the perfect gift
for golfers who can't be

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:56.327
more than eight feet from
a bathroom at all times.

00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:58.359
Grandpa, lookin' at you.

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:00.419
The Uroclub looks like a normal golf club,

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.444
except the end of the grip
unscrews to reveal a tube

00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:06.586
that's ready to receive your three wood.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.408
By covering your crotch area
with the provided green towel

00:08:09.408 --> 00:08:12.190
and putting your business inside the club,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.914
relieving yourself is exactly
the same as using a facility,

00:08:15.914 --> 00:08:18.941
only more complicated and obvious.

00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:19.984
Ever wonder why your dad takes

00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:21.659
a really long time before putting?

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:23.242
Yeah, now you know.

00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:26.622
When it comes to false advertising,

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:30.289
it seems like sometimes hiding
the lies in a hint of truth

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.430
makes the advertisers sleep better.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.013
Take Sauna Suits, or the
more modern Sauna Shorts,

00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:36.856
for example.

00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:39.465
These things promise to strip
you of those extra pounds

00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:43.362
by making you sweat more, but
they're far from a good idea.

00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:45.322
Now, the truth is in the sweating part.

00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:47.737
The suits and shorts keep the heat in,

00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:50.422
increasing your body heat,
which makes you sweat.

00:08:50.422 --> 00:08:52.676
Now, while yes, you lose water weight

00:08:52.676 --> 00:08:56.100
while you sweat excessively,
it's a temporary fix.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.942
The first thing you have to do
is drink water to compensate,

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:01.300
and that's just going to
bring the weight right back.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.233
What's worse is using Sauna Suits, shirts,

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:06.523
or any similar style of
attempted weight loss

00:09:06.523 --> 00:09:09.133
can do some real damage to your body.

00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:12.089
Excessive sweating can
lead to severe dehydration,

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:15.176
which in turn can lead to organ failure.

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:17.850
This one's not just a
ripoff, it's life-risking,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.375
but hey, if you wanna lose some pounds,

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:22.708
sometimes you just gotta ride the snake.

00:09:25.142 --> 00:09:27.119
Don't you just hate it when
you're doing your business,

00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:29.264
you know, dropping the
kids off at the pool,

00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:30.199
you know what I'm sayin',

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:31.946
and there's absolutely
nothing to do but sit there

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.421
and wait for nature's
movements to be over with?

00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:37.504
Sure, you could read my book,
Mind=Blown or a magazine

00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:40.097
or get back to those texts
that you've been putting off,

00:09:40.097 --> 00:09:42.064
but there's got to be something that,

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.381
while spectacularly unnecessary,

00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:46.131
will give you something to do

00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:48.122
and maybe even teach you something.

00:09:48.122 --> 00:09:51.039
Well, yes, there is, the Potty Putter.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:54.785
Though now widely considered
a gag gift for avid golfers,

00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:57.941
this bathroom distraction
had a real TV commercial

00:09:57.941 --> 00:10:00.913
teasing it would take
some strokes off your game

00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:02.592
for only $19.99.

00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:05.096
The ad actually promised
to make you healthier

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:06.956
by not rushing your business,

00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:08.982
claiming with the Potty Putter,

00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:12.026
you'll take time to play with your putter.

00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:13.888
Of course, the whole thing
is incredibly awkward

00:10:13.888 --> 00:10:15.931
as nobody puts in a squatting position,

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:17.994
and if you do, they're
probably pooping their pants

00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:20.167
and you should get
authorities immediately.

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:21.985
But hey, thank you guys
so much for watching this,

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:24.426
and if you got a laugh out of
it or you learned something,

00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:26.727
any of the above, drop a like on it.

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:28.950
And of course, don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't yet.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.123
I'm going to have a brand
new video for you tomorrow

00:10:31.123 --> 00:10:34.549
at 12 west coast time,
three Eastern Standard Time,

00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:35.622
so make sure you come by then.

00:10:35.622 --> 00:10:36.549
Have a great day.

00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:37.697
Make sure you're smiling today, baby.

00:10:37.697 --> 00:10:38.966
Don't go buying any of these products,

00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:39.964
and I'll see you then.

00:10:39.964 --> 00:10:40.797
Peace.
