00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.990
Nighttime in Russia
YouTube channel illustrated magazine published

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.309
yet another crazy Russian video in November
of 2013.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.930
Get ready for it.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.440
A highway in the darkness of night.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.599
Some light music.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.599
Headlights.

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.599
The road.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.430
And then, out of nowhere…

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.470
Why an enormous bundle of sticks blasted into
the middle of the road at that moment, who

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.470
knows.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.059
All I know is that this driver is a pro.

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.090
He kept his wits about him enough to not overcorrect,
even though this clearly scared him as much

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.530
as it did us.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.710
Probably, more so.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.180
While this could have been a falling branch
or tree, the right side of the road seems

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.519
to be clear of trees, and the branches appear
to be chucked straight down onto the highway.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.300
This was certainly a terrifying event, and
with no explanation.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.249
We may never know who threw those sticks.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:03.929
14.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.671
Near Overturn
This is another amazing yet scary save, published

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:13.360
by Life Trucking in May of 2017.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.890
Watch as a car, driving alongside a semi,
comes closer to loss of life than they likely

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.880
ever imagined.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.159
As the two drive parallel down the highway,
the semi is passing the vehicle when suddenly

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.000
its cargo tips.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.009
The big rig goes up on its left wheels.

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.149
Those in the car must have been suprised to
see the semi nearly toppling onto them, before

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.640
the driver manages to return the big rig to
its regular balance.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.840
Although surprisingly scary, this driver’s
magical maneuver is worth applauding.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.600
13.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.799
Between Two Coal Trucks
EDUARDO ORTEGA published this scary episode

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.420
in February of 2012.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.719
As you can see, it’s a foggy day with limited
visibility ahead.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.649
That is, until you spot two sets of headlights
heading toward the driver, occupying both

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.049
lanes.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.360
One of the truckers had attempted to pass
the other and was now in the dash cam driver’s

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
lane.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.190
Predicting a terrible incident waiting to
happen, one of the opposite coal truck drivers

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.890
slows down, veering off the roadway and onto
the hard shoulder.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.420
The other doesn’t seem to move out of the
way in the slightest.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.500
Still, the expert trucker manages to thread
the needle and make it through.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.490
The drive cam is even more entertaining, as
you can see the driver look back in disbelief.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.440
He’d just come face-to-face with losing
his life and saw the other side.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.110
Although he has himself to thank for a quick
and clean maneuver, he could give the opposite

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.180
trucker a pat on the back for his knee-jerk
reaction in taking his big rig off the road

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.450
and out of commission.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.170
12.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.030
Russian Truckers vs Highway Bandits
YouTuber SomewhereInRussia published this

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.290
roadside nightmare in September of 2012.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.421
In the video description, he writes: “Author
of the video stopped his truck on the road

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.250
to change the wheel.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.490
3 bandits in blue Lada tried to get ~$100
out of trucker for ‘crossing their territory’.”

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.960
As you can see in the footage, the semi is
idling, while the trucker is likely changing

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.650
the wheel, as the YouTuber stated.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.680
You can see him walk up the road to pick something
up off the ground, walk back, and get in his

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.140
vehicle as the phone rings.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.770
When he answers it, you see the blue Lada
pull up alongside him.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.570
A man in a tracksuit approaches the driver’s
side door.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.750
Next, you can hear the trucker radio for help
and, soon enough, two other big rigs heed

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.090
his call.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.980
Not sure what is said in the back-and-forth,
but a little later, the driver exits his rig

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.260
to confront the bandits alongside his fellow
drivers.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.220
Holding a metal pipe, he walks toward the
group, which has grown from one to more than

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.890
half a dozen.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.070
It seems some of these men are from the bandit
group, while the others are truckers who have

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.480
managed to block the Lada and its bandits
in.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.320
Confrontation kicks off amongst the group.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.810
After the would-be bandit has been thoroughly
pummeled, about a half dozen men are seen

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.360
heaving the Lada, which is parked on the side
of the road, until it rolls onto its roof.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.319
It’s lucky the truckers banded together,
because it seems they’re better together.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.949
The bandits lost.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.770
This time.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.370
11.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.550
Wrong Way
This one is unfortunately fact, not fiction.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.360
On the northbound M40 in Oxfordshire, UK,
someone was headed southbound.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.729
Directly into traffic.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.710
The car and caravan, which were reported to
have “foreign plates,” flew down a five-mile

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.060
stretch of the motorway.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.610
Other drivers swerved out of the way of the
car/caravan combo.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.580
The Subaru Forester, towing the caravan, ended
up driving into a couple vehicles, which took

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.639
the life of one of the drivers, who was thirty
years old, along with the driver and passenger

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.740
of the Subaru, both in their eighties.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.020
This trucker’s dash cam footage shows the
Subaru heading in the opposite direction of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.289
all the other northbound vehicles at the time.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.289
Moments later, the ride would come to a sad
end.

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.189
Police were already on their way, having received
reports that someone was driving the wrong

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:39.680
way down the motorway…and then later receiving
further updates about the event.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.430
10.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.340
Nightmare Alley
This video, published by Dash Cam Owners World

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.500
in April of 2018, shows what it’s like to
cross paths with something not only unexpected…but

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.430
altogether surreal.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.900
The driver is cruising across some backroads,
no other light source in view but his own

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.779
headlights when, all of a sudden, on the right
side of his lane, a woman dressed in white

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.560
comes into view.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.129
On the ground, a dark streak draws a path
to where she stands, as if something wet stains

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.590
the road.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.949
Her right hand is making a jabbing motion.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.060
The driver screams in fright and quickly backs
out of there, as the deranged woman wanders

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.229
aimlessly towards him.

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.870
He keeps backing away, faster and faster,
until the ghost woman is no longer in view.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.090
Some commenters think this must be real.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.220
Others suggest the lady is one of the “black-eyed
kids” that you hear so much about.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.370
Still others think it was a prank gone too
far.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.009
Whether real or not, if I ran into this at
night, I would surely panic.

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:48.759
9.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:53.661
Crazy Face
JoeRobTV showcases another fright in the dark

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.661
of night.

00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:59.819
Published in September of 2017, Joe wrote
that this happened around 9PM at night although

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.569
he didn’t mention the location.

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.319
In the clip, Joe says there was someone walking
in the distance that looked incredibly sketchy.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.599
Then he spots him.

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:14.419
He says the guy is just standing there, beneath
the sign at the side of the road.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.449
He flashes his brights, and the figure finally
comes into view.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.689
It appears to be a guy, dressed in a black
t-shirt and dark jeans.

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:25.710
The driver says he seems to be wearing a mask.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.939
The mask isn’t clear, but something does
seem to be wrong with the drifter’s face.

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:36.029
And as the guy slowly drives past, the figure
approaches, coming toward the passenger side

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:39.120
door, as the driver shouts in terror.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.190
Some YouTubers think this grotesque thing
is a demon.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.139
Others, of course, think it’s a prank.

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:47.370
But one comment stood out from the rest.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.360
Erick Cantú Aguilar from Mexico City said
he came searching for answers after seeing

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.069
something similar.

00:07:55.069 --> 00:08:00.440
In his own words: “One day I was walking
by the street with a friend of mine, we passed

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.360
under a bridge and we both saw something identical
to this being!”

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.729
He said that he knows that most probably won’t
believe him, but finding the same type of

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:11.759
figure online was strange.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:16.380
At least we know Joe got away from this pseudo
demon.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.569
The video made it to the Internet, after all.

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:21.569
8.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:25.810
Bouncy Castle
While bouncy castles are good fun, there’s

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.910
no fun and games on the open road.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:34.821
Published by lacarse in April of 2016, this
dash cam shows the damage that a bouncy castle

00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:36.840
is capable of.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.960
Yet another savvy truck driver shows off his
skills with quick enough reflexes and foresight

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.540
to prevent something seriously bad.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.560
The footage shows a nighttime drive along
the busy interstate.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.900
Lots of folks are on the road, clipping away
at a pretty steady pace.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.280
Then, suddenly, in the middle of one lane
appears a large purple tarp - or what looks

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.090
to be a deflated bouncy castle.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.640
The vehicle in front of the trucker goes around
the obstacle, which appeared on the I-40E

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.980
near Nashville, Tennessee, according to the
video’s description.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.570
But, instead of simply dodging the tarp like
all the others flying down the interstate,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.910
the trucker pulls over, gets out of his car,
and attempts to pull the object off the road

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.410
and onto the shoulder.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.840
Apparently, the bouncy castle is pretty heavy,
because the trucker has a hard time dragging

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.090
it, while dozens of cars pass him by, unable
to spare a thought to help.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:40.330
Regardless, he finally manages to remove it
fully from the lane, gets back in his truck,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.620
and is on his merry way again.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:49.860
Future drivers down the I-40E have this competent
trucker to thank for his action.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.460
7.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.270
Robber Recovery

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.060
Red Pill published the clip in August of 2015.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.470
The semi’s dash cam footage captures a man
pull over his car in front of the big rig,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.960
which was parked on the side of the road.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.470
The trucker was apparently absent from the
cab at the time, perhaps fixing a wheel.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:16.090
The man approaches the passenger’s side
door, likely scoping the semi out, and then,

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.310
seeing it’s empty, goes round to the driver’s
side.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.450
Soon, the man is seen running back to his
vehicle holding a bag.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.990
He pops into the passenger’s side of the
vehicle.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.830
That’s when the truck driver spots him trying
to get away with his valuables and races after

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.830
him.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:38.140
The car attempts to drive off as the man chases,
but he pauses for a moment, and for some unknown

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.330
reason, the would-be robber throws the bag
back out of the passenger’s side door, and

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.130
the trucker retrieves it.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:50.110
Although it’s unclear why the robbers didn’t
complete their take off with the bag, as it

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.590
doesn’t seem like the driver was going to
catch up with them.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.730
Maybe the sight of him was enough to scare
the wits out of them.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.140
6.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.400
Cut Off
Trucker Clinton Rhodes, from the Otago region

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:09.300
of New Zealand, captures loads of dash cam
footage that would have you raging.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.980
Much of the footage he captures is near misses.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.370
But this one in particular could really have
taken someone’s life - or multiple someones.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:25.210
As Rhodes drives steady, a car cuts him off
to take an exit, missing his 34,000 liter-petrol

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.170
tanker by an inch.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:32.390
As you can see, the car was on the opposite
side of the semi before crossing sharply over

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.370
into his lane.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.650
Rhodes notes that drivers are impatient with
big rigs like his and often won’t wait for

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.150
the passing zone, but just go right ahead
and pass on double lines.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.120
A very scary incident avoided.

Mob Mentality
We’ve talked about this event before in

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.530
a previous video, but since then we’ve been
able to uncover more footage of this extremely

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.180
scary situation.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.870
A trucker is cruising down a dark highway
at night with another trucker ahead of him.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:15.590
Suddenly, you hear the truck ahead blare its
horn, as the big rig swerves to avoid hitting

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.270
a makeshift roadblock that a group set up.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.910
The roadblock is trees placed across the road.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.920
The group shines flashlights into the drivers’
eyes, likely hoping to blind them enough to

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.460
stop the big rigs.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.540
Then they could go right ahead and take what
they want.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:38.650
But no luck this time, as both drivers - and
those ahead of them - make it through.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.760
This happened in a port city in northern France,
across the English Channel from Dover.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.350
This second video shows the same event to
even more terrifying effect, as the dash cam

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.900
of the first truck in the lineup captures
the lead up to the event.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:00.120
More of the mob appear on the road, throwing
rocks and branches and attempting to stop

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.720
the driver.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.060
As the driver continues forward and spots
the branch, he starts to back his big rig

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.060
up.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:17.200
And that’s when the mob starts shouting
and throwing stones, thinking they’ve got

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.160
him.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.200
The sheer amount of people attacking is enough
to make one fear for his life.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.510
But, thankfully, the driver doesn’t let
fear get to him.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.330
He blares his horn into the night, drives
forward, and the men start jumping over the

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.580
railings.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:40.300
He plows over the trees and is on his way
again.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.000
Eighteen Wheeler
This video first appeared on Real TV in 2001.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.020
The uploader describes this footage, writing,
“This seems to happen more often than you

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.040
might think.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:59.010
A truck driver might hear of a police pursuit
coming his way via CB radio and he might actually

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.740
try to block the driver's path.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:07.850
In a situation like this, the suspect would
definitely have his work cut out for him.”

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.500
The clip shows dash cam footage of a taken
vehicle in Des Moines, Iowa.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:17.790
When a 14-year-old runaway purchased the vehicle
with a forged check, the police soon caught

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.270
up with him.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.970
But after they successfully pulled the young
man over, ordering him to exit the car with

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.260
his hands in the air, he peeled away.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.160
And the chase was on!

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.610
The police car starts off slow, lending the
boy a bit of a lead.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:38.310
Soon, he’s driving at speeds of nearly 100
mph, but the police are on it.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.240
It seems they’ve radioed a semi to their
aid.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.750
You can see the runaway try to pass, as the
semi swerves into both lanes, blocking his

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.750
path.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.000
But the runaway takes an off-ramp, which leads
nowhere.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.020
He’s then driving into fields, his vehicle
spitting up dirt and grass as he peels off

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.040
again.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.010
The detour somehow leads back to the highway,
where the runaway is again blocked behind

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.320
the semi.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.460
The boy’s tire blows up and sparks are seen
flying everywhere.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.210
He soon veers onto the shoulder, still trying
to clear the semi.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.920
Finally, the chase comes to an end.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.700
The driver was, of course, taken into custody
and sentenced for his actions.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.510

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.600
Reckless Driver
Why can’t people just let truckers do their

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.770
job.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.900
This crazy footage is from February of 2017.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.680
The footage shows why they were so worried.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.250
The big rig catches video of the truck driver
just sitting in his white truck on the side

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.690
of the road.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.660
Once the rig starts moving, he follows alongside.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.540
Then he pulls right in front of the semi.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.330
The trucker and his passenger wonder what
in the world this guy is up to.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.890
The passenger suggests that possibly the man
thinks the trucker cut him off.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.900
But the trucker thinks he’s just deranged.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.520
For a long while, the truck sits there, until
the big rig backs up.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.140
The passenger tries to catch the white truck’s
license plate, but it’s unclear through

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.330
the rain and the distance.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:15.400
All the while, the trucker continues to sit
there, while other drivers fly past.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.550
Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, the
white truck backs off and allows the big rig

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.000
to pass, which it then does.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.030
The young man in the truck watches them, and
as the passenger reported, he begins driving

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.600
down the wrong side of the road, halting traffic.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.700
According to the trucker, the man was taken
into custody and charged.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.230
So, at least there’s a happy ending.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.510

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.940
Balancing Act
Published by Erin Cox in July of 2017.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.490
This truck driver pulls off a big save after
his truck almost tips over.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:57.491
Watch, as the trucker defies gravity, as his
back wheels lose traction for a moment, after

00:16:57.491 --> 00:16:59.920
taking a turn too quickly.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.549
Pulling it back in a way that certainly makes
me believer in this trucker’s driving ability.

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:11.289
The rig swings over, bouncing to the right
before settling on solid ground again, coming

00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:12.400
to a stop.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.589
It’s certainly both amazing and terrifying
he was able to pull this off, something tells

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.059
me the chances of success with that manoeuvre
are quite low.

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:27.339

Dash Cam Owners Australia is a dedicated page

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.070
to reckless driving and traffic incidents
in - you guessed it - Australia.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.940
In the video, you can see a truck just cruising
along a highway.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.279
Nothing wrong with that.

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:13.850
Then, out of nowhere, a car pulls onto the
highway from a field.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.929
As you can see, the car isn’t even traveling
down a designated road.

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:22.840
It appears to be making its own makeshift
road across the grass and, without any regard

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:28.249
to the safety of the semi driver cruising
down the highway, it pulls in front of it,

00:18:28.249 --> 00:18:29.950
nearly becoming flattened.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:35.470
Luckily, the truck driver was reactive enough
to pull into the opposite lane and even slightly

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.389
off-road to avoid something bad from happening.

00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:42.940
But shortly after, you can see the car speed
off in front of the big rig without a care

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.940
in the world.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:50.340
I mean, you almost just took someone’s life
- and own - but no worries at all, right?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:19:04.299
Maybe that driver should have their license
taken away.
