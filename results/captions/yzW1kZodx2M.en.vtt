WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"!

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.003
I'M YOUR SHOWS STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:09.442 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND?

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:10.209 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES!

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.677 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HAD A GREAT
WEEKEND.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.049 align:start position:0%
I TELL YOU ONE THING, NONE OF US
HAD AS GOOD A WEEKEND AS JOHN

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:21.988 align:start position:0%
KELLY WHO IS OUT AS WHITE HOUSE
CHIEF OF STAFF.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.189
A GREAT WEIGHT HAS BEEN LIFTED
FROM HIS SHOULDERS, NOW THAT

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:26.793 align:start position:0%
TRUMP WILL NO LONGER BE RIDING
HIM PIGGYBACK.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.395 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
SO, I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:41.941 align:start position:0%
CONGRATULATIONS ON A JOB, WELL
-- DONE.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:46.879 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.081 align:start position:0%
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I THINK
WE'VE FOUND THE NEXT HOST OF THE

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.882 align:start position:0%
OSCARS!

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THERE'S BEEN TENSION BETWEEN

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:58.891 align:start position:0%
KELLY AND THE PRESIDENT FOR A
WHILE, AND PEOPLE WERE WONDERING

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:03.729 align:start position:0%
WHETHER KELLY WOULD QUIT OR IF
TRUMP WOULD FIRE HIM.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:07.567
THEN, ON FRIDAY NIGHT, THE TWO
MET IN TRUMP'S RESIDENCE AND

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.935 align:start position:0%
AGREED THAT THE DEPARTING CHIEF
WOULD BREAK HIS OWN NEWS ON

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.505 align:start position:0%
MONDAY.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.174 align:start position:0%
A PROFESSIONAL, AMICABLE
AGREEMENT... SO, TRUMP DID THIS

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:16.242 align:start position:0%
ON SATURDAY.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; JOHN KELLY WILL BE LEAVING AT
THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:23.716 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: (AS TRUMP)
"I WOULD LIKE TO HUMBLY ANNOUNCE

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.452
THAT IT WAS ME WHO DUMPED HIM.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:30.423 align:start position:0%
NO MATTER WHAT HE TELLS YOU,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:35.528 align:start position:0%
I'M THE ONE WHO SAID WE SHOULD
SEE OTHER PRESIDENTS."

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
"JUST WAS NOT INTO HIM."

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.968
AND TRUMP ALREADY HAD KELLY'S
REPLACEMENT PICKED OUT, MIKE

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.703
PENCE'S CHIEF OF STAFF AND BRO
WHO'S NOT GOING TO LET THOSE

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.972 size:84% position:42%
NERDS HOLD A LUAU ON CAMPUS
WHILE HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.109
SIGMA PHI EPSILON, NICK AYERS.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.812
AYERS HAD EVERY QUALITY TRUMP
WAS LOOKING FOR: EXPERIENCE IN

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:58.317 align:start position:0%
THE WHITE HOUSE, POLITICAL
ACUMEN, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.519
"WITH A HEAD OF BLOND HAIR, MR.
AYERS SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES MR.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.922
TRUMP IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS, A
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT OFTEN

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.658
LOOKS FOR AS A POSITIVE SIGNAL."

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.893 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"OH, WOW, IT'S LIKE LOOKING IN A

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.128 align:start position:0%
MIRROR.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:15.535
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A GREAT SKIN
FARM... I MEAN... CHIEF OF SKIN.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:20.773 align:start position:0%
I MEAN STAFF OF HAIR."

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.708 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
IT WAS SUCH A DONE DEAL THAT

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.544
TRUMP ALREADY PREPARED A NEWS
RELEASE ANNOUNCING MR. AYER'S

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:29.348 align:start position:0%
APPOINTMENT.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.584 size:84% position:42%
BUT AYERS DECLINED TRUMP'S
OFFER, AND ACCORDING TO ONE

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:42.028 align:start position:0%
FORMER ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL,
THIS WAS "A HUMILIATION FOR

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.629 align:start position:0%
MR TRUMP AND HIS ADULT CHILDREN,
AN EMOTION THAT THE PRESIDENT

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
TRIES
TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.903 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( APPLAUSE )

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:51.670 align:start position:0%
AND THAT'S NOT EASY.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start position:0%
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS ADULT
CHILDREN?

00:02:56.542 --> 00:03:01.314 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND IT'S NOT JUST AYERS.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.415
NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT THIS JOB.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.883 align:start position:0%
SOME OF THE NAMES FLOATED
INCLUDE, "TREASURY SECRETARY

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.918 size:88% position:44%
STEVE MNUCHIN, WHO HAS NEVER
PURSUED THIS JOB OR HAS EVER

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.287 align:start position:0%
CONSIDERED HIMSELF FOR THE
ROLE," AND "WHITE HOUSE BUDGET

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.456 align:start position:0%
DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY, WHO
REMAINS UNINTERESTED."

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.826
IT'S LIKE TRUMP'S TRYING TO GIVE
HIS ROSE AWAY IN "THE BACHELOR."

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.662 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"I HOLD IN MY HANDS, THE FINAL

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:21.300
ROSE, AND I WOULD BE SO HONORED
IF YOU, STEPHANIE, WOULD-- NO?

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.571 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:29.675 align:start position:0%
CHLOE, I HAVE ALWAYS-- RIGHT
OKAY, MOVING ON.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.811 size:75% position:38%
ANYBODY WANT THIS THING?

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.979 align:start position:0%
CHRIS HARRISON?

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.847 align:start position:0%
YOU WANT TO EARN YOUR CHECK FOR
ONCE?

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.781 align:start position:0%
NOPE?

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:41.287 align:start position:0%
THE GUY HOLDING THE BOOM MIC,
YOU SINGLE?"

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.995 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.463 align:start position:0%
SO, THE PRESIDENT IS IN
DESPERATE NEED OF A CHIEF OF

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.999
STAFF WITH NO VIABLE CANDIDATES.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.200
WHICH IS WHY I'D LIKE TO TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO OFFICIALLY

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.302 size:78% position:39%
THROW MY HAT IN THE RING.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:04:05.444 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:09.382 align:start position:0%
( AUDIENCE CHANTING )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M GOING TO

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.550 align:start position:0%
DEFINITELY DO IT.

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.085 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU SHOULD DO IT!

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:15.655
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, I
STEPHEN COLBERT, AM YOUR NEXT

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:21.427 size:84% position:42%
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.328 align:start position:0%
( CHEERING )
WILL I BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:22.595 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT?

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:22.995 align:start position:0%
NO.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.766 align:start position:0%
WILL WE FIGHT?

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
YEAH!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:28.301 align:start position:0%
BUT I WILL BRING A STEADY HAND
TO A TUMULTUOUS WEST WING?

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:31.804 align:start position:0%
ALSO NO.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:32.505 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT NO ONE COULD!

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.273 align:start position:0%
WHO CARES?

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:37.209
AND, NO, I DON'T AGREE WITH THE
PRESIDENT'S POLICIES, AND, NO,

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:40.112 size:88% position:44%
THIS WON'T HELP THE COUNTRY
BUT I BELIEVE IN MY HEART OF

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:44.383 align:start position:0%
HEARTS THAT THIS COULD BE FUN
FOR ME.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:49.388 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.691 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT WOULD BE FUN.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:52.758 align:start position:0%
CAN I DO IT?

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:55.494 align:start position:0%
IT WOULD BE GREAT!

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.129
WHO WOULDN'T PASS UP THE CHANCE
TO SPEND TEN MINUTES ON THE DECK

00:04:57.162 --> 00:05:00.099 align:start position:0%
OF THE TITANIC WHILE IT'S
SINKING?

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:04.270 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:07.039
A BOUND SOUNDS LIKE WHEN THEY
KNOW THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE THE

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
BIG BATH.

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:11.177
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET EVEN
MORE CHAOTIC AT THE WHITE HOUSE

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.883 size:84% position:42%
BECAUSE ROBERT MUELLER IS
BEGINNING TO SHOW HIS HAND.

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:18.684 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH!

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:22.054 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: POKER FANS HERE
TONIGHT.

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:24.256
FRIDAY, MUELLER DROPPED HIS
SENTENCING RECOMMENDATION FOR

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:31.297 align:start position:0%
FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY AND REGRET
EMOJI MICHAEL COHEN.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.568 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND WE'RE LEARNING ALL SORTS OF

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.769 align:start position:0%
JUICY DETAILS.

00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:37.870
FOR INSTANCE, MICHAEL COHEN WAS
IN TOUCH AS FAR BACK AS 2015

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.505 size:88% position:44%
WITH A RUSSIAN WHO OFFERED
"POLITICAL SYNERGY" WITH THE

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.708 size:75% position:38%
TRUMP ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.343
"POLITICAL SYNERGY" IS A SUCH A
NICE WAY TO SAY "COLLUDING TO

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:47.380 align:start position:0%
FIX THE ELECTION."

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:50.816 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S LIKE DESCRIBING

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.453 align:start position:0%
REPEATEDLY STABBING SOMEBODY AS
"TORSO VENTILATION."

00:05:54.486 --> 00:06:02.194 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S GET SOME AIR IN THERE.

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:03.863 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, PROSECUTORS WANT COHEN TO

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
SERVE A SUBSTANTIAL PRISON TERM
FOR HIS PAYMENTS TO TRUMP

00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:10.903 align:start position:0%
MISTRESSES KAREN MCDOUGAL AND
STORMY DANIELS, WHICH

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:16.475 align:start position:0%
CONSTITUTED ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:17.576 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:18.544 align:start position:0%
WE SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED
SOMETHING WHEN TRUMP'S WEBSITE

00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:20.146 align:start position:0%
ASKED IF YOU WANTED TO
CONTRIBUTE $25, $50, OR

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:25.518 align:start position:0%
"WHATEVER YOU CAN COUGH UP FOR
THE SPANK BANK."

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:31.490 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S AN UNOFFICIAL TERM.

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:33.092 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
COHEN ARGUED FOR A LIGHTER

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.127 align:start position:0%
SENTENCE, CITING HIS SUPPORT FOR
OTHER CHARITABLE CAUSES.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.269 align:start position:0%
IT'S TRUE.

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:47.740 align:start position:0%
WE KNOW HE GAVE TO CHARITY, AND
DESTINY

00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:54.914
AND CANDY, GINGER AND SHYANNE.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.015 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, COHEN'S SENTENCING

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.650 align:start position:0%
RECOMMENDATION DOES NOT MENTION
THE PRESIDENT BY NAME.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:01.654 align:start position:0%
INSTEAD, IT SAYS HE ACTED AT THE
DIRECTION OF "INDIVIDUAL-1."

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.523
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVER SAY
THIS, BUT DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:09.428 align:start position:0%
NUMBER ONE!

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:12.131 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE NUMBER ONE!

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:12.832 align:start position:0%
WHOO!

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.767 align:start position:0%
WHOO!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.601 align:start position:0%
WHOO!

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:23.843 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.412
TRUMP SAW THIS NEWS ON FRIDAY,
AND TWEETED, "TOTALLY CLEARS THE

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:27.613 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT.

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.115 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU!"
(AS TRUMP)

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:31.283 size:84% position:42%
"YEP, TRUMP'S IN THE CLEAR!

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
BUT I'D HATE TO BE THAT
INDIVIDUAL-1 GUY.

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:35.455 align:start position:0%
HE IS TOTALLY SCREWED."
