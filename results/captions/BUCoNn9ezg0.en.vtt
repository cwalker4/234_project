00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.030
The galaxy far far away is a lot more famous
than it might sound, and with a brand new

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.240
movie universe in the making, every dark corner
or mystery of the Star Wars fiction is likely

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.240
to be explored.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.650
But what about the stories that happen behind
the scenes?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
We're setting our sights on the Star Wars
Saga for the latest dose of rapid fire trivia,

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.350
in Screen Rant's Know Your Movies: 20 Star
Wars Secrets That Will Blow Your Mind.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.539
Clever Cockpit
As an inside joke among the modellers on the

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.540
original movie, they made sure to include
miniature copies of a Star Wars poster and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.870
a Playboy centrefold in the cockpit of the
Rebel Blockade Runner.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.110
They're impossible to see on film, but they're
there.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.600
The Krayt Dragon
The massive bones in the sands of Tatooine

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.789
are never commented on, so it's fitting that
the crew actually left the fibreglass model

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.539
behind when filming wrapped.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.109
Until a pair of paleontologist fans tracked
it down in 1995, taking one of its massive

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.469
claws as a souvenir.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.309
The Moff's Feet
When actor Peter Cushing tried on the leather

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.640
boots of his costume as Grand Moff Tarkin,
he wasn't impressed.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.570
The actor decided only to wear them when they
were visible.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.240
For every other shot in the movie, he's sporting
a pair of cushy carpet slippers, hidden from

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.240
view.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.909
A Family Tradition
When he was cast as Rogue Squadron pilot Wedge

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.660
Antilles, actor Denis Lawson couldnâ€™t have
guessed that Wedge would become one of the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.480
greatest pilots in the galaxy.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.240
Or that his nephew Ewan McGregor would be
cast as a young Obi-Wan 22 years later.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.479
Fat Paychecks
Everyone knows George Lucas made his millions

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.479
by keeping the merchandise rights to the Star
Wars brand, but Alec Guinness made a deal

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.970
for just over 2% of all royalties paid to
Lucas.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.970
When the movie and Obi-Wan Kenobi were instant
hits, he never HAD to take a role that he

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.590
wasn't sure if ever again.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.010
Fated Fett
Boba Fett's popularity took everyone by surprise,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.880
from George Lucas to the actor in the suit,
Jeremy Bulloch, who got the part thanks to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.620
his half-brother working as a producer.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540
When he showed up on set, the costume fit
him so perfectly, he was given the job on

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.619
the spot, without an audition or screen test.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.810
Murky Waters
Fans love seeing R2-D2 navigate the underwater

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.570
swamp near Yoda's secret hut, but it wasn't
filmed on a Hollywood sound stage.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.450
The shots were filmed in George Lucas' unfinished
swimming pool, with the crew hiding underwater

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.320
or out of frame, and Lucas himself filming
the shots.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.630
Daddy Issues
The reveal that Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.940
father was kept a secret to almost everyone,
with the working script having Vader reveal

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.380
that Obi-Wan killed Anakin.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.690
George Lucas filled Mark Hamill in on the
actual twist just seconds before filming his

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.440
reaction, but the rest of the cast didn't
know the truth until they saw it in theatres.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.290
Missing Yoda
It's hard to believe, but the original script

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.500
for Return of the Jedi didn't include Yoda's
return or death.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.230
George Lucas only added them after a child
psychologist told him that unless he actually

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.790
showed someone confirming Darth Vader was
Luke's father, kids would just assume he was

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.390
lying, leaving the plot unresolved.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.060
Timeless Twi'lek
When George Lucas decided to extend the musical

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.200
scene in Jabba's palace, he was surprised
to find that Femi Taylor, the actress who

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.750
played the dancer Oola was in even better
shape than she had been 15 years earlier.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.690
She returned to film the new shots, and audiences
never even noticed.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.630
Fuzzy Fans
The rise of CG effects was obvious in The

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.650
Phantom Menace, but model makers were still
behind some of the massive shots of Mos Espa

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.650
Grand Arena (the first pod race).

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.030
To fill the stands with spectators, modellers
painted and placed almost half a million cotton

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.620
q-tips by hand, with a fan blowing underneath
to make them ripple like the real thing.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.500
Head Room
Since CG was used in almost every shot, the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.600
sets were only built to be as tall as the
actors' heads, and the rest filled in with

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600
green screen.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.910
Since he stands at 6 foot 4, star Liam Neeson's
added height cost the production close to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.120
$150,000 extra.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.310
Jar Jar Jackson
The part of the most hated character in the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.290
prequel trilogy eventually went to actor Ahmed
Best, but the man chasing the role was none

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.959
other than the King of Pop himself, Michael
Jackson.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.660
George Lucas thought his star power would
be distracting, and even introduced the two

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.420
men so Jackson could give his seal of approval.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.100
Multiple Mauls
Devoted fans probably know that Darth Maul

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.790
is played by stunt performer Ray Park, but
it's not the British actor's voice - that's

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.940
delivered by Peter Serafinowicz, later playing
a different kind of space warrior in Guardians

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.000
of the Galaxy.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.410
The Perfect Cut?&nbsp;

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.970
Fans have never, and probably will never see
it, but rumors of a six-hour cut of The Phantom

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.489
Menace have swirled for years.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.540
According to Jake Loyd, the young Anakin,
the people who did see the cut called it "mindbogglingly

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.540
good."

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.650
Which means it's lost forever, probably.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.540
Foreshadowing - Literally
The shots of Anakin Skywalker's shadow while

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.780
on Tatooine are too perfect, with Hayden Christiansen's
hairstyle giving him the same profile as Darth

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.780
Vader.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.790
Apparently, it wasn't planned, just noticed
when they arrived on set, and worked into

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.670
an entire scene in the finished movie.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.850
What's Old is...

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.500
Older&nbsp;
When it came time to create an older version

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.040
of C-3PO for Episode 2, the filmmakers decided
it would just be easier to repaint and weather

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.070
the originals.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.700
So in the prequel movie, fans are actually
seeing the very same costume of the original

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.190
films, before he was polished and updated.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.670
Dooku Do-Over
Actor Christopher Lee brought serious gravity

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.210
to the role of Count Dooku, but the original
character was going to a be a woman, serving

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.850
as Palpatine's second apprentice.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.710
The design was changed but that version of
the Sith warrior was used for the Clone Wars

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.540
series as Asajj Ventress, Dooku's own agent.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.120
Blue Aces
The Force Awakens introduces ace pilot Poe

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.380
Dameron and his fellow fighters of Blue Squadron.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.850
It's actually delivering on a decades long
plan, since Luke was originally going to be

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.840
fighting with the same squad in the first
movie.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.920
The blue paint wouldn't work with effects
at the time and became red squadron instead.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.940
Finally, things can be set right.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.980
What's in a Name?&nbsp;

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.890
George Lucas thought up the name of his first
R2 Droid when a fellow film editor asked for

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.440
Reel 2,Dialogue 2.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.590
But the name of BB-8 is a lot simpler.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.210
According to director JJ Abrams, he just noticed
the Droid looked like a capital B and an 8

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.400
- from there, the name of the lovable Droid
was obvious.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.470

known Star Wars trivia, but what are yours?
