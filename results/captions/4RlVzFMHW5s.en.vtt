00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.440
Accounts of sexual misconduct, assault, and
even rape have rocked the entertainment industry

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.830
over the last few months.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.740
Movie stars, directors, and producers have
all fallen under the weight of charges against

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.740
them.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.650
The likes of Kevin Spacey, Louis CK, Harvey
Weinstein, and Brett Ratner have all been

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.340
made to reckon with their past actions, and
have seen swift repudiation from the film

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340
industry.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.869
Spacey and Louis CK have seen their films
shelved (or dramatically altered via an emergency

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.369
Christopher Plummer, in Spacey’s case),
and Weinstein will likely never produce again.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.100
Many believe that this could be a watershed
moment for the film industry, with the growing

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
awareness of sexual misconduct leading to
a change in behavior.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.650
Hollywood, however, has been plagued by powerful
people who have taken advantage of their position

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.150
for some time, and it seems unlikely to fully
change anytime soon.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.010
Here are 10 respected people in Hollywood
who turned out to be creeps…

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.930
10.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.150
Roman Polanski

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.250
The acclaimed director of classic films like
Chinatown, Rosemary’s Baby, and The Pianist,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.680
Roman Polanski had to flee the United States
after being arrested for rape by use of drugs,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.950
sodomy, and several other atrocious charges
against a 13-year-old girl.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.710
The young girl, Samantha Geimer, was introduced
to Polanski through her mother who was an

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.110
actress and model.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.120
Polanski asked Geimer’s mother if she could
participate in a private photo shoot for the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.550
French edition of Vogue.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.710
Geimer participated, with the consent of her
mother, and later testified that she felt

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.520
uncomfortable at the shoot, with Polanski
asking her to pose topless.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.180
Nonetheless, Geimer agreed to participate
in a second shoot, which took place at Jack

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.480
Nicholson’s home.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.980
During the photography session, Geimer testified
that Polanski gave her champagne, and a quaalude.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.620
Soon after, he suggested she pose on a bed,
and despite her protests, Polanski continued

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.770
his advances.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.860
According to Geimer, Polanski then performed
oral, vaginal, and later anal sex after learning

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.700
she was not on birth control.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.960
Geimer repeatedly asked for him to stop, but
because of the alcohol and drugs, she felt

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.460
unable to fully control her faculties.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.070
Polanski was arrested and, under a plea agreement,
ordered to report to a 90-day psychiatric

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.190
evaluation.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.690
Fearing that instead of probation he’d receive
jail time, Polanski fled the country and has

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.520
been living in countries that refuse to extradite
him to the United States.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520
9.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.660
Woody Allen

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.830
Another famous director known for irreverent
romantic comedies like Annie Hall and Manhattan,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.330
Woody Allen has had a long and storied career
working with the best actors in the industry

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.310
while managing to reinvent the way comedy
was captured on the big screen.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.790
Despite his successes as an artist, Allen
has had several questions posed about his

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.790
character.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.480
Dylan Farrow, an adopted daughter of Woody
and Mia Farrow, claimed that when she was

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.900
left alone with the film director, he touched
her inappropriately.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.569
She was seven at the time.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.730
According to the police report, Farrow stated
that Allen took her to the attic and touched

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.740
her genitals.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.099
Soon after Allen heard of the accusations,
he filed charges for full custody of the children,

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.180
snaring the family in an even more tumultuous
legal fight.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.630
The allegations levied by Dylan Farrow would
never go to court, as her mother feared what

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.090
a trial would do to her young daughter.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.380
If that was all the baggage in Woody Allen’s
past, he may not have made this list.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.989
However, Allen infamously began dating and
then married Mia Farrow’s other adopted

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.540
daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.120
Previn was adopted by Farrow and her former
husband Andre Previn, and Allen began seeing

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.849
her while he was in a relationship with her
mother.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.190
Mia Farrow only became aware of their relationship
after visiting Allen’s home and finding

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.069
nude photographs of her 21-year-old daughter.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.360
Not exactly the most ethical behavior.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.540
8.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.540
James Toback

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.099
James Toback has been in the film industry
for more than four decades, and during that

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.700
time he’s allegedly used his small window
into Hollywood to sexually harass and assault

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.700
women.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.209
The Los Angeles Times reported that Toback
was known to brag and promise auditions and

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.070
roles for aspiring actresses, luring them
into meetings where he asked sexually suggestive

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.150
questions before groping them or masturbating
in front of them or onto their bodies.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.730
Although Toback denies these allegations,
more than 200 women have come forward stating

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.550
they received unwanted sexual advances.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.690
Although Toback was neither a well-known director
or screenwriter, he’d use his connections

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.170
to Robert Downey Jr., who appeared in several
of his movies, to gain legitimacy in the eyes

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.349
of his victims.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.359
Most women interviewed claimed he’d approach
them on the street, promising them a role

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.280
while showing pictures of himself with RDJ.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.629
As his methods have come to light, Toback
has lost his representation, but his career

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.490
had already pretty much come to an end.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.699
The revelations will then hopefully be a warning
sign to aspiring actresses of the predatory

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.379
behavior of some men in the industry.

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:33.379
7.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.379
Kevin Spacey

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.260
An Oscar winner and one the most esteemed
actors in Hollywood, Kevin Spacey’s fall

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.759
from grace may be the most dramatic on our
list.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.860
The star of House of Cards was forced to release
a statement after the allegations by actor

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.639
Anthony Rapp (who you probably know either
from Adventures in Babysitting or Rent).

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.639
When he was only 14-years-old, Rapp contends
that Spacey forced himself onto him in a sexual

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.639
way.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.629
In his statement, Spacey did not deny the
incident but claimed he did “not remember”

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.689
it occurring and that he was now living as
a gay man.

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.710
That didn’t stop the avalanche that would
soon crush one of Hollywood’s most respected

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.710
stars.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.309
Several other young men, including Richard
Dreyfuss’s son Ben, alleged similar groping

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.580
incidents revolving around Spacey.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.850
Without any denials from Spacey, Netflix fired
him from House of Cards, his Gore Vidal biopic

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.249
was shelved, and all of his scenes in the
film All the Money in the World were re-shot

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:23.360
with Christopher Plummer – who, in a bit
of a karmic twist, received an Oscar nomination

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.360
for the role.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.550
At this point, it’s hard to imagine Spacey
ever working in Hollywood again.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.550
6.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.550
Harvey Weinstein

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.740
The story that started it all was the New
Yorker expose that revealed the sexual assault,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.259
harassment, and rape committed by the legendary
film producer Harvey Weinstein.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.819
Famous actresses like Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Mira Sorvino, and Ashley Judd have

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.559
all corroborated the tactics used by Weinstein
to sexually harass and assault his victims.

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.210
He had a similar approach with all his victims.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.009
First, he summoned them to a private place
to discuss the film or role, then he asked

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.439
for a massage or touched them inappropriately.

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.089
Finally, in some cases, he’d offer a work-for-sex
arrangement.

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.199
Some noteworthy cases included the harassment
of Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.229
film Swingers.

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.259
Kendall has stated that Weinstein undressed
and chased her around the room naked.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.409
Tomi-Ann Roberts remembers being asked to
meet Weinstein to discuss a role, and finding

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:15.919
him naked in a bathtub.

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.509
Weinstein encouraged her to take her clothing
off, arguing that the role needed a woman

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.499
who was comfortable being naked in front of
camera.

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:27.070
The most egregious claims against Weinstein
were made by Annabella Sciorra, an Emmy nominee

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.499
for her work on The Sopranos.

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:32.309
In the late ’90s, Weinstein allegedly raped
Sciorra, forcing himself into her room after

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.419
dropping her off following an industry event.

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.659
Sciorra recounts not being able to fight off
his advances, and refusing to share her story

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.509
from shame of not fighting hard enough to
stop him.

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.669
The ramifications were swift, with Weinstein
being fired from the company he founded, and

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.039
being permanently banned from the Producers
Guild of America.

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.039
5.

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.039
Andy Dick

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.689
Ok, so maybe not everyone on our list was
ever ‘respected’… but that certainly

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.219
didn’t stop them from getting plenty of
work, as is the case here.

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:03.629
Andy Dick, a “comedian” best known for
being remarkably obnoxious and getting beat

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.309
up by Jon Lovitz, was also forced to lose
his job as a result of sexual misconduct.

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:13.289
The appropriately named Dick was accused of,
among other things, groping people’s nether

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.939
regions, kissing and licking people without
their permission, and sexual propositions

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.009
of at least four members of the production
team while working on the independent feature

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:22.869
film Raising Buchanan.

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:27.009
Dick denied the groping allegations but did
admit to licking and propositioning people.

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.740
It wasn’t Dick’s first dismissal for his
unwanted sexual advances.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.319
Filmmaker Frankie Ingrassia and producer Jed
Rhein confirmed to Vulture last October that

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.449
Dick was fired from another film for sexual
misconduct.

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:39.449
4.

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:40.849
Brett Ratner

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.409
Actress Ellen Page recently chronicled the
horrible abuse that many women faced at the

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:45.430
hands of Brett Ratner.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.819
In a Facebook post, Page described how, as
an 18-year-old, she was outed as gay by Ratner

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:52.770
during a cast and crew meeting.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.991
Ratner also went on to crudely tell another
female employee to have sex with Page, in

00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.580
order for the actress to realize that she
was gay.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.709
That was the tamest of his transgressions.

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:07.060
Actress Natasha Henstridge was only 19-years-old
when Ratner allegedly assaulted her.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.030
Henstridge recalls hanging out watching TV
with Ratner and some other friends, when she

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.030
fell asleep.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.479
When she woke up, Ratner was the only one
in the apartment.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.490
Henstridge attempted to leave, but Ratner
put himself between her and the door and began

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.559
to touch himself, and then forcing her to
perform oral sex on him.

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:25.789
Ratner has denied all the allegations, but
that hasn’t stopped him from feeling the

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:26.789
heat.

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:30.479
Warner Brothers has cut ties with Ratner’s
production company RatPac and his remaining

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:33.969
ties with the studio have already started
to raise problems.

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:34.969
3.

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:35.969
Steven Seagal

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.620
Once one of the biggest action stars in the
world, Steven Seagal has been accused by multiple

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.640
women of sexual harassment.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.460
Actress Eva LaRue has claimed that while meeting
with Seagal about a role, he undid his kimono

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.640
revealing his bare chest and underwear.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.220
LaRue fled the room, and later told her agent,
who seemed unsurprised by the behavior.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.200
Jenny Mccarthy has also revealed that she
was harassed by Seagal.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.690
Auditioning for Under Siege 2, Seagal told
her to take off her dress.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.730
She refused, and he proceeded to unzip his
pants.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.490
McCarthy ran out of the room to her car, where
Seagal followed her and told her not to tell

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.130
anyone about the encounter.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.130
2.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.270
George Takei

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.880
Famous for playing Sulu on Star Trek, Takei
has also found himself embroiled in the growing

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.410
sexual misconduct scandal.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.320
A male model has accused Takei of drugging
him and sexually assaulting him more than

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.540
two decades ago.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.440
Takei’s accuser, Scott R. Brunton, claims
that after he broke up with his boyfriend,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.620
Takei offered to take him out to dinner.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.220
After returning to Takei’s home, Brunton
felt tired and disoriented.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.760
When he woke up, he saw Takei taking off his
pants.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.890
Takei has denied that the encounter took place
and has remained steadfast in his denial,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.780
even after a salacious interview with Howard
Stern surfaced, where Takei discussed fondling

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.100
men without their consent.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.100
1.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.100
Ed Westwick

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.150
Like with Andy Dick, maybe “respected”
doesn’t quite fit the bill here.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.990
But it’s next to impossible to leave this
one off the list, because some of the most

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.470
serious accusations we’re talking about
today have been levied against Gossip Girl

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.780
star Ed Westwick.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.060
The 30-year-old actor has been accused of
rape and sexual assault by multiple women.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.580
The separate allegations all have connections
and similarities.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.480
A producer on Gossip Girl invited both Rachel
Eck and Kristina Cohen to nights out with

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.880
the actor, which ended with them being assaulted
by Westwick.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.050
The allegations made by Cohen describe the
aspiring actress waking to find Westwick on

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.050
top of her.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.970
Her attempts to fight him off would fail,
and Westwick would allegedly go on to rape

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.970
her.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.510
Westwick has denied each accusation, releasing
a statement noting his disappointment with

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.910
a rush to judgment.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.860
He claims to have not even met his accusers.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.720
Nonetheless, the BBC has canceled the TV show
Ordeal by Innocence, starring Westwick, and

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:50.230
his series White Gold has been put on hold.
