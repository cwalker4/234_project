00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:06.059
Welcome to the DietDoctor podcast
with Dr. Bret Scher.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.619
Today I'm joined by Prof. Andrew Mente.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:14.179
Now prof Mente has a PhD in epidemiology
from the University of Toronto,

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.260
he's done his postdoc work
in cardiovascular epidemiology

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
from McMaster University

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.059
and he's an associate professor of health
research methods at McMaster University

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.500
and most recently he was
one of the co-investigators

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.420
on the lifestyle and the nutritional side
of the PURE study.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.820
Now PURE is this enormous study
over five continents,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.500
18 different countries,
over 135,000 different individuals,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.100
that has had some pretty profound
research evidence

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.859
as it comes to saturated fats,
cholesterol fat in general

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.859
and their implication
on overall mortality.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.140
It has a number of data
on salt intake and mortality.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.939
And a lot of it is contrary
to conventional wisdom and guidelines.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.820
Now all that being said,
this is an epidemiological study

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.379
and we definitely talk about the strengths
and benefits of epidemiology

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.379
versus randomized controlled trial

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.299
and he is a good perspective on how
we really need both

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.420
to further research and affect policy.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.900
So there's a lot of data here
going over the PURE study

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.700
and it has some pretty profound impacts on
the way we should make recommendations

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.140
and how we should see older
recommendations and their falling.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.859
So I hope you enjoy this interview
with Prof. Andrew Mente

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.540
and learn a lot about the PURE study

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.711
and understand how we can use that data
in our daily lives.

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:46.099
Prof. Andrew Mente thank you so much
for joining me on the DietDoctor podcast.

00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:47.739
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:47.922 --> 00:01:51.620
Now you have really become known
as the PURE guy

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.700
because of the PURE study and all the data
that's come out of that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.379
and how that'S impacted how we see salt

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.780
how we see fat and carbohydrates
and how we see lipid biomarkers,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.939
three huge concepts
that we've kind of been misled on.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.780
So this has been pretty revolutionary data
that you've come up with.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.300
Yes well the unique part of PURE

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.780
is that it's a large prospective
epidemiological study,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.740
but it's also a global study
so it covers five continents of the world.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.900
And as a result we captured
broad patterns of diet globally

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.460
from across a broad range of intake,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.449
both very low levels and very high levels

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.699
of individual nutrients in foods
and dietary patterns.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.860
That's important because that allows us
to assess shapes of relationships

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.699
between dietary variables
and health outcomes.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:48.769
Which has never been characterized before
with any high degree of statistical precision.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.419
Yes it's such an interesting part when
you talk about nutritional research

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.020
and it is complicated,
let's be honest, it's very hard to do,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.900
whether you talk about randomized
controlled trials and observational study,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.180
a study in one type of population
or a study in a large swath of a population,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.780
and each have their benefits
and their drawbacks.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.580
So when you look at analyzing the data
from the PURE study,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.139
tell us what you think some of the strengths
and weaknesses are in that type of a study.

00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:20.900
Sure, obviously observational studies,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.780
we assess relationships
or associations between variables,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.780
diet and health outcomes,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.060
so you don't prove causation
with any one observational study,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.099
but what you do is you look
for a coherent pattern of information

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.219
from observational studies,
both looking at foods or nutrients

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.780
versus intermediate risk markers
for cardiovascular disease

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.659
and actual outcomes.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.139
Of course with a large randomized
controlled trials

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
we can better assess causative effects.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.300
The problem with large randomized trials is
they're very difficult to conduct with diet

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.699
and it's very difficult for people
to sustain a particular diet for a long term.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.780
And so there's a challenge there.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.219
On the other hand
when you have weak effects,

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.180
it's harder to assess weak effects
in observational studies,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.579
because you don't know if the result is true
or due to residual confounding.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.899
So we tend to think of different designs
as complementing one another.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:26.060
So not one design being the best
considering feasibility

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.779
and also, you know,
what is the cleanest design.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.779
But using different designs complementary
to one another

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.060
and capitalizing on the strengths of each
is the ideal way to go forward.

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:42.019
Yeah, and then the harder question is
how to take the data you have

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:45.980
and incorporate it into guidelines
for the entire country or the entire world

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.100
to try and follow?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.459
And when is that data strong enough
to support a statement

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:53.899
that this is the way to eat?

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:57.459
And so far it seems like we've been
a little misled in that stand, haven't we?

00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.259
Absolutely, so we take the issue
with the fats and carbs for instance.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.899
So the current dietary guidelines
go back obviously

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:11.019
to where that was conducted in the 50s
that led to the adoption of a low-fat diet

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.779
which we know it really hasn't panned out

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.339
and populations have gotten fatter

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.019
and diabetes rates tripled,

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:22.860
coinciding with the introduction
of the guidelines.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.860
So our data suggest that the conventional
way of thinking of diet

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.259
focusing on higher intake of carbohydrates
may actually backfire,

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.459
which supports what has actually
happened.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.259
And so higher carb intake,

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.699
and remember many parts of the world consume
very high amounts of carbohydrates,

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.899
low and middle income countries,

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.420
and largely it's refined carbohydrates
and added sugar.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.660
And we find that higher carb is related
to more cardiovascular events and mortality

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.540
particularly all-cause mortality,
whereas for fats we see the opposite.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.060
We see higher fat intake
related to lower risk of mortality

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.420
and saturated fat related
to lower risk of stroke.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.860
So this kind of challenges
conventional wisdom on diet,

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.019
but it is consistent with the trials,

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:11.379
because you look at the randomized trials

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.259
that replaced saturated fat
with polyunsaturated fat,

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.100
that haven't really panned out.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.180
Largely neutral effects.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.300
And other observational studies too
have shown neutrality

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.300
looking at relationship with saturated fat
and clinical outcomes.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.060
So our findings, if anything,
are supportive of previous studies.

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:30.100
Let's jump into the study a little bit.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.259
So you mentioned 18 countries,
5 different continents,

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.300
over 135,000 individuals and what was
the timeframe that you followed them?

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:45.899
So for our papers that came out last year
in the Lancet it was eight years of follow-up.

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.420
This year we had a paper that came out
on dairy that was nine years of follow-up,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.819
because the follow-up is ongoing
and PURE is still during the follow-up

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.819
and we hope to follow people
for at least another 5 to 10 years.

00:06:55.958 --> 00:07:00.860
So you mentioned the data
on the saturated fats and carbohydrates.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.899
So with a higher carbohydrate diet
starting at 68% of the calories

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:09.100
there was an increased risk
of all-cause mortality.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.779
Now we need to talk about hazard ratio,

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:15.980
because you know we're quick to point out
that smoking with a hazard ratio of 3 1/2

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.300
is a dramatic change.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.459
The red meat leading to colon cancer
at 1.17 is a small hazard ratio.

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.220
So the hazard ratio here
was small at 1.17 and 1.28.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.779
So how do you help us interpret that

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:35.899
in terms of it was a fact because
of how many patients there were,

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:40.420
but yet the hazard ratio was small and
it's sort of against what the guidelines say.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.860
So how do you incorporate all that
into how we should interpret that data?

00:07:45.036 --> 00:07:47.259
Dietary effects are weak.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.459
If you look at the collective literature
whether it's nutrients or foods,

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:58.259
largely effects are weak up to the degree of
like 10% change in risk, relative risk change.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.100
So that's a very weak effect,
unlike smoking,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.139
where you see a 20 fold increase in risk
of smoking versus lung cancer.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:10.740
So that's a challenge with diet, studying diet
in observational studies,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.300
but if anything, you look at the data
of other cohort studies

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.139
and if you focus on the studies that looked
at carbohydrates versus mortality

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:23.379
as a percent of energy,

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:28.220
you also there see that higher carb intake
shows an increase in the risk of mortality.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.860
Now some studies have looked
at calculated diet scores

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.500
or carbohydrates scores

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.980
and so what goes into that is different
coating of our carbohydrate foods.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.899
So you can select almost any food you want
to go into a carbohydrate score

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.100
and you'll get different results,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.019
but the studies that looked at percent
of energy from carbs,

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.980
you see a positive association
with mortality.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.860
Now there aren't that many
free living populations

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.980
with very low carbohydrate intake.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.539
So don't misread me, I'm not saying that
going as low as possible would be beneficial

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:04.059
because that has yet to be demonstrated

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.659
but certainly appears that there is
an optimal range

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:10.740
between 50% to 55% of energy from carbs

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.220
that appears to be associated
with lowest risk.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.500
At the low-end it's a little more murky,
we really don't know.

00:09:16.633 --> 00:09:21.460
And then the problem comes in
of the quality of the food that you're eating.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.419
So there's really no control
for the quality of carbs,

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.860
because it's free living people 
like you said,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.700
in some of the poor countries,
underdeveloped countries,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.860
it's going to be a lot of refined
carbohydrates and refined grains.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.940
So not a surprise that a higher level
of carbohydrate increased mortality risk.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.419
Now what maybe was a surprise

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:43.899
that the higher level of fat intake
decreased mortality risk,

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:48.500
I think that's where the real headline is,
that is so counter to what we're being told.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.100
And now you broke that up into
monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.379
and saturated fats in terms
of their mortality risk;

00:09:54.379 --> 00:09:56.379
so tell us how those varied.

00:09:56.681 --> 00:10:00.299
Yes, so first of all
each individual type of fat,

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:04.419
saturated, mono and polyunsaturated
were associated with lower risk of mortality,

00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:07.299
so they all directionally
went toward protection.

00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:10.059
Now with looking at saturated fat
we found--

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.659
because remember we're covering
low and middle income countries here

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:15.820
where saturated fat in many parts
of the world is very low,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.139
and so saturated fat going up
to about 13% of energy

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.788
was associated with lower risk of mortality.

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:29.779
Now what this suggests is that when you go
to low levels below 10% and further

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:32.059
do you actually see
the increase in mortality?

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:34.860
Which is actually what the guidelines
recommend; to go to those lower-levels.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.659
Now we are not saying that our data

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.991
supports consuming 20% or 25% of energy
from saturated fat,

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.980
only because that's not captured

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.299
by the natural distribution of saturated fat
in free living populations.

00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:55.524
And certainly some societies you see
consumed 3 to 4 decades ago

00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:58.860
much higher amount of saturated fat.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.259
So our data is not capturing
that high level of saturated fat,

00:11:02.259 --> 00:11:07.299
but up to about 13% or 14% of energy
we see a lower risk of mortality

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:10.419
compared to people consuming
lower amounts of saturated fat.

00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:14.659
Now interestingly the mortality also
for fat in general and saturated fat

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:17.539
was neutral for cardiovascular mortality

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:22.100
and beneficial for all-cause
and non-cardiovascular mortality.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.059
I mean is that one other surprise
or is it what you would expect to see?

00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:29.059
Well we look at the randomized trials,

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:34.899
at Cochrane review by Hooper in 2015
of randomized trials,

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:37.740
where they replaced saturated fat
with polyunsaturated fat,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.100
again a direct test
of the diet heart hypothesis,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.259
the summary estimates were neutral.

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:45.500
So our results were consistent with that.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.580
The Women's Health Initiative trial

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.059
which compared the low-fat diet
to a higher fat diet

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:57.820
again found no significant change in risk
for cardiovascular events and mortality.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.659
So that was another large study,
cost half $1 billion.

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:05.779
So if anything our results
are consistent with that.

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:10.659
Now if you look
at cardiovascular disease mortality

00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:13.059
and non-cardiovascular mortality,

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:17.460
directionally we did see
that different types of fats were beneficial,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.779
although it wasn't statistically significant
but directionally.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:23.419
And in carbs directionally was harmful

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:27.259
versus cardiovascular death
and non-cardiovascular death.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:30.441
It was the nonfatal events
were as large and neutral.

00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:34.220
Now are we able to breakdown
the non-cardiovascular deaths anymore,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.298
whether it's cancer, infection
or the various different causes?

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:44.419
Well the main non-CVD causes right now
in PURE are cancer and respiratory mortality.

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:47.299
So those two,
those were the main drivers of it.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:51.740
Now of course PURE is a large cohort
that is still ongoing,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.740
so we are following people up.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.980
We don't have enough event rates
right now

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.580
to characterize cancer
or respiratory events alone

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.740
or individual types of cancer.

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:03.860
But as the cohort gets older
the event rates will pick up

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.899
and we'll have more events.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:08.860
So that's why it's very important in PURE
to do the follow-up over the next 10 years

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.929
than we can assess
individual types of cancer and diet.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:15.700
Right, now you with a study like this
that goes against our guidelines

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.419
and goes against what you can say
that the most common dogma is now,

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:23.419
would you say this is strong enough
evidence to say things have to change now?

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:27.379
Or do you think this is sort of one blip
on the screen and we need more to come

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:30.820
in order to affect policy
and make a change?

00:13:30.996 --> 00:13:34.340
Well, I think collectively looking
at our data and other studies as well

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.419
we could relax a bit on the threshold
for saturated fat

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:41.940
and given the population on average
in the US for instance,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.820
the average intake of saturated fat
is about 12% of energy.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.419
So it's only slightly above
the WHO recommendation of 10%.

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:52.259
So it's not like we have a saturated fat
emergency, so I would say that's fine.

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:55.220
What we're consuming else, fine,
we could even consume a little bit more.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.980
We're not saying consume
unlimited amounts,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.019
we need data for that still,

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:02.019
but what we consume now
appears to be right

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.419
and we don't have to put in
stringent cutoffs

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:06.984
to get people to lower their saturated fat.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.340
Now also there's concern about--
like we talked about earlier, data quality,

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.220
so is this mostly from food frequency
questionnaires that people filled out

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.659
and how often were they filling that out and
is there any concern of reliability for that?

00:14:21.798 --> 00:14:25.580
Yes, so the food frequency
questionnaires were extensively validated

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.460
and developed specifically for each region

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.899
and there were long-frequency
questionnaires,

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:33.899
so captured detailed aspects of diet.

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:39.299
So for instance we have 150 items
measuring diet in a particular population.

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:42.500
So that's a very in-depth analysis into diet.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.379
Now the downside with these questionnaires
of course is random measurement error.

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:52.019
And so that adds noise but that more
dilutes associations toward the null,

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:56.539
and that is a factor
in every epidemiological study.

00:14:56.539 --> 00:15:01.700
So it is the best tool we have at the moment
for large epidemiological studies

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.500
and that's what we use.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.419
Again that's why I say complementing
randomized trials,

00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:11.700
focusing on risk markers
would be optimal.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.887
So the major strength however
is the fact that we cover again

00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:20.700
a broad range of intake
across different parts of the world,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.980
again characterizing those extreme ranges

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.513
as much as they are represented
by human consumption

00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:30.100
and that's really
where the advantage of PURE is.

00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:36.460
Now you mentioned comparing the trials
to randomized trials using risk markers.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.539
And that's one of the parts of PURE
that I really enjoyed most,

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.740
was looking at the risk markers.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:49.179
So you looked at... as they increase carbs
their LDL decreased and so did their HDL

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:53.659
and their triglyceride to HDL ratio increased
and their ApoB went down a little bit.

00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:59.860
So their ApoB to ApoA ratio also went
down.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:05.940
So then you looked at outcome data
in terms of what these markers all met.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.779
And what did you find in terms of the
difference between LDL cholesterol,

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:12.492
the ApoB to ApoA...?
Share that data with us.

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:16.100
Yeah, so as you said
looking at the risk markers,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.659
saturated fat had an increase in LDL
with higher saturated fat,

00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:25.980
but the effects on the other lipid markers
were largely beneficial.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.659
So when you look at the ratio
of total cholesterol to HDL,

00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:32.940
which is a stronger risk marker
of future cardiovascular disease,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.220
that's just a potential beneficial effect,
because the ratio went down

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.740
and we know that that risk marker
is a better predictor of future events.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.580
And when you look at ApoB to ApoA,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.940
which remember in INTERHEART
and INTERSTROKE,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.100
two large international studies,

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.980
was the strongest lipid predictor
of heart attacks and stroke,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.100
we found that the ratio goes down
with higher saturated fat,

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.460
which again suggests a beneficial effect
since that is the strongest risk marker

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.164
and that goes down
with higher saturated fat.

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:03.139
And then what we did is we modeled...

00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:06.579
we said okay assuming we don't have
any data on clinical events,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.660
let's model and use the lipid markers

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.411
to project what the effects of diet
on cardiovascular risk would be.

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:17.619
And then we did that,
we modeled using LDL

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.779
and we found a positive association
as you would expect.

00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:24.180
After all saturated fat
is positively associated with LDL.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.700
But then when we map that
versus actual events,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.619
we found that LDL was a poor
predictive marker of future events

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:36.460
when you look
at the observed associations.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.937
On the other hand
ApoB to ApoA ratio was much better

00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:42.940
at projecting the effects of diet
on health outcomes.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.740
So this suggests that if we focus on LDL

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.259
we may be largely misinforming diet
for populations.

00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:54.339
ApoB to ApoA ratio, which is a measure
of small dense LDL particles

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:57.099
that are more atherogenic than LDL

00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:00.740
appears to be the much better
predictive marker

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.099
to project the effects of diet
on health outcomes.

00:18:03.201 --> 00:18:06.140
Are you able to quantify that
to give us some sense...

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.380
like how much better,
how much more associated it was?

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.367
Or is that data sort of hard
to quantify that way?

00:18:12.444 --> 00:18:16.220
What we did is we calculated 
the I-squared value,

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.380
which generally assesses the degree

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.740
to which the actual estimates
agree with one another.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.660
And so when you calculate that statistic

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.619
you see that the estimates
from the ApoB to ApoA ratio,

00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:36.140
projected estimates versus
the actual observed estimates agreed

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.339
and it was a good agreement.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.084
Whereas with LDL they diverged
in opposite directions.

00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:44.460
So the projected estimates
showed an increase in risk,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.299
whereas the actual effects of saturated fat
on the events go down slightly.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.500
So they diverged in different directions.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.539
It would suggest that LDL is not very good
for projecting dietary effects.

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:57.660
It may be very good for projecting
statin effects on health outcomes,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.657
but not for diet.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.660
That's so worth repeating;

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.180
that the projected effect
would be that the risk would go up

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.339
and the observed effect
was that it actually went down.

00:19:08.557 --> 00:19:09.700
That's right.

00:19:09.765 --> 00:19:11.579
It was completely discordant.

00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:15.500
And that calls into question every
single dietary study that's looked at LDL

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.099
because the presumption is
if the LDL level goes down,

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:24.099
this diet is therefore beneficial
and protective.

00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:28.460
And you really don't have to look any
further than the sort of the older studies

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:34.859
that looked at giving polyunsaturated
fatty acid oils, seed oils,

00:19:34.859 --> 00:19:38.460
which showed LDL went down
and that's what was publicized,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.779
but then a re-examination of the data
showed that mortality actually went up,

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:45.539
but that's not been talked about very much.

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:49.259
So my hope is that this study would cause
just a huge snowball effect

00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:53.539
of people realizing that LDL-C is not
the marker we should be following.

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:56.700
Yet I don't feel like I've heard enough
about that in the media

00:19:56.701 --> 00:19:59.802
and in the scientific circles.

00:19:59.879 --> 00:20:02.900
Is that just because old dogma dies hard
and people aren't ready to hear it?

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.793
Why do you think that's the case?

00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:08.859
Well, you know, LDLs
is considered by the--

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:12.361
You're conventionally thinking of it
as an infallible marker.

00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:13.419
Right.

00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:16.460
And so people think of it
in a very reductionist way, many scientists.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.420
So they figured that, if anything, that
adversely affects LDL, it must be harmful.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.779
And you could ignore
all the other biomarkers.

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:24.980
But diet is much more
complicated than that.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.420
So you take foods,
natural sources of saturated fat,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.819
that contain saturated fat but they also
contain monounsaturated fat.

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:35.819
They also contain protein,
they contain vitamin Bs, including B12.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:39.819
They contain zinc and magnesium.

00:20:39.819 --> 00:20:43.259
So this is all thrown out and we treat food

00:20:43.259 --> 00:20:47.983
almost like it's a single nutrient
saturated fat that's infused into our veins.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:50.900
And that's used to project the effects

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.900
and really is an absurd way of thinking
if you really think about it deeply.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.116
So for diet we have to think much more
multidimensionally than that.

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:01.500
Absolutely,
I think that's a great statement,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.819
because we do like reductionist thinking,

00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:06.460
we do like to try and make things
overly simplistic

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.859
and this is the mess we get into
when we do that.

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:14.859
I know your study did not specifically look
at a low-carb or ketogenic diet,

00:21:14.859 --> 00:21:18.779
but in those circles the main concern is,
"What about the LDL?"

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:23.819
The LDL goes up and that's why doctors
are hesitant to prescribe it,

00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:28.900
that's why a number of guidelines
will not include it because of that concern

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.700
and yet looking at this data if the ApoB to
ApoA ratio stays the same or gets better

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.259
it shouldn't matter what the LDL does.

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.619
So I think that's why this evidence
is so powerful

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:40.980
and we need to be seeing this
from the rooftops more

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.099
to say we need to reevaluate dietary
changes and their effects on cholesterol.

00:21:45.099 --> 00:21:47.071
And quick, to point that out...

00:21:47.161 --> 00:21:49.900
It may not be the same for drugs,
it may not be the same for genetics,

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.399
but for dietary changes
that's what we need to look at.

00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:57.420
Absolutely yes and we need to study
a much wider range.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.619
So you look at the PURE study

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:03.745
because the level of carbohydrates and fats
only cover a particular range.

00:22:03.803 --> 00:22:06.220
That's where the randomized trials
are needed...

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.819
like Virta for the work
that Dr. Hallberg is doing

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:13.900
to capture the lower end
of the carb distribution.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.299
So it's very important to look at that to see
what the effect on the risk markers here are

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:20.779
for very low-carb intake.

00:22:20.779 --> 00:22:23.019
Which PURE does not capture,

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:25.700
because it's largely representing
parts of the world

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.660
that consume from moderate to high carb.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.500
So that's why Sarah's work
is very important.

00:22:29.601 --> 00:22:32.259
Right and since you brought
Sarah's work at Virta Health,

00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:36.339
you know, at their one year data mark
the LDL-C went up by about 10%

00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:39.700
with no change in their ApoB
and their HDL went up,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.779
so their ApoB to ApoA ratio improved.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:46.059
And so based on this
that is a net benefit for mortality

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:47.934
and that's what we care about.

00:22:48.038 --> 00:22:49.320
That's right.

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:51.339
Yeah, it's so fascinating.

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:55.619
The tide is changing maybe a little
too slowly, but it is certainly changing.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.926
Yes.

00:22:57.019 --> 00:22:59.980
Now this study also had
other aspects to it.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:05.460
So the next one was increasing fruit,
vegetable and legume consumption

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.980
decreased mortality
starting at three servings per day,

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.263
with really no difference between the three
and eight servings per day.

00:23:12.317 --> 00:23:15.380
Now I am curious about that, because
fruits, vegetables, legumes,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.339
they frequently do get bunch together.

00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:21.607
And I think it's a sign of somebody maybe
being a little more health conscious,

00:23:21.681 --> 00:23:24.740
because that's what we're told
as a healthy way of eating,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.299
but was there any parsing out individually
of how vegetables are different than fruits

00:23:28.299 --> 00:23:30.436
and different than legumes individually?

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.019
Yes, absolutely.

00:23:32.019 --> 00:23:38.420
So the beneficial effect was largely driven
by fresh fruit, raw vegetables and legumes.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.980
It's the cooked vegetables,
when you put that end into the equation,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.339
that's when you start
to drown out the beneficial effect.

00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:48.341
-Interesting.
-Yes.

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:52.099
So if you look at versus CVD
and also looking versus mortality,

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:55.099
fruit, raw vegetables and legumes
were beneficial,

00:23:55.099 --> 00:24:00.500
but when you look at cooked vegetables
that's when you see no effect on CVD

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.380
and maybe even directionally
maybe even a harmful effect.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.619
So maybe cooking methods
and what we add to food while cooking

00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:11.213
may be an important factor.

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:14.980
Yes, I wonder if this is because they're
cooking in Omega six seed oils

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.460
or they're cooking
in like heavy sugary sauces or something.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.980
It certainly makes you wonder
because that's not what I would expect.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.539
So of course everybody's got their bias.

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:26.619
When you see something you don't expect
you want to find out what makes it wrong

00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:29.099
and that's part of the trouble
we get into

00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:31.220
and I need to catch myself for doing that.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.740
Because interesting,
with increased fruit intake,

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.579
if somebody was diabetic
or had metabolic disease,

00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:38.779
you would think that would have
a deleterious effect,

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:41.700
but over the whole sample,
fruit intake was beneficial.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:45.999
Yes, well we have to also remember
that PURE represents general population,

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:50.819
people living in communities,
so it may very well be different for diabetics.

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:53.220
The diabetics may need to restrict

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.819
the very high sugary
or high G.I. type of fruit in their diet.

00:24:57.819 --> 00:25:01.539
But for general populations
fruit was largely beneficial.

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:05.700
So I guess it depends on the population
that you are studying

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.471
and diabetics may be different.

00:25:07.564 --> 00:25:10.619
Yeah and I think is important to point out
for the general population,

00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:14.460
fruit, vegetables, legumes can certainly be
part of a very healthy diet

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.900
but in certain populations
we need to measure their effects

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.980
specifically on that individual.

00:25:20.096 --> 00:25:21.137
Yes indeed.

00:25:21.246 --> 00:25:23.859
And then the other part of the study
was salt.

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:27.460
So salt and saturated fats have to be
the two most misunderstood

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.755
and misrepresented components
of our food intake.

00:25:30.838 --> 00:25:38.019
What you saw from a salt intake was that
a higher risk below 3 g of sodium

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:40.713
and a higher risk at above 6 g of sodium.

00:25:40.796 --> 00:25:43.059
So first before we get into the details

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:46.339
tell me the difference between
grams of sodium and grams of salt,

00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:48.479
just so we're all speaking
the same language here.

00:25:48.553 --> 00:25:55.180
Yes so 1 g of sodium 
is 2.5 g of table salt.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.299
So the WHO recommendation
is 2 g of sodium

00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:04.180
which is 5 g of table salt
or 1 teaspoon.

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:06.859
One teaspoon! Tiny amount.

00:26:07.003 --> 00:26:11.660
Yes, very difficult for most people to
consume in the short term

00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:15.340
let alone the long-term
and that's the recommendation.

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:18.903
Yeah, so the recommendation I think
is less than 2.4 g, or is it less than 2 g?

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:20.980
Now depends on the guidelines.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.886
WHO is 2 g, the US dietary guidelines 2.4,

00:26:25.961 --> 00:26:28.579
for high risk population

00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:32.700
the American Heart Association
recommends less than 1.5 g per day,

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.558
which is only 0.7 teaspoons of salt per day,
very low amount.

00:26:36.635 --> 00:26:38.619
And there was a study

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:43.775
showing only less than 3% of the population
adhered to the less than 2 g per day.

00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:49.579
Correct, and when you adjust
for random error, it's well below 1%.

00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:53.900
And when you look at people who meet
the sodium and potassium recommendation

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.019
it's only 0.001% of the population
who meets the recommendation.

00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:00.965
Now what we currently recommend
is what nobody eats.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:03.779
Right, and this
completely seems undoable.

00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:05.958
So where does recommendation
come from?

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:12.059
Well, the entire field hinges
on an assumed benefit

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:15.333
considering the effect of sodium
and blood pressure.

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:18.859
So given that sodium is associated
with higher blood pressure,

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:24.700
it's assumed that this will translate into
a cardiovascular benefit if we lower sodium.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.380
Now of course this assumes that sodium
affects only blood pressure

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.099
and has no other effects
on any other biological systems in the body.

00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:37.539
But because sodium is an essential nutrient
it doesn't quite work out that way.

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:43.380
So we agree that at high levels you get
toxicity and increase in blood pressure,

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.180
but at low levels you get deficiency.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.380
And so what that does is it activates certain
mechanisms that are built into our bodies

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.099
since salt is an essential nutrient.

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:57.059
So you get renin angiotensin
system activation at low levels.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:01.019
And this has been shown repeatedly
in intervention trials.

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:03.579
And so you have
dual competing mechanisms,

00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:06.019
which is consistent
with an essential nutrient.

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:08.339
Toxicity at high levels,
deficiency at low levels,

00:28:08.339 --> 00:28:10.140
sweet spot in the middle.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.619
And our findings reaffirm that and
other studies as well reaffirm that.

00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:16.180
There is not one single study ever

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.900
that has shown that low-sodium
at currently recommended levels

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.180
is better than average sodium,
that sweet spot of 3 to 5 g per day,

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.819
versus cardiovascular events
and mortality.

00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:30.299
High levels above 5 g per day,

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:33.460
certainly, we should get those populations
down to moderate levels,

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.940
but there's absolutely no evidence
to support low levels versus moderate levels

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.099
and yet that's what
we currently recommend

00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:43.065
again based on an assumed benefit,
looking at blood pressure.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.380
Right, an assumed benefit and a lot
of people will quote the DASH study,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.859
thinking that this was the end-all be-all
conclusive study on salt intake,

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:54.660
that the DASH study really was
the moving force to inform the guidelines.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.539
But tell us a little bit about the DASH study

00:28:57.539 --> 00:29:00.417
and maybe why that wasn't such a good idea
to use that to base our guidelines.

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:03.140
Well, the DASH study
was a proof of concept study,

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.539
it was an excellent study
in that it was a randomized trial

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:09.299
and people were provided the food
during a 30 day period.

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:11.900
So it was a feeding study.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.420
So it was an excellent study
in its own right in that way.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:21.660
However the problem is how we interpret
the data from PURE-- sorry from DASH,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.140
how we interpret the data from DASH

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.619
to make dietary recommendations
for cardiovascular disease prevention.

00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:30.819
Because there are a number of limitations
we have to point out.

00:29:30.819 --> 00:29:36.339
One is that we have to remember that this
was largely a salt sensitive group of people,

00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:40.059
a lot of hypertensives
and pre-hypertensives,

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:45.339
and we also need to remember that
potassium intake was low at baseline.

00:29:45.339 --> 00:29:48.460
So when you put someone
on a very low potassium diet,

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.740
lowering or changing their blood pressure
will result in changes--

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.019
changing their sodium
will result in changes in blood pressure.

00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:58.500
But when you give people higher amounts
of potassium,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.619
put them on an all-around healthy diet,
like the DASH diet,

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:04.539
that contains
many of high potassium foods,

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:08.420
then the effects of sodium
will be largely mitigated.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.420
So that's what DASH found.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.579
That when we consume
a low potassium diet

00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:14.859
you see large changes in blood pressure,

00:30:14.859 --> 00:30:17.619
which doesn't surprise
really anyone given that,

00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:20.059
but when you give them
a high potassium diet

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:23.099
then sodium becomes less important

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:26.859
and so the important point is
DASH is only 30 days.

00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:31.619
So we look at the long-term effects,
we need studies with longer follow-up

00:30:31.619 --> 00:30:34.059
to look at the effects in the long-term.

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:39.420
So some studies like TOPP have looked
at longer term follow-up.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.339
TOPP originally was designed to look
at blood pressure,

00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:45.019
so people were followed up
for a period of 36 months,

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:48.859
but what TOPP found
was that people initially...

00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:52.660
they never reached the 1.8 g per day target,

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.019
they lowered their sodium a little bit
to down to 2.5 g per day,

00:30:56.019 --> 00:31:01.220
but then by around a year they migrated
back to their original sodium intake.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.579
And so even though they followed
people up over time,

00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:06.779
we don't even know what people
were eating

00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:08.740
during the course
of the extended follow-up.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.779
But there's every reason to believe

00:31:10.779 --> 00:31:13.180
they were not even following
the low-sodium recommendation.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.660
So we really don't have any data
from randomized trials,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.285
so we have to look at the data
on long-term clinical events

00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:21.259
and that's where the cohort studies
come into play

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:24.059
and there's consistency
across a dozen cohort studies

00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:29.579
showing low-sodium is either associated
to harm versus moderate sodium

00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:32.339
or there's no change in risk.

00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:35.940
But no study is suggesting or showing
a lower risk with low-sodium

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.969
compared to average intake.

00:31:38.046 --> 00:31:40.779
Yeah, and that's what so frustrating
about this whole concept

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:44.460
is that it's one thing to make a recommendation
that has a neutral effect.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.140
It's another thing to make
an official recommendation

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.460
that actually might put you in harm's way
and that's what this seems to suggest

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.420
and that's what happened
with the carbohydrate recommendation

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.140
that sparked our diabetes and obesity crisis, 
and that's happened with the salt as well.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.900
The official recommendation
based on your studies

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.980
says you should be following a sodium
intake that is going to worsen your health.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.556
Why is there not a public outcry about this?
I mean that's unbelievable.

00:32:07.639 --> 00:32:10.420
Yes, so science works that way

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.391
in that when we have a position
for a long time, change takes time.

00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:17.140
It's always been like that
and so this is no different.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.539
And so eventually in the long-term
the truth does win out.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:23.380
And so the only thing we can do
is just keep publishing our science

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.796
and the truth eventually works itself out.

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:30.380
The other important point I want to go
back to about the DASH trial

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.380
that we don't hear much about

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.700
is the difference between the high
and low sodium diet--

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.099
sorry, high and low potassium diets

00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:39.332
and how that affected blood pressure
response to sodium,

00:32:39.401 --> 00:32:41.220
that's definitely worth repeating.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.579
So on the low potassium diet

00:32:43.579 --> 00:32:47.099
there was a larger blood pressure effect
with increase in sodium.

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:49.579
On the higher potassium diet

00:32:49.579 --> 00:32:53.900
was essentially no blood pressure impact
on increase in sodium or a very small amount.

00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:55.156
That's correct.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:33:00.059
Now when we say, what examples of low
and high potassium diets,

00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:03.380
when I think of a high potassium diet
I think of fresh vegetables,

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.859
when I think of a low potassium diet
I think of potato chips and pretzels

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.539
and packaged foods.

00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:13.900
And so I think where the salt is coming from
and what type of diet you're having

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.539
clearly makes a huge impact.

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:19.059
So as a supplies, the low-carb community,

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:22.579
if someone is eating their broccoli
and their cauliflower and their spinach

00:33:22.579 --> 00:33:25.460
and they're putting
their Himalayan salt on it

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.420
and having it with their know, chicken,
meat, fish, eggs and cheese,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.980
that's a perfectly reasonable diet where you
can be having the higher end of sodium

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.140
and based on the DASH study
you would say would have no effect.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.483
Is that a fair statement?

00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:44.299
Yeah absolutely, so you need to consider
the overall pattern of the diet,

00:33:44.299 --> 00:33:48.180
which is what you're saying, so that needs
to be taken to account as well.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.859
So it's not only necessarily
a potassium effect,

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:55.299
but also potassium is a marker
of the quality of the diet.

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:57.779
So if you have a higher potassium diet

00:33:57.779 --> 00:34:00.779
you're consuming an all-around
balanced healthy diet

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:03.339
with plenty of foods
containing high potassium;

00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:06.059
fruits, vegetables, dairy and nuts
and seeds for instance,

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:08.099
all are potassium foods.

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:11.219
So we have to consider within the context
of the dietary pattern.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.579
And DASH is important in that respect

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:18.460
because it shows that salt sensitivity
is not an immutable trait.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.980
You can mitigate it by eating
an all-around healthy diet.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.659
And when you do that we find
that salt becomes less important.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.980
So the messages just concentrate
on consuming an all-around healthy diet

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.979
and you don't need to be worried about
individual nutrients like salt and saturated fat.

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:38.019
Yeah, and the other component
about salt I want to bring up

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:42.139
was you also broke it down between those
with hypertension and those without hypertension.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:46.019
And there was a difference
between the low-end and the high-end.

00:34:46.019 --> 00:34:49.900
So for both groups,
whether you had hypertension or not,

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.900
the risk increased at the low-end
of sodium intake below 3 g.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.340
But at the higher end
if you didn't have hypertension

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.780
then that risk was mitigated,
the risk did not go up as much.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.780
So would that suggest there may not be
much of an upper limit

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.235
if you don't already have hypertension?

00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:09.139
That's right,
that's what that data suggests.

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:14.193
So if you don't have hypertension there's
no increase in risk even at the high-end.

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:18.500
So if we take a cautious approach,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.900
would say well, still that's aimed to get
people in the middle,

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.940
which is where most people are anyway.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.820
But the people who are hypertensives,
we did see an increased risk.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.380
So this would suggest that
rather than a population wide strategy,

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.380
best we target people with hypertension
who also consume high amounts of sodium

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.300
exceeding 5 g per day
and get them down to moderate levels.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.659
At the low-end, what's interesting,

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:48.059
we see an increased risk, as you said,
irrespective of blood pressure.

00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:51.019
So whether you have high blood pressure
or normal blood pressure,

00:35:51.019 --> 00:35:54.756
you still see the increased risk
at the low-end versus clinical events,

00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:57.857
cardiovascular disease and mortality.

00:35:57.913 --> 00:36:00.940
And what that suggests is another
mechanisms that play here.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.340
And again consistent with other data,

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.380
showing activation
of the renin angiotensin system,

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.579
which we know is vascular damaging.

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:12.619
And you get exponential rise in these
hormones with low levels of sodium

00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:16.420
and therefore you see the consistent results
across different subpopulations.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.219
It's been shown repeatedly in people
with hypertension and without hypertension,

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:22.860
people with diabetes and without diabetes

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.059
and people with vascular disease
and without vascular disease.

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.579
It's a consistent finding.

00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:30.911
How about congestive heart failure?
Where are the data on that?

00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:33.420
So congestive heart failure...

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.380
there was one study looking at data
from the EPIC-Norfolk

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:41.539
that found in healthy people
there was a lower risk of heart failure

00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:44.500
with moderate sodium
compared to low-sodium.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.820
So even versus heart failure
as a primary outcome,

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.980
in healthy people we see a beneficial effect
with moderate sodium

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.460
rather than with low-sodium.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.539
And looking at heart failure patients there
are some trials that are ongoing right now

00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:02.420
looking at low-sodium versus average
sodium in heart failure patients

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.460
so we will have to see
what the results are for that.

00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:10.179
I think it's fairly well accepted that heart
failure exacerbations and hospitalizations

00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:13.260
increase with increased sodium intake

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.019
in severe poorly controlled
heart failure patients.

00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:20.059
I have to re-examine
whether it's a mortality effect or not

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:23.699
or more of a symptom
and hospitalization effect.

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:26.460
And then at what levels
you break that down,

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.099
at what level
of renin angiotensin activation

00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:32.019
because most of these people are
on ACE inhibitors or ARBs,

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:34.219
which are really angiotensin blockers,

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:38.193
there's definitely a lot of other factors
to incorporate for the heart failure patients.

00:37:38.261 --> 00:37:41.420
That's right, that's one of the bigger
challenges with heart failure patients

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.195
is that they are
on all these different medications.

00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:49.820
So we need more data on what the effects
are for heart failure.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.219
Certainly there is compelling data
that again high amounts of sodium,

00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:57.460
exceeding 5 g per day is certainly harmful.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.179
So the question is whether very low
amounts is better than moderate levels.

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:06.539
Really that's the research question
and we need more data on that.

00:38:06.648 --> 00:38:09.659
Well, this has been a great discussion
of the PURE study

00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:16.099
and I mean for one study to upend our
common wisdom in dietary guidelines

00:38:16.099 --> 00:38:21.619
for saturated fat, for salt and
for lipid biomarkers is pretty remarkable.

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:26.500
So I think you did a great job with the study
and in representing the results

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.420
and I hope there's more to come.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.900
I mean you said it is ongoing
and there's more data coming.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.340
When can we expect
the next installment? Do you know?

00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:38.260
Yes, so right now we're working
on our other dietary papers.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.980
So obviously we collected using
a long food frequency questionnaire,

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.865
we're now looking
at all the different types of foods

00:38:45.866 --> 00:38:48.497
versus cardiovascular events
and mortality.

00:38:48.561 --> 00:38:51.460
So we want to spend the next two years
to publish all these papers

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.139
and then also one looking
at the dietary pattern as a whole.

00:38:55.139 --> 00:38:56.980
That would be a key paper as well.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.820
So this is what we are going to publish
in the next year or two

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.579
and also we'll do more dietary assessments
during follow-up

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:08.699
and that also helps improve the precision
and accuracy of the estimates of diet

00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:11.340
and then continue the follow-up
as much as we can

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:16.619
to look at effects on less studied outcomes
like cancers and respiratory events

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:19.100
and infectious disease as well.

00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:22.139
Great... If people want to learn more
about you and more about the PURE study

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.162
where can you direct them to go?

00:39:24.236 --> 00:39:26.860
There is a website online.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:34.139
If you go to PHRI.ca there is a link
that takes you to the PURE study.

00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:36.171
If you want to read up more on it,
it's there.

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:39.089
Great, Prof. Andrew Mente thank you
so much for joining me today.

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.208
My pleasure.
