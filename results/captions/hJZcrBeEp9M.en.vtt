00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:03.450
DANA PERINO.

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:06.820
"THE FIVE" ."

00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:11.224
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:13.060
WE ARE WAITING THE POSSIBLE

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.562
SENTENCING OF PAUL MANAFORT.

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:17.964
FIRST, SO WHILE YOU’RE HARD AT

00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:20.734
WORK, WHAT ARE THE DEMS UP TO?

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:21.702
ARGUING WHETHER THEY SHOULD

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:23.237
CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.172
WHAT A STRANGE PLACE TO BE,

00:00:25.173 --> 00:00:26.073
DEBATING HOW TO CONDEMN HATE.

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:29.009
YET FOR WEEKS THEY HAVE BEEN

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.178
DANCING AROUND ILHAN OMAR’S

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.845
REPEATED ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:33.180
HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI,

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.783
MISCAST AS THE ADULT IN THIS

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:36.884
COMEDY, PUSH THE RESOLUTION

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:37.518
CONDEMNING THESE SLURS BUT

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.520
BOWING TO THE HARD LEFT NEWBIES.

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:42.990
SHE IS DANCING AGAIN.

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.825
&gt;&gt; THIS ONE RESOLUTION

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:46.160
ADDRESSING THESE FORMS OF

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.862
HATRED, NOT MENTIONING HER NAME

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:49.196
BECAUSE IT’S NOT ABOUT HER.

00:00:49.197 --> 00:00:50.197
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SHE

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:51.832
UNDERSTOOD THE FULL WEIGHT OF

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.367
THE WORDS.

00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:54.335
I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT HER WORDS

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:58.272
WERE NOT BASED ON ANY

00:00:58.273 --> 00:00:59.240
ANTI-SEMITIC ATTITUDE BUT THAT

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.442
SHE DIDN’T HAVE A FULL

00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:03.311
APPRECIATION OF HOW THEY LANDED

00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.280
ON OTHER PEOPLE.

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.416
THESE WORDS HAVE A HISTORY.

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:09.851
AND A CULTURAL IMPACT THAT

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:11.419
MIGHT’VE BEEN UNKNOWN TO HER.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.321
&gt;&gt; Greg: SO SHE IS JUST

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:13.788
IGNORANT.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.890
NOW THEY ARE REVAMPING THE WHOLE

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.259
THING AND NOT MENTIONING OMAR BY
NOW THEY ARE REVAMPING THE WHOLE

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.393
THING AND NOT MENTIONING OMAR BY

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.826
NAME BUT INCLUDING ALL

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:20.228
PERSECUTED PEOPLE.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.096
THIS IS HOW FAR THE DEMOCRATS

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:22.597
HAVE FALLEN.

00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:25.366
THEY CAN’T EVEN AGREE TO REMIND

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:27.235
PEOPLE THAT THEY DON’T HATE THE

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:28.002
JEWS.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.573
IT SEEMS PRETTY EASY TO ME, BUT

00:01:31.574 --> 00:01:32.340
HERE’S MY DATED ARGUMENT AGAINST

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.110
THE RESOLUTION.

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:37.145
CONDEMNING HATE PUTS THE HATER

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:37.612
IN HARM’S WAY.

00:01:37.613 --> 00:01:39.881
KAMALA HARRIS AS I’M CONCERNED

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:42.584
OF THE SPOTLIGHT BEING PUT ON

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:45.320
CONGRESSMAN OMAR MAY PUT HER AT

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:45.821
RISK.

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:46.288
SORRY, SENATOR.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.256
THE SPOTLIGHT IS WHAT OMAR

00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:48.590
CRAVES.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.693
THE SPOTLIGHT IS THE WHOLE

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:51.993
POINT.

00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:53.228
BESIDES, WHEN THE SMOLLETT HOAX

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.297
TOOK OFF, DID ANYONE WORRY ABOUT

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:56.598
PUTTING TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.099
DANGER?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.001
WHEN PEOPLE SAID RED HATS WERE

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:00.168
RACIST, DID ANYONE CARE THAT IT

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.503
PUT TARGETS ON ENNIS AND HEADS?

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.705
DID ANYONE CARE AT ALL WHAT

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.240
ACTUAL HARM WAS DONE?

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.975
THESE ARE TRICK QUESTIONS

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.445
BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:09.711
NO.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.280
THE RADICAL LEFT HIS DOG

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:13.382
WHISTLES AWAY ABOUT JEWS AND THE

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.085
FEAR IS THAT CRITICISM OF

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.887
ANTI-SEMITISM MIGHT PUT HER IN

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:19.421
HARM’S WAY.

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.258
THERE ARE ROUGHLY 100,000

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.559
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS STILL LIVING

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560
WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE NAZIS.
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS STILL LIVING

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.694
WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE NAZIS.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.797
I WON HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT.

00:02:27.798 --> 00:02:32.968
SO JESSE, I GUESS IT’S WEIRD NOW

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:33.669
THAT THEY ARE WORRIED THAT IF

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.772
YOU COULD ASSIST ANTI-SEMITISM,

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:39.175
SOMEBODY ELSE GET HURT FROM, I

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.076
GUESS, ENRAGED JEWS.

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:41.811
NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT JEWS

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:42.678
ASSAULTING HER.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.747
IS THAT THE CASE QUESTION MIKE I

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:45.248
DON’T UNDERSTAND.

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.649
&gt;&gt; Jesse: YOU ARE ABLE TO

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.218
CRITICIZE ISRAEL WITHOUT BEING

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:49.652
ANTI-SEMITIC.

00:02:49.653 --> 00:02:50.853
OMAR APPARENTLY IS UNABLE OR

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:51.988
UNWILLING TO DO THAT BECAUSE

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.658
SHE’S BEEN WARNED A FEW TIMES.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.093
THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:57.527
NANCY PELOSI.

00:02:57.528 --> 00:02:59.462
SHE’S GOT ENOUGH TO SUCH A BAD

00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:00.029
START A SPEAKER.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.198
SHE CAME IN AND THE STOCK MARKET

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.966
CAME DOWN.

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:05.268
THE GRAIN NEW DEAL HAS BEEN A

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:05.635
DISASTER.

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:07.804
THEY HAVE SUFFERED FROM A

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:08.638
BLACKFACE CONTROVERSY ANOTHER

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.672
SEPARATING THROUGH AN

00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:10.607
ANTI-SEMITIC CONTROVERSY.

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:12.142
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.

00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:14.044
NANCY PELOSI DOES NOT WANT TO

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:14.878
ALIENATE THESE RADICAL FRESHMEN

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.578
BECAUSE SHE FEARS THEM BECAUSE

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.250
THEY HAVE MUCH JUICE.

00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:22.185
THEY HAVE THE GRASSROOTS, THE

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:23.086
YOUTH, THE SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:25.255
THEY DON’T WANT TO TAKE A LOSS.

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:26.490
THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE INFALLIBLE

00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:27.324
AND THEY ARE SELF-RIGHTEOUS AND

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:28.425
I DON’T WANT TO PLAY DEFENSE.

00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:30.360
THEY WANT TO GO ON FULL THROATED

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:31.328
OFFENSE AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.764
AND THEY DON’T WANT ANY BLUE DOG

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.400
DEMS CROSSING TO THE OTHER SIDE.
AND THEY DON’T WANT ANY BLUE DOG

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.534
DEMS CROSSING TO THE OTHER SIDE.

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.200
NANCY PELOSI HAS LOST CONTROL,

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:38.468
AND THAT’S WHY THEY ARE WATERING

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.670
IT DOWN.

00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.704
IT’S LIKE JOHN BOEHNER AND THE

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:42.406
TEA PARTY COULDN’T HANDLE THEM,

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:43.941
AND HE HAD A HUGE HEADACHE TO

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:44.775
DEAL WITH AND THAT’S WHAT YOU’RE

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:46.744
SEEING HERE.

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:51.014
&gt;&gt; Greg: THEY GOT THE JUICE,

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:52.683
WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO BASH THE

00:03:52.684 --> 00:03:53.183
JEWS.

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:54.885
THE RESOLUTION DOESN’T NAME OMAR

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:56.820
BY NAME BUT INSTEAD EVERY

00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:57.688
PERSECUTED GROUP.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.156
&gt;&gt; Dana: ALL HATE MATTERS.

00:03:59.157 --> 00:03:59.890
&gt;&gt; Greg: SO NOW I HAVE TO COME

00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.928
OUT AND SAY --

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.996
&gt;&gt; Dana: IT’S VERY CLUMSY.

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:06.597
THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:07.832
EMBARRASSED BY IT AND I THINK

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:08.566
THEY PROBABLY WISH THEY NEVER

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:10.167
WOULD’VE GONE DOWN THIS ROAD FOR

00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:11.902
THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF THE

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:15.606
FEATURES IT HAS EXPOSED.

00:04:15.607 --> 00:04:17.241
IT’S BEING CONSIDERED PRETTY

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:18.442
MUCH A JOKE.

00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:20.077
YES, ALL HATE MATTERS.

00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:21.312
ALL LIVES MATTER.

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:21.812
WE’LL GET IT.

00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:24.982
SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT’S A POINT

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:25.716
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHERE YOU HAVE

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:28.386
TO KIND OF WONDER ALSO WHAT THE

00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:29.620
-- THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOESN’T

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.223
HAVE THAT MUCH THEY ANYMORE

00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:33.291
BECAUSE OF ALL THEIR PROBLEMS

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:34.058
INSTITUTIONALLY AND THE

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.059
CREDIBILITY PROBLEMS.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.362
NOW YOU HAVE AMERICAN JEWS WHO

00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:38.129
HAVE TYPICALLY VOTED FOR

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.000
DEMOCRATS, REALLY HAVING TO MAKE

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:43.234
THIS DECISION ABOUT, DO WE

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:43.968
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS PARTY

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.572
IF THEY CAN’T EVEN SAY THAT

00:04:47.573 --> 00:04:49.441
ANTI-SEMITISM IS BAD.

00:04:49.442 --> 00:04:50.241
I DISAGREE WITH WHAT

00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:52.043
NANCY PELOSI SAID THERE THAT

00:04:52.044 --> 00:04:53.311
IT’S NOT ABOUT HER, MEANING

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:55.981
CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR.

00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:56.681
BECAUSE THIS INITIALLY STARTED

00:04:56.682 --> 00:04:58.383
LIKE SIX WEEKS AGO WHEN SHE

00:04:58.384 --> 00:04:59.384
FIRST GOT SWORN IN.

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:01.453
IF THEY WOULD HAVE NIPPED IT IN

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:02.454
THE BUD THEN, THEY WOULDN’T BE

00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:04.289
HAVING THIS PROBLEM NOW.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.024
&gt;&gt; Jesse: CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:06.925
REMEMBER WHEN NANCY CAME IN AND

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:08.326
THEY SAID NANCY WAS GOING TO CUT

00:05:08.327 --> 00:05:09.127
OFF PEOPLE’S HEADS AND THEY

00:05:09.128 --> 00:05:10.629
WEREN’T GOING TO REALIZE THEY

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.064
WERE BLEEDING.

00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:13.065
NOW NANCY IS BLEEDING.

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:15.100
SHE HASN’T BEEN ABLE TO EXECUTE

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:15.400
THIS.

00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:18.303
&gt;&gt; Greg: JEDEDIAH, OMAR IS

00:05:18.304 --> 00:05:19.905
GETTING SOME VERY STRONG SUPPORT

00:05:19.906 --> 00:05:24.076
FROM DAVID DUKE WHO SAYS --

00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:25.611
&gt;&gt; Dana: DOES SHE CONDEMN

00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:26.011
DAVID DUKE?

00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:27.646
&gt;&gt; Greg: I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:29.415
HE CLAIMS THAT OMAR IS THE MOST

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:30.816
IMPORTANT MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:31.850
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: IT’S AMAZING SHE

00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:33.452
DOESN’T TAKE EAT FROM THAT.

00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:37.923
SHE DOESN’T TAKE HEAT FOR THAT.

00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:43.529
&gt;&gt; Jesse: PETER DOOCY SHOULD

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.896
ASK HER.

00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:44.597
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: FOR NANCY PELOSI

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:46.699
TO COME OUT AND SAY IT’S NOT

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.099
ABOUT OMAR.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.501
OF COURSE IT IS AND IT WOULD

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:50.503
BENEFIT YOU TO SAY THAT IT IS

00:05:50.504 --> 00:05:50.870
ABOUT HER.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.571
BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE ARE ASKING,

00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:53.572
WHO IS IT ABOUT?

00:05:53.573 --> 00:05:54.907
IS IT ABOUT ALL OF YOU THAT YOU

00:05:54.908 --> 00:05:58.878
ALL FELT ENGAGED, AND MAKE THIS

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.612
VAGUE, ODD COMMENTARY ABOUT THIS

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:03.249
WHEN IN FACT ALL THE LANGUAGE IN
VAGUE, ODD COMMENTARY ABOUT THIS

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.383
WHEN IN FACT ALL THE LANGUAGE IN

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.451
IT, IT POINTS EXACTLY TO THE

00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:06.886
COMMENTS OMAR MADE, TALKING

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:08.221
ABOUT DUAL ALLEGIANCE.

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:10.590
IT SHOWS A REFUSAL ON THEIR PART

00:06:10.591 --> 00:06:12.659
WHEN SOMEONE OF THEIR OWN RANK

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.394
DOES SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS LIKE

00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:15.461
NIXON ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS,

00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.430
THEY ARE REFUSING TO HOLD THAT

00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:18.264
PERSON ACCOUNTABLE.

00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:19.499
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.870
THE COUNTRY, IT MAY MAKE THE

00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:24.804
BASE HAPPY BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:26.439
IN THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.707
THAT LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WHY

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:28.608
DID THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FEEL

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:30.443
THEY NEED TO DO THIS.

00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:32.245
ARE PEOPLE CONFUSED?

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:33.246
DO THEY THINK THE

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:35.015
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS

00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:35.615
REPRESENTATIVE OF HATE?

00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:37.784
HUGE PROBLEM.

00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:38.451
NANCY PELOSI BETTER GET INTO

00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:38.752
LINE.

00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:39.853
SHE’S AFRAID OF THE NEWBIES AND

00:06:39.854 --> 00:06:41.254
SHE’S BEEN THERE A LONG TIME AND

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.457
IT SHOWS.

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:44.958
&gt;&gt; Greg: I SHOULD LOOK THIS

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:45.625
WAY.

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:46.760
THE VOTING HAS STARTED, EVEN

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.229
THOUGH I’M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.529
DANA.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.231
LOOK AT THE VOTING OVER THERE,

00:06:51.232 --> 00:06:51.531
JUAN.

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:52.232
WHY THE OBSESSION WITH ISRAEL

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:55.235
AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE?

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:57.638
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT COMES

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.071
FROM ACADEMIA?

00:06:58.072 --> 00:06:59.373
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT.

00:06:59.374 --> 00:07:00.574
IS IT BECAUSE THEY DON’T

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:02.309
UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE THAT

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.810
THEY ARE USING?

00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:04.878
&gt;&gt; Juan: I THINK IN HER CASE,

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.547
SHE HAS UNFAMILIAR SOME OF THESE

00:07:06.548 --> 00:07:07.081
ANTI-SEMITIC TROPES.

00:07:07.082 --> 00:07:10.084
TO ME, THIS IS NOT THE ISSUE.

00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:12.319
I THINK THEY WANT TO HAVE HONEST

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.187
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AMERICAN

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:15.022
POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND

00:07:15.023 --> 00:07:16.223
WHAT THEY ARE RUNNING INTO HIS

00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:18.926
PEOPLE SAYING OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:07:18.927 --> 00:07:19.627
SHE USED THESE ANTI-SEMITIC

00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:21.262
TROPES AND THEREFORE WE CAN

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:21.896
IGNORE THE LARGER TOPIC.

00:07:21.897 --> 00:07:24.532
I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:26.267
LIKE ILHAN OMAR COMING INTO THE

00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:29.003
CONGRESS, YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE

00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:31.072
FIRST TWO MUSLIM WOMEN.

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:31.772
SUDDENLY THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON

00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:34.308
PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS IS

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.909
INTRODUCED PEOPLE SAY WE

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.311
HAVEN’T HEARD THIS BEFORE.

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:37.812
HANG ON.

00:07:37.813 --> 00:07:40.915
&gt;&gt; Greg: WHAT IS THE LARGER

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:41.249
TOPIC?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.651
&gt;&gt; Juan: I ALREADY SAID IT’S

00:07:43.652 --> 00:07:46.154
YOU AND FOREIGN POLICY IN THE

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:47.655
MIDDLE EAST.

00:07:47.656 --> 00:07:49.657
YOU GET BERNIE SANDERS WHO IS

00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:51.726
JEWISH, SAYING DON’T EQUATE

00:07:51.727 --> 00:07:52.794
ANTI-SEMITISM WITH LEGITIMATE

00:07:52.795 --> 00:07:53.995
CRITICISM OF THE NETANYAHU

00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:54.662
GOVERNMENT AND ISRAEL.

00:07:54.663 --> 00:07:57.599
ELIZABETH WARREN BRANDING ISRAEL

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.605
THE EQUIVALENT OF ANTI-SEMITISM,
ELIZABETH WARREN BRANDING ISRAEL

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:05.739
THE EQUIVALENT OF ANTI-SEMITISM,

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:04.839
CHILLING IN AN AMERICAN

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.240
DEMOCRACY.

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.242
HERE IS JAY STREET, A JEWISH

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:07.675
LOVING GROUP.

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:09.644
"THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE

00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:11.713
JEWISH COMMUNITY IS WHITE

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:12.547
NATIONALISM ON THE RIGHT THAT

00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:15.650
TRUMP HAS ONLY USED BOTH IN THE

00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:16.718
U.S. AND GLOBALLY."

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:19.988
WHAT YOU GET FROM REPUBLICANS IS

00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:21.423
THE LIGHT, AND THE PROBLEM FOR

00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:22.491
DEMOCRATS RATHER THAN SAYING

00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:24.726
WHEN TRUMP SAYS TO A GROUP OF

00:08:24.727 --> 00:08:27.763
JEWISH BUSINESSMEN, YEAH, YOU

00:08:27.764 --> 00:08:30.599
WANT TO BUY MACULAR POLITICIANS

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.567
AND CONTROL THEM OR WHEN KEVIN

00:08:32.568 --> 00:08:33.435
McCARTHY GOES HAVE TO GEORGE

00:08:33.436 --> 00:08:36.038
SOROS, TOM STEYER, AND BLOOMBERG

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.872
IS BUYING ELECTIONS.

00:08:36.873 --> 00:08:37.773
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: DEMOCRATS, EVERY

00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:39.174
TIME TRUMP SAYS SOMETHING THEY

00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:41.410
DON’T LIE, THEY EXPECT

00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:42.778
REPUBLICANS TO HOLD TRUMP

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:43.178
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.848
NOW YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO,

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:47.816
WHETHER SHE MEANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:08:47.817 --> 00:08:48.484
ISRAELI POLICY OR NOT, HER

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:53.055
COMMENTS "IT’S ALL ABOUT THE

00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:54.256
BENJAMINS," IT’S BEEN

00:08:54.257 --> 00:08:55.257
UNIVERSALLY CONDEMNED.

00:08:55.258 --> 00:08:57.293
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM PUTTING YOUR

00:08:57.294 --> 00:09:01.363
-- PUTTING HER IN A RESOLUTION.

00:09:01.364 --> 00:09:03.432
&gt;&gt; Juan: THEY ARE CONDEMNING

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:04.400
ANTI-SEMITISM AND --

00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:05.434
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: FROM HER.

00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:07.503
UNTIL THEY HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE,

00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:09.538
GUESS WHAT, SHE’S BEING

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:09.939
EMPOWERED.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.741
&gt;&gt; Juan: IF THEY ARE

00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:15.044
CONDEMNING HATRED, WHY ARE

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:16.812
REPUBLICANS HAVING SUCH TROUBLE

00:09:16.813 --> 00:09:17.880
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS AREN’T

00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.483
INTERESTED IN CONDEMNING HATRED.

00:09:20.484 --> 00:09:21.050
THEY ARE INTERESTED IN

00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:23.219
CONDEMNING DEMOCRATS AND OMAR.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:23.986
THEY ARE SAYING DON’T DO THIS.

00:09:23.987 --> 00:09:27.490
YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER OMAR.

00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:28.024
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:31.294
SYC LEADING DEMOCRATS AND, IS IT

00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:31.995
ABOUT SILENCING LEGITIMATE

00:09:31.996 --> 00:09:34.230
CRITICISM OF ISRAEL?

00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:37.066
AND SMEARING, WHICH IS WHAT WE

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:38.234
SAW IN WEST VIRGINIA WITH THE

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:38.568
POSTER.

00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:42.105
&gt;&gt; Jesse: YOU ARE DEFLECTING.

00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:43.406
YOU DIDN’T ANSWER GREG’S

00:09:43.407 --> 00:09:43.773
QUESTION.

00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:45.375
GREG ASKED ABOUT U.S. FOREIGN

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.042
POLICY, WHY IS THERE AN

00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:46.776
OBSESSION WITH ISRAEL AND YOU

00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:50.947
DIDN’T ANSWER.

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:54.651
WHY IS IT ABOUT ISRAEL?

00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:55.352
THEY ARE THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC

00:09:55.353 --> 00:09:58.722
COUNTRY IN THAT REGION.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.358
THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD IS

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:03.059
ABOVE AND BEYOND IRAN,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.493
SAUDI ARABIA.

00:10:03.494 --> 00:10:05.695
I DON’T HEAR CRITICISM OF THOSE

00:10:05.696 --> 00:10:06.463
COUNTRIES.

00:10:06.464 --> 00:10:08.665
YOU ONLY SEE CRITICISM OF

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:09.232
ISRAEL.

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.600
&gt;&gt; Juan: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:13.670
&gt;&gt; Jesse: HAS OMAR SPOKEN OUT

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.205
ABOUT IRANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS

00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:15.973
ABUSES, SAUDI HUMAN RIGHTS

00:10:15.974 --> 00:10:16.306
ABUSES?

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:20.244
I HAVEN’T HEARD HER.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.879
&gt;&gt; Juan: AMERICA SPEAKS OUT

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.814
ABOUT THESE ISSUES BECAUSE THERE

00:10:23.815 --> 00:10:24.782
HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD IS SO

00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:25.449
HORRIFIC.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.851
YOU ARE IGNORING ISRAEL’S RECORD

00:10:27.852 --> 00:10:30.254
IN TERMS OF OCCUPYING WEST BANK

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.155
TERRITORIES, THEIR TREATMENT OF

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:32.222
PALESTINIANS, AND QUESTIONS

00:10:32.223 --> 00:10:35.494
ABOUT A TWO-STATE SOLUTION WHICH
