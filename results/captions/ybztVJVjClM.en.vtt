ABOUT THE MOMENT OF THE
DECISION.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.257 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE A LOT OF THOUGHT GOES
INTO THIS.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.660
WHAT IS THAT MOMENT OF DECISION
LIKE WHEN YOU SAY, "I'M GOING TO

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.162 align:start position:0%
MAKE THE LEAP?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.296 align:start position:0%
I'M GOING TO DO IT."

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.631 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A HARD DECISION.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:42.034 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE THINK IT'S INEVITABLE AND
EASY AND WE HAVE QUITE A FEW

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:45.238 align:start position:0%
CANDIDATES RUNNING THIS TIME AND
I GIVE THEM CREDIT BECAUSE TO

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.875 align:start position:0%
PUT YOURSELF THERE FOR A
GRUELING YEAR, TWO-YEAR JOURNEY.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:52.645
AS SOON AS I STARTED LOOKING AT
MY HESITATIONS AND REASONS I WAS

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.847 align:start position:0%
USING, THEY WERE MORE COMING
FROM FEAR THAN FAITH.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.017
AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT YOU
SHOULD LIVE LIFE WITH COURAGE

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.853 align:start position:0%
AND PURSUE YOUR DREAMS AND
ASPIRATIONS.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:04.924 size:88% position:44%
AND I REALIZED MY DREAMS FOR
THIS COUNTRY WERE FAR BIGGER

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:06.726 align:start position:0%
THAN THE FEARS I HAD ABOUT
MYSELF.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.495
AND I COME FROM A HISTORY-- WE
BOTH COME FROM A HISTORY WHERE

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:12.899
PEOPLE PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE
FOR THIS NATION, AND WHY SHOULD

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:16.235 align:start position:0%
I WORRY ABOUT MY FEARS.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:17.436 align:start position:0%
THOSE ARE SMALL.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.641
THE AMBITIONS I HAVE FOR THE
UNITED STATES ARE LARGE AND AND

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:25.278 align:start position:0%
GOOD WILLING GET A CHANCE TO
SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP DURING THIS

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:37.256
BEAUTIFUL VIDEO WHEN YOU FIRST
LAUNCHED-- YOU ANNOUNCED YOUR

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:38.958
CAMPAIGN, YOU FIRST LAUNCHED.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
AND IT'S VERY HOPEFUL.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:41.627 size:81% position:41%
YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT LOVE.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.761 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:45.765 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LOVE OF YOUR
COUNTRY, LOVE OF YOUR FELLOW MAN

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:50.603
PUP SAID VERY SPECIFICALLY YOU
DON'T HAVE HATE IN YOUR HEART.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.104 align:start position:0%
YOU EVEN SAID YOU LOVE DONALD
TRUMP.

00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:55.208
&gt;&gt; WELL, MY MOM TAUGHT SUNDAY
SCHOOL, AND SHE TAUGHT ME LOVE

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.344 align:start position:0%
YOUR NEIGHBOR, NO EXCEPTION
EXRKZ NEVER LET SOMEONE PULL YOU

00:02:58.377 --> 00:02:59.645 align:start position:0%
SO LOW YOU HATE THEM.

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.282 align:start position:0%
SO I'M NOT GOING TO LET DONALD
TRUMP CONTORT MY SOUL.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:10.356
I BELIEVE IN THIS ELECTION, MORE
THAN EVER, WE NEED A'S VIVAL OF

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.524 align:start position:0%
GRACE IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.659
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR
POLITICS, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:16.963 align:start position:0%
OUR POLITICS RIGHT NOW IS
UNDERMINING OUR ABILITY TO GET

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.131 align:start position:0%
BIG THINGS DONE.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:21.634 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THE
FORCES TEARING US APART ARE

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.470 align:start position:0%
STRONGER THAN THE FORCES BINDING
US TOGETHER.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
I THINK PATRIOTISM MEANS LOVE OF
COUNTRY.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.742 size:84% position:42%
YOU CAN'T LOVE YOUR COUNTRY
UNLESS YOU LOVE YOUR FELLOW

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:30.509 align:start position:0%
COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.645 align:start position:0%
NOW, WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO
AGREE.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:35.181 align:start position:0%
WE MAY-- WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO
AGREE.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:38.718
WE MAY HAVE DAYS WHERE WE DON'T
LIKE EACH OTHER, BUT WE HAVE

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:39.585
COME TO THE POINT IN AMERICA
WHERE THE BIGGEST ASPIRATION IS

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:45.057 align:start position:0%
TOLERANCE.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.929 align:start position:0%
THE REALITY IS WHAT LOVE SAYS IS
THAT YOU AND I SHARE A COMMON

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.497 align:start position:0%
DESTINY, THAT WE NEED EACH
OTHER.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
THAT IF YOUR KIDS DON'T GO TO A
GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOL OR HAVE

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start position:0%
HEALTH CARE, THEN MY KIDS ARE
THE LESSER FOR IT.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS
FOUNDED-- WRITTEN, LITERALLY, BY

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.475 align:start position:0%
OUR IMPERFECT GENIUSES WHO WROTE
THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.310
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A THEOCRACY.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.045
WE'RE NOT ALL OF THE SAME RACE.

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.215
WE FOUNDED OUR NATION ON IDEALS,
AND OUR FOUNDERS NEW EXWOOU THAT

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:11.250 align:start position:0%
WAS A TOUGH WAY TO FOUND A
COUNTRY.

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:16.956
AS BIG AS THESE IDEALS ARE, WE
HAVE TO HAVE HAVE A CONNECTION

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.190 align:start position:0%
TO EACH OTHER.

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:21.727 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WITH THE DECLARATION SAYS
AT THE END IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.798
MAKE THIS NATION WORK WE MUST
MUTUAL LEPLEDGE, PLEDGE TO EACH

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.733 align:start position:0%
OTHER, OUR ARMS AND OUR
FORTUNES.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:31.904
YOU TURN ON TV OR YOU WATCH OUR
POLITICS TRASH TALKING, TWITTER

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:35.441 align:start position:0%
TROLLING, WHERE IS THE SACRED
MORE THAN NRN THAT?

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.176 size:84% position:42%
MOST AMERICANS, DEMOCRAT OR
REPUBLICAN, BELIEVE THAT

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.145 align:start position:0%
EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO
HEALTH CARE.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:41.514
MOST AMERICANS -- DEMOCRAT AND
REPUBLICAN-- BELIEVE KIDS SHOULD

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.682 size:81% position:41%
HAVE GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:46.786
WE HAVE SO MUCH COMMON GROUND,
AND SO MUCH COMMON PAIN, BUT

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.555 size:88% position:44%
WE'VE LOST A SENSE OF COMMON
PURPOSE TO SEIZE THAT COMMON

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:52.358 align:start position:0%
GROUND AND DEAL WITH THAT COMMON
PAIN.

00:04:52.391 --> 00:05:00.132 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU--

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:05.137
&gt;&gt; SO YOU MAY-- I MAY LOVE THE
PEOPLE, BUT I DON'T WANT DONALD

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:09.675 align:start position:0%

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:11.243 align:start position:0%

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:15.081 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.816 align:start position:0%
GET THE NOMINATION FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.018 align:start position:0%
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS, A
LOT OF COLLEAGUES --

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:23.622 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU MAD I CANNOT ANNOUNCE
ON THIS SHOW.

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:29.095 size:88% position:44%
I HAVE SEEN OTHERS, MY DEAR
FRIEND KIRSTEN JILLEN BRAND.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.865 align:start position:0%
KIRSTEN IS LIKE A SISTER TO ME

RIVALRY.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.700 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LET'S HEAR IT.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:43.075
LET'S HEAR WHY YOU'RE A BETTER
CHOICE THAN KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND,

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
WHY ARE YOU A BETTER CHANCE THAN
THE 54 OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING.

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:52.184
THERE HAS TO BE A REASON WHY
YOUR MESSAGE IS BETTER THAN THE

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:53.285 size:88% position:44%
OTHER PEOPLE AND WHAT IS IT?

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.856 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; THE 2020 RACE STANDS FOR,
THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.157 align:start position:0%
RUNNING, 2,020 PEOPLE.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.726
LOOK, I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE
RUNNING AT THE MOST DIFFICULT

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.264
PROBLEMS THIS COUNTRY HAD, FROM
THE TIME I MOVED INTO AN INNER

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:09.034
CITY LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD,
THEY STILL LIVE IN, TAKING ON

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:11.337 align:start position:0%
BATTLES PEOPLE STAYED COULDN'T
BE DONE.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.074 align:start position:0%
I REMEMBER PEOPLE LITERALLY
LAUGH AT ME AS I WOULD GO AROUND

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:18.110
AS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW
YORK TALKING ABOUT THE GREATNESS

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:21.814 align:start position:0%
OF NEWARK AND NOW OUR CITY IS
GOING THROUGH THE BIGGEST

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:25.117 size:88% position:44%
ECONOMIC REVIVAL SINCE 1960.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.286 align:start position:0%
WHEN I GOT TO WASHINGTON, PEOPLE
WERE CYNICAL.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.622 align:start position:0%
THEY TOLD ME WE COULDN'T MAKE
BIG CHANGE.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:33.659
AND ONE OF MY BIGGEST ISSUES FOR
GOING TO WASHINGTON WAS JUSTICE,

00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:36.862 align:start position:0%
REFORMING OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:40.900
I GOT DOWN TO THE SENATE FLOOR,
AND THE EVENTUAL CHAIRMAN OF THE

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.735 align:start position:0%
JUDICIALLY COMMITTEE WAS
SPEAKING AGAINST WHAT I WANTED

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:47.506 align:start position:0%
TO DO, WHICH WAS LOWERING
SENTENCES AND ENDING MANDATORY

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.241 align:start position:0%
MIN MINIMUMS.

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:52.178
I SAT DOWN WITH HIM AND WE PUT
TOGETHER A PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.279
THAT IS NOW THE LAW OF THE LAND.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.247 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE REFORM ACT THAT WAS

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.849 align:start position:0%
SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT ABOUT A
MONTH AGO?

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:57.983 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:00.753 size:88% position:44%
IT'S SOMETHING I WORKED FIVE
YEARS ON, AND WE GOT IT DONE

00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:02.922
WITH A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND
A SO-CALLED DIVIDED CONGRESS.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.223 align:start position:0%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
AND SO --

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:06.792 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE PRESIDENT
TAKES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT.

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:10.362 align:start position:0%
THE PRESIDENT TAKES A LOT OF
CREDIT FOR THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.630 align:start position:0%
REFORM.

00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:14.366
COULD IT HAVE GOTTEN DONE WITH A
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IN THERE OR

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
WOULD THE REPUBLICANS NOT HAVE
COME ALONG AT ALL UNLESS A

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:20.372 align:start position:0%
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT GOT CREDIT
FOR IT.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:23.175
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION OF COULD IT HAVE
GOTTEN DONE-- AMERICAN HISTORY

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.312 align:start position:0%
IS THE PERPETUAL TESTIMONY TO
THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:27.113 align:start position:0%
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.647 align:start position:0%
WE CAN GET ANYTHING DONE WE WANT
TO.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.848 align:start position:0%
WE'VE PROVEN THAT.

00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:33.385 align:start position:0%
