00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.735
-You're about to do
what is my dream tour.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.105
You're going to Europe
to do stand-up in Europe,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.505
and you're also going
in the winter.

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.941
-Are you one of those Americans

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.043
that just automatically thinks
they're smarter over there?

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.345
'Cause you gotta go --
'Cause everybody American goes,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.781
"Oh, my God, the food and
the people are so enlightened."

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.182
You go over there,
it's some idiot

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:18.584
eating fish and chips,

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.587
screaming about soccer
or whatever.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.390
It's like, "I know that guy.
I've seen that guy," you know?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.893
It's like everybody's over there
in, like, lab coats,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.761
figuring stuff out.
They're not.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.062
[ Laughter ]

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:32.031
Everything is so much older
and so much cultured.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.568
They still get on social media
and trash each other.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.004
[ Laughter ]
-Are you going to any places?

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.906
You've obviously toured a lot
over there before.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.040
Are you going places
you've never been?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.541
-Yes, this is like a thrash.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.344
I'm going through
Eastern Europe -- like Estonia.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.779
I'm doing Prague, Bosnia.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.582
Poland is a big one
I wanted to go to.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:53.118
-Do you go in
with an expectation?

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:54.620
Do you think to yourself,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.956
"Oh, a Bosnian audience
will like this part of my act?"

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.424
Or you do just go in and do
exactly what you would do?

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:02.562
-I act like I'm right here,
because if you go over there --

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.863
The first time I did London,

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.732
like, I was just in my head
the whole time.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.433
I'd have, like, a joke
coming up about, like --

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.802
and it involved a squirrel,
and then, in my head,

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.670
I'd be like, "Do they have
squirrels over here?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640
Did I see a squirrel?
Is this going to bomb?"

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.007
And I would be,
like, freaking out.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.376
And then, I swear to God,

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.010
you pull back and
then they'd pull back,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.879
and then it just becomes
like this staring contest.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.548
So I just act like I'm here.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:27.053
I use references, I use slang,
and I just go until it bombs.

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:28.921
And then I make fun of it
that they didn't get it,

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.723
and then I just go again.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.626
But I've gotten
some of the funniest...

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.662
I was in Stockholm, Sweden,
one time,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.864
and I was onstage
and there was some guy...

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:40.400
I was saying, "All right,
what do I do after this?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.968
Where should I go?"
Blah-blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.503
And I just hear this guy
in the crowd yells out.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.139
He goes, "Come to my house!
We'll have a party!"

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.308
[ Laughter ]

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:52.045
I was just like, "Yeah, I think
I'm going to skip that one."

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.312
[ Laughter ]

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.582
I don't think I'm gonna meet you
anywhere, buddy.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.516
But they had
a great sense of humor.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:58.918
And I remember when I did
Stockholm --

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.921
uh, uh, Stockholm, Sweden --

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.422
I came out and I said, "Hey,

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.091
it's great to be here
in Switzerland."

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.660
And they all laughed,
thinking I was joking,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.963
and I just played it off.
I was like, "Aw, [Bleep]."

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.632
[ Laughter ]
"So, anyways, I, uh..."

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:16.769
-Do you feel a bigger rush?
Is there something, you know,

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.505
when you think about all
the small rooms you played here

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:20.873
and where you're from,

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.575
and when you go over
to a whole nother country,

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.843
do you have a rush of,
"I can't believe

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.111
I'm killing it in a foreign
country in a big crowd"?

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.047
-Yeah, definitely,
but I always had that thing,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.017
you know, you have a job to do,
these people paid for a sitter.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.418
They're coming out
in that thing,

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:33.585
and I'm always trying
to get, like, better.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.254
But there's definitely --

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.557
I've been starting to add
some shows over there,

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:41.127
and it's just like, you know,
it's YouTube, it's Netflix.

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:43.829
Like, your stuff
can just go international.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.932
And I definitely feel blessed
that I can go to these places,

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.834
make a little bit of money,
you know,

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:50.837
and, yeah, meet
all these different people.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.372
-Can you enjoy yourself
the day of?

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:55.608
Like, if you -- Obviously,
you're going city to city,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:56.742
so you don't have a lot of time.

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:58.444
If you have a show at night
in Prague,

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.279
can you go out and
enjoy a day in Prague,

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.248
or are you in your head about
the fact that you got a show?

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.350
-Probably not, 'cause
this is my first time there.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.985
The first time there
is always just

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.620
you go there
like, you know, an animal,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.489
sleeping on a futon
and all that.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.890
Then, you build a following.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.392
Then, I can bring my wife,
you know?

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.894
She shows up once
all the land's been cleared,

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.962
all the hard work's done.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.699
"No, I want to go.
That seems like fun."

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.934
[ Laughter ]
I didn't bring her.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.836
She'd probably buy
some stupid antique over there,

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.070
and I got to figure out
how to bring it

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.872
halfway across the world.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.709
"But I like it."
-You break even

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.110
on the whole trip
'cause you got an old piano.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.679
-That's the word
that's gonna kill me earlier

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.482
is gonna be "why."
That's what my wife always does.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.918
"Do you like this?"
"No, I don't like it.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.119
It's a piece of [Bleep].
Don't get it."

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.187
And then she's always
just like, "Why?"

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.324
[ Laughter ]
"But I like it."

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.891
And then, it's just like,
"All right, buy it!"

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.428
"No, but I want you
to like it, too."

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.997
And it's just like --
there's just no winning.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.567
-You're a licensed
helicopter pilot.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.668
-Yes, I am.
-This is true.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.603
How long has this been the case?

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.873
-Um, I got it in 2014 or 2015.
I can't remember.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.609
-What made you want to become
a licensed helicopter pilot?

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.913
-A conspiracy theory and
living in Los Angeles.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.349
-What is the conspiracy theory
that led you to it?

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.118
-Well I'm not into --
Like, you know, people think

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.452
if you're into
conspiracy theory,

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.054
they just automatically think
that you think, you know,

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.456
there's lizard people
and shape-shifters

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:18.991
and you have
this aluminum hat on.

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.126
No, I just sort of read up
on the banking system,

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.663
and I'm like, "This is kind of
a giant Ponzi scheme."

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:24.964
[ Laughter ]

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.933
And you know,
I was living in L.A.,

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.067
And I was just looking at us

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.668
like, "You can't get out
of this city

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:30.970
even when it works.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.038
Like, what if [Bleep]
ever hit the fan?

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:34.741
How do I get out of here?"
And it just seemed like

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.709
up and out was
the only way to do it, so...

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:40.045
-Yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:43.182
-I think you know.
-Yeah, but then, I always

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:45.384
watched "Magnum, P.I.,"
and I always liked TC,

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.020
and he flew that Huey 500,
which I thought was cool.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.023
And I'm also sort of
a closet gearhead,

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:52.257
where I don't know
a lot of stuff,

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:54.660
but I watch videos
of people repairing engines.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.129
And I just really got into it,
and next thing you know,

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.396
I'm flying around
in those things.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:58.764
-I guess my question
would be, though,

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:01.367
based on your escape plan,
do you have your own helicopter?

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.537
-No, there's
a lot of holes in it.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:05.771
[ Laughter ]

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.040
-This is not enough
for your family.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.610
[ Laughter ]

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.678
-I know. I know.

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:15.214
But I can only afford --
I just rent those things.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.350
It's just like --
Yeah, that's the thing.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.550
There's another thing, too.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.085
Whenever you watch,
like, a zombie movie

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:22.354
and some guy comes running up
to, like, a plane --

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:24.957
a helicopter, I should say --
and just starts it up

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.226
like he's getting
in, like, you know, a Corvette

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.295
and just drives away,
that's not how it works.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.929
You got to warm
the whole thing up.

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:32.765
You'd have to kill
half the zombies

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.901
by the time you went through
your preflight,

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.735
just to get up and out of there.

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.671
I didn't know that,
so I went ahead and I did it.

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.106
And I will tell you,

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.507
it's one of the big
accomplishments in my life,

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.375
'cause I was terrible in school.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.812
But that was something
that I was actually --

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.914
I wasn't worried
about learning how the fly it.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.349
It was the ground school and
all the rules you had to know.

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.686
But I was so interested
and it was so fascinating,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:56.289
I was actually able to do it.
So, you know....

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.357
-Well, fantastic.
And congratulations on that.

00:05:58.357 --> 00:05:59.725
-Thank you.
-Congrats on the show.

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:02.095
Have a great trip to Europe.
-Oh, thank you very much.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.262
-It's always a pleasure
to see you.

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.329
-I'm grateful
we finally did this.

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:05.365
-Bill Burr, everybody!
