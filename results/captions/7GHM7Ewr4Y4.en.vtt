00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.970
And that brings us to Politics Monday.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.300
And with that, here's Stu Rothenberg, senior
editor of Inside Elections, and Susan Page,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.290
USA Today's Washington bureau chief.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.290
Susan, let me start with you.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.870
Let me start with something that Speaker Pelosi
told "The Washington Post" magazine last week,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.340
that they posted it today.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.840
She was asked whether she supported impeaching
President Trump.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.310
She said: "Impeachment is so divisive to the
country that unless there's something so compelling

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.240
and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think
we should go down that path, because it divides

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.310
the country, and he's just not worth it."

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.890
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau Chief, USA Today:
This is consistent with what she's been saying

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.140
in the past, although it's a little blunter.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.329
It goes a step further.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.630
It's consistent with what Adam Schiff and
Jerry Nadler, two of the key Democratic committee

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.790
chairmen, have been saying.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.970
But it is going to make a lot of Democrats
unhappy who believe that the right thing is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.930
to move ahead with impeachment proceedings
against the president.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.290
Nancy Pelosi, I think, is speaking from the
perspective of someone who lived through the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.670
Bill Clinton impeachment, where the House
was able to convict.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.899
The Senate was -- the House was able to impeach.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.559
The Senate wasn't able to convict.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.952
And the party that bore the burden of a backlash
was the party that impeached -- tried to impeach

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:09.952
the president.

00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:11.439
So I think that is the perspective.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.640
But there's -- the Democrats are going to
be divided on this issue.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.020
JOHN YANG: And members of her caucus are going
to be unhappy.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.020
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside Elections: Right.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.020
Right.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020
I agree, John.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.090
I think, basically, what she is saying is,
do Democrats want to feel good or do they

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.799
want to win?

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.030
Many of the younger Democrats, insurgents,
anti-establishment Democrats, just can't resist

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.090
themselves.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.919
They really want to take on the president
immediately, and impeachment is the way, the

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:37.919
most immediate way.

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.240
They just don't have any patience.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.130
I think the speaker has history on her side,
and I think she's right

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.840
SUSAN PAGE: But it's not -- it's only a matter
of being impatient.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.090
If you believe the president had done something
impeachable, you may feel that, even if we're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.499
not going to succeed, we have an obligation
to impeach him.

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.389
And you could also make the point that, with
Richard Nixon's impeachment, you didn't start

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.570
out with a lot of Republicans in favor of
that.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.380
It was as evidence built over time through
the impeachment hearings that there was Republican

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.380
and bipartisan support.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.110
STU ROTHENBERG: Yes, but, Susan, you know
the Republicans in the Senate are not going

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.289
to go along with the conviction.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.079
So, impeachment would make Democrats feel
good, but I don't think it would accomplish

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.079
anything.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.269
JOHN YANG: Susan, this morning, The Washington
Post had a look inside the Trump reelection

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.269
campaign.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.810
And it sounds like a lot of what he was doing
in 2016, big rallies, a lot of data mining,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.489
and demonizing the opposition.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.680
We heard in that tape piece what the Democrats
are talking about, Medicare for all, free

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.900
college tuition.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.849
Are they in a way helping -- by talking this
debate about are you a socialist, are you

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.370
a capitalist, are they playing into that in
any way?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.111
SUSAN PAGE: The Democrats are going to have
to figure out what kind of coalition they

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.459
think will defeat Donald Trump.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.459
And they are not in agreement on that.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.120
There are some Democrats, like Stacey Abrams,
who came pretty close to winning a race she

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.739
wasn't supposed to win for governor of Georgia,
who thinks you do that by persuading and energizing

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.989
your core supporters, you get young people
and minorities excited about your candidacy

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.730
and your bold proposals and you get them to
the polls.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.530
But there are other Democrats who say, the
way we made big inroads in the midterms last

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.140
November was by swinging districts that are
purple, where you have to appeal to some voters

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.319
who are independent-minded or even vote Republican
sometimes.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.140
I think this is one of the things this long
primary season is going to sort out.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.030
What kind of Democrat can make the best case
that they can defeat Donald Trump?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.209
Because if you -- I'll tell you one thing
Democrats are not divided on, and that is

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.190
their fervent desire to deny Donald Trump
a second term.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.069
STU ROTHENBERG: I think that's a choice Democrats
don't have to make.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.580
I think they need swing voters and they need
to turn out core voters, younger voters, 18

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.180
to 29, significant constituency that's entering
the electorate now that is really strongly

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.069
Democratic.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.200
Non-whites, they need to get more of those
voters, but they still need to hold onto suburban

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.939
voters, those swing voters and college -- college
-- white women with a college degree.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.209
So I think they -- I don't think they have
to choose one path or the other.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.209
They need to do both.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.590
JOHN YANG: This is a time when the Democrats,
a lot of the Democratic candidates are introducing

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.510
themselves to the country.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.739
One of them, Kirsten Gillibrand, has had a
little -- or has hit a little bit of a bump.

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.430
She's -- one of her big issues has been dealing
with sexual assault and sexual harassment

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.959
in the military.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.829
And now it turns out, it's being reported
by Politico, that a young woman on her staff,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.370
unhappy with how her complaints about sexual
harassment and intimidation were handled,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.570
quit.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.770
What do you make of this, Susan?

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.300
SUSAN PAGE: We have had other Democratic candidates
have problems along the same lines.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.810
Bernie Sanders has as well about his handling
during his first presidential campaign about

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.050
complaints of sexual harassment.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.319
But I think this hurts Kirsten Gillibrand
more.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.530
And that's because it's been her signature
issue.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.639
And for her to have responded inadequately
to complaints of sexual harassment by a staffer,

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.290
and moving to fire the staffer who was accused
only when it was about to become public, I

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.789
think, makes her look hypocritical.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.060
So I think it's an issue she's going to have
to address in a really forthright way if she's

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.060
going to get over it.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.580
STU ROTHENBERG: I agree completely, but I
would add this.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.630
You only have one chance to make a first impression.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.919
And we know the senator.

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.280
You know the senator.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.310
But most voters don't know the senator.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.640
And this could be a stumble that she could
recover from easily.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.110
Elizabeth Warren, I think, has recovered from
her Native American stumble, at least partially.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.210
Or else this could sink Gillibrand';s campaign.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.289
We will see.

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.610
JOHN YANG: We have also seen some new polling
out of Iowa.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.879
We're talking about the Democrats have to
decide what they want.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.419
It's interesting that the top two candidates
are Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who are

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.810
-- and they're the second choice for each
first choice.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.290
You can't think of some -- two candidates
who are more different in a lot of ways on

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.290
policy issues.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.890
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, but I would just say we're
almost a year away from the Iowa caucuses.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.440
And so I don't take the lineup, the horse
race questions on the Iowa poll so seriously.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.569
What struck me about that was the policy questions
and how liberal that the Democratic coalition

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:03.569
is.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.979
In Iowa, there was majority support for the
Green New Deal, which I bet most people couldn't

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.820
define, for Medicare for all, which is a really
far-reaching health care proposal.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.039
That surprised me.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.479
And that indicated that maybe Stacey Abrams'
view of things, where you want to take bold

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.139
positions, that's certainly what looks like
it's going to resonate in Iowa.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.139
STU ROTHENBERG: Yes.

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.300
I would say Democrats know two candidates,
Sanders and Biden.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.669
If you pick Sanders, then Biden is your backup
choice.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:27.960
If you pick Biden, it's Sanders.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.409
JOHN YANG: Stuart Rothenberg, Susan Page,
thanks so much.

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:30.409
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.413
STU ROTHENBERG: Thanks, John.
