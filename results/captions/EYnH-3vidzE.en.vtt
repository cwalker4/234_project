00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.040
SHANE SMITH: It turned out to
be a comparatively short

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.420
10-hour train ride from Tynda to
Dipkun, which was the next

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.280
town that had a North
Korean camp in it.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.660
When we finally got there, it
was pretty late in the day.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.970
We had to move fast.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.070
If we were going to see the
North Korean camp and get back

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.120
in time before the pitch black
Siberian night fell and

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.440
stranded us in the forest.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.450
Well, we're sort of in the
middle of nowhere.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.460
But we're going to try to
go to the camp now.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.580
The old chief of police of
Dipkun, who we met on the

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.440
train, had offered to take us
out there in his new truck but

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.920
was a bit worried about the
bridge because it had recently

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.640
been washed out.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.510
We could take this.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.242
This would be awesome.

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:53.492
Is this us?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.660
So we are in a race against
time to go see the North

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.610
Korean camp.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.680
The old chief of police
is driving us.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.670
He'd been the chief of police
for over a decade and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.000
consequently knew
the North Korean

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.360
situation there quite well.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.610
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.265
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They
get kopecks.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:18.704
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:19.598
SHANE SMITH: What's kopeck?

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:20.045
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Pennies.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.386
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.330
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They live
in smelly barracks--

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.315
like dozens of people
all together.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:30.614
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.354
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, I think
we're getting there.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.160
SHANE SMITH: The bridges is made
out of old railway ties.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.340
Our buddy, the chief of police,
he buys this truck on

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.390
credit and then fucking risks
the whole thing by driving

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.190
across this fucking thing, which
he doesn't even know who

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.360
built it or when.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.610
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Maybe we should
have taken our stuff

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.020
off in case he falls
into the river.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.630
SHANE SMITH: He's got
balls, this guy.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.065
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:06.970
SHANE SMITH: We'll have to
buy him some more vodka.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.220
Hey.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.268
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Oh my god, it's
completely been cleared.

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:21.510
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.860
SHANE SMITH: So this is our
chief of police, and he's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.700
breaking in to the North
Korean camp.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.996
I love him.

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:31.960
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.433
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:37.380
I love this guy so much.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.180
This was a whole
Korean village.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.090
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They had a
sign here that said, "Kim

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.500
Il-Sung lives with
us forever."

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.690
SHANE SMITH: Because, I guess,
that there have been some

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.390
people who came--

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.560
Simon, who's with us,
being one of them--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.970
they've knocked down the camp.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.530
And they've moved on
to the next village

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.850
down the train line.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.180
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This used to
have a slogan on it that said,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.630
"laboratory of Kim Il-Sung's
theory." So they've given it

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.900
over to an entrepreneur
to take down.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.940
And then his benefit is he gets
to sell the spare parts

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.970
and metal and stuff like that.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.490
Let's try to open the door.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.620
SHANE SMITH: This was built by
the North Koreans to resemble

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.270
North Korea.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.760
They wanted it to be like
a home away from home.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.170
And this was the laboratory
of Kim Il-Sung's theory.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.595
So we're going to
go check it out.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.410
So this is where they would
learn about Juche, the ideals

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.840
of Kim Il-Sung.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.900
The study room was a bit freaky
because it had the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.650
requisite painting of Mount
Baekdu, which I had seen a lot

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.170
when I was in North Korea, which
was where Kim Jong-Il

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.960
was supposed to have been born
under a double rainbow as a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.990
new star shot into the sky
to mark the joyous event.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.910
But in actual fact, he was
really born in a small log

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.180
cabin near Khabarovsk, where
we had started our journey,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.010
while the Soviets trained his
dad to be the Stalinist,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.750
cult-of-personality leader of
Korea after World War II.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.770
So there's a room here filled
with Juche ideals.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.830
You kind of feel like you've
stumbled on a cult house

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.850
because there's these weird
things to make candles, and

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.640
fires, and homage to the Juche
ideals and we're finding crazy

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.310
propaganda stuff because North
Korea's a cult of personality.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.755
One man runs, like a
god, the country.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.380
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It's kind of
got this eerie, Pompeii

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.730
feeling about it.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.120
SHANE SMITH: It's such a bizarre
concept that there's

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.140
little North Koreas dotted
around Siberia.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.550
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This would
have been living quarters

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.480
right here.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.770
SHANE SMITH: It's
not very nice.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.890
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Pure filth.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.140
SHANE SMITH: Very disgusting.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.270
SIMON OSTROVSKY: There's
one of the old dudes.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.800
SHANE SMITH: Oh shit.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.160
Oh that's--

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.210
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.122
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He
says it's fine.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.460
SHANE SMITH: Are they
North Koreans?

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.470
SIMON OSTROVSKY: No, but it'd
to be cool if we were, and

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.210
they saw us looting.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.780
SHANE SMITH: We're literally
getting caught in

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.140
looting right now.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.130
All smiles.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.340
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Just smile.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.250
They'll think you're crazy.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.500
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:08.160
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says, you
want to see a real Korean?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.005
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:10.100
We should get the vodka.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.560
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.950
SHANE SMITH:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.215
Hello.

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:20.260
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simon.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.910
We have to cross the bridge
while it's light.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.850
SHANE SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.308
KIM ZUNG YUN:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:05:26.308 --> 00:05:27.766
LABORER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:29.224
KIM ZUNG YUN:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:05:33.598 --> 00:05:37.490
LABORER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.920
SHANE SMITH: Well, I feel bad
for the guy because he's

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.780
obviously terrified.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.950
So we'll blur his face.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.570
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah,
definitely.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.080
Maybe we should let him know
that we'll do that.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.580
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.600
When we told him not to worry
and that we would blur his

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.160
face, the North Korean worker
relaxed a little and seemed

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.510
much happier.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.470
He also told us that the main
part of the workers group had

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.350
moved even further
up the line.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.852
So we got into another train,
and we kept going.

00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:18.310
Should we get arrested?

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.560
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.
