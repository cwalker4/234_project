AND THE GUY HAD HIS SOCKS AND
SHOES OFF, AND HIS FEET UP ON

HIS LUGGAGE, AND EVERYBODY HAD
TO LOOK AT HIS OLD

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.527
50-SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD FEET.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:10.396

HERE THE ENTIRE TIME SINCE THEN?

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:23.376

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.251 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I MOVED HERE IN
'95, TOO.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.052
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
THEN.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:33.286 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.688

&gt;&gt; NO, IT WASN'T.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.324
IT WAS A SCARY PLACE TO BE.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:43.096
AND CROWDS WERE NOT
IMPRESSPURPOSE THERE WERE DRUG

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:46.399 align:start size:88% position:13%
ADDICTS, PEOPLE NODDING OFF,

EVERYTHING.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.968
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE TO
DO STAND-UP.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:52.305
AND NOW 20 YEARS LATER I CAME
BACK AND I WAS DOING STAND-UP

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:55.108
LOCALLY, AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE
GROANING IN THE CROWD AT JOKE S.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.075
