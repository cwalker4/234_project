00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.030
May I just say I'm not
one to name drop but,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.610
Ellen's birthday party was the--

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.730
I can't remember in my
life having that much fun.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.529
And the truth is--

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:11.070
In your life?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.820
In my life.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.450
Wow.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.977
In my life.

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:13.810
It was a good party.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.800
It was a good party.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.720
And the truth is
people who know me know

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.970
that I like to sit at home.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.570
A big night for me is putting
some pine cones on the fire,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.780
watching them crackle.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.670
Having a having a nice book to
read, you know, with the dogs

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.360
curled up.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.330
So usually when I say to
friends I'm going to a party.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.810
So I said, you
know, to my friend.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.350
I'm going to a
party, Ava DuVernay,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.550
I said, I'm going
to Ellen's party.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.890
She goes, Oh, I hope it's OK.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.860
I go, yeah, I'm
sure it'll be fine.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.180
And then the next day she
says, how was that party?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.010
I go, the most fun I ever had!

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.630
She said, what?

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.450
You had fun at a party?

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.590
I go, I don't even know
what happened to me.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.160
Yeah.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.680
I don't know what
happened to me.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.260
And I've actually been
trying to figure out

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.210
what made it so great.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.280
Was it the location?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.440
Was it the fact that we were
in this sort of velvet Womb

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.280
Yeah, the bar.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.970
Was it that?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.250
Portia made a great--
she designed it.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.370
No, my birthday party
last year was at our house

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.400
and there was only 100
people and that was insane.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.980
And Bruno Mars ended up
taking over the DJ booth.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.900
And was like you know,
DJ'd until like 2:00

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.070
in the morning by himself.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.736
I don't think I was
invited to that one.

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:22.550
You were invited.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.890
I Was

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.160
Yeah.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.910
You were invited.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.940
Of course you're always.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.090
Anyway but this party.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.590
OK.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.760
Oh, yeah, we were
shooting "Wrinkle."

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.550
That's right.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.790
Yeah, you were you
were not in town.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.580
Yes but this--

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.570
I will never miss another one.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.080
Good.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.580
Good.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:40.420
There were a lot
of people there.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.690
Just coming here,
I was thinking,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.270
gosh, I hope Ellen says
you know I'm having

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.260
a few people over tonight.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.634
You want to come
over afterwards?

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:47.530
No, what was it that
made it so great?

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.909
It was a great energy.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.200
It was a great group of people.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.460
It was a great mix of people.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.970
Yeah.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.180
Did you stay for all
the performances?

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.370
I stayed for everything.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.369
What time did you leave?

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.631
I left like around midnight.

00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:57.130
OK.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.800
I know I saw Reese was gathering
all the people to sing.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.837
And it was a combination
of different people.

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:02.920
That's what makes a great.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.510
But I had one of these
moments, I'm embarrassed.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.860
I said to Matt backstage.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.180
I was embarrassed to even say.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.949
So I don't get out much.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.789
I really don't.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.170
You know I'm a homebody.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.439
So there were so many
famous people at this party.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.480
So when I was doing my
show famous people came on

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.860
and they looked like themselves.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.360
Right.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.440
At your party,
they're all disguised.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.820
They are looking like
they normally do.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.440
So this guy passes by and he's
like, I can see that he really,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.110
he said, hey.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.860
How are you doing?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.640
Hey, how are you doing?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.400
You know it's like,
hey how are you doing?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.160
And then he comes back.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.480
He's like, really,
what's going on?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.310
I go, what's going
on with You OK.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.550
So I'm standing there and
talking to The Weeknd.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.930
I didn't know who he was
before because he cut his hair.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.100
And Gail goes, oh, you're
talking to The Weeknd.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.230
Oh, that's The Weeknd?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.947
He cut his hair.

00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:51.280
And he's wearing a baseball cap.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.192
So this guy comes back
honest it's a true story.

00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:55.900
And so I'm thinking
I know it's somebody.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.840
I know it's somebody.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.340
Who is it?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.760
I know it's somebody.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.799
Is it Justin Timberlake?

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.340
I don't think it's
Justin Timberlake.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.560
So The Weeknd says
to him, hey man,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.240
I really love that film you did.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.322
And he says, no that
wasn't a good film for me.

00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:08.530
That wasn't my favorite film.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.740
So I go, so what was
your favorite film?

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.460
Smart.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.543
So what was your favorite?

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:19.762
He says, The Aviator, and I
go, Leonardo, you're so funny.

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:22.042
Good way to find out.

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:23.750
Leonardo, you funny guy.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.610
I knew that was you.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.660
But this is what was so great.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.280
It was such, what
I thought about it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.640
is, such a great mixture of
different kinds of people.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.852
It's not like when you go
to a Grammy party or film.

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:34.060
All the same kinds of people.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.560
It was a mixture
of different kinds.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.880
It was most fun I ever had.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.390
Yeah.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.070
It was a great-- did you dance?

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.450
I danced.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.610
I drank.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.960
I talked to people.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.142
I had the most fun.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.850
I was trying to
replenish what you were--

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.349
I thought you were
drinking tequila.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.170
And you said no let
me finish this vodka.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.524
I said, you're going to
switch from vodka to tequila?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.190
Can you do that?

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.970
And you said, we'll see.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.470
Yes.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.294
I said, I'm using I'm
using vodka as my baseline.

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:01.210
Starting out that way.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.150
There's just the one
shot, that special vodka,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.700
that special tequila
that you had.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.200
Yeah.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.640
I had it back for you only.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.050
They said Ellen has a
special tequila for you.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.140
I go, I know what you mean.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.730
So I wish you all
could have come.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.930
It was just the most fun.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.740
Next year.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.470
Next year.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.410
So you know-- I don't
know a lot of celebrities.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.040
You are like the
celebrity that I know.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.700
And Reese.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.820
That's not true.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.120
I don't know, like, people
that I'm texting regularly.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.934
But now I met so many in your
party and I'm texting them.

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:35.100
And now you're texting them?

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.500
Yes, I got a lot of numbers.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.225
Oh, good.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:43.080
I'm so glad I got to hook
you up with celebrities.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.130
I now have celebrity
friends because of you.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.110
Oh, I'm so glad.
