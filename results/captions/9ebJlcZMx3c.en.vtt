00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:16.375
What if I told you
that in a month from now,

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.508
you will be able to memorize

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:23.625
a pack of cards
by just looking at it once?

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:30.043
And that you will be able
to do that in under 5 minutes,

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:31.787
with a little bit of training.

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:37.331
What if I told you that
that is all the knowledge you need

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:42.099
to fundamentally understand
how your memory and your brain works?

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.909
That knowledge will then
help you in your everyday life,

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:48.594
when it comes to remembering
people's names,

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:54.332
commit important information to memory
and then do it as a presentation at work,

00:00:54.828 --> 00:01:01.162
or if you're a school child and you
want to score perfectly on your exam.

00:01:02.502 --> 00:01:07.236
What if I told you that this knowledge,
if implemented in schools,

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:09.623
would change the way
we see the school system,

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:13.355
not only in Sweden but in the whole world?

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:19.168
My name is Idriz Zogaj.

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.916
I'm a memory athlete.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:25.168
I am not some kind of a superstar;
this is my alter ego.

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:31.703
Before the age of 25, I didn't know
anything of what I know today.

00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:33.950
The interesting thing
about the age of 25 is

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:37.388
that at the age of 25
the brain becomes fully mature.

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:40.691
That is, you are a grown-up.

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:43.864
Before that I knew nothing.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.505
I also finished
-- well, I knew a lot of things, but --

00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:49.381
I also finished my university studies,

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:51.191
and I was thinking, what happens now?

00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:53.400
What am I going to do with my life?

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.361
I've always been
very interested in traveling

00:01:57.362 --> 00:02:00.658
and getting to know
other people, culture, etc.,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.729
and that requires communication.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.823
So, I was thinking,
okay, I like the challenge,

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:09.395
and I like to communicate with people,

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:11.025
so, I'm going to learn a language.

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:12.240
A new language.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.682
Something completely different
from what I know now.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.351
I know the Latin alphabet,

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:20.798
but I want to learn something
that I don't understand when I look at it,

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.247
like Arabic, Chinese or Japanese.

00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:26.066
Even Hindi crossed my mind.

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:31.432
So, while I was looking at courses
that I could take at home,

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:33.769
because I was tired
of the university life,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.175
I accidentally came across
a book on memory.

00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:41.683
I was thinking that I wanted
to learn this new language

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:44.005
the way children do it, by practicing.

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:48.570
Going somewhere and talking to people,
and in that sense learning the language.

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.802
I sort of don't like grammar,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.840
so this was my way of cheating away
the grammar studies.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.725
I thought, if I am
going to do it that way,

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:01.329
I will become prepared.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.010
So, I want to put a lot of words
and phrases into memory,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.995
and then go to that country,
or that part of the world.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.448
This book of memory was excellent.

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.420
Why not start to read it,
and then see what happens.

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.338
So, I ordered the book and started to read

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:21.342
and then realized it is apparently
all about techniques,

00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:23.121
thinking in the right way.

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:25.268
It wasn't that difficult.

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:29.087
I was very picky with the language
I wanted to learn.

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.959
I was like, reading the book,
doing some exercises.

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:37.917
Several years went by
and I didn't find any language to select.

00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:40.130
But in the meantime,

00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:44.927
I was doing these exercises
and gradually getting better.

00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:47.213
Another interesting thing about this book

00:03:47.214 --> 00:03:50.745
was that at the last chapter,
this person talked about

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:54.401
that you can compete in memory.

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.381
I was thinking,

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:59.273
what, they have competitions in memory?!

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:02.867
This guy, Dominic O'Brien, had won
the World Memory Championship six times,

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.813
so he knew what he was talking about.

00:04:04.814 --> 00:04:07.313
I was still, like, competing in memory!

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:10.524
I was looking at the levels
he suggested that you complete.

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:12.515
Then I realized, hold on!

00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:17.115
During this training, I've actually
reached many of these levels.

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:18.634
So, I thought, OK,

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:20.360
I will focus a little bit more,

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:23.221
and that's when I started
to train the pack of cards,

00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:26.091
and one of the levels was
to do it under five minutes.

00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:29.946
In 2004, I felt ready.

00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:34.245
At the age of 27, I went to

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:38.627
the World Memory Championships
in Manchester.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:43.022
Why not think big, just go
to the World Memory Championships.

00:04:43.023 --> 00:04:45.229
I came 22nd in the world.

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:48.888
I also became Sweden's best memory,

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.164
a title I would hold
for five consecutive years.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:05:00.126
So, when I came back, my friends
were looking at me differently.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:04.426
They were like, "When did you
become such a brain man?"

00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:06.826
"What do you mean?"

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:12.219
"Well, come on, you just went to the
World Memory Championships and competed".

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.567
"Yes."

00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:15.361
"So..."

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:18.743
"Yes, but I just read
these techniques and adapted them."

00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:20.229
"You did?"

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.785
"And I don't feel different,
I mean, I'm the same."

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:27.741
"Really, but what do you do
at the World Memory Championships?"

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.419
"Well, we compete in memory."

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.636
"Such as.."

00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:35.451
Well, every competition is 10 disciplines.

00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:37.179
It can be numbers.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.709
It can be binary digits:
one zero one one zero zero one one.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.134
Very funny.

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:47.993
It can also be words.

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:51.967
It can be names and faces, people's names.

00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:54.810
It can be historic dates.

00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:58.629
Do you know that the world record
for memorizing historic dates

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.805
is about the same or even more

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:04.900
than all the dates you learned
throughout the school system,

00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:06.750
including high school?

00:06:06.751 --> 00:06:08.959
This guy does it in five minutes.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.261
Imagine that, 12 years
compressed into five minutes.

00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:17.150
I think it's easy if I show you.

00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.766
They would take
a pack of cards, shuffle it.

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.017
Not the one that we had before;
it's shuffled.

00:06:23.018 --> 00:06:24.293
They would give it to me,

00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:26.538
and then while we're chatting
I would start,

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.021
and then after a while they ask me,
"Idriz, when are you going to start?"

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.928
Well, actually I'm already done.

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:34.215
"What do you mean?"

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:37.360
Take the cards, the pack,
and split it anyway you want.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:39.652
This is Diamonds of 9.

00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:42.257
What comes after Diamonds of 9?

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:43.164
What do you mean?

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:46.649
What is the card that comes
after Diamonds of 9?

00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:50.901
Clubs of 2, right?

00:06:50.902 --> 00:06:54.912
And what comes
after Clubs of 2? Hearts of 10.

00:06:54.913 --> 00:06:57.657
And what comes after Hearts of 10?

00:06:57.658 --> 00:06:58.874
Two Fives.

00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:00.437
That's good.

00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:05.079
One is Diamonds and one is Hearts.
I would say that one is Hearts.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.395
"So, how do you do this?"

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.734
Well, it's just about adapting techniques,

00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:16.472
and actually I think it's easy
if I show you with an exercise.

00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:19.769
Look at these two images.

00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:23.607
Do you see a connection between them?

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:26.540
I'll give you a hint,
there is no connection.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.614
It's just two randomly picked pictures.

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:32.780
But here's what I want you to do.

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:37.696
I want you to make a fun,
vivid and animated story.

00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:39.423
Use all your senses,

00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:43.226
see how it looks like, feels like,
to connect these two images together.

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:45.749
And do it in 3D,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.940
even though you don't have 3D-goggles.

00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:50.988
Your brain is amazing,
it can do it anyway.

00:07:50.989 --> 00:07:53.362
It's projected in 3D.

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:55.696
I'll give you a few seconds to do this.

00:08:00.226 --> 00:08:01.765
Here's how I would see it.

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:04.216
Let's see at the order
of where you're sitting.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:07.221
You look next to you and see a big snail.

00:08:07.222 --> 00:08:10.283
It has a door on it. You open the door
because it says welcome.

00:08:10.284 --> 00:08:13.106
I mean, you've never been
inside a snail cell.

00:08:13.107 --> 00:08:17.559
You go in and say:
"Oh it's slimy in here, why they do that?"

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.495
Look at these two images.
OK, give you the same, make a story.

00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:29.153
Let's take the stairs where I came up.

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:32.852
You see a flamingo
building a big brick wall.

00:08:32.852 --> 00:08:37.089
We have to climb over it.
It's no point but --

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:42.044
And these three, what do you think?

00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:45.999
We all know why elephants
-- because it is a big elephant --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.353
you all know why they are strong:
they carry a lot of weight.

00:08:50.413 --> 00:08:53.912
You see a big giraffe up on the screen
and the skier is like,

00:08:53.913 --> 00:08:58.073
I'm going to go skiing
down the giraffe neck.

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:03.187
Look up on the roof.
The last one is a bit obvious, right?

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:06.698
Because you see a reptile,
and they like to be in the sun.

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:09.810
It's quite common, so you might think
that this is an obvious one.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.817
This one I will remember.

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:16.213
That's a dangerous thing,
because obvious things we tend to forget.

00:09:16.214 --> 00:09:18.246
I bet I could find people in this room

00:09:18.247 --> 00:09:20.550
that don't remember
what they had for breakfast.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.280
Maybe today was different
because you were going to TED,

00:09:24.281 --> 00:09:26.330
so you had breakfast later or whatever.

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:31.139
But it's a common thing you do,
so it's easy to forget, not registered.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.431
So, see the snake with big glasses,

00:09:34.432 --> 00:09:39.443
a nice drink and enjoying
the sun on the roof.

00:09:40.343 --> 00:09:42.442
And the drink is not spilling.

00:09:43.592 --> 00:09:45.744
So, what did we just do?

00:09:47.534 --> 00:09:50.625
Well, we let our brain have fun,

00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:53.939
and when we did that
we focused on the task.

00:09:56.439 --> 00:10:01.877
When we focus on the task,
we tell our brain that this is important:

00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:03.737
remember this.

00:10:05.907 --> 00:10:10.409
So, first we enforce
the power of remembering.

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.260
What is the brain?

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.337
The brain is a biological lump of neurons.

00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:21.811
It contains about 3% of our body weight,

00:10:21.812 --> 00:10:25.034
but consumes 20%
of our energy intake every day.

00:10:25.784 --> 00:10:28.300
It doesn't matter
if you're sitting in the audience,

00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:30.743
standing here talking
or whatever you are doing.

00:10:30.744 --> 00:10:33.854
It's about the same level
of energy consumption all the time.

00:10:35.114 --> 00:10:37.109
So, it has a lot of neurons.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.996
They like to connect to each other.

00:10:40.886 --> 00:10:44.074
They can make tens
of thousands of connections.

00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:46.189
This is also why we are all unique.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.922
I mean, it's impossible to copy
or to make two identical brains.

00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:52.708
So, we are all unique.

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:55.414
The stronger we make the connections,

00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:58.039
the longer we will remember
the information.

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:02.718
So, we can make weak connections
and we forget them,

00:11:02.719 --> 00:11:04.555
because that's a natural thing.

00:11:05.134 --> 00:11:08.134
We always forget, that's a natural thing.

00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:10.682
If you have a normal functioning brain,

00:11:10.802 --> 00:11:13.152
it sorts out information
that is not important.

00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:17.249
But you can tell it
what is important and what is not.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.310
The stronger the connections you make,
the longer you will remember it.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.070
With this knowledge, I would say
that today students study too much.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.603
The reason why they do,

00:11:36.604 --> 00:11:39.109
I could say that it's
because many students today,

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.192
don't know how to put
the information into their brain.

00:11:42.812 --> 00:11:45.708
They study and study and study
and it becomes late.

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:48.579
They go to bed late and wake up tired.

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:51.916
Instead of putting
the information in their brain

00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:54.090
in the way the brain likes to have it.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.565
Then they can rest,
commit time to the hobbies,

00:11:58.566 --> 00:12:00.170
spend time with their family,

00:12:00.171 --> 00:12:03.509
and then do a repetition
of the information they learnt.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:06.694
But if you don't know
that the information is there,

00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:09.094
you don't trust your brain.

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:12.442
If you don't trust your brain,
you study all the time.

00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:20.639
I will prove this to you

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.197
that your brain actually is better
than you might think yourself.

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:28.084
The exercise we did before,
I do with five-year-olds.

00:12:29.378 --> 00:12:33.399
But then we use 30 pairs.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.378
So, don't feel any pressure.

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:41.193
Look at this image!
There's something missing, right?

00:12:42.383 --> 00:12:46.965
I bet your brain fills in the gaps.

00:12:49.275 --> 00:12:51.991
So, if I say weight, you say?

00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:53.712
(Audience) Elephant.

00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:55.926
Thank you. And if I say bricks, you say?

00:12:55.927 --> 00:12:57.953
(Audience) Flamingo.

00:12:57.954 --> 00:13:00.012
And if I say the obvious one?

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:01.931
(Audience) Sun.

00:13:01.932 --> 00:13:03.645
Thank you.

00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:05.338
If I say door, you say?

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:06.330
(Audience) Snail.

00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:08.364
And if I say ski?

00:13:08.365 --> 00:13:09.547
(Audience) Giraffe.

00:13:09.548 --> 00:13:13.862
And if I told you to give them to me
in the right order, as they came up,

00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:15.073
what will you do?

00:13:15.074 --> 00:13:17.812
You will close your eyes,
go to the first place,

00:13:17.813 --> 00:13:20.023
go to the second place,
go to the third place,

00:13:20.024 --> 00:13:22.199
the fourth place and the roof is last one.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.220
Give them to me backwards.
You just go backwards.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:28.397
This is what we do
at memory competitions.

00:13:31.197 --> 00:13:34.371
Now you memorized 10 words.

00:13:34.372 --> 00:13:37.359
That's one of the events,
to memorize words.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.031
You can go to the competition and perform.

00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:45.642
The only thing we do
is that we do it faster and longer.

00:13:47.502 --> 00:13:49.984
It's very interesting to note

00:13:49.985 --> 00:13:54.319
that the world record
for memorizing a pack of cards

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.953
by just looking at them once
as fast as possible,

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:02.710
is about the same time it takes
Usain Bolt to run 200 meters.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.500
Think of that the next time
you watch the Olympics.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.027
When he starts, you start,
and see how many cards you remember.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.718
Now, I don't know Usain Bolt,

00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:20.418
but I know the world record holder
for the cards, Simon Reinhard.

00:14:20.446 --> 00:14:23.198
I know how much he trains.

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:27.466
I know he doesn't do anything different
from what we just did before.

00:14:28.916 --> 00:14:30.535
He just structures the knowledge

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:33.083
that he puts them into his brain.

00:14:33.084 --> 00:14:34.928
He looks at the information once,

00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:37.790
and he knows it's fixed there.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:51.107
It's all about having fun and letting
the brain make strong connections.

00:14:51.108 --> 00:14:53.878
Then there's no limits.

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:55.891
I have a friend who comes and helps me

00:14:55.892 --> 00:14:59.317
to organize the Swedish
Memory Championships every year.

00:15:00.077 --> 00:15:04.623
If we would have a scale
here over the mat.

00:15:04.624 --> 00:15:09.750
Here is a person
who has difficulty with memory.

00:15:09.751 --> 00:15:12.710
Here is the normal memory,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.809
here's where most people would be.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.530
And here is where the geniuses are,
the super memories.

00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:22.966
So, when she came first in 2009,

00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:27.758
I contacted the [inaudible]

00:15:28.248 --> 00:15:31.755
and told them, why don't we run
some tests, some memory tests on this,

00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:36.194
because I like to work with a scientist
to show them what we could do.

00:15:36.195 --> 00:15:39.419
Because there's not so much research
going on in this area.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.001
The guy who did the research on her,

00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:47.124
which is actually that guy,
Jacob Stohlman,

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:51.459
he said like, "Idrez, we have to redo
the scale because she's over there.

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:54.355
She's outside of our scale."

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:56.836
What she did is like way outside.

00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:00.897
How can you do this?

00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:05.158
But you haven't studied what we do,

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:07.980
because it's like we would
invent a sport today,

00:16:07.981 --> 00:16:10.103
and all of a sudden people are running,

00:16:10.104 --> 00:16:12.556
"Oh, they're moving so fast."

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:15.367
But we're not doing anything else.

00:16:15.368 --> 00:16:18.244
We're just working with the brain,

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:20.431
how the brain likes to work.

00:16:20.432 --> 00:16:22.681
The techniques are very old.

00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:26.497
The oldest one comes from the Greeks.

00:16:26.498 --> 00:16:30.953
The ancient Greeks,
several thousand years ago.

00:16:32.023 --> 00:16:33.495
So, we didn't invent anything,

00:16:33.496 --> 00:16:37.133
we just packed it into this,
and it's the training that has done it.

00:16:38.073 --> 00:16:41.731
And you can start your training
right here, right now.

00:16:41.732 --> 00:16:44.317
The next time you hear
something you want to remember,

00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:45.777
make a fun story of it,

00:16:45.778 --> 00:16:48.732
and you will make strong connections.

00:16:48.733 --> 00:16:50.898
So, happy practicing.

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:51.904
Thank you.

00:16:52.494 --> 00:16:56.168
(Applause).
