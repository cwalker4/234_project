00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
Unless you literally live under a rock, you’ve
likely heard that elephants have the best

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.509
memories in the animal kingdom,they never
forget!

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.929
Not only that, but give ’em a memory puzzle,
and they’ll knock it out of the park.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.349
Is there any truth to that, though?

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.510
Surely there’s an elephant out there who’s
skipped a meal, or wandered away from the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.870
herd and never found his way back.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.680
One elephant-lover might’ve found the answer
to that question when he visited his former

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.280
pet.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.120
They say an elephant never forgets, but that’s
hard to believe.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.420
Even humans, as advanced as we are, forget
simple things.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.219
For a giant animal that’s known to be afraid
of mice to never forget, well, it just sounds

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.749
a bit far-fetched.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.210
But maybe it isn’t.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.969
Take Sunita the elephant, for instance.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.329
Unlike most elephants, she didn’t spend
a lifetime grazing on the plains of Africa

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.620
or India.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.489
Instead, she spent most of her youth in the
hands of elephant-fanatic Charlie Frank, and

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.379
his wife, Madeline.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.400
Charlie adopted Sunita in 1955 when she was
just five years old.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.910
He loved elephants, and along with his wife,
he wanted to share the immensely-talented

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.000
and well-trained Sunita, or “Nita,” as
he called her with the world.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.540
With Sunita at their side, Charlie and Madeline
marched in parades, performed in circuses,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.190
and even hit up Hollywood!

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.980
Sunita’s lifestyle taxed her brain as she
learned stage directions and circus routines.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.640
But despite sharing the big screen with celebrities
like Lucille Ball, it wouldn’t be until

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.400
decades later long after her performance career
ended, that Sunita’s memory was truly tested.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.550
In 1971, Charlie finally feeling the wear
and tear of old age retired from show business.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.970
Unfortunately, it wasn’t exactly easy for
him to bring Sunita back with him and his

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.680
wife to their home, in the suburbs.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.970
Faced with a dilemma as to what to do with
his long-time friend and companion, Charlie

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.980
considered selling Sunita.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.930
But he just couldn’t bear it, he couldn’t
risk someone treating her poorly.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.409
Instead, Charlie and Madeline donated Sunita
to the Wild Animal Park in San Diego.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:14.359
The elephant would be afforded the opportunity
to roam with other elephants on open plains.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.819
For 15 years, that’s where Sunita lived,
and for 15 years, Charlie and Madeline never

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.060
saw their elephant companion.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.790
After Madeline passed away, and with his own
health declining, Charlie knew he needed to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.400
see his old pachyderm pal again.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.060
After so much time, would she remember him?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.170
Would she be able to recognize him even though
he was far more gray?

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.159
Or would her memory be lost, in the blur of
a long complex past?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.069
Charlie simply had to find out once and for
all.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.140
Accompanied by cameras, Charlie approached
the enclosed area Sunita had spent the past

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.510
15 years.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.680
He spotted her immediately from about 100
yards away.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.790
He cupped his hands over his mouth and called
to her.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.790
“Nita!

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.790
Nita!

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.260
What’re you doing out there?”

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.590
Charlie playfully said to the elephant.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.590
Cmon!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.590
Cmon!

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.590
Hurry up!

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.879
Something’s liable to get you out there.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.879
You better come running.”

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.889
Sunita didn’t look like she would budge.

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.299
But then, she moved.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.499
“You better get over here,” Charlie said.

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.609
You could just hear the excitement and love
in his voice as he extended a hand, holding

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.129
out a little something to coax Sunita into
moving faster.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.760
Charlie waved his hand, which was filled with
Sunita’s favorite treat jelly beans, and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.349
the elephant rushed toward her old trainer.

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.650
She opened up her mouth and let Charlie feed
her the sweet snack, just like the good old

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.650
days!

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.430
If there was any chance Sunita had forgotten
her old friend, it vanished as the two seemingly

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.459
picked up where they’d left off 15 years
ago.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.260
Still, Charlie wasn’t the only thing Sunita
remembered.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.489
After talking with the elephant and feeding
her more jelly beans, Charlie led Sunita out

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.069
of the elephant enclosure towards something
they were both familiar with the circus ring.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.870
There in that ring, under the warm San Diego
sunshine, an aging Charlie led Sunita through

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.549
the routine they’d developed decades ago.

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.469
Both had some rust to shake off, but for the
most part, they nailed the routine!

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.980
At nearly 60 years old, Sunita couldn’t
exactly move with the swiftness she had in

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.850
her youth; she even had to eat her jelly beans
lying down.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.410
Still, she remembered all of her old tricks.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.500
“As a rule, they’re a friend for life
if you take care of them,” Charlie said

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.949
about elephants.

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.900
He was confident the elephant truly remembered
him.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.940
“She wouldn’t work for somebody that she
didn’t know”.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.560
In the end, Sunita the elephant was able to
remember the man who changed her life.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.990
What a lovely reunion between this elephant
and her owner!

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.319
It’s great to see all the fame didn’t
go to her head.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.020
She still remembered her old routine!
