00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.302
&gt;&gt; Sean: THERE WAS A TIME WHEN

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:16.270
AMERICAN COLLEGES WERE HIVES OF

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.371
FREE SPEECH AND INDEPENDENT

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:18.272
THOUGHT, THAT WAS A LONG TIME

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:20.107
AGO.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.707
NOW THEY ARE FAMOUS FOR

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.308
TOLERATING NO DISSENT

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.877
WHATSOEVER.

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.479
SPEAK OUT AS A STUDENT, YOU CAN

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.546
BE SUSPENDED OR FLUNKED, MORE

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:27.648
INSIDIOUSLY, SPEAK OUT AS A

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.081
PRESIDENT, YOU WILL FRIGHTENED

00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.083
OR FIRED.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.718
OR TRY TO BRING NEW IDEAS TO

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.454
CAMPUS, YOU'LL PROVOKE A RIOT.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:42.029
WE SAW THAT THE UC BERKELEY,

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:44.131
WHERE MILO YIANNOPOULOS VISITED.

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.531
[PROTESTER NOISES]

00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:44.531
&gt;&gt; Sean:

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.704
&gt;&gt; Tucker: MOST CAMPUSES ARE

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:54.675
PRETTY PRETTY BAD.

00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:55.409
BUT WHICH ONES ARE THE WORST?

00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:59.846
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

00:00:55.542 --> 00:01:00.347
WHAT ARE THE WORST SCHOOLS FOR

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.281
HIS FREE-SPEECH?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.883
&gt;&gt; IT'S A WIDE FIELD.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.351
WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT SCHOOLS ARE

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:06.119
IN THEIR PLACE ON THE LIST, I

00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:07.287
CAN THINK, HOW CAN I GET ANY

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:09.489
CRAZIER?

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:11.491
I END UP KICKING MYSELF.

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:13.327
LET'S START WITH UC BERKELEY,

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:16.663
THE COLLEGE THAT REALLY KICKED

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.066
IT OFF AT THE END OF LAST YEAR,

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:21.068
WHERE A PRESENTATION BY MILO

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:21.802
YIANNOPOULOS WAS CANCELED AFTER

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:25.272
PROTESTERS TOOK THE STREETS AND

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:26.473
OVERWHELMED THE POLICE.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.475
COMMITTED PROPERTY DAMAGE,

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:30.477
VIOLENCE, AND ENDED UP JUST

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:30.811
CAUSING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.312
MAYHEM.

00:01:30.944 --> 00:01:35.949
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YEAH, THEY DID.

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:37.484
&gt;&gt; UC BERKELEY HAS KIND OF BEEN

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.453
ON THE MEND SINCE THEN.

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:41.288
THEY PAID AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:42.889
MONEY FOR VARIOUS FREE-SPEECH

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.057
EVENTS, ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:46.293
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY FIRST

00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.893
TRIED TO STIFLE AND CENSOR THAT

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:50.597
SPEECH.

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:51.665
THEY PAID ABOUT $800,000 FOR BEN

00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:53.734
SCHAPIRO, I BELIEVE.

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.568
THEY CURRENTLY ARE FACING A

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:57.537
LAWSUIT REGARDING A SPEECH THAT

00:01:54.701 --> 00:02:00.374
WAS PLANNED BY ANN COULTER,

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:02.409
WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:03.910
RECENTLY FILED A STATEMENT OF

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:06.279
INTEREST.

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:07.547
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WE FOLLOW THAT

00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:09.282
PRETTY CAREFULLY, HARVARD ON THE

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.683
LIST, DREXEL ON THE LIST.

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:16.189
WHY DREXEL?

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:18.225
&gt;&gt; DREXEL PROFESSOR TWEETED, IN

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.693
HIS WORDS, SATIRICAL AND JOKING

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.361
TWEET REGARDING WHITE GENOCIDE.

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:23.063
ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.197
WHITE GENOCIDE, POKING FUN AT

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:27.267
THE IDEA THAT WHITE GENOCIDE IS

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:29.369
A THING THAT EXISTS.

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:30.504
SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLY, THE

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:35.409
INTERNET ERUPTED IN OUTRAGE WITH

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:37.444
CALLS FOR HIS FIRING, AND HE WAS

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:40.280
SUSPENDED AND INVESTIGATED BY

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:40.947
DREXEL AND HE HAD TO KEEP

00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:42.482
HIMSELF OFF CAMPUS BECAUSE

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:44.117
DREXEL SAID THAT THE ENVIRONMENT

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:45.452
WAS NOT SAFE FOR HIM.

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:46.486
EVENTUALLY SAID, I CAN'T COME

00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:50.657
BACK INTO EACH YEAR.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.258
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:52.659
&gt;&gt; Tucker: UNBELIEVABLE.

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:54.294
LET ME ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION.

00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:55.262
YOU STUDY THE STUFF FOR A

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:56.329
LIVING.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:58.098
IF YOU HAD KIDS ABOUT TO GO TO

00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:59.566
COLLEGE, WOULD YOU WANT TO SEND

00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:01.368
THEM TO ANY COLLEGE, IF SO,

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.668
WHERE WOULD YOU WANT TO SEND

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:03.770
THEM?

00:03:01.802 --> 00:03:05.372
&gt;&gt; FIRST THING I WOULD DO WOULD

00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:07.107
GO TO THE WEBSITE AND LOOK UP

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:09.276
OUR SPEECH CODE RATINGS AND SEE

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.644
WHICH SCHOOLS ARE PROTECTING

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.045
THEIR STUDENTS EXPRESSIVE

00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:13.947
RIGHTS, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE.

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.648
THEN GO LOOK AND SEE WHAT KIND

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.249
OF CONTROVERSIES HAVE HAPPENED

00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:17.184
ON CAMPUS.

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:21.388
I AM PRETTY SURE THAT I WOULD

00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:22.656
WANT MY CHILDREN TO FEEL FREE TO

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.858
ASSOCIATE WITH THE PEOPLE THEY

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:27.294
WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH AND NOT

00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.462
BE TOLD WHO THEY CAN AND CANNOT
