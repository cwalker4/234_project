00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:07.680 line:1%
I'm not even talking about ten years ago,
but about how things were five years ago:

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.280 line:1%
Things were really horrible here
five years ago.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.800 line:1%
The drought, the heat, the wind.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.320 line:1%
The withered soil was simply blown away.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:30.400 line:1%
They set up a programme
so that we could move to a different area.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.600 line:1%
The land has become fertile again.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.000 line:1%
There have been
enormous improvements.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.680 line:1%
Our fruit trees were shrivelled up,
but now they're growing again.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.840 line:1%
There's even
a larger number of species.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.800 line:1%
Those are really positive results.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.160 line:1%
We now have food security.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.760 line:1%
Our children can go to school.
We have a better life.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.880 line:1%
We no longer need to ask
the government for support...

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.240 line:1%
...thanks to the changes
that were implemented.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.880 line:1%
Wild animals that had disappeared
have returned.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.480 line:1%
Even the leopard.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.960 line:1%
I'm from that area.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.920 line:1%
Will he come tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, yes.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:25.320 line:1%
The people didn't understand the project.
They didn't see why it was needed.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.680 line:1%
They want us to plant trees everywhere.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.000 line:1%
Even on the good land.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.280 line:1%
Even there.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.720 line:1%
Well, how about the next generation?

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.560 line:1%
You can't eat trees.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.680 line:1%
The objective was
to give the hills a 'hat' on top...

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.880 line:1%
...a 'belt' in the middle
and 'shoes' at the bottom.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.520 line:1%
The trees planted on the hilltop
form the hat.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.280 line:1%
The terraces form the belt.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.560 line:1%
And a constructed dam forms the shoes.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.400 line:1%
That way everything can grow again...

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.440 line:1%
...and the economy
and our lives will improve.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.080 line:1%
You have to trim them at the top
and then put them around the saplings.
