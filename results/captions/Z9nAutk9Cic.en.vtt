This is David Harvey and you're
listening to the Anti-Capitalist

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.160
Chronicles, a podcast that looks at
capitalism through a Marxist lens. This

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.790
podcast is made possible by Democracy at
Work. I want to talk about the topic of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.490
freedom. This was raised last week when I
was giving some talks in Peru - of all

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.080
places - and the students there were very
interested in this issue: does

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:40.560
socialism require a surrender of
individual freedom? I think the right-wing

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
has managed in many
respects, particularly in the United

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.590
States but also in other parts of the
world, of somehow other colonizing the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.440
notion of "freedom" and using the concept
of freedom as a weapon in class struggle.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:08.900
To say that socialists are actually
about "unfreedom," that the slavery of a

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.810
socialist society or communist society
is something to be avoided and evaded at

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:24.170
all costs...I think that there is an
approach to this which we should take

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.299
great care so that we do not give up the
idea of individual freedom as being part

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.290
of what an emancipatory project of
socialist world is. In fact, we may want

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.930
to put it center instead of peripheral.
And put it center because I think

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.990
there's a way in which we can talk about
individual liberty and freedom as being

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.960
part of an emancipatory project which
rests upon a collective

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.679
attempt to build the kind of society
where all of us have life chances,

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.310
life possibilities which are open to us
all. Now Marx, on this had, I think, a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.640
few interesting things to say. One of
them is that the realm of freedom begins

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.129
when the realm of necessity is left
behind. That freedom means nothing if you

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.430
have don't have enough to eat, if you are
denied access to adequate healthcare,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.180
education; and the role of socialism is
to provide those basic necessities and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.459
to fulfill those basic human needs so
that then people are free to do exactly

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:55.019
what they want. So you could in fact
argue that the end point of a socialist

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.390
transition - and even the end point of the
construction of a communist society - is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.079
a world in which individual
capacities and powers are liberated

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:14.370
entirely from one's needs and
constraints. And that therefore, rather

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.180
than saying that the right-wing has a
monopoly over the notion of individual

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.220
freedom, that we should reclaim that idea
for socialism itself. But Marx also

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.260
pointed out that the idea of freedom is
always a double-edged sword.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.959
And he has an interesting way of looking
at this, particularly when he looks at

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.530
the position of the laborer. He says the
laborer

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.919
in a capitalist society is free in the double sense. They are free in the sense

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:53.370
that they can offer their labor power to
whoever they want, they can offer it on

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.889
whatever conditions they wish and to put
forward, but at the same time they're

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.370
"unfree" because they have been freed from any control over the means of production.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.200
In other words, they have to surrender
their labor power in order to live.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:21.020
So you have a double-edge freedom, and Marx is very direct about looking at that.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.900
In the chapter on "The Working Day" (Das Kapital, chapter 10), he puts it this way. That

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.380
the capitalist is free to say to the
labourer:

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.910
"I want to employ you at the lowest wage
possible for the largest number of hours

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.860
possible, that is what I would demand of
you" and the capitalist is free to do

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.410
that in a market society because, as we
know of market society, it's about

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.810
bidding about this, and bidding about
that. On the other hand Marx kind of says

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.450
the worker is free to say: "you don't have
a right for me to work, to make me work

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.100
12 hours a day. You don't have a right to
do these things." And Marx kind of

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.260
comments that given the nature of a
market society, both the capitalist and

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.660
the worker are right in terms of what
they demanding. But of course they demand

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.750
something radically different. So, says
Marx, they are both equally right by the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.890
law of exchanges; but between equal
rights, force decides. That is, struggle

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.060
between capital and labor - not
necessarily violence, but could be

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.590
violent at a certain point. The struggle
between capital and labor is really what

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.230
is involved in the determination of how
long the worker must work for a day,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.810
what the wage will be, and what the
conditions of labor will be like. Now,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.950
this idea of freedom as a double-edged
sword is something that is, I think, very

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.550
very important to look at, and one of the
best analysts of this was an economic

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.300
historian called Karl Polanyi who wrote
a book called The Great Transformation.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.220
Polanyi was not a Marxist - and I think
he read some Marx, but he didn't

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.620
subscribe as it were to the Marxist view
of things - but Polanyi himself was very

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:19.030
open about this question of rights and
question of freedom. This is what he

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.940
has to say in The Great Transformation: he
says that "there are good forms of

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.930
freedom and bad forms of freedom."
Among the bad forms of freedom that he

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.350
listed were "the freedom to exploit one's
fellows or the freedom to make

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.150
inordinate gains without commensal
service to the community. The freedom to

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.560
keep technological inventions from being
used for public benefit, or the freedom

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.160
to profit from public calamities, or
naturally induced calamities, some of

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.800
which are secretly engineered for
private advantage. But," Polanyi continues,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.450
"the market economy under which these
freedoms throve also produced freedoms

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.460
we prize highly. Freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of meeting,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.370
freedom of association, freedom to choose one's own job. While we may

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.020
cherish these freedoms for our own
sake" - and I think many of us still do, and

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.300
that would include me - "they were to a
large extent by-products of the same

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.790
economy that was also responsible for
the evil freedoms." And Polanyi's answer

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.720
to this duality makes some very strange reading given the current hegemony of

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.480
neoliberal thinking, and the way in which
freedom is presented to us by political power.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.620
He writes about it this
way: "the passing of the market economy"

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.600
- that is getting beyond the market
economy - "can become the beginning

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.910
of an era of unprecedented freedom." Now
that's a pretty shocking statement, to

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:03.460
kind of say that the real freedom begins after we leave the market economy behind.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.220
So it continues: "juridical
and actual freedom could be made more

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:13.240
wider and more general than ever before.
Regulation and control can achieve

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.940
freedom not only for the few, but for all.
Freedom not as an appurtenant of

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.190
privilege, tainted at the source, but as a
prescriptive right extending far beyond

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.450
the narrow confines of the political
sphere into the intimate organization of

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.419
society itself. Thus will old freedoms
and civic rights be added to the fund of

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:39.130
new freedoms generated by the leisure
and security that industrial society

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.720
offers to all. Such a society can afford
to be both just and free."

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.120
Now, that idea of a society based upon justice and freedom, justice and liberty,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.300
seems to me to be of
being the political agenda of much of,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.720
say, the student movement of the
60s to the 68 generation.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:08.440
That there was a demand for both justice
and freedom. Freedom from coercion of the

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.820
state, freedom from coercion imposed by
corporate capital, but also justice.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.620
It was interesting that in the 1970s, in
effect, politics was about working

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:29.860
through that demand and in effect saying:
"we give you the freedom," said the

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:36.010
capitalist class, "but you forget the
justice." And I think giving the freedom

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.420
was also circumscribed, in the sense that
the freedom was going to be given by

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.240
freedom of the market. And that therefore,
the free market was the answer to the

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.860
question of freedom, and just forget the
justice, because justice would be a

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.770
product of demand and supply in the
market. And this was something that

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:02.800
Polanyi also recognized.
Unfortunately, he said: "The passage to the

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.910
future," that he outlined here, "is blocked
by a moral obstacle." And the moral

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:12.700
obstacle was something which he called
"liberal utopianism." I think we

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:19.030
still face that liberal utopianism.
It's an ideology which is pervasive in

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.410
the media, and it's an ideology that is
pervasive in politics, and the liberal

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:29.260
utopianism of, say, the Democratic Party
is one of the things that stands in the

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.350
way of the achievement of real freedom.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:39.220
So what Polyani did is to say that that
kind of approach to freedom is something

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:46.030
that is going to get in the way.
And I quote him: "Planning and control are

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:51.370
being attacked as a denial of freedom.
Free enterprise and private ownership

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.110
are declared to be the essentials of
freedom." And this of course was what the

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.120
main ideologists of neoliberalism put forward.
This is what Milton Friedman was about.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.600
This is what Hayek insisted. That the
freedom of the individual from state

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.030
domination can only be assured, he said,
in a society which is founded on private

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:19.480
property rights and individual liberty.
"Planning and control then are attacked

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.070
as a denial of freedom. Private ownership
is declared to be the essential of

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.840
freedom. No society built on other
foundations is said to deserve to be

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:35.170
called 'free.' The freedom that regulation
creates is denounced as 'unfreedom.' The

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:41.960
justice, liberty and welfare it offers
are decried as a camouflage of slavery."

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.280
Now to me, this is one of the key issues
of our time. That are we going to go

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.460
beyond the freedoms which are limited
freedoms of the market, and market

00:11:53.460 --> 00:12:00.020
determinations, and the laws of supply
and demand, and what Marx called "the laws of motion of capital"...

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.360
Are we going to be able to go beyond that? Or are we going

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.080
to accept, as Margaret Thatcher put it,
that "there is no alternative"?

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.840
And of course, if there is no alternative, there is no freedom. And this is the

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.070
paradox of our current situation. That in
the name of freedom

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:24.250
we've actually adopted a liberal utopian
ideology which is a barrier to the

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:30.460
achievement of real freedom. Because I do
not think it is a world of freedom when

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.750
somebody who wants to get an education
has to pay an immense amount of money

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.340
for it and has student debt
stretching way, way into their future.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.280
What we're talking about is debt peonage.
What we're talking about is debt slavery.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.340
And this is something which
needs to be avoided and needs to be

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.620
circumscribed. We should have free
education; there should be no charge for

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.340
that. The same should be true of health
care, and the same should be true of

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:05.140
basic provision of housing. And now it's
interesting that we went from a world in

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.610
the 1960s, where there was social
provision of housing.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.950
In Britain for example, a large
proportion of the housing provision in

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:21.550
the 1960s came in the public sector: it
was social housing. And when I was

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:29.380
growing up, that social housing was the
basic provision of a necessity at a

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.550
reasonably low cost. Then what happened
was Margaret Thatcher came along and

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:39.400
privatized it all, and said, basically, "you
will be much freer if you own your

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.550
property and you can be actually become
part of a property-owning democracy."

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.980
And so instead of 60% of the housing being
in the public sector we suddenly go to a

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.430
situation where only about 20 - or maybe
even less - percent of the housing is in

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.630
the public sector. And of course, one of
the things that then happens is that

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:04.090
housing becomes a commodity, and
commodity then becomes a part

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.950
of speculative activity. And to the
degree it becomes a vehicle of

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:14.890
speculation, so the price of the property
goes up. And so you get a rising cost of

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:23.620
housing with no actual increase in
indirect provision. So you take an issue

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.390
like housing and you kind of say...I've
actually lived in my lifetime through

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.670
the following sequence: when I was a kid
growing up I was brought up in what

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.630
might be called a respectable
working-class community where there was

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.860
home ownership.
Now, most people in the working-class did

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.460
not have homeownership, but there was a
segment of the working class that had

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.720
home ownership, and I happened to be
raised in a community of that kind.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:56.020
But the house was viewed as a "use-value." That is, it was a place where we

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.980
lived and we did things and, yeah, it was
family life and all those kinds of

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:05.530
things. We never really discussed "exchange value." And in fact I saw some

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.150
data recently that said that housing
values - particularly housing values for

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:16.630
working-class housing - really showed
absolutely no shift at all over

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:25.100
100 years or more up until the 1960s.
And then in the 1960s something else

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.850
began to happen. Housing started to be
viewed as an exchange value rather than

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:34.880
a use-value. People started to think of
how valuable is this: can we improve its

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.650
value? If so, how do we improve its value?
So suddenly exchange value

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:42.590
considerations came in and then along
came Margaret Thatcher and said "okay,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.030
we're going to privatize all of the
social housing so everybody can start to

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:52.730
benefit from rising exchange values."
So the question of housing as an

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.930
exchange value started to become
significant. Now, one of the consequences

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.570
of this is that those people in the
lowest elements of the population, from

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.940
the standpoint of income, found it harder
and harder and harder to find a place to live.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.540
So that instead of living in very
central locations where they had easy

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.780
access to job and employment
opportunities, they were more and more

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:22.220
expelled from the centres of cities and
from the best locations and increasingly had

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.250
to commute longer and longer distances
to their work and to their jobs.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.160
Now, by the time you get to the 1990s
however, the house has become an

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:38.090
instrument of speculative gain, that
people start to speculate on

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:43.160
housing values, and we get speculative
activity in housing markets. And the

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:49.550
result is that many of the people in the
lowest levels of the population cannot

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:55.520
find a place to live: we get the
production of homelessness. Now, when I

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.010
was young, there were some homeless
people around but very, very, very few.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:05.030
But now, if you're in London, or you're in
large cities of that kind, you find more

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:09.290
and more homeless people. In New York
City right now, the data suggests that we

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:15.170
have 60,000 homeless people. We have a
large proportion of young kids who are

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.100
actually homeless - not in the sense
that you see them on the streets, but

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.810
they sort of shift from one
relative to another, or one friend to

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.370
another, and sleep on the couch, and this
kind of thing. I mean, this is no way to

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:34.040
actually create solidarious communities.
So what do we see in cities? We see

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.290
actually a great deal of building going on.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:43.780
But it's speculative building. We're actually building cities for people to speculate in.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.820
And not cities for for people to live in.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:57.160
And if we create cities for investment purposes rather than for for living purposes we

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.190
get the kind of situation we see in New
York City, where there is a crisis of

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.960
affordable housing. The mass of the
population is badly served in terms of

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.360
its use-values of housing. It has very
little access to adequate use-values.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:19.880
At the same time we are building large, huge, sort of high-value apartments for the ultra-rich.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.060
The former mayor of New York
City had a kind of ambition that every

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.360
billionaire in the world would come and actually invest and live

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:36.620
and have a big apartment on Park
Avenue, or somewhere like that, and of

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:43.070
course that indeed is what happened. So
we find you know, Arab sheiks and

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:50.510
billionaires from India or China or Russia, but they

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.190
don't live! They just come here maybe
once or twice a year, and that's it.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:01.280
This is no foundation for decent
living arrangements. And so on the one side,

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.660
we are building cities and building
housing in a way which provides

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.430
tremendous freedom for the upper classes,
at the same time as it actually produces

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:16.070
unfreedom for the rest of the population.
And this is what I think is meant when

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.120
Marx make that kind of
famous comment: that the realm of

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:27.420
necessity actually has to be overcome in order for the realm of freedom to be achieved.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:33.640
What we have right now in
New York City is freedom of

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.750
investment, freedom for the upper classes
to choose where it is that they will

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:44.220
live, and the mass of the population is
then left with almost no choice whatsoever.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.220
And this is, if you like, the
way in which market freedoms limit possibilities.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.400
From that standpoint I
think that the socialist perspective is

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:00.540
to do as Polanyi suggests. That is, we
collectivize the question of access

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:07.250
to freedom, access to housing. We turn it
away from being something which is

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:12.840
something surely and simply in
the market to being something in the

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.630
public domain. Now, this I think is one of
the basic ideas of socialism in the

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:27.060
contemporary system: to put things in the
public domain. And I think that, on this, I

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.840
get some encouragement from the fact
that the Labour Party in Britain - which

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.170
is one of the few traditional parties
which seems to have some vigorous

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:45.120
Democratic urgency about what it is up
to - starts to propose that many areas in

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.010
in public life should be taken back from
the market and brought back into the

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:57.060
public domain. For example, transportation. Now, if you say to anybody in Britain

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:03.210
that private provision of transportation
on the railways is producing a more

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:08.130
efficient transport system, everybody in
Britain will laugh at you. They know

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:12.390
perfectly well what the consequences of
privatization have been about. It's been

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:17.850
a disaster, it's been a mess, it's been
uncoordinated, and the same thing applies

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:24.690
to public transportation in cities. We
also see the privatization of water

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:29.130
supply - which is supposed to be good - but
on the other hand, what we find is of

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.960
course that water is charged for us a
basic necessity. It should not be

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.880
rendered through the market but now, you have to pay your water rate,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.760
and water provision has not been
good. So the Labour Party is kind of

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.850
saying: "look, there of all these areas
which are basic necessities for the

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.770
population and they should not be
provided through the market. So we're

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.580
going to stop this business of student
loans, we're going to stop our

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.720
access to education through
privatization, we're going to actually

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.539
move much more to this
world of something being provided: basic

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:12.690
necessities through the public domain."
That there is an urge to try to

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:17.700
say: let's take these basic necessities
and take them out of the market. Let's

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.019
provide them in a different way, and we
could do that with education. We can do

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:26.789
that with health care. We can do that
with housing, and we should do it with

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:30.929
basic food supplies. In fact there have
been experiments

00:22:30.929 --> 00:22:38.090
in some Latin American countries with
providing basic food supplies to

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:44.220
lower populations at a cut price. I
don't see any reason whatsoever why we

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:50.429
shouldn't have a basic food supply
configuration for most people in the

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:54.720
world today.
Now this then is the idea that the realm

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.509
of freedom is only possible when we have
actually provided all of the basic

00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:05.970
necessities which we will need to lead
for a decent adequate life. And that, it

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.919
seems to me, is the idea of freedom which
a socialist society would pursue and

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:16.220
which would say that there is a
collective way in which to do this.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.840
Finally, one point: it is often said that
in order to do this we have to surrender

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.330
our individuality, and we have to give up
something. Well, to some degree, yes, that

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.769
might be true. But there is a greater
freedom to be achieved. I think that

00:23:31.769 --> 00:23:38.429
I read Marx as saying he is actually
interested in maximizing the realm of

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:45.509
individual freedom, but that individual
freedom can only be maximized when the

00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:50.309
realm of necessity is taken care of. And
the task of a socialist society is not

00:23:50.309 --> 00:23:54.840
to regulate everything that goes on in
society, not at all. The task of a

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.039
socialist society is to make sure that
all of the basic necessities are taking

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.749
care of - freely provided - so that people
can then do exactly what they want.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.600
And here I think it's not only that they
receive the resources to do it, but they

00:24:08.609 --> 00:24:15.720
also have the time to do it. Freedom - free
time, real free time - is something which

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.620
is absolutely crucial to the idea of a socialist society.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.540
And I think if you ask everybody
right now: how much free time do you have?

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.860
You find actually everybody kind of says:
"I have almost no free time, whatsoever.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.930
It's all taken up with this, that and
everything else." But then real freedom is

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:39.500
a world in which we have free time to do
whatever we want. And I think that that

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:46.860
emancepatrian message about freedom
is crucial to the idea of a socialist society

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.720
and it's something that we can
all work towards. Thank you for joining
