00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.630
JUDY WOODRUFF: Britain's Parliament has issued
a stunning new statement on Brexit tonight:

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.070
It won't buy the prime minister's plan to
leave the European Union.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.950
What it will buy instead is anything but clear,
after rejecting her plan by nearly 150 votes.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.780
Special correspondent Ryan Chilcote reports
from London.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.240
THERESA MAY, British Prime Minister: If this
vote is not passed tonight, if this deal is

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.810
not passed, then Brexit could be lost.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.460
RYAN CHILCOTE: The future of Britain's exit
from the European Union was on the line in

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.670
day-long debate, as was Prime Minister Theresa
May's political career.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.969
May spoke with a hoarse voice that underscored
her exhaustion from a last-ditch effort to

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.129
push her amended Brexit deal through Parliament.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.450
THERESA MAY: I believe it is absolutely imperative
for this House that we meet the decision that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.140
was taken by the British people in June 2016,
that we deliver on that referendum, and that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.020
we deliver Brexit for the British people.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.950
RYAN CHILCOTE: Her original Brexit plan suffered
a resounding defeat by a historic margin back

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.950
in January.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.570
MAN: The ayes to the right 242, the no's to
the left 432.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.840
RYAN CHILCOTE: With that weighing on her mind,
the prime minister made an 11th-hour trip

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.189
to Strasbourg, France, last night to seek
new concessions from the European Commission's

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.189
president.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.170
They reached legally binding changes on one
of the deal's main sticking points: the so-called

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.670
Irish backstop that would ensure the border
between E.U. member Ireland and the United

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.860
Kingdom's Northern Ireland remains open after
Brexit.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.909
Britain's objective: for the U.K. not to be
tied to the E.U. and its trade rules indefinitely,

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.729
should they be unable to agree on the nature
of their future relationship.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.439
Right now, the border between Northern Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland is all but invisible.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.180
That means cars and goods can cross freely.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.310
May's original Brexit strategy would have
kept that border open.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.610
THERESA MAY: A joint instrument with comparable
legal weight to the withdrawal agreement will

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.090
guarantee that the E.U. cannot act with the
intent of applying the backstop indefinitely.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.429
RYAN CHILCOTE: But that assurance also came
with a warning

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.849
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President, European Commission:
In politics, sometimes you get a second chance.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.760
It is what we do with this second chance that
counts, because there will be no third chance.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.780
There will be no further interpretation of
the interpretations, and no further assurances

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.780
of the reassurances.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.860
RYAN CHILCOTE: Then, this morning, Britain's
attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, took the wind

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.370
out of May's sails, issuing a legal assessment
that the changes reduce, but do not eliminate

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.240
the risk the U.K. could remain trapped in
a trade union with the E.U.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.080
GEOFFREY COX, U.K. Attorney General: The question
for the House is whether, in the light of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:55.300
these improvements, as a political judgment,
the House should now enter into those arrangements.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:03.290
However, the matters of law affecting withdrawal
can only inform what is essentially a political

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.080
decision that each of us must make.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.450
RYAN CHILCOTE: The magnitude of that political
decision fueled passionate debate in Parliament.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.750
MAN: The honorable gentleman's cheeky, chappy
chortling and chuckling away from a sedentary

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.110
position, but it's been made perfectly clear
that the prime minister's not giving way.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.569
RYAN CHILCOTE: Opposition Labor Party leader
Jeremy Corbyn was among those who rejected

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.569
the deal.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.270
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor Party: After
three months of running down the clock, the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.150
prime minister has, despite very extensive
delays, achieved not a single change to the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.810
withdrawal agreement.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.540
Not one single word has changed.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.190
RYAN CHILCOTE: Opponents again zeroed in on
the so-called Irish backstop.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.590
MAN: If, in December 2020, alternate arrangements
aren't found for the backstop, we will have

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.140
a hotel California Brexit, where we will have
checked out, but we won't be leaving.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.420
RYAN CHILCOTE: And, critically, many of May's
own allies, like Northern Ireland's Democratic

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.400
Unionist Party, refused to support the divorce
agreement.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.430
With her coalition crumbling around her, Prime
Minister May's Brexit strategy failed to win

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.430
passage.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.879
MAN: The ayes to the right 242, the no's to
the left 391.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.220
So the no's have it.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.400
The no's have it.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.389
RYAN CHILCOTE: This evening, Prime Minister
May voiced her own frustration after the fateful

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.389
vote.

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.030
THERESA MAY: I profoundly regret the decision
that this House has taken tonight.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.930
I continue to believe that by far the best
outcome is that the United Kingdom leaves

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.790
the European Union in an orderly fashion with
a deal.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.910
RYAN CHILCOTE: As for the European Union and
its leaders, they're saying, look, there have

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.681
been months and months of negotiations.

00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:44.150
The U.K. decided to leave the European Union
two-and-a-half years ago.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.990
They're holding firm, and they're saying they're
not going to renegotiate the terms of the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.729
U.K.'s exit from the E.U.

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:52.729
-- Judy.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.139
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Ryan, what a spectacle.

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.419
Tell us what's next.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.930
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, tomorrow, the Parliament
is going to vote on whether the U.K. should

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.449
exit the European Union without a deal with
the E.U.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.060
She doesn't think that's a good idea.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.020
That said, there are people who support Brexit
that think it's a good idea, that actually

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.580
the U.K. would have more autonomy to pursue
the kind of trade deals it would like the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.580
pursue.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.610
Now, if that didn't get supported, if the
parliamentarians say, no, we do have to have

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.780
a deal, then on Thursday, they will have another
vote where they will be asked whether the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.600
deadline, the March 29 deadline, when the
U.K. is supposed to leave the E.U., whether

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.800
that should be extended, pushed back.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.690
So, two more votes coming quite possibly this
week.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.270
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, Ryan, I know there
are a number of directions this could go,

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.030
but what are the options after this?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.880
RYAN CHILCOTE: So the two logical options
are, one, that the U.K. chooses to pursue

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.669
a new deal with the European Union.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.199
Now, right now, the E.U. is saying they're
not going to renegotiate the exit terms.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:06.960
However, the E.U. would love if the U.K. came
back with a softer Brexit, if they wanted

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.550
to leave the E.U., but have a closer relationship
after that with the European Union.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.770
That would require the prime minister to reach
across party lines, if you will, to the leader

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.090
of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, and do some
kind of deal that they have already said that

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.650
they would support, a softer Brexit.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.250
That seems pretty difficult to imagine.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.750
You know, they really don't like one another.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.710
There isn't that kind of bipartisan love,
if you will, to see something like that happen.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.800
The other option is that this goes back to
the British people, a second referendum.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.030
They could be asked, do you support the prime
minister's deal that she reached with the

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.110
European Union?

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.479
Obviously, it's just been rejected by the
Parliament, but the people would be asked.

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.770
Or do you think the U.K., in fact, now that
we know what we know, should remain in the

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.790
European Union?

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.370
Those are really the only two options on the
table -- Judy.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.270
JUDY WOODRUFF: The drama continues.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.850
Ryan Chilcote, reporting for us from London,
thank you, Ryan.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.690
RYAN CHILCOTE: Thank you.
