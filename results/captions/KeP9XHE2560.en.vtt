00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.403
-President Trump is becoming
more lawless amid

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.238
a power grab at the
Justice Department

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.439
and in a recount in Florida.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.775
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.977
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:16.515
Trump has always seen the law
not as a constraint on his power

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.818
but as a tool to protect
and enrich himself.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.087
Today, for example, he attacked
Democrats for saying they'll

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.656
investigate him now
that they control the house

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.725
tweeting, "The prospect of
Presidential Harassment

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.627
by the Dems is causing the
Stock Market big headaches!"

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:31.197
And last week he said
that if Democrats in the house

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.798
use their power
to investigate him,

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.501
he'll just turn around
and investigate them.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.437
-Are you offering an "My way
or highway" scenario

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.639
to the Democrats?
-No.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.441
-You're saying that...
-Negotiation. Not at all.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.944
...if they start
investigating you,

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.513
that you can play that game
and investigate them.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.515
-Better than them.
-Can you compartmentalize --

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.518
-And I think I know more --
And I think I know more

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.386
than they know.
-No.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.988
[ Laughter ]
No, you don't.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.224
Trump's like a Gotham City
gangster who thinks he can

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.561
outsmart Batman and ends up
dangling from a gargoyle.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.063
"Bad news Batman,
I also have a utility belt --

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.065
Oh, son of a bitch!

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.767
Oh.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.869
Oh, I'm upside down again.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.041
Oh, that back fired."

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.243
Grifters always think they can
outsmart everyone else,

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.078
and that's what Trump is --
a grifter

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.813
who surrounds himself
with other grifters.

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:23.649
Right now as we speak,
Trump is being sued

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.751
in Federal Court
for defrauding investors.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.388
He just appointed an acting
Attorney General who advised

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.589
a firm accused
of scamming customers.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.425
And his candidate for Senate
in Florida,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.527
the state's governor,
was involved in one

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.263
of the largest Medicare frauds
in American history.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.498
-President Trump,
three of his adult children

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.735
and their company are now facing
a new lawsuit over allegedly

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.571
conning consumers
in a "systematic fraud

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.207
and pattern of racketeer."

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.175
-Matt Whitaker, the now acting
Attorney General

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.277
after Jeff Sessions was fired,
he is now linked

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.513
to a company referred to
as scam.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.915
-Rick Scott earned his fortune
in healthcare administration.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.285
He served as the CEO of the
Colombia Hospital Corporation.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.889
Scott resigned in 1997 amidst
a fraud scandal encompassing

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.158
Medicare, Medicaid,
and other Federal Programs.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.827
-Man, if these guys
weren't in politics,

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:11.731
they'd be selling fake Rolexes
on the sidewalk in Times Square.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.766
"Of course it's a real Rolex.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.601
The extra X is for extreme."

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.136
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:20.239
Trump's entire career has been
built on scamming people.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.009
In fact, even in the closing
weeks of the presidential

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.012
campaign, Trump was personally
involved in a scheme to break

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.614
campaign finance law
by paying hush money to hide

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:31.450
his alleged affairs,
as we learned on Friday.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.686
-"The Wall Street Journal"
reporting federal prosecutors

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.622
have evidence that Donald Trump
played a central role

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.991
in paying off women during
the 2016 campaign

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.760
who claimed they had
affairs with him.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.695
-"The Wall Street Journal"
reporting that during

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:46.366
the 2016 campaign Donald Trump
closely coordinated

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.702
with American Media Inc.
chairman David Pecker to silence

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.538
two women who claimed they had
affairs with Trump.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.207
-You know, there's a lot
that's hard to believe

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.776
about the Trump era,
but, one thing I will never

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.545
get over is the fact that
the President asked a friend

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.415
to help him cover up an affair
with a Playboy model

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.784
and that friend's last name
was literally Pecker.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.519
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.389
It's like the worst screen play

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.226
in a freshman
creative writing class.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.128
"I need a name for the guy
who covers up the sex stuff.

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.931
Oh, I know.
I'll call him Rex Penis."

00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:21.534
[ Laughter ]

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.436
So prosecutors now have evidence
that Trump personally violated

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.305
election law during
a presidential campaign,

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.841
which makes it pretty convenient
that he just installed

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.210
an acting Attorney General
Matt Whitaker

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.946
who is very much a Trump
loyalist and much like Trump,

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.749
Whitaker also has a history
with fraud.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.851
-Whitaker later joined
the advisory board

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.287
and was first paid
in October 2014

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.190
for a company that has since
been shut down and slapped

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.760
with a $26 million fine
by Federal Authorities.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.030
-World Patent Marketing billed
itself as helping investors

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.966
secure patents,
and Whitaker was hands on.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.235
-It's a unique design
that's going to help...

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.839
-Showcasing a hot tub invention
in this post from the company.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.710
-That's right, the new Attorney
General of the United States

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.112
was involved in a scam
selling hot tubs.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.180
Not only does this
administration

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.650
keep adding grifters,
the scams keep getting worse.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.218
[ Laughter ]

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.620
Our next Secretary of State
is going to be a guy who forges

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.422
signatures based on baseballs.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.258
[ Laughter ]

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:22.227
[ Applause ]

00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:25.664
How did Trump --
how did Trump pick this guy?

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:27.599
Well, Whitaker basically
auditioned for the role

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.902
by going on TV and criticizing
the Russia investigation.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:32.638
In fact, at one point Whitaker,
who now oversees

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.873
the Russia investigation,
said the infamous meeting

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:37.109
Donald Trump Jr.
had with the Russians

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:40.212
at Trump Tower in 2016,
totally fine.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:42.982
-If you have somebody that you
trust that is saying you need

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.351
to meet with this individual
because they have information

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.720
about your opponent,
you would take that meeting.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.322
You certainly want to have
any advantage

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:53.025
and any legal advantage you can,
and one of those main advantages

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.894
is to know what your opponent
is either --

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.863
You know, I mean, all sorts of
things that could be happening.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:00.266
And Hillary Clinton, there was
so much smoke around her.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.201
-There was smoke around her?

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.704
Trump has so much smoke around
him he looks like he's been

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.639
hanging out on Willie Nelson's
tour bus.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.474
[ Laughter ]

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:11.644
So on Friday, reporters asked
Trump if he had picked Whitaker

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.978
because he saw him
on TV attacking

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:15.148
the Russia investigation,
and Trump made it sound like

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.182
he'd never even met the guy.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.818
-What do you think of all this
criticism of Matt Whitaker

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:23.355
and the calls to recuse himself
considering what said --

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:25.825
-Well, Matt Whitaker,
I don't know Matt Whitaker.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:26.926
-So there you go.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.728
Trump says there's
no conflict of interest,

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.430
because he doesn't know
Matt Whitaker.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.799
And if Trump says something,
then you know

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.168
he also said the exact opposite.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.035
-In "The Washington Post"
this morning,

00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:40.906
it says that you talked
to the Attorney General's

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:44.744
chief of staff about replacing
the Attorney General.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.512
Apparently according
to the post,

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.314
you talked to Matthew Whitaker.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.416
Anything to that story?

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.418
-Well, I never talk about that,
but I can tell you

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:55.187
Matt Whitaker is a great guy.
I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:57.456
-Of course he knows him.

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:59.892
If anyone looks like they should
be friends with Trump,

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:03.129
its poor man's Telly Savalas
over here.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.497
And on top of everything else,
Whitaker's appointment itself

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:06.866
might be illegal.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.101
Whitaker wasn't next in line
at the Justice Department,

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:11.437
and he's never been confirmed
by the Senate.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.939
Last week two prominent lawyers
wrote an op-ed arguing

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.141
that Whitaker's appointment
was unconstitutional.

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:17.310
And one of those lawyers

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.345
has a personal connection
to the White House.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:21.747
-Kellyanne Conway's own husband,
George Conway,

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:25.083
a self-described conservative
co-authored an op-ed in

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:27.319
"The New York times," calling
Whitaker's appointment

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.891
as acting AG unconstitutional,
illegal, and invalid.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.792
-That's right, one of the
authors of the op-ed

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:35.427
was George Conway,
the husband

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:37.429
of White House counselor
Kellyanne Conway.

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:38.764
And this isn't even
the first time

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.466
he's criticized Trump in public.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:41.967
What's that marriage like?

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.168
"Honey,
can you pass the chicken?"

00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:44.169
"There is no chicken."

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.271
"I'm looking right
at the chicken."

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:49.575
"That's not chicken,
that's alternative meatloaf."

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.344
[ Laughter ]

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.711
Trump was asked --

00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:57.149
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.785
Trump was asked on Friday
about George Conway's

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.154
criticism, and he decided
to attack the husband

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:04.089
of one of his closest advisers.

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:08.094
-Was Kellyanne's husband wrong?
-Who?

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.961
-Kellyanne's husband
wrote the --

00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:14.166
-You mean -- you mean --
you mean, Mr. Kellyanne Conway?

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:17.236
Why don't you ask Kellyanne
that question, all right?

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.605
She might -- she might know him
better than me.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.407
I really don't know the guy.

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.409
-Okay, so he definitely
knows the guy.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.312
[ Laughter ]

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.214
But Trump, of course,
is no expert in marriage.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.349
In fact, after that talk
with reporters,

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.651
Trump started to walk away
to get on his helicopter

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:36.822
and forgot that he left his wife
standing by herself off camera.

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.758
-I'll see you in Europe.

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:46.032
[ Laughter ]

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.209
[ Laughter ]

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:58.510
[ Applause ]

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.646
-"No. No, you.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.747
No, that's the polite way
to do it.

00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:05.784
You take a big bendy arc.

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:09.622
In olden times that was
considered chivalrous.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:12.391
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye."

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:15.127
[ Laughter ]

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:20.365
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:25.437
I mean, at least -- at least
he went back for her.

00:08:25.437 --> 00:08:27.373
Melania, one.
Umbrella, zero.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.775
[ Laughter ]

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.712
It's obvious that Trump wants
Whitaker to rein in

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:35.247
the Russia probe and the special
counsel, Robert Mueller.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.115
But when he was asked
about Mueller on Friday,

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:39.285
Trump claimed he wasn't even
thinking about it.

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.387
-[ Indistinct talking ]

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.460
-I haven't ruled out anything.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.563
I haven't even thought about it.
I'm thinking about the world.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.763
-The world?

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:53.633
[ Scoffs ] Globalist.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:56.335
You should be thinking about
America first.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:57.502
[ Laughter ]

00:08:57.502 --> 00:09:01.040
Of course there is --

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.008
there is one other thing
on Trump's mind,

00:09:03.008 --> 00:09:04.476
and that's the recount
in Florida

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:06.445
where the GOP candidates
for Governor and Senate

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:09.481
Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott
are narrowly leading.

00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.450
After Election Day,
officials were still counting

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.018
mail ballots
and provisional ballots,

00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:15.087
which is totally normal
and happens in every election.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:17.790
But Trump and Scott have been
lying and spreading baseless

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.392
conspiracy theories about
nonexistent voter fraud.

00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:24.263
-Every Floridian should be
concerned there may be rampant

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:27.500
fraud happening in Palm Beach
and Broward County.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.167
-Any evidence of voter fraud?
-Wait.

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:30.969
Well, you take a look
at the past.

00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:32.238
Take a look at the past.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.773
And all of a sudden
they're finding votes?

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:37.609
You mean after the election
they're finding votes?

00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:40.212
-Yeah, that's when you
find votes,

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:43.282
after people cast them.

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:45.017
"I planted seeds in my garden,

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:48.287
and two weeks later
I'm finding flowers?

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.956
Fraud."

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:53.525
And then today Trump tweeted
that the vote counting

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:55.695
should just stop, because his
candidates are ahead.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.029
-"The Florida election should
be called in favor of Rick Scott

00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:00.465
and Ron DeSantis in that large
number of new ballots

00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:02.801
showed up out of nowhere,
and many ballots

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:03.802
are missing or forged.

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:05.304
An honest vote count
is no longer

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:08.140
possible-ballots
massively infected.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.109
Must go with Election Night!"

00:10:11.109 --> 00:10:13.945
-Hey man, you don't get
to just stop counting the votes,

00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:15.381
because you're ahead.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.549
Trump's like a guy who starts
a game of horse,

00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:18.985
scores one basket,
and says,

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.687
"Actually, we were playing H-,
so I win.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.023
[ Laughter ]

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:28.293
[ Applause ]

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:30.796
I'm the winner, you're --"

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.498
Trump was then asked
if he had any evidence

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.132
that there was fraud
happening in Florida.

00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:36.668
And since there is no evidence,
he had no answer.

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.204
-You notice the votes
never go the other way?

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:41.640
They hire lawyers,
and the votes don't ever

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.675
seem to go the Republican way.

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:44.777
-Do you have evidence of fraud?
-Although I hear --

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.478
Well, I don't know, you tell me.

00:10:46.478 --> 00:10:48.981
-All right. We'll tell you.
No.

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.484
You don't have evidence
of fraud in Florida.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.318
In fact, I'd be shocked
if you even knew

00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:55.354
which state Florida was.

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:57.222
If you asked him to describe it,
he'd probably say it's the one

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:59.191
that's shaped like a...
-Pecker.

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:05.196
-So, Trump doesn't have any
evidence of voter fraud,

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:07.399
but don't worry, he's putting
his best people on it.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:10.268
-"As soon as Democrats sent
their best Election stealing

to Broward County

00:11:12.604 --> 00:11:15.907
they miraculously started
finding Democrat votes.

00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:18.677
Don't worry, Florida --
I am sending much better lawyers

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:20.212
to expose the FRAUD!"

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:22.047
-Oh, you're going to send
your lawyers

00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:24.150
to look at ballots
like this guy?

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.551
[ Laughter ]

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.986
I'm not sure he's your best bet.
I mean, look at him.

00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:29.521
He looks like he just got
kicked in the...

00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.490
-Pecker.
-So...

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.358
[ Laughter ]

00:11:33.358 --> 00:11:36.895
we have to --

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:41.333
we have to get our Pecker jokes
in now while we can.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.902
The guys lying about nonexistent
voter fraud are the ones

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:45.370
who've committed actual fraud.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.372
A grifter President
put a grifter in charge

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:49.108
of the Justice Department,
and is trying to get

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.976
another grifter elected
to the Senate.

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:53.511
But like the grifter he is,
Trump always abandons

00:11:53.511 --> 00:11:55.780
the people who serve him,
whether it's Attorney General,

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.350
his personal fixer,
or even someone as close to him

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.552
like his own...
-Pecker.

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:02.254
This has been "A Closer Look."

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.457
