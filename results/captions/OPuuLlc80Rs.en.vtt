00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.811
We are now lucky enough to be joined by Ian,

00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.365
and Ian is one of the drivers here at the tank museum, of the fantastic Tiger 1.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:18.297
Ian thanks very much for joining us.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.200
On tanks every morning what we would have to do was a First Parade

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.051
and of course the Tiger 1 was no different.

00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.525
So to give you an idea now of what the First Parade actually involved on the Tiger 1,

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.697
Ian is going to take us on a quick spin round.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.834
On the Tiger. First Parade, it's quite a long winded process so it does drag on but it is better to be safe than sorry.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:40.274
The first thing we do check on the outside of the Tiger, the exterior, its tracks.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:45.234
Tracks are really important because track wear and track pins.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:50.308
Each pin has a clip on the end so it retains the pin within each link so you've got to watch out

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.514
for things like that so nothing comes apart.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:56.754
Slack in the track so, if there is too much slack it's going to be too sloppy,

00:00:56.754 --> 00:01:01.040
it's going to make the drive not very good on the tank so we always check adjustment.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.971
On each side obviously is what’s called the final drive.

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:11.017
Within the final drive is, they are filled with oil so the other thing we have to do is check the oil levels.

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:16.525
If the oil is too low obviously it can cause a catastrophic failure within the final drive, which we don't want.

00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:17.942
So they are checked as well.

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:20.830
You've got one this side and obviously one on the driver's side.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.430
What's the drip tray for then?

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:23.051
That's ah

00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:24.690
You've got a leak.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.628
You always get a leak so no matter but so as long as you check it and you check the right levels, happy days.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.000
We check for sprocket wear, any pick up marks on the teeth we try to keep an eye on those.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.942
Road wheels.

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:44.434
We try, every wheel station is greased so that has to be checked as well and greased up.

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:49.314
The rubber on the road wheels we check there is no more being picked off or cracking

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.685
or it’s deteriorating so we keep an eye on the road wheels.

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:55.702
We've got some access panel here.

00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:58.205
This really is for the enurser starter.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:03.325
You can take it off and visually get inside with a torch and look all within the engine bay.

00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:05.771
You've got coolant pipes.

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:09.750
You've got obviously the engine there and just checking for any suspect oil leaks and that.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.314
Anything we find.

00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:13.840
As you can see it is pretty dry on the floor you know.

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:17.394
But obviously there's things called burly plates on the hull of the Tiger.

00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:22.342
Sometimes we take those off and just double check to see if there are any leaks or anything like that.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.657
Must say that's pretty amazing because even on Challenger 1 and Challenger 2

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.770
you find drip trays underneath it and leaks and all the rest of it so.

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.560
Don't get me wrong you are going to get the odd leak, yeah.

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:35.710
Going back to the adjustment of the tracks, the track adjusters are housed in here.

00:02:35.714 --> 00:02:36.994
Wow, that's really unusual.

00:02:37.062 --> 00:02:38.114
So they are in there.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.205
So it works on like a cam sort of idea, so to adjust the tracks so it's all housed in there.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.594
And when you said about the track tension Ian, what is the sort of right track tension then?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.451
I mean I would suggest at the moment, obviously that..

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:57.800
...the track has just got to be touching the second row in and the outer edge, so it is just right where it is now.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.640
Ok there was two ways to start the tiger I

00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:02.120
The first one obviously was a very traditional method

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.360
I'm using the electronic start of the driver's cap

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.506
the other way is to do an inertia start

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:11.090
Ian now is just going to quickly take us through and demonstrate how to do an inertia start

00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:15.306
Fist of all we have to the access cover that has to be removed

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:18.420
and then we've got the adapter's plate for the inertia start handle

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:22.760
lower down here, mounted, is the actual handle for the inertia start

00:03:34.573 --> 00:03:39.306
you push that key in and it engages the starter

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.640
and the fly wheel and bong

00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:42.426
easy?

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.640
No. *laughs*

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:49.140
We have now moved up on to the back decks and Ian is going to give us a quick spin round

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:50.920
what we actually do on a First Parade on there.

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:52.386
Within the engine compartment

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.880
there's a, more or less, 3 main things to check

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.980
We've got things, what's called fan drive gear boxes

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.890
One's located on this side, one's located on the right side

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.810
they have got oil in them, and dip sticks so they will be dipped and checked

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.226
We do them when they're stationnary

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:12.420
and what we do, when we run the tank and we've got them engaged

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.410
we check them as well, when the engine's running, and the fans are engaged

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.680
so we check them as well

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.410
The next thing is the main engine oil.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.040
Main engine oil is practically directly underneath me.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.980
It is a, because it's a dry sump there is a separate oil tank.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.450
There is a dip stick underneath it as well.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.410
What we do is pull the dip stick out.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.400
Obviously if there is oil on the dip stick, it's safe to start.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.900
Re put the dip stick back in and the other thing is just another visual check,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.460
all round the engine we have got coolant pipes,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.930
petrol pipes any sort of smells that we are not you know of

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.580
fuel because being a petrol driven engine you got be to safety all the time.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.420
Carry on with the First Parade on the Tiger,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.200
the coolant side, is checking the coolant on Tiger.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.370
Either side of the rear of the tank are two radiators.

00:05:03.373 --> 00:05:06.373
To check it, we have got this radiator here down by my foot.

00:05:06.386 --> 00:05:10.730
Obviously just we undo the cap and check the level for the coolant in there.

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:15.570
Make sure there are no leaks or anything or there's no damage or anything to the radiators.

00:05:15.573 --> 00:05:19.560
Also on the coolant side, where Richard stood,

00:05:19.613 --> 00:05:23.373
underneath the grills there are the cooling fans.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.586
There are two fans each side.

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:30.653
So what we do on the First Parade is, those would be lifted and we would inspect the fans

00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:34.480
for any wear, any damage and make sure they are moving freely.

00:05:34.493 --> 00:05:39.226
To check the fuel, it's round here on this side of the deck of the tank.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.440
There is another access panel I've removed.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.480
There is the top of the fuel tank.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.426
That's the way we would fill the fuel tank is there.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.053
We haven't got a luxury like a fuel gage,

00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:54.693
we just use a measuring stick to check quantity of fuel within the fuel tanks.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.480
So basically that's the bits that we do on the outside of the rear deck of the Tiger.
