00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:05.438
Presidential Pardons...

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.074
the only genuine
get out of jail free card.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.943
Pardons are one of the most
powerful tools available

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.745
to a President and they have
been used controversially

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:13.646
in the past.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.681
Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:18.018
Gerald Ford pardoned
Richard Nixon.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.253
And as we've mentioned before,
Abraham Lincoln once

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.722
pardoned a man for
attempted bestiality.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.591
-That is true.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.158
And in fairness,
this was the horse.

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.728
That's a pretty fuckable
horse right there.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.130
I'm not saying that
you should fuck it,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.733
I'm just saying I wouldn't kick
it out of bed for eating apples.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.102
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-The point here is...

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:40.239
While we were away Donald Trump
issued his very first pardon

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.674
and it was a doozy.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.389
That's right. Donald Trump
pardons Joe Arpaio.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.790
A man who answer's the question,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.826
"What if a decaying Russet
potato somehow hated Mexicans?"

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.361
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But--

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.198
But let's look at that decision
because if the President

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.833
of the United States is going
to use his very first pardon

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.870
on someone this early in his
term it really is worth knowing

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.673
exactly who Joe Arpaio is,

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.008
and what the implications of
this decision may be.

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:19.012
And you probably may have heard
of Joe Arpaio before.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:22.048
He is carefully cultivated an
image over 25 years

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.950
as a hard-nosed Sheriff with
unconventional methods

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.719

Well, that is just awful.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.218
The pink underwear is fine
but no one should be forced

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:00.753
to wear horizontal stripes.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.256
They widen the silhouette.
That is a fact.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.058
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-That's a fashion fact.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.626
Now, Arpaio didn't really mind
that coverage.

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:10.596
He actually welcomed it, 'cause
he loves being on camera

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.832
so much that he
essentially spent years

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.468
treating prisoners as props
for a reality show.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.971
And sometimes, literally,
he actually had

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.973
a short-lived show called,
"Smile... You're Under Arrest!",

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.543
Where people with outstanding
warrants would be tricked

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.844
into appearing on a set,
only to be pranked

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:27.312

Whoomp, there it is.

00:02:56.708 --> 00:03:00.713
Now, for the record, even then
that reference was 15 years old.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.716
Which is a weird wiggity-whack
thing to do, dog.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:07.486
And look, tricking people into
arrest for your own amusement

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.889
is a terrible idea
for a reality show.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.759
The only worst idea is not
making Peter the bachelor.

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.596

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.010
Now, Arpaio will honestly
do anything for a camera

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.977
and if you don't believe me

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.446
watch him sing
his favorite song,

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.847
which, of course, is...

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:37.950
Frank Sinatra's<i> My Way,</i>
the universal anthem

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.819
-of assholes everywhere.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.221
Watch him sing it for a
documentary film crew.

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:46.125
<i> -♪ The record shows ♪</i>
-♪ ("MY WAY" INSTRUMENTAL

<i> ♪ And did it my way ♪</i>

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.406
Here's something
interesting there...

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.475
when Frank Sinatra heard that
he actually climbed

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.876
out of his grave,

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:05.978
walked 400 miles to
Arpaio's house,

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.447
rang the door bell
and simply said... "No."

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.782
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:13.986
But, what does, "Doing it
Arpaio's way," actually mean?

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:17.456
Because Trump didn't just pardon
him, he touted Arpaio's support

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.458
on the campaign trail,
even having him speak

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:20.726
at the Republican convention.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.729
So, Trump clearly doesn't seem
to have any real problem

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.064
with Arpaio's way.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.767
And for the record,
it is far more that just

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.902
the eye-catching circus
that you've seen so far,

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.537
and many people
were affected.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.607
Maricopa County where he was
the Sheriff until just last year

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.876
contains over
four million people.

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:40.113
That's a higher population
than that of 24 states.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.215
And conditions in his tent city
weren't just eccentric,

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:44.416
they were appalling.

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:47.987
Temperatures there could rise as
high as 145 degrees.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.957
Food was limited
to two meals a day.

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.458
And then, there was this...

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.560 line:0%
REPORTER 8:<i> Chinese law

-(WOMAN SPEAKING CHINESE)

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.520

I-- It's a grey area.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.730
And look, remem-- remember
Arpaio operates jails,

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:32.231
not prisons, and jails...

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.001
are typically for people serving
sentences of less than a year

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.136
or even just awaiting trial,

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.839
which is not to say that anyone
should be subjected to

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.107
some of Arpaio's treatment.

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.876
At one point, he actually
installed web cams in the jail,

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.579
one of which showed female
inmates using the toilet,

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.682
which wound up being linked to
by pornographic sites.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.751
And while the cameras were
eventually pulled,

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.386
the Sheriff's office
defended themselves

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.287
with their lawyer saying,
"They did not show the

00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:57.323
private part of any inmates,"
and...

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.759
"...no juveniles would have
been displayed

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.594
unless they
'look older and lie to us.'"

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:06.698 line:0%
-(AUDIENCE GASPING)
-And just spare a thought there
for the attorney who

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.001
went all they way through
years of law school

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:10.502
only to have to tell a reporter,

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:13.338
"Don't worry the women we
broadcast taking a shit

00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:15.040
were probably all adults."

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:18.010
And Arpaio seemed
routinely impervious

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.812
to criticism of any
of his tactics.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:22.447 line:0%
I have not received many
negative comments,

00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:24.750 line:0%
other than the, uh,
Justice Department

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.320 line:0%
or Amnesty International
or the Civil Liberties Union.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.322
-Yes, Joe...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.726
but those are the three key
groups who might criticize you

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.194
over mistreating prisoners.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:38.164
So, you just went
three-for-three on that one.

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:40.833
You're not going to get
complaints from Carl's Jr.,

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.901
-the Girl Scouts, and
Hootie and the Blowfish.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:44.937
That's not what those groups do.

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:46.505
So, is it frankly,

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.507
any wonder that when a reporter
asked inmates,

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:50.209
whether Arpaio
had any nicknames,

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.013
one responded "Hitler" while
another responded "Hitler."

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.714
-And that--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.449
That is a charge that
he's defended himself

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:58.717
against by saying,

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:02.154
"My daughter has adopted
children of various ethnicities.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.524 line:0%
I got a black, a Mexican
with Down syndrome even.

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:07.860 line:0%
And yet I'm the racist,
I'm the fascist,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.794 line:0%
I'm the Hitler."

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:10.930 line:0%
And look, I'm not gonna
argue with him on that one.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.864 line:0%
That is just sound
logic right there.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.301 line:0%
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-That is why when you
play the board game

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.635
"Guess Who's The Hitler,"

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.105
the first things you ask
to narrow it down are,

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.739
"do their daughter
got a black?

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:23.342
And "do their daughter
got a Mexican with

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.577
with Down syndrome even?"

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.211
Because if their daughter
got those,

00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:29.515
they can't be the Hitler.
It's right there in the rules.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.084
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
-And look, look...

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:36.122
Arpaio's jails weren't just
tough and humiliating,

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.723
they were sometimes deadly.

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.257
Over the years,
the county has paid out

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:40.726
multiple large settlements

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.294
to families of inmates
who've died

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:43.896
following incidents
in his facilities,

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:47.733
including over $8 million
to the family of Scott Norberg,

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:51.404
who died in custody
after being restrained,
shot and beaten by guards.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.406
And when one officer
tried to warn two other guards

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.442
that the inmate
was in dire trouble,

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.177
their response was chilling.

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.849 line:0%
I told him that
he was turning blue or purple,

00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:04.750 line:0%
and that he was breathing,

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.151 line:0%
and he said, "who gives a fuck?"

00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:08.654 line:0%
ATTORNEY: After, uh, Speidel

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.056 line:0%
responded to you,
"Who gives a fuck,"

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:17.062 line:0%
and you warned Officer Gurney,
what did Mr. Gurney say?

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:19.131 line:0%
They said just,
"Who gives a shit?"

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.368
Look, you can't
see someone dying

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:23.902
and say, "who gives a shit?"

00:08:24.002 --> 00:08:27.006
You can't even see
something dying and say that,

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.408
with of course the sole
exception of orchids,

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.343
because really,
who gives a shit?

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:33.813
They're--
they're high maintenance
little flower cocks,

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.814
-and they all deserve to die.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:38.884
Now, now I should tell you
the justice department

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.386
declined to prosecute that case

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:43.589
and both Arpaio and the offices
insisted they did nothing wrong.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.658
In fact, Arpaio was
so unapologetic

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.660
that both
officer "who gives a fuck"

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.096
and officer "who gives a shit"
were later promoted,

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.166
presumably to
lieutenant "whatever, asshole,"

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.502
and sergeant "zero fucks given."

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.037
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And that promotion,

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:00.339
the problem is, that promotion
sends a pretty clear message

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:03.142
to Arpaio's staff.
Almost as clear a message

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.646
as a president pardoning the man
who oversaw all of this.

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:10.082
And remember, Arpaio wasn't just
in charge of jails.

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.517
He was also
a law enforcement officer.

00:09:12.617 --> 00:09:15.821
Though his respect for the law
seemed awfully selective.

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:18.857
Now, over the years,
his office repeatedly
launched criminal cases

00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:21.560
against his perceived enemies,
be they county officials

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.761
or even judges,

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.231
some of which were so
shockingly flimsy

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.099
they were dismissed
or thrown out.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:30.469
One civil suit that he brought
turned out to be so baseless

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:33.071
it was actually cited
in the disbarment

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.706
of the attorney who brought it,

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:36.942
with a member of
the disbarment panel saying

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:39.812 line:0%
it was "nothing short of
fumbling with the law,

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:42.681 line:0%
like children wielding
a buzzing chainsaw."

00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:45.317
Which is not only
an amazing statement,

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:47.953
it's also actually my favorite
Precious Moments figurine.

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:49.454
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:09:49.554 --> 00:09:52.291
And for America's
toughest sheriff,

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.193
Arpaio seemed to let
certain crimes

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.327
fall through the cracks.

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.896
In 2011, it came out
that his department

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:02.067 line:0%
had failed to properly
investigate more than
400 sex-crimes,

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:03.735
some of which involved children.

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:06.305
And while Arpaio
eventually admitted to that,

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:09.674
his apology left
a lot to be desired.

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:12.778 line:0%
If there were any
victims out there,

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:16.148 line:0%
I apologize, uh,
to those victims,

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.483 line:0%
if there were any.

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:20.319
-Hold on. If there were any?
-(AUDIENCE GASPING)

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.287
There were, we know that.

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:24.990
That is a casual indifference
to overlooking sex-crimes

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.060
so egregious, I am genuinely
surprised that Penn State

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.596
-hasn't erected a statue of him.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.733
And amazingly,
here's the amazing thing...

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.335
None of what you have just seen,
not the conditions,

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:39.238
not the deaths, not the baseless
charges against his critics

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:43.442
has anything to do with
why he was convicted
and needed a pardon.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:46.045
That stems from
racial profiling,

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.247
which his department has been
repeatedly accused of

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.649
over the years.
And one huge investigation

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:52.785
made some really
troubling allegations.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:55.788
REPORTER 9:

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:20.579
Think about that.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.549
Thirteen days for
a turn signal infraction.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.083
And that is in Arizona,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.920
where an old person driving
with their turn signal on

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.890
-is literally their state seal.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.860
And not surprisingly,
in 2011, a lawsuit alleging

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.029
his department had a patent
of racial profiling

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:38.130
resulted in this.

00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:41.466 line:0%
A federal court in Phoenix
has decided Arizona authorities

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:44.469 line:0%
cannot arrest people suspected
of being illegal immigrants

You'll never guess
what happened.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.817
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Arpaio did not comply
with that court ruling.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.552
In fact,
over the next 18 months,

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:04.389 line:0%
his office detained at least
171 people without charge

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.892 line:0%
and turned them over
to Immigration Enforcement.

00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:11.997 line:0%
And last July, a federal judge
found Arpaio guilty of
criminal contempt.

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.566
And at that point,
he was a criminal.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:17.235
He had committed
and was convicted of a crime,

00:12:17.335 --> 00:12:21.139
you know, the thing that
the people he puts in tents
and pink underwear had done.

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:23.375
And which he felt meant
that they had forfeited

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:25.711
any right to complain.
He had done that.

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:27.780
And he hadn't even
been sentenced

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.382
before Trump started
hinting at a pardon,

00:12:30.482 --> 00:12:32.384
for a frankly incredible reason.

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:37.756 line:0%

convicted for doing his job?

I'll make a prediction,

00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:44.596
I think he's gonna be
just fine, okay?

(CHEERING)

00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:47.899
But here's the thing there.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.303
He absolutely was not
"just doing his job."

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.705
He was also doing
something illegal.

00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:55.707
You wouldn't say that
John Wayne Gacy

00:12:55.807 --> 00:12:57.376
was "just doing his job,"

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:58.978
even though he was
by all accounts

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.279
-a pretty good birthday clown.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:03.482
It's the stuff he was doing
on top of that

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:05.284
that needed addressing.

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:08.087
And yet, and yet,
I do not doubt

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:10.222
that Trump thinks that
everything Joe Arpaio did

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:13.292
was or should be part of
a law enforcement officer's job.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:16.161
And that is the real
problem here.

00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.697
That is why this pardon
is a slap in the face

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:21.100
to Latinos that Arpaio
and his department

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.968
unconstitutionally targeted,

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:24.536
and that is why it's
a slap in the face

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.638
to the very rule of law itself.

00:13:26.738 --> 00:13:30.609
Because Arpaio broke the rules
he was sworn to uphold.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.378
Rules that are put in place
to protect citizens

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:34.713
from a government
going out of control.

00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:36.281
And Trump giving him a pass

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.383
after everything that
you have seen tonight

00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:41.186
and saying he was
"just doing his job"

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:45.490
is a loud confirmation
that at least as far as
this White House is concerned,

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:46.759
for the next few years

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:49.661
law enforcement won't
necessarily be expected

00:13:49.761 --> 00:13:51.963
to do their jobs the way
the Constitution

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.665
or the courts say they should.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.935
Instead,
like Sheriff Joe Arpaio,

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.570
they should absolutely
feel free to do their job...

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.973
um, what's the term?
