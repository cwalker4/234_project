00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.950
The universe has long captivated us with its
immense scales of distance and time.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.470
How far out does it stretch?

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.240
Where does it end, and what lies beyond the
star fields and the streams of galaxies that

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.120
extend as far as telescopes can see?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.130
These questions are beginning to yield to
a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.210
and to technologies that are letting us peer
not only into the most distant realms of the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.240
cosmos but at the behavior of matter and energy
on the smallest of scales.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.720
Remarkably, our growing understanding of this
kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.540
of atoms, is now enabling us to glimpse the
answer to the ancient question:

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:33.300
How large is the universe?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.940
In ancient times, most observers saw the stars
as a sphere surrounding the earth and as the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.980
home of deities.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.340
The Greeks were the first to see celestial
events as phenomena, subject to human investigation

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.510
rather than the fickle whims of the Gods.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.400
One philosopher and sky-watcher named Anaxagorus
suggested that meteors are made of materials

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:16.099
found on Earth and therefore, might have even
come from the Earth.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.340
Those early astronomers built the foundations
of modern science.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.480
But they would be shocked to see the discoveries
being made by their counterparts today.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.859
The stars and planets that once harbored the
gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:47.049
a vast scaffolding of matter and energy that
extends far out into space.

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.780
Just how far began to emerge in the 1920s.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.419
Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope
on California’s Mt. Wilson, astronomer Edwin

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:07.409
Hubble, along with an assistant named Milt
Humason, analyzed the light of fuzzy patches

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.750
of sky known then as nebulae.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.669
They showed that these were actually distant
galaxies located far beyond our own.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.709
Hubble and Humason discovered that most of
them are moving away from us.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:33.689
The farther out they looked, the faster these
objects are receding.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.329
This fact, now known as Hubble’s law, suggests
that there must have been a time when the

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.650
matter in all these galaxies was together
in one place.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.559
Everything that astronomers saw in their increasingly
large telescopes would have dated back to

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:59.720
a singular beginning, now called the Big Bang.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:08.459
That the universe could expand had been predicted
back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.010
Einstein himself didn’t believe it until
he saw Hubble and Humason’s evidence.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.240
Einstein’s general theory of relativity
suggested that galaxies could be moving apart

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.990
because space itself is expanding.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.139
So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant
star, it moves through a cosmic landscape

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.620
that is getting larger and larger, increasing
the distance it must travel to reach us.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.560
So, how large the cosmos has gotten since
the big bang depends on how long its been

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.419
growing, in addition to its expansion rate.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.639
Recent precision measurements gathered by
the Hubble space telescope and other instruments

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:11.780
have brought a consensus, that the universe
dates back 13.7 billion years.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:20.159
In that time a beam of light would have traveled
13.7 billion light years, or about 1.3 quadrillion

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.139
kilometers.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.560
But taking into account the expansion of the
universe, the most distant galaxies discovered

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.080
by the Hubble space telescope are actually
46 billion light years away from us in each

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:45.250
direction and almost 92 billion light years
from each other.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.039
So is that the size of the universe?

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:58.250
It’s not, according to a dramatic new theory
that describes the origins of the cosmos.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:09.400
It holds that our 92 billion light-year patch
is a mere speck within the universe as a whole.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.129
The theory is based on the discovery that
energy is constantly welling up from the vacuum

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:24.250
of space in the form of particles of opposite
charge, matter and anti-matter.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.139
Back in the 1980s, the physicist Alan Guth
proposed that energy fields embedded in the

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:38.550
vacuum of space had suddenly tipped into a
higher energy state, causing space and time

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.389
to literally “inflate.”

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:55.000
The universe went from atomic size to cosmological
size within an infinitesimally short time.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.139
As a result, according to Guth’s calculation,
the universe as a whole would have grown to

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:07.310
some ten billion trillion times the size of
the observable universe.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:14.759
That’s a ten followed by 24 zeroes.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:20.819
Put another way, the whole universe is to
the observable universe - as the observable

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:36.520
universe is - to an atom.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.819
The incredible fury of cosmic inflation helps
explain the immense size and smoothness of

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:46.270
the universe.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.949
But to succeed, the theory must also account
for how the universe produced what we see

00:07:51.949 --> 00:08:07.210
around us, all those stars and galaxies and
clusters of galaxies, and ultimately us.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.080
Scientists are now attempting to piece together
the chain of events that launched our universe

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:21.490
in its earliest moments by generating what
you might call a “little bang.”

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.990
At the Brookhaven National Lab in New York
State, they are blasting gold atoms in opposite

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:34.539
directions down tunnels almost two and a half
miles long.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:39.570
When these atoms reach velocities just short
of the speed of light, they are sent into

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.340
a violent collision.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:53.750
A fireball erupts, reaching a temperature
exceeding two trillion degrees Centigrade.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.670
As far as we know, the last time anything
in our universe was that hot was about a millionth

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:05.290
of a second after its birth.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:11.820
What interests the scientists is the splatter
of subatomic particles, a super-hot soup of

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:19.850
quarks and gluons that theory says gave rise
to matter as we know it.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:27.090
In initial tests, this quark-gluon plasma
has shown a crucial property: extremely low

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:32.250
viscosity or resistance to flow.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.620
Scientists call it a perfect liquid.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.650
To grasp its importance, we go back to those
primordial energy fields that the theory says

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.450
spawned the big bang.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.030
The thinking is that those fields contained
tiny fluctuations that were blown up to huge

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.880
size during inflation.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.950
In the ultra-dense quark-gluon mix, these
fluctuations generated pressure waves, or

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.070
ripples.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:18.200
As the universe evolved, these ripples gave
rise to variations in the density of matter.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:27.250
Amazingly, the imprint of those primordial
ripples is out there today in a faint signal

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:34.450
discovered accidentally back in the 1960s.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:40.840
Working for the Bell Telephone Company, physicists
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson had built a

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.560
giant horn-shaped antenna.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.010
But wherever they pointed, the contraption
picked up excessive noise in the microwave

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.090
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:01.180
That noise turned out to match a prediction
made years earlier: that in the wake of the

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:14.370
big bang, the universe was filled with a cloud
of extremely hot gas that scattered all light.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.640
As the universe cooled, the cloud dissipated.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.160
Light then shone through

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:30.040
Over time the spectral signature of this light
would have shifted, as the universe expanded

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:38.020
and cooled, to what Penzias and Wilson detected.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:46.660
What they’d heard was the echo of the Big
Bang.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:52.430
This image shows the smooth contours of the
light recorded by the Bell team.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:12:02.550
Scientists would have to look closer to find
the imprint of cosmic inflation.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:11.070
The Space Shuttle Discovery lifted the Hubble
Space Telescope into orbit on April 24, 1990,

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:17.300
in one of the most important scientific milestones
of our time.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:26.580
Another launch, arguably just as important,
took place five months earlier.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:33.410
The Cosmic Observation Background Explorer,
COBE for short, was sent up to take a harder

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:41.660
look at the microwave radiation discovered
by Penzias and Wilson.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:47.260
The results came out two and a half years
later.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:54.850
The light of the early universe contained
a pattern of hot and cold spots.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:01.720
In this image was nothing less than the origin
of all we see around us today, smooth on a

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:11.610
large scale, but with significant clumps from
which gravity would form gas clouds, then

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:18.230
stars, and galaxies.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.631
With this cosmic template in hand, astronomers
set out to discover how the patterns and the

00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:31.270
dimensions of the universe evolved over time.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:36.960
In an age of computer controlled telescopes
and automated observing, astronomers could

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.210
now launch huge international collaborations
with the goal of mapping a large fraction

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:51.100
of the universe in three dimensions.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:58.620
At Apache Point in New Mexico, the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey set the standard for mass production

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.060
astronomy.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:07.280
A series of steel plates are drilled with
holes that exactly match the location of galaxies

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.970
in the night sky.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:15.820
After plugging fiber optic sensors into the
holes, the plates capture the light of hundreds

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.330
of galaxies per night.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:28.510
From that light the astronomers calculate
their distances from Earth.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:36.430
Another survey is named the 2 Micron All Sky
Survey, or 2Mass, after the frequency of infrared

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:47.070
light its detectors are tuned to capture.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:53.870
In this image, the 2Mass data covers a region
60 million light years across.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:59.780
The local group of galaxies, including the
Milky Way, are in the center.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.440
This is our intergalactic neighborhood.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.290
Jump further out to a region about 200 million
light years across.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:16.910
Our location is linked to the densely packed
Virgo Supercluster, the nearest intergalactic

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.910
city.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.950
Stepping out to a region over 320 million
light years across, you can see the full breadth

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.870
of our local region of the universe.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:31.550
Galaxies line up in walls and arcs.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:46.920
Beyond them are sparsely-populated voids,
the rural cosmic countryside.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:59.060
Moving out with the data, this region is over
650 million light years across.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.390
Then almost two billion.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:09.500
3.2 billion.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:18.760
And finally out to a region 6.5 billion light
years from end to end: the cosmic continent.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:25.040
In the middle of it all, our galaxy, so immense
from our Earthly perspective, is less than

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.950
a speck.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:38.490
The 2mass study, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
and the 2 Degree Field in Australia have extended

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:45.130
our maps to a quarter of the way back to the
beginning of the universe.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:50.950
They have laid out a grand cosmic roadmap.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:17:03.660
COBE’s successor, the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe, or “WMAP”, was launched

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:10.680
to scan the early universe for the fine-scale
origins of this cosmic atlas.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.550
WMAP traveled beyond any interference from
Earth, to a position balanced between the

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.020
Earth and the Sun.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:31.930
There, for two years, its detectors took in
the pristine light of deep space.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:49.790
This is what WMAP saw: a pattern consistent
with the filaments and voids that had evolved

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:56.340
in the universe at large.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:03.220
Scientists are poring over the WMAP data for
clues to the true dimensions of the universe.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.180
One group, for example, looked for repeating
patterns that could be evidence of pressure

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:13.830
waves that ricocheted through the hot gas
of early times.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:20.690
They saw none, which implies that the universe
had grown so large during inflation that such

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.100
waves could not cross it.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:31.040
Then they did the math and reported that the
entire universe must have a minimum diameter

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.030
of 78 billion light years.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:44.890
So what is its maximum size, and what’s
beyond that?

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:51.050
We will never know for sure what lies beyond
our visual horizon, but astronomers are turning

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:57.430
up some surprising hints in the universe they
can see.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:12.520
To ancient observers, the universe was made
of five classical elements: Earth, Water,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:26.640
Air, Fire, and a fifth, Quintessence, or space.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:35.310
Aristotle believed the stars, unchanging and
incorruptible, were made of this fifth element.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:43.750
Today, we are finding that space, in fact,
has a character of its own.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.800
Astronomers have calculated the gravitational
pull needed to bind stars as they orbit a

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:57.240
galaxy or galaxies as they orbit a cluster
of galaxies.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.370
They have found that there is simply nowhere
near enough visible matter there to hold these

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.110
structures together.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:15.660
The missing ingredient, its identity still
unknown, they call: Dark Matter.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:23.560
In supercomputer simulations of cosmic evolution,
dark matter is added in to supply the gravitational

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:30.670
tug needed to form the web pattern of filaments
and walls; voids and dense clusters we see

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:37.270
in the universe at large.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:43.150
But something else appears to be happening
on these large scales.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:48.240
Astronomers have been making refined measurements
of the cosmic expansion rate with a new type

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240
of distance marker.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:57.660
They wanted to know if gravity was slowing
down the pace at which the universe is growing.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.960
The markers they used, type 1A supernovae,
are thought to burn at uniform intensities

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.360
throughout the universe.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.220
By measuring changes in the brightness of
these so-called standard candles at various

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:22.940
distances, the researchers can spot changes
in the cosmic expansion rate.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:28.760
To their surprise, the data showed that the
universe as a whole is not only expanding,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.470
it’s actually accelerating outward!

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:40.390
The culprit is thought to be energy welling
up from the vacuum of space, similar to what

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:49.580
occurred in the early moments of the Big Bang,
causing cosmic inflation.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:59.809
By emerging in minute quantities everywhere,
it is pushing space outward across the whole

00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:03.680
universe.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:10.300
Over time, this so-called “Dark Energy”
has grown to an astonishing three-fourths

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:17.310
of all the matter and energy in the universe.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:23.200
With data like this pointing to an underlying
dynamic within our universe, some scientists

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:31.190
are thinking of the cosmos in far broader
terms than ever before.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:36.640
There is a version of inflationary theory,
for example, that suggests we live in one

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:45.810
of many universes, that may co-exist side
by side but do not touch one another.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:56.100
Like bubbles, they are continually rising
up and expanding across the oceans of infinity.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:03.840
Just 500 years ago, in Galileo’s time, many
people looked out into space and saw a universe

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.440
of lights centered on the Earth.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:25.500
The invention of the telescope revealed stars
far from our planet, then galaxies, clusters

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:41.060
of galaxies, and beyond them, vast walls and
filaments of matter.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:47.770
Newer ideas about the size of the universe
amount to a quantum leap in our sense of scale,

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:56.030
by extending these structures far, far beyond
our horizon.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:02.270
Do these discoveries push us, on our tiny
out-of-the-way planet, into a smaller and

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:09.150
smaller corner of Creation?

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:16.270
Or does our ability to comprehend and imagine
the far limits of time and space somehow expand

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:45.169
our importance in the grand scheme of things?
