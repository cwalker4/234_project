00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:23.819
Have you ever wondered why schools teach so little if anything about the world's first advanced civilization ?

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.869
Especially when it introduced so many things we still use today ...

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.468
Why the mystery around Sumeria which was in Mesopotamia in what's now modern-day Iraq?

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.669
After all here's just some of what they gave us:

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.989
the modern calendar based on lunar cycles,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.059
the counting system used for geometry in measuring time, the wheel, the plow,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.090
irrigation systems like levees and canals,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.219
sailboats... They even spoke the first known language

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.859
and most importantly they left evidence of the first recorded writing.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.489
That's a lot of intelligent contributions to humanity.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.980
So why aren't we talk more about this clearly advanced and influential civilization?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.540
Well ...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.330
connect the dots and you'll discover why the omission could be deliberate.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.269
Sumerians were accurate in creating many advanced systems,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.280
yet we dismiss their history of man as mere mythology, and why is that?

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.880
Well if we gave the same credibility to their written history as we've given their inventions

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.880
we'd be teaching a completely different version of our origins

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.940
and ... we'd be thinking a lot more about what our future may hold.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.780
So let archaeologists continue to debate the history and evolution of man.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:04.400
If you go to the source here's what the first civilization ever to record history revealed about our past.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.760
In 1849 a British archaeologists discovered 14 tablets in Sumeria.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.759
Today these are the oldest known writings, and they date back to the 24th century, BC.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.709
While the stories on them share much of what other ancient writings say

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.929
they put a whole new spin on the other ancient sacred texts you see.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.480
while they do refer to a “Father of All Beginnings," or some kind of ultimate Supreme Being,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:47.660
the tablets say that the creators in Genesis, The Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve – these were polytheistic gods of ours:

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.100
otherworldly beings- or just plain out:  they were aliens.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.860
The entire first two tablets explain who they were and where they were from.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.400
Tablet 3 tells of the 6 days of creation – or settlement -  on Earth.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.140
Later, they explain how the human race was genetic manipulated by these beings

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360
and did not evolve randomly.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.020
Even the technology Sumerians gave us came from these beings.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660
Are you interested now in knowing more about what the Sumerians had to say about our history?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.040
Here are selected legends from the 14 tablets,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.100
and their parallels with other ancient sources

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.040
According to the Sumerian tablets

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.140
445 thousand years ago

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.400
“Creator Gods” – as they call it – came to Earth.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.980
The only inhabitants of Earth were wild and undomesticated animals and early ancestors of man.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.850
These beings were called the Anunnaki which means

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.820
“Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came”

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.560
the Anunnaki

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.679
inhabited a distant orbiting planet called Nibiru

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.910
Which only entered our solar system every 3,600 years.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.300
They described Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.860
and abundant with iron oxide making its rivers and lakes appear red

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.640
Now a side note about Nibiru

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.540
According to the tablets Nibiru's atmosphere began to deteriorate and become a hostile place for life

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.640
and in order to restore it the Anunnaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.250
Gold

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.620
Now here are a few interesting facts

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.140
There is proof that gold nanoparticles can be used to repair our damaged ozone.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.860
It shields radiation which explains why NASA uses gold foils in their space stations

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.580
While NASA is currently aware of eight official planets in our solar system?

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.510
There has been much speculation

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.780
about the wobbly orbit of two planets

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.080
which points to the likely gravitational pull of a very large mass,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.640
which has yet to be discovered.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.979
Now detection of this mass traces back decades but in October of 2017

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.800
NASA published an article called "The Super Earth that Came Home for Dinner",

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.560
stating: There are now five different lines of observational evidence

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.020
pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,"

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.960
If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.140
then you generate more problems than you solve.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.460
Clearly there is potential of another planet yet to be discovered in our Solar system.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.960
Now when the Annunaki arrived they were capable of living lives that spanned hundreds of thousands of years

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.380
They created a mining settlement they called Eridug - “Earth Station 1”

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.460
in the Persian Gulf under a leader named Enki.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.220
The tablets convey:

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.380
“After the kingship descended from heaven, (it) was in Eridug.”

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.240
These visitors were not alone: they brought another extraterrestrial race with them.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.080
They were called the Igigi, and they worked as their slaves

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.680
The Igigi were considered inferior. They served the Anunnaki by mining gold.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.540
As civilizations grew the Igigi endured crushing labor

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.760
And these stories are consistent with Babylonian tablets from the 18th century BC:

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.460
“When the gods, man-like, bore the labor, carried the load,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.520
the gods’ load was great, the toil grievous, the trouble excessive.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.960
. . .The great Anunnaki... made the Igigi undertake the toil.”

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.470
After many centuries the Igigi rebelled -

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.060
mistakenly believing they could overcome these oppressive masters.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.960
Their defeat almost completely annihilated their race,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.500
leaving the Annunaki without a workforce.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.780
Unable to replace the Igigi, Nibiru's ruler - Anu ordered his son - Enki

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.460
to genetically engineer a new slave race.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.860
One that was intelligent enough to perform complex work, but still be subservient to the Annunaki

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.260
His experiments are recounted in detail in Atra-Hasis

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.160
many unique creatures were created

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.120
Enki finally successfully met his goal and the result:

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.640
a genetic hybrid between Earth’s cavemen - Homo Erectus - and the Anunnaki themselves:

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.780
this hybrid we call Homo sapiens.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.954
The tablets called first man “the Adamu. “

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.220
In Hebrew, “Adam” means “man”.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.020
The Anunnaki put the Homo Sapiens to work in the mines and elsewhere in Mesopotamia

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.860
The Semitic word “avod”, or “worship,” literally means, “work for.”

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.340
Hence, early man had no choice but to

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.880
“worship” their gods.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.500
According to the pictographs and texts these Anunnaki who we know lived many centuries -

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.100
were giants compared to the Homo sapiens.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.400
Now Because their main purpose in life was to serve the Anunnaki,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.400
Homo sapiens were, in return, educated in social skills, academic affairs, and technology

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.520
– all this is abundantly clear in the tablets.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.060
The new human slaves were sterile,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.910
but as a demand for workforce increased,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.539
they were re-engineered so that they could reproduce.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.450
This later led to an overpopulation,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.130
so later many humans were banished from the safety of their cities,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:22.390
giving rise to the story of the Garden of Eden, and the story of banishment from paradise for procreating …

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.820
As humans evolved to become more intelligent,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.300
some Anunnaki leaders bred with these humans.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.520
The children which resulted from these forbidden unions between races,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.200
were called the Nephilim, or, “the giants of old”.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.740
The tablets say that these practices enraged Enlil,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.720
The Anunnaki leader of that time,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.640
who was also the brother of Enki.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.440
Enlil wanted to ensure no human would ever rise to power and potentially rule Nibiru.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.960
Naturally the interbreeding increased that risk.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.360
But it was beyond his control

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.400
human populations increased over the following millennia,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.440
only to be met with a population control plan that nature had in store

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.920
During one of its 3,600 year cycles,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:25.260
Nibiru's orbit created havoc on the Sun and on Earth.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.040
Nibiru is also called “the Destroyer” in the Kolbrin,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.500
which is an ancient gospel found in Scotland, that was omitted from biblical text,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.120
much like The Dead Sea Scrolls were.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.230
It reads:

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:47.240
”Men forgot the days of the Destroyer. Only the wise know where it went and that it shall return at the appointed time.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.500
The Destroyer … its color. bright and fierce and ever-changing,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.740
(was) an unstable appearance … a fierce body of flames.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.559
Though stating that Nibiru usually passes without causing harm,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:10.040
the tablets describe one cataclysmic event, which occurred when Nibiru neared Earth.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.080
It says first, black spots appeared on the Sun's surface,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.840
the Earth's magnetic field became weaker, the temperatures rose, and the ice caps began melting.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.660
This event, we call The Deluge, or, The Great Flood.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.500
It also reads:

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:38.140
"For days before the Day of the Deluge, the Earth was rumbling, groaning as if with pain;

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:45.820
For nights before the calamity struck, in the Heavens, Nibiru as a glowing star was seen."

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.720
Well according to the tablets Enlil saw the oncoming disaster

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.700
as an opportunity to rid the planet of humans that he deemed unworthy.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.860
He returned to Nibiru, but many Anunnaki chose to stay,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.720
and witnessed the flooding and destruction on the planet

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.080
from their "celestial boats", which circled the Earth.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.680
It reads:

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.560
"Then there was darkness in daytime, and at night the Moon as though by a monster was swallowed.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.120
The Earth began to shake, by a force --  before unknown.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.240
. . . It was agitated.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.960
In the glow of dawn, a black cloud arose from the horizon.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.020
The morning light turned to darkness.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.820
Then the sound of a rolling thunder boomed, and lightning lit the skies...

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:42.400
On that day, on that unforgettable day, the Deluge with a roar began."

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:51.200
At that point, the South Pole huge ice sheets collided and fell into the ocean.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.880
This would have created tsunamis everywhere travelling north to the gold mines in Southeast Africa.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.700
The tidal wave continued north until it reached and submerged the city of Eden

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:11.688
one of the first Anunnaki settlements on Earth, now located somewhere at the bottom of today's Persian Gulf

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.279
Witnessing the cataclysm, Enki - who felt sympathy for his creations,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.020
instructed his chosen ones to build boats.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.360
Among these few humans,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.200
was Ziusudra, (we know as Noah) and his family.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.980
A great storm with heavy rains started.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.320
The tidal wave kept sweeping the Earth for seven days, until it finally came to a halt.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.640
But the heavy rains continued for forty more days and nights.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.240
The story of The Deluge is recorded in almost every civilization on our planet.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.780
Core ice samples taken from Greenland and Antarctica

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.720
illustrate that at the height of the last ice age,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.420
the sea levels were 425 feet lower than they are today.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:10.480
And, more importantly, there is clear indication of a rapid sea rise.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.820
After The Deluge

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.120
reconstruction of a new spaceport began.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.740
The text describes how the Anunnaki made their buildings according to the position of the stars.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.400
It reads:

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.160
"Let the heart of the plain, the heavens reflect!

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.600
Once Enki to this agreed, Enlil from the skies of distances took measures."

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.300
Indeed the pyramids now questioned to be much older than originally determined

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.760
and many other ancient monuments are in fact aligned to the stars.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.540
When the Anunnaki finally left Earth,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.020
their influence had reached every corner of the world,

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.780
from Mesopotamia, to India, to South America.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.160
Before they left, they gifted humanity the Sumerian civilization,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.020
which was inexplicably advanced for its time,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.000
having made sort of a ‘sudden’ appearance as a mature and highly organized culture that came out of nowhere.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.460
The Anunnaki taught the Sumerians their way of life,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.900
and established monarchs.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.980
Now here's where it gets interesting:

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:30.560
the kings would act as their emissaries on Earth and rule the people according to ancient principles.

00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:33.220
Unbeknownst to man,

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.940
royal bloodlines were genetically manipulated by the Annunaki.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:45.280
This would in turn explain the strong aversion by an nobility to interclass breeding.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:54.260
Some people speculate that the Anunnaki have deceptively managed to control the Earth through this selective breeding of nobility

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.220
for centuries... millennia.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:04.300
Others speculate that as the tablets indicate Nibiru may once again come close to our planet

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.280
and then the Anunnaki will return and restore rule over the slave race they created.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.320
This would explain the secrecy around the Sumerian recorded history.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.280
Either way, 3,600 years approaches a new cycle.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.920
So now that you know what ancients reveal about our origins,

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.780
perhaps you’d like to decide?
