&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so and you're from where?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.580
What do you do?

[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; And we work for therapeutic personnel.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.425
My apologies.
I work as an occupational student.

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:04.925
And we work for therapy to personnel.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.730
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.900
&gt;&gt; Marketing and responsibilities.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.385
We're on our own so.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:15.045
&gt;&gt; [NOISE]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:16.091
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] A little stumpy.

00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:19.160
&gt;&gt; Actually, you have time to catch your
breath cuz I'm gonna read the letter

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.850
that you wrote.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.360
Dear Ellen, my name is Kelly Gibson and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.770
my family dances along to
your show every single day.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.050
I'm married to my wonderful husband,
Reggie,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.130
who is the most amazing father to our 11
year old son and three year old triplets.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.460
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; When we learned we were having

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.960
triplets, we laugh because we
knew we were meant for the job.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050
My husband is the hardest worker I know.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.390
We choose to be happy
through the struggles and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.870
our four children are reflection
of our happiness.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.570
Ellen, you bring our family joy and
daily reminder that we have so

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.160
much to be thankful for.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.510
Thank you for
making the world a better place.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.370
More positive.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.570
We love you.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.020
Love, the Gibson family.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.015
So isn't that sweet?

00:01:54.015 --> 00:02:02.300
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; You know I'm so shy.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.100
&gt;&gt; It's amazing you have this much
energy with 3-year-old triplets and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.837
an 11-year-old.

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:08.450
Your 11-year-old, what's his name?

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.010
&gt;&gt; Timothy.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.902
Hi, Timothy!

00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:12.994
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So Timothy is a good big brother?

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:14.440
&gt;&gt; My gosh!
&gt;&gt; He's an excellent big brother.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.030
&gt;&gt; He's like the biggest blessing ever.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.810
He helps us with the kids.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.440
He doesn't complain.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.843
He's just, he is-
&gt;&gt; That's so sweet.

00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:21.867
&gt;&gt; I don't know what we
would do without him.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:22.506
He's amazing.

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:24.480
&gt;&gt; Well, you're all super human.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.175
That's what it is.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:26.490
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's what it takes.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.300
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.970
you drive them around all day
long to different things, right?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
We got to keep them busy.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.480
&gt;&gt; My God.
We stay busy.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.690
We don't stop ever.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.820
And you watch the show together everyday.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.670
&gt;&gt; Every day when he gets home from work,
it's on.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.370
&gt;&gt; Very true.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.300
&gt;&gt; No question.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.270
You have to watch it.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.680
&gt;&gt; There's nothing else to watch.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.481
It's depressing.

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:44.841
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I get home from work and

00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:46.500
I need to see something fun and exuberant.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.304
&gt;&gt; Happy.
&gt;&gt; And happy.

00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:49.063
And then I can go to sleep afterwards.

00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:49.846
&gt;&gt; That's what I try to do.

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:50.751
I try to give you something.

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.949
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.227
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE

00:02:54.227 --> 00:02:56.452
&gt;&gt; They're a lot of mess,

00:02:56.452 --> 00:03:00.495
look how precious they are, look at that.

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:02.100
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Babies.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.790
&gt;&gt; I know you dance the show and
you love the music.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That we play, I'll put play list for

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.590
you that you're gonna love.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.158
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:11.826
I was trying to figure out we
can play that playlist and

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:14.863
I was like, I got an idea,
let's play the playlist here.

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:24.422
[MUSIC]

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:25.180
Won.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.436
&gt;&gt; My.
&gt;&gt; Number one.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:26.959
&gt;&gt; My God.

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.799
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Seriously?

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:38.799
&gt;&gt; Here.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.010
&gt;&gt; Let me have the mic, okay.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.920
Okay.
My friends at Chevy want

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.630
you to have this 2018 Equinox,
it completely redesigned and packed with

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.950
technology that will keep you comfortable,
and connected, like Apple CarPlay.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.933
It's everything you need to do everything
you want and we'll be right back.

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:06.280
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; The kids are here,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.238

so come on out kids.

00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:11.379
&gt;&gt; My gosh.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.937

&gt;&gt; Say hi, [INAUDIBLE] Hi, that's okay,

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:32.400
they don't have to give me a hug.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.320
They can-
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.500
&gt;&gt; You wanna give me a hug?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.490
You can, or.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.000
Hi!
&gt;&gt; Do you wanna give Ellen a hug?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.910
&gt;&gt; No, she doesn't want to.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.400
&gt;&gt; She's Dory, she's Dory.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.868
&gt;&gt; That's okay, it's very confusing.

00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:43.991
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; People don't understand when you

00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:45.214
tell a child that I'm a fish.

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:46.341
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Daddy!

00:04:46.341 --> 00:04:48.372

&gt;&gt; Good job.
&gt;&gt; All right,

00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:00.615
this is the first time
traveling all together, right?

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:01.268
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yeah.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.626
&gt;&gt; Did they cry, were they scared,
were you scared of flying?

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:04.266
&gt;&gt; No, they were so excited to fly.

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:05.315
&gt;&gt; No, they wanted the window seats.

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.168
&gt;&gt; Just when they got tired.

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:08.115
&gt;&gt; They wanted the window seats.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:08.835

&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:13.771
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you work with people
with mental disabilities, and

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:18.481
you both have, and you've known for a year
now, that the company that you work for

00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:21.410

&gt;&gt; June 30th.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.560
&gt;&gt; They've cut funding, and so
that's the end of your job.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.650
&gt;&gt; That's a scary thing to, yeah.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.400
So, what are you going to do?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.795
&gt;&gt; We're both going to school.

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:35.484
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; We get that in every day as much

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:37.380
as we can.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.281
Basically, it's just one check now and
that's me because she has to stay home.

00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:07.444
that doesn't pay the bills.

00:06:07.444 --> 00:06:08.075
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:10.665
