00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.279
number ten Greek fire ancient scientists
have given countless inventions to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.080
humanity some inventions from ancient
times still remain a mystery though the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.070
Greek fire used by the Byzantine Empire
in the seventh century is one of the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.109
biggest secrets in science this was a
liquid substance thrown from ships it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.430
was impossible to extinguish with water
and it spread quickly

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.770
this substance helped to defeat enemies
in many naval battles in fact it has

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.649
served an inspiration for the famous
wildfire on the series Game of Thrones

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.370
National Geographic got closer to making
this fire by the creation of a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.879
flamethrower built with a brass tube and
a mixture of oil and pine resin however

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.609
there is a belief that the Greek fire
contained naphtha sulphur and ammonia

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.000
among other substances the components of
the Greek fire were a well-kept secret

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.880
nowadays historians and chemists
continue to look for the way to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.909
reproduce the formula of the Greek fire
that seems to have lost in time Damascus

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.030
steel the Christian soldiers who fought
in the Crusades came across a type of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.740
weapon that had never been seen before
the swords carried by the Islamic

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.049
military were constructed with the
Damascus steel the strength flexibility

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.329
and wave-like patterns made them
completely unique it is a fact that they

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.369
could cut a still prevail in the air and
they could slice a rock without damaging

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.009
the blade sharpness these swords were
made of crucial steel meaning steel made

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.030
with a different heating and cooling
techniques moreover they were made with

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.020
a mixture of iron mineral wood leaves
and coal however the specifications for

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.270
making these swords disappeared when the
last blacksmiths who made them died in

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.629
the year 1700 competence universe
stay in Madrid Spain states that they

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.790
have unveiled the secret to make these
swords in fact they have the patent to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.010
forge steel swords with a high content
of carbon nevertheless there are still

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.290
debates by experts in metallurgy about
the real manufacturing of Damascus steel

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:43.019
number 8 the Voynich manuscript Wilfrid
Voynich a Lithuanian antiquarian of

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.150
Polish origin got a manuscript by an
anonymous author the content of this

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.190
manuscript is still unknown Voynich
spent his life trying to find out the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.650
secrets of the document the book known
as the Voynich manuscript honoring

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.829
voyages name has 246 pages and it is
written in an alphabet that nobody has

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.069
been able to identify it is an
undecipherable language in 2009 carbon

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.409
dating technique was performed on this
manuscript

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.260
hence it found out that the manuscript
was from the 15th century this

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.730
manuscript has hundreds of drawings that
allow dividing the content of it into

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.780
sections such as botany biology and
astrology it also has miniatures of

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.459
naked women and water or walking in the
water and they are interacting by means

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.489
of tubes or capsules these miniatures
are very strange considering the age of

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.750
the document it has become the most
researched puzzle that has to be solved

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.750
number 7 the Antikythera mechanism

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.560
this corded brass object that seems
useless is actually a 2,000 years old

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.840
analog computer the Antikythera
mechanism was recovered from the bottom

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.470
of the sea in 1901 near Antikythera
island greece it is divided into 82

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.079
pieces the device is a complex clock
mechanism system made up of many brass

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.790
gears antiques experts have found out
that this system was used to calculate

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.150
the moon phases and the lunisolar
calendar

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.250
it could also forecast eclipses and be
used to plan the exact date of the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.910
Panhellenic games such as Olympic at
critical games moreover it was also used

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.650
to show the planet movements known by
that time to study its mechanism a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.720
special tomograph built for the
investigation of this ancient object the

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.190
similar technology was not developed
until the Scientific Revolution between

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.990
the 16th and 17th centuries so it's a
real mystery to know who made this

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.090
device and how its creator got the
necessary knowledge to make a futuristic

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:09.190
invention at that time number 6 Shang
hang seismograph present-day

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.940
seismographs have nothing to do with the
first earthquake detector in history

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.070
Zhang hang a Chinese scientist and an
astronomer from the East Han Dynasty

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.360
this seismoscope in the year
132 ad it is a copper vessel with dragon

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.440
heads aiming at the cardinal points
beneath the dragon heads

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.960
there are various toads with open mouths
when there was an earthquake a bronze

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.340
bar fell into one of the toads mouth
indicating where the earthquake had

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.710
taken place and this device is able to
detect earthquakes occurring 600

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.260
kilometers away some theorists believe
that it is a system based on a free

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.660
swinging pendulum driven by inertia
however the operation of this device is

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.970
one of the biggest mysteries in history
the original seismograph does not exist

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.900
anymore and most of its replications are
used just for decoration

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.810
there is a functional replica of this
device in the History Museum in Beijing

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:18.830
number five Ulfberht Sword, many tombs
from the Viking Age have been discovered

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.419
all over the north of Europe
archaeologists have found inside the

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.210
tombs a total of 171 Ulfberht Sword, these swords were made with

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.949
techniques that were very advanced for
that age they got their name from the

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:40.220
inscription plus Ulfberht on their
blades the meaning of this word is still

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:48.530
unknown these swords are made of 99.9%
pure metal which was free from slag also

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.530
having an almost perfect carbon balance
according to experts the technology to

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.599
make these swords was superior at that
time this technology did not appear but

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.880
800 years later in other regions it is
similar to the one used for making

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.229
Damascus steel in 2014 a 9th century
tomb was found in Scandinavia this tomb

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.330
had an Islamic inscription this finding
makes scientists think that there may be

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.010
a link between Viking swords and the
weapons used centuries later by the

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.260
Arabian militaries in the Crusades
however no evidence has validated this

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:35.560
coincidence number forms the iron pillar
of Delhi

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:41.080
time is a deadly enemy of ancient
monuments that causes maximum damage

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.949
that's why this iron pillar weighing 6
tons and 7.21 meters high which is not

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:56.110
rusted during more than 1600 years it is
still an engineering mystery located in

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:01.780
Delhi India the only clue about its
origin is the inscriptions on the metal

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.120
they can be perfectly seen after
centuries of exposure to the natural

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.069
environment many scientists think that
the mild weather in the area does not

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:17.860
affect this big iron mass others suggest
that phosphorus is a component of the

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.750
pillar and there is no sulphide and
manganese in its structure which could

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.250
contribute to the good condition of the
monument however all scientists agree

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.649
that this big iron monument is a living
testimony of the wisdom of India's

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:42.459
former inhabitants number three, The Phaistos Disc, Luigi Pernier, an Italian

00:08:42.459 --> 00:08:48.420
archaeologists discovered the fastest
disc on the Greek island of Crete in

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.640
1908 this disc also known as the rosetta
stone of the Minoan civilization and

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.220
made from baked clay is 15 centimetres
in diameter and dates back to the late

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.480
Minoan Bronze Age it is engraved on both
sides with a spiral of 242 symbols the

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.550
real meanings of these symbols are still
unknown there are some theories about

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.230
the symbols they seem to be printed with
a kind of seal this fact makes

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.370
historians think that this is probably
one of the oldest printed documents in

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.649
existence or this object might have been
used as a seal itself and may be

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:31.269
considered the first printing attempt it
is also believed that this disc was a

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:38.230
musical score or even an asset inventory
a calendar or a game a true thing is

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.200
that present time experts consider it a
jigsaw puzzle

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:50.750
number two Roman dodecahedron despite
the fact Roman civilization has been

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.360
studied for centuries still it is full
of mysteries one of those mysteries is

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.750
the Roman dodecahedron it dates back 200
years ad it is a hollow object with 12

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.360
sides made up of brass or stone each
side has a pentagonal shape and a hole

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.209
in the center hundreds of these devices
have been found from Wales too hungry

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:19.490
especially in Germany France and Italy
its size varies between 4 centimeters to

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.230
11 centimeters however no document has
information about its existence or

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.910
purpose this is weird considering that
Roman civilization kept the records of

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:34.730
almost everything there is a belief that
these dodecahedron were used as candle

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:40.190
holders dice gauges for water pipes or
simply as a solid foundation to support

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.540
the Roman eagle symbol it is also
possible to think that these objects

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.370
were used for religious purposes or
fortune-telling there is no doubt that

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:57.850
this is a multi-purpose mysterious
object number one giant stone spheres

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.839
more than 500 pre-columbian stone
spheres were discovered in the Sierpe district,

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:08.420
in the south of Costa Rica in
1939 the size of the stones ranges from

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:14.990
30 to 257 and they weigh between two
kilos and 16 tonnes it was concluded

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.800
that Costa Rica's indigenous people used
advanced cutting and polishing

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.410
techniques to transform blocks gia rites
and igneous rock into spheres of the

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.209
perfect finish moreover it is believed
that a superior method to transport

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:34.010
these spheres was also used experts
state that these spheres are a mystery

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.110
not because of their construction but
because of what they represent nobody

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.190
has figured it out yet many of these
stones have been moved or exploited by

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.720
treasure hunters this situation has
become an obstacle for investigation

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.610
some of these stones were placed near
human and animal statues few data

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.330
suggests that this group of rocks my
been used as an astronomical calendar

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.890
but the only truth is that there are not
spheres like these in any other place on

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:26.129
this planet
