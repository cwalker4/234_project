00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:41.654
Every day, since November 1998,
the International Space Station

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:47.433
has been orbiting the Earth at a speed
 of 28000 kilometres per hour

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:53.468
Having spent several months on-board
the International Space Station,

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.010
the time has come for
three of its crew members

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:58.544
 to travel back to Earth

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:03.188
The return journey aboard a Soyuz capsule
 takes three and a half hours

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.794
Before it can start,
there is a lot of preparation to do

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.073
Both in space and on the ground

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:16.841
The normal landing site
 for the Soyuz is Kazakhstan

00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:18.590
A group of ground based experts prepare

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:21.144
meticulously for this operation

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:23.960
They take into account
the current orbit of the station

00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:28.884
and then select the most appropriate
 landing site on the ground

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:32.665
The landing site is checked by
the search and rescue team,

00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:35.482
to make sure that
the terrain is flat and free

00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:38.535
from any obstructions that
could complicate the landing

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:44.620
The search and rescue team is able to
operate even in extreme weather conditions

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.255
When all the information
has been analysed,

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.622
the optimal return trajectory is calculated

00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.452
One week before the Soyuz
 undocks from the station,

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:04.680
the instructors and controllers located
 in the Mission Control Centre near Moscow

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:09.186
 conduct a remote training  session with
 the crew and the on-board simulator

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:11.263
During this session, the crew

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:13.396
are reminded about the
most important actions

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.974
they will have to perform
during the re-entry

00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.169
They carefully run through
 the procedures for

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.938
each critical step,
including the scenarios

00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:23.511
that could lead to
an emergency descent

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:25.677
They are also briefed
on the latest details

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.497
 of their trip back,
 such as landing conditions,

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:32.622
and the precise timelines for
the activation of vehicle systems

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:36.843
The on-board crew runs a test
of the Soyuz vehicle and begins

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:40.458
packing items that will travel
with them back to the ground

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:46.528
The Soyuz is then activated and
the crew starts preparing it for undocking

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.847
When instructed by the
ground controllers,

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:51.722
the crew say their goodbyes
to their colleagues staying behind,

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.924
and close the hatch that separates the
Soyuz orbital module from the Station

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.005
The hatch is carefully checked,

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.263
to make sure there are
no leaks that could cause

00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:04.044
an unexpected cabin depressurization

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.731
The crew members put on their spacesuits
and enter the descent module that

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.522
they will occupy for the ultimate
rollercoaster ride back to Earth

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:19.044
Former astronaut Frank
De Winne is now head of

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.237
the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:24.347
He remembers clearly the
emotions he felt as he was

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.561
about to leave the
International Space Station

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.185
Wow! Today I'm really going home
 because of course the days before,

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:37.482
 you are preparing for the descent,
you are reviewing all the procedures

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.260
you are going through all the radiograms

00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:42.533
But it is only at the moment
that you are in your spacesuit

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:45.388
and that the hatches are closing
that you know that four hours

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:48.036
later you will be back on Earth

00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:54.424
Both crew and vehicle are now
ready for the undocking sequence

00:03:55.357 --> 00:03:58.614
The Russian segments of the station
 have several docking ports

00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:00.747
for hosting Soyuz vehicles

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:04.427
In this example,
the vehicle is going to undock

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.027
from the so called Service Module

00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:13.036
In this case, the undocked Soyuz
reaches an orbit below the station

00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:16.832
The orbital velocity of
the Soyuz also increases

00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:22.035
Sometimes, however, the Soyuz is docked
to a port underneath the Station

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:25.685
In these situations,
approximately 40 minutes

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:29.404
before the undocking,  the Station
changes its orientation

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:36.843
The Soyuz then undocks and joins
a higher orbit and its velocity decreases

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.927
In both cases, after one revolution
 of the earth, the orbits intersect

00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:46.285
but because of their now
different velocities the Station

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:50.552
and the Soyuz  arrive at the
 intersection point at different times

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.997
This prevents any possibility of
a collision  between the two vehicles

00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:04.349
When the Flight Director
 is ready a "GO"

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.310
is given to the crew
to initiate the undocking

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:09.498
The crew commander
issues the command

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:11.271
to open the Soyuz hooks

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:15.255
These are the only mechanical devices
 holding the vehicles together

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:18.176
After approximately 3-4 minutes,
the hooks are

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:22.124
fully opened and the Soyuz is no longer
firmly attached to the Station

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.560
A set of pushers that were kept
mechanically compressed

00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:28.284
while docked, gently
ease the Soyuz away from

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:32.745
the station at a relative
speed of 12 to 15 cm/s

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.757
Being so close to the Station,
the Soyuz propulsion system

00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:46.504
is inhibited in order to avoid
contamination of the Station with residual

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.941
chemical dust produced
by the Soyuz thrusters

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.375
The crew gets visual confirmation of
 the separation through the image

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.060
provided by the external TV camera,
and also from indications

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.302
displayed on their monitors

00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:05.549
ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli,

00:06:05.557 --> 00:06:10.583
returned to earth aboard a Soyuz
spacecraft at the end of Expedition 27

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.141
I didn't actually feel the detach,
 when we detached

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:18.341
from the Station,
physically I did not feel it

00:06:18.374 --> 00:06:20.899
The physical departure from the Station

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:24.068
is done because of the push
of some springs that are inside

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:27.255
You don't want to start your
engines close to the Station,

00:06:27.258 --> 00:06:29.090
because you are going to plume everything

00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:32.393
So you are just kind of
drifting away and what you

00:06:32.393 --> 00:06:35.682
are doing, what we were doing
 was just looking at the instruments,

00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:40.570
looking at the camera outside and
 checking that the Soyuz would be inside

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:43.591
the departure corridor,
this is what we were doing

00:06:44.114 --> 00:06:48.593
I did not really feel anything
The only thing is that we felt

00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:52.607
we started this long
journey back to Earth

00:06:54.823 --> 00:06:56.959
Three minutes later,
when the spacecraft

00:06:56.964 --> 00:06:59.822
has moved about 20 metres,
the crew monitors

00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:05.466
the 15 second burn that increases
the separation speed up to 2 km/h

00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:10.560
This  leads the Soyuz to a safe position
 relative to the Space Station

00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:15.067
After the undocking,
the ground controllers upload

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.810
the data needed by
the on-board computer to

00:07:17.822 --> 00:07:20.115
autonomously perform the descent

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.029
The crew is in constant
communication with the ground

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:28.404
They verify the validity of the data,
before allowing the computer to use it.

00:07:29.902 --> 00:07:31.754
At this stage, the crew must

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:34.948
pay special attention to
prepare for the next

00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:37.020
critical operation: the Deorbit Burn

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:40.639
As can be seen,
although the Soyuz is now

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:44.088
far away from the Station,
it is still orbiting

00:07:44.104 --> 00:07:47.185
the Earth at an altitude
 close to that of the ISS

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:52.685
The purpose of the Deorbit Burn is to
 force the Soyuz to decrease its speed

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:58.279
As a result, the trajectory of the vehicle
changes and it re-enters the atmosphere

00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:02.404
The atmosphere acts as a natural
brake and does most of the work

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:06.854
in slowing the Soyuz down
until a set of parachutes opens

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:09.177
and ensures a relatively soft landing

00:08:10.096 --> 00:08:11.958
This braking is achieved by

00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:15.848
using the main engine located
 in the rear side of the spacecraft

00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:18.135
to push against the
direction of travel

00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:20.736
The required orientation
and duration of the

00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:23.544
braking impulse must be
precisely calculated

00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:26.590
and achieved because
it directly influences

00:08:26.616 --> 00:08:29.005
the steepness of
the re-entry path

00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:31.169
If we don't burn enough,

00:08:31.187 --> 00:08:34.286
then we have still too much speed
and we will still be too high

00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:37.607
in the atmosphere and we can
actually skip off the atmosphere

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:42.830
and then go further into space and that
of couse would not be a successful re-entry

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:46.770
On the other hand, if we burn too
much and we come in too steep

00:08:46.786 --> 00:08:51.044
then we will have too much speed when
we are in the lower parts of the atmosphere

00:08:51.044 --> 00:08:54.777
the heat that is normally
 around 2000 degree Celsius

00:08:54.787 --> 00:08:58.249
will be much higher and we
have the risk of burning up

00:08:58.256 --> 00:09:02.927
So also therefore is very critical that
 we do the correct deorbit burn

00:09:02.944 --> 00:09:06.847
and that we really
fix this around 120 m/s

00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:12.859
To achieve the correct burn,
the main engine fires

00:09:12.874 --> 00:09:16.247
for exactly four minutes
and forty five seconds

00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:25.790
The Soyuz now follows a
 trajectory that will lead

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.474
it to intercept the dense
 layers of the atmosphere,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.430
leading to a safe re-entry and landing,
 about 55 minutes later

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.984
As the vehicle travels along its
 trajectory, about 30 minutes before

00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:43.988
landing and at an altitude
 of roughly 140 km,

00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:49.029
it separates into three parts: the orbital
 module, the descent module

00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:50.896
and the instrument compartment

00:09:51.872 --> 00:09:54.771
There is no chance of the individual
modules colliding with

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:58.490
each other, this is called
 impact-less separation

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:03.333
Only the descent module hosting the crew
 will make it back safely to Earth

00:10:03.357 --> 00:10:07.302
The other two will disintegrate and
burn up in the atmosphere

00:10:08.144 --> 00:10:14.403
The separation of the spacecraft into
three parts is happening through

00:10:14.404 --> 00:10:16.489
several seconds, because
there are several

00:10:16.497 --> 00:10:19.271
parts that get detached
one after the other

00:10:19.314 --> 00:10:25.794
All this action is done with explosive
bolts or with explosive implements

00:10:26.154 --> 00:10:29.367
Seen from the inside of the
 spacecraft, it felt like

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:33.605
there was somebody outside the
spacecraft with a sledgehammer that

00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:38.021
was hammering  here and there,
 up and down so every few

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:41.115
milliseconds the spacecraft
 was shaking with this

00:10:41.122 --> 00:10:43.154
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:45.435
It felt really interesting actually!

00:10:51.724 --> 00:10:55.443
The descent module experiences
extreme high temperatures

00:10:55.451 --> 00:10:59.208
during re-entry, so to protect it,
 and the crew inside,

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.286
it is fitted with a
special protective

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:04.132
coating and has a heat
shield on its base

00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:07.973
As the atmosphere becomes
more dense, the descent module

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.497
positions itself so that its heat
shield points forward

00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:14.949
The capsule is about to enter
the Earthís atmosphere

00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:18.449
This will be the most stressful
part of its journey home

00:11:18.763 --> 00:11:21.285
By the time we were
supposed to re-enter

00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:23.926
the atmosphere, I actually
 looked out from our

00:11:23.973 --> 00:11:29.660
 window and I actually looked we were
tumbling and I was a little bit puzzled

00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:33.080
because I thought we needed
 to re-enter with a special angle,

00:11:33.097 --> 00:11:38.354
so I started looking at procedures, we did
a few things and when I looked out again

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:44.443
 I saw that we were already inside
this plasma, it was getting

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:47.865
really red and actually the
window was getting pretty dark

00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:49.607
what was happening was that

00:11:49.627 --> 00:11:53.651
the plasma stream was actually
burning the outside layer of

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:55.964
the window which has a protective cover

00:11:56.032 --> 00:12:01.279
So it was  kind of interesting, at that
point I did not feel that much I mean

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:05.842
the gravity starts
grabbing you but it is very

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:08.358
gentle at the beginning
and you actually use it

00:12:08.366 --> 00:12:13.723
 to feel or go into the
seats and buckle up,

00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:17.263
pull your straps so that you
really lay into the seat

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:19.115
It was an interesting feeling

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:23.764
The descent module follows a path
that is similar in shape

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:26.263
to that made by a surfer
 riding a big wave

00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:31.883
Like a surfer, the Soyuz is able to make
small adjustments to keep itself on track

00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:36.724
So, how is the trajectory of a
 free falling capsule controlled?

00:12:38.173 --> 00:12:41.024
Even though it does not
have wings, the Soyuz

00:12:41.024 --> 00:12:44.146
capsule is able to change the
way it flies through the air

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:46.880
The design of the Soyuz
enables it to do this

00:12:46.968 --> 00:12:50.514
The capsuleís lift increases
when it rotates in one direction

00:12:50.522 --> 00:12:53.906
and decreases if it rotates
in the opposite direction

00:12:53.966 --> 00:12:58.149
In this way, the capsule is able to
 keep to its planned trajectory

00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:01.841
As a side effect,
 this rotation also induces

00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:03.927
a sideways displacement
 of the module

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:06.357
This effect is very
useful because it gives

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:09.896
more flexibility for the selection
 of the landing site

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:13.267
This sideways manoeuver
has already been taken

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:17.088
into account when selecting
the optimum trajectory

00:13:20.423 --> 00:13:23.770
During the descent in the atmosphere,
 the crew feels the effect of

00:13:23.778 --> 00:13:26.098
the deceleration when
their weight exceeds

00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:28.858
several times their own
weight on the ground

00:13:28.988 --> 00:13:33.496
The maximum G-load (4G) is experienced
when the capsule reaches an

00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:36.450
 altitude of roughly 35 km while

00:13:36.466 --> 00:13:40.129
it has already been travelling
for 6 to 7 minutes in the atmosphere

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:42.896
Gravity is a very,
very strong force

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.621
We do not understand
here on Earth how gravity

00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:50.367
has such a hold on our body
and what is around us

00:13:50.553 --> 00:13:53.520
You do feel it when you
 come back from space

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.004
because now you have been in
 a non-gravity environment

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:03.536
for a long time and then you see
all these forces grabbing you

00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:06.308
You look at stuff and you feel
your hands are heavy,

00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:10.185
you feel your watch weights a ton,
your books, the materials

00:14:10.192 --> 00:14:12.919
around you, your head
is extremely heavy

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.279
It  is really a very strong feeling

00:14:16.893 --> 00:14:21.150
In the unlikely event that the
automatic control system fails,

00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:24.857
the crew is able to use a manual
 hand controller as a backup

00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:28.844
They train extensively to
prepare for this possibility

00:14:29.427 --> 00:14:31.993
Another option is the ballistic descent

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.499
The spacecraft starts spinning and
flies a much steeper trajectory

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:39.316
without any additional
 sideways displacement

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:42.810
The G-load in this case
 will increase up to 9

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:49.527
When the capsule reaches an
altitude of 10.5 km, its speed

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:54.069
has already decreased
from 28000 to 800 km/h

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:58.099
In order to further decrease the speed,
the parachute cover

00:14:58.107 --> 00:15:01.272
is jettisoned and a series
of parachutes are deployed

00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:05.938
At the end of the atmospheric re-entry,
you really start hearing

00:15:05.952 --> 00:15:10.542
the noise of the wind and the sound,
you are almost breaking the sound barrier

00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:13.904
Then, in the opposite direction of course
 you are coming back into

00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:16.513
the normal area of flying

00:15:23.247 --> 00:15:27.300
This is around 30000 feet that
the parachute has to open

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:30.496
This is actually a very critical
moment and is one of the

00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:34.240
only things in the Soyuz where the
crew does not have a manual override

00:15:34.252 --> 00:15:36.396
So this is only an automated system

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:40.254
So far, it has always worked and we
also have a backup parachute that can

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:42.563
help us in case that
the main will not open

00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.677
But it is also a very
violent moment,

00:15:44.684 --> 00:15:47.874
you can imagine this
 2000 kilogram capsule

00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.864
that is soaring at the speed of
sound through the atmosphere

00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:53.924
and then all of the sudden
you have a parachute

00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:58.064
that opens on the side and that
pulls on you, like a little swing,

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:01.626
It is almost like a yo-yo and you
 see the capsule going all around

00:16:01.634 --> 00:16:04.466
It is much worse than in
 a roller coaster because

00:16:04.492 --> 00:16:07.752
the motion is in all directions
and it is a little bit

00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:11.243
 scary for some of us,
for some others it can also be fun

00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:14.040
because they are like "Wow this
 is the best ride I've ever had!"

00:16:14.213 --> 00:16:19.495
Then, a few minutes later, at a
 height of 8.5 km, the drogue chute

00:16:19.495 --> 00:16:24.905
finally deploys the 1000 square
metre canopy of the main parachute

00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:31.926
This slows the capsule down
 to a speed of  22 km/h

00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:34.661
The capsule is suspended
 under the parachute

00:16:34.669 --> 00:16:37.418
 with a specific angle
relative to the ground

00:16:37.557 --> 00:16:41.510
This angle helps the capsule to
dissipate the heat accumulated

00:16:41.526 --> 00:16:44.302
on its surface and structure
during the re-entry

00:16:44.646 --> 00:16:48.857
But then everything calms down,
of course once that the main parachute

00:16:48.864 --> 00:16:53.036
has deployed you really come to the
 calm air after this whole violent

00:16:53.044 --> 00:16:55.740
re-entry, the violent
opening of the parachute,

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.768
then you are hanging safely,
 slowly descending

00:16:58.775 --> 00:17:00.482
to the Earth underneath your parachute

00:17:00.489 --> 00:17:03.130
and this is actually the
first time that you know:

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:05.419
Yes, I am safe, we are going to make it!

00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:11.888
At an altitude of roughly 5.5 km,

00:17:11.904 --> 00:17:15.723
the frontal heat shield and external
window glass are jettisoned

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:20.693
The capsule vents excess fuel
and oxygen from pressurised tanks,

00:17:20.702 --> 00:17:24.346
to reduce any chance of an
explosion when it hits the ground

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.794
In order to position the spacecraft
adequately for the landing,

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:30.966
the main canopy switches
to symmetric suspension

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:33.825
This setup ensures that the
cosmonauts' seats are now

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:37.755
perfectly positioned to absorb
 the landing impact shock

00:17:38.422 --> 00:17:41.146
The retrorockets that were
hidden behind the heat shield

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:42.943
are prepared for firing

00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:47.093
Inside the capsule, the crew
 seats automatically raise

00:17:47.093 --> 00:17:49.608
 in order to prepare
shock absorbers

00:17:50.891 --> 00:17:54.165
Usually, the Search and Rescue
Team equipped with aircraft

00:17:54.187 --> 00:17:57.181
and helicopters starts
tracking the Soyuz capsule

00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:00.380
even before the very first
parachute is deployed

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:04.301
The helicopters land next to the capsule
 shortly after touch down

00:18:04.302 --> 00:18:06.512
and the team help the crew to exit

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.007
Finally, 70 cm above the ground,
the six retro rockets fire

00:18:11.015 --> 00:18:16.012
 to further reduce the capsule
speed to approximately 5 km/h

00:18:16.044 --> 00:18:19.004
The capsule hits the ground
 but the crew seats continue

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:24.512
moving down and shock absorbers help
to make the landing softer for the crew

00:18:26.925 --> 00:18:29.599
The soft landing is not really soft,

00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:34.635
You prepare for it by putting your arms
against your body, not touching

00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:39.794
any of the metallic parts, hold your books
against you, you are not talking

00:18:39.802 --> 00:18:44.151
not to put the tongue in the middle of your
teeth and you are lying there trying

00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:48.829
to be as inside your
 seat as well as you can

00:18:48.851 --> 00:18:52.557
and you are waiting for
 this "soft landing" to happen,

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:59.370
which for me felt like a head-on collision
between a truck and a small car

00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:03.724
and of course I was in the small car,
so when this happened it was like

00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:04.823
 BA-DA-BOOM!

00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:07.838
everything shook, I was
kind of shaking in there,

00:19:07.838 --> 00:19:11.885
everything was, and then...
silence everything was stopped

00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:17.329
So I looked a little bit around, I looked
 at my crew members and then I said:

00:19:17.452 --> 00:19:20.208
Hey guys,
 Welcome back to Earth!

00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:22.776
Once landed,
one of the first actions

00:19:22.776 --> 00:19:25.088
of the crew commander
 is to release

00:19:25.096 --> 00:19:28.386
one of the two ropes that connect
 the capsule to the parachute

00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:32.083
This is important, as  in
windy conditions, it prevents

00:19:32.094 --> 00:19:36.490
the capsule from being dragged away on
 the ground by the inflated parachute

00:19:37.772 --> 00:19:41.811
You know that you are on the ground,
you hear the voices of the rescue troops

00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:46.695
that are next to you and you know that 5
minutes later they will open up the hatch

00:19:46.695 --> 00:19:48.799
and you can breathe fresh air

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.643
The crew is now safely back on Earth

00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:55.068
They will soon be reunited with
 their families and begin

00:19:55.082 --> 00:20:00.154
the rehabilitation process,
after their extraordinary journey
