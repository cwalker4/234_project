00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:11.561
Sadhguru: Oh!

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.910
Sadhguru: He must be some inspiration to all of you

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:02.108
Sadhguru: About not drinking water

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:06.901
This must have happened to Abhilash

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.768
when he was on the ocean.

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:13.253
I want you to understand this.

00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:13.734
If

00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:19.611
Being on the ocean for maybe two months or three months

00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:21.317
all by yourself,

00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:23.565
one man boat,

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:29.465
means you really have to be in tune with what’s around you, many ways –

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.914
in some ways where you can logically understand,

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:33.951
in many ways that nobody understands

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:36.828
but they know it works like that.

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:40.978
Anybody who’s been at sea for long periods of time

00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:42.405
has this sense.

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:45.926
Anybody who’s flying for a certain period of time,

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:50.077
they have a sense with the wind and the air in a certain way

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:52.907
Not all of it is scientific knowledge,

00:01:52.907 --> 00:01:55.991
not all of it is intellectually correct

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.199
but they just know that’s how it is

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.478
and it always works that way

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:01.535
because

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.019
Like every other creature which lives in water,

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:08.997
they know things which no naval officer will know.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:10.947
A dolphin

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:11.943
or a whale

00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:13.117
or a shark

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:16.776
knows things about the ocean and water and its behavior

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:20.251
which no oceanographer knows in the world

00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.475
because it’s not an intellectual understanding,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.907
you’re part of that.

00:02:24.907 --> 00:02:26.711
So in some way,

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:31.881
someone who wants to go around the world in a boat all by himself,

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.901
in a sailboat,

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:35.678
without any engines or anything,

00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:38.760
obviously you get into tune with water around you,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.100
otherwise it wouldn’t really work for you.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.437
First of all,

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:45.058
you won’t mentally survive that.

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:47.213
Forget about physically making it,

00:02:47.213 --> 00:02:48.789
mentally you wouldn’t survive that

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.580
unless there is a certain affinity

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.499
between you and that element.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.869
So when you’re in such a state,

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.108
you know,

00:03:00.108 --> 00:03:02.163
particularly being in the ocean,

00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:03.540
largely being in the sun,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.113
The respiration process in the skin is greatly enhanced when you are

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:08.605
in a condition like that

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.341
and you’re on the water surface,

00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:14.235
so naturally humidity will be there.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.380
You are taking in water –

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.775
not through your mouth,

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:19.772
but you’re continuously taking in water.

00:03:19.772 --> 00:03:21.575
If you want to check,

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:23.541
you check your weight.

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:24.840
Get into the bathtub,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.731
sit there for half an hour and check your weight,

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.660
you will be certain number of grams higher

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.000
because body will take in water.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.220
So

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.422
No, I had some nasty joke,

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:44.703
let’s skip that

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:51.897
So, this body does soak up water,

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.005
either with contact

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.349
or with humidity in the air.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.855
So this ability may not be same from one person to another.

00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:03.821
One person may be doing it at a higher rate

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.097
than someone else.

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:11.718
And those of you getting all creamed up from head to toe,

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.055
you must know this that in many ways,

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:17.976
you’re taking away your contact with the existence.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.940
Grease up the entire skin,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.408
it won’t breathe.

00:04:24.408 --> 00:04:26.713
When it doesn’t breathe,

00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:29.856
its contact with air and water and world around you

00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:32.811
Your general sensitivity will go down.

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:34.319
Your neuronal system,

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.000
I mean your nervous system will lose its sensitivity

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.529
because the contact,

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.352
the outer… outermost contact is being blocked up.

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:48.722
So the entire world is taking to this of course now

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:50.275
to block themselves up

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:55.596
because they’ll… they’ll contact the world through the Facebook, of course

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.364
Even the bears are going on the Facebook I heard.

00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.096
Though

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.647
that’s different but anyway,

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:13.141
your need for water might have come down quite dramatically because

00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:14.577
the humid conditions

00:05:14.577 --> 00:05:18.570
and your own openness to the element could have done that and its

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.060
If you don’t feel thirsty,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.005
if you don’t drink water,

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.195
nothing is going to happen,

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.749
you’re going to be fine.

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.193
It’s only in America, you will die if you don’t drink water

00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:35.845
Nowhere else, people simply drink water.

00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:37.414
When they get thirsty, they drink water,

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:39.806
otherwise they’re fine even in a desert

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.945
It’s only in America, in cold climate,

00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:45.936
everybody is carrying a bottle and sipping continuously

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:50.118
because the marketing machines have done this to them,

00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:52.978
that they must drink lots of water.

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:55.287
Excessive consumption of water,

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:58.276
especially if it’s done in small sips,

00:05:58.276 --> 00:05:59.229
body absorbs.

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.179
When it absorbs,

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:01.266
the sodium levels,

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:06.259
which are very delicately balanced, will drop.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.225
Rest of the body also is affected

00:06:08.225 --> 00:06:10.482
but may not be s… so noticeable.

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:15.758
But in the brain, sodium levels dropping will lead to swelling of the brain.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:18.691
This does not mean your brain is growing.

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:19.793
It means

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:21.935
Swelling means it’s a kind of sickness,

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:22.824
okay.

00:06:22.824 --> 00:06:24.802
Not expansion of the brain,

00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:29.202
it’s swelling up because of lack of sodium content.

00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:31.694
Because there’s not enough sodium,

00:06:31.694 --> 00:06:34.034
more water goes into the brain

00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:38.505
trying to supply the required sodium to keep the balance.

00:06:38.505 --> 00:06:41.935
So more water in your brain means

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:44.075
you will slosh

00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:50.190
Psychological imbalances will come

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.422
when

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:53.286
when you manage to absorb.

00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:56.695
See, if you drink lots of water at one go,

00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:59.008
body will decide how much to absorb,

00:06:59.008 --> 00:07:00.705
how much to throw out.

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:04.227
But if you keep sipping through the day,

00:07:04.227 --> 00:07:05.944
body kind of gets deceived

00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:09.511
and tends to absorb more water than it should.

00:07:09.511 --> 00:07:12.599
But let’s say right now, you drink two liters of water,

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.773
all of it is not going to go into the system.

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:16.347
What is needed, it’ll take,

00:07:16.347 --> 00:07:18.744
rest of it will be shunted out.

00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:21.754
So

00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:26.044
not consuming water and being out there

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:28.599
is very much a possibility.

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.938
Nobody need to drink water simply

00:07:30.938 --> 00:07:33.250
because you think it’s a good thing to do.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.679
That is what the water bottling companies are telling you,

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:37.625
okay.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.376
When you feel thirsty, you must drink water.

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:43.989
Just to ensure you’re drinking enough,

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:47.947
drink ten percent more than what you actually need.

00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:50.537
Couple of cups more

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:53.243
just to ensure that you don’t drink less.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.828
If you’re not the kind

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.430
who is carrying a

00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:09.988
water bottle with you every minute of the day,

00:08:09.988 --> 00:08:12.843
then it’s good to drink little extra water

00:08:12.843 --> 00:08:15.199
so that when the need comes,

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.414
you have certain amount of time

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.183
before you can drink,

00:08:19.183 --> 00:08:21.036
that it’s not an emergency.

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:23.125
At the same time, when you need water,

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.779
when you’re thirsty if you don’t drink,

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:28.048
it’ll cause damage to the system.

00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:29.776
I would say –

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.458
this may be very controversial,

00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:40.454
the medical fraternity will for sure protest on this

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:46.527
but they will come to it after maybe twenty years or thirty years

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:50.448
I would say if everybody consumes good water

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:54.278
in sufficient quantity,

00:08:54.278 --> 00:09:00.268
fifty percent of the heart attacks in the world would come down.

00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:02.758
Damage to the heart is immense

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:09.311
when the water that is needed is not there in the system.

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:11.114
But when I say water,

00:09:11.114 --> 00:09:13.736
it is not just about drinking liquid water.

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:17.238
You must eat high water content foods.

00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:21.478
If you eat a fruit, it’s nearly ninety percent water.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:25.652
Vegetables and other things are over seventy percent water.

00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:30.589
Minimum seventy percent water content must be there in the food that you eat.

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:32.233
But in this part of the world –

00:09:32.233 --> 00:09:33.651
now it’s changing of course,

00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:36.247
people are becoming more conscious about these things,

00:09:36.247 --> 00:09:38.070
otherwise in this part of the world –

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.331
what people are eating is very dry food.

00:09:43.331 --> 00:09:46.030
Everything that is here is generally dry,

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.626
only now

00:09:47.626 --> 00:09:51.888
I think twenty-five years ago,

00:09:51.888 --> 00:09:53.539
in this part of the world,

00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:56.538
hardly people ate any vegetables.

00:09:56.538 --> 00:10:02.468
Vegetarians were beaten on the streets.

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:03.864
Yes!

00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:06.179
Being a vegetarian is a crime

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.180
because they think you’re weird

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.083
So, very low water content food you eat

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:17.943
and it goes and gets stuck in your… like concrete,

00:10:17.943 --> 00:10:19.405
it sits in your stomach.

00:10:19.405 --> 00:10:20.748
Now you drink water, water, water –

00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:23.176
that’s not going to help.

00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:25.425
You must eat high water content foods.

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:27.205
When you consume food,

00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:28.867
at least it must be level

00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:32.670
with the percentage of water content in your own body.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.896
So any food that you eat should be

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:39.703
at least seventy percent water content.

00:10:39.703 --> 00:10:41.556
So this is why

00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:44.189
vegetables, fruits must be part of your diet,

00:10:44.189 --> 00:10:45.615
so that it is there.

00:10:45.615 --> 00:10:48.222
You eat bread, I don’t know, it may be

00:10:48.222 --> 00:10:51.089
it’s just twenty, twenty-five percent water content

00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:53.807
or even less, depending on the type of bread you eat.

00:10:53.807 --> 00:10:56.207
If you eat meat, it’s very, very low water content.

00:10:56.207 --> 00:10:59.478
Cooked meat has very low water content.

00:10:59.478 --> 00:11:02.458
So when you’re on bread and meat,

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:04.690
you’ll have serious issues

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.182
and I’m telling you –

00:11:07.182 --> 00:11:13.307
doctors may think I am… I need water up here

00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:16.037
but they will come to this in twenty years, thirty years,

00:11:16.037 --> 00:11:17.928
whatever time they take –

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:22.493
I will tell you if they consume high water content foods,

00:11:22.493 --> 00:11:28.028
fifty percent of the cardiac deaths will go from the world.

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:30.171
People won’t die of heart attacks.

00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:33.007
One reason they’re dying of heart attacks is

00:11:33.007 --> 00:11:36.884
they’re eating very low water content foods.

00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:39.309
So people may say, “What about other countries?

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:41.480
Why are they dying in India?”

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.543
There also, the same has happened.

00:11:44.543 --> 00:11:46.541
What used to be traditional meals

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:48.799
and what they’re eating today,

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:50.819
it has changed dramatically

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:54.700
because they are also rule… ruled by commercial forces

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.332
who tell them what to eat.

00:11:57.332 --> 00:11:59.340
They won’t listen to their bodies,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.920
they look at the advertisement.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.228
The big hoarding

00:12:02.228 --> 00:12:05.599
or the television advertisement decides what you eat,

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:08.409
not what your body tells what to eat.

00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:13.570
So, not consuming water in certain situations is okay.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.344
But if there is an indication of thirst,

00:12:16.344 --> 00:12:18.073
you must drink water.

00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:20.669
It’s very necessary that you must drink water

00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:22.311
when there’s an indication of thirst

00:12:22.311 --> 00:12:24.501
because body has its own way.

00:12:24.501 --> 00:12:26.137
When it indicates you need water,

00:12:26.137 --> 00:12:29.029
you must give it water within twenty minutes

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:31.091
or at the most half an hour,

00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:34.761
you must drink substantial quantity of water.

00:12:34.761 --> 00:12:36.629
If you drink enough water,

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:38.900
then body will choose how much to take,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.822
how much to reject.

00:12:40.822 --> 00:12:42.842
what's the other question he asked?

00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:46.265
Sadhguru: Oh!

00:12:47.895 --> 00:12:51.436
Both the sun and the moon have

00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:54.105
vibrational impact

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:59.815
and also gravitational impact on the water.

00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:02.591
Only the gravitational impact of the water is noticed

00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.106
by most people because

00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:08.289
a sailor like Abhilash cannot sail

00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:10.901
Okay, that’s a small boat, it can sail anytime.

00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:12.606
But if you have a big ship,

00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:15.863
you cannot sail without the tide.

00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:19.853
You cannot leave the port without the tide.

00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:22.119
Right from ancient times,

00:13:22.119 --> 00:13:25.290
sailors have always looked for tide.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.806
Without the tide,

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.691
there is no question of sailing in the ocean –

00:13:29.691 --> 00:13:32.888
without the help of the tide.

00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:35.339
So understanding when it comes up,

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:38.158
when it goes down was very, very important.

00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:43.331
Generally, to put it in a very simple terms,

00:13:44.571 --> 00:13:46.707
though the

00:13:49.257 --> 00:13:49.871
See,

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.731
it’s the same gravitational pull,

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:56.006
which is managing Planet Earth and moon.

00:13:56.006 --> 00:14:00.972
But the centrifugal force

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:03.427
of the rotation

00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:07.776
and the gravitational force somehow are so perfectly balanced

00:14:07.776 --> 00:14:10.516
that they’re holding on together.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.441
But actually,

00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:14.420
the center of the mass is in one place,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.240
it’s not in two places.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.382
So it’s one gravity managing two bodies,

00:14:22.382 --> 00:14:24.166
two celestial bodies.

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:27.846
You know, Planet Earth is also a celestial body.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.026
It’s a heavenly body –

00:14:29.026 --> 00:14:30.038
you’re in heaven,

00:14:30.038 --> 00:14:33.135
missing the whole point

00:14:34.495 --> 00:14:35.706
If you were looking

00:14:35.706 --> 00:14:39.205
If you are standing on Planet Mars,

00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:42.335
Earth would look like heaven or no?

00:14:42.335 --> 00:14:43.806
It is a heavenly body

00:14:43.806 --> 00:14:46.851
and for sure the best planet on the

00:14:46.851 --> 00:14:48.970
in the system at least,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.925
in this solar system

00:14:50.925 --> 00:14:55.009
It is for sure heaven in this solar system, isn't it?

00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:58.186
Okay, we’re messing it up, that’s different but

00:14:58.186 --> 00:14:59.515
it can fix itself.

00:14:59.515 --> 00:15:03.015
If we vanish, it’ll fix itself pretty good.

00:15:03.015 --> 00:15:07.743
If fifty-sixty percent of the human beings disappear somewhere,

00:15:07.743 --> 00:15:09.416
let’s say they go to Mars

00:15:12.486 --> 00:15:15.151
you will see Planet Earth will

00:15:15.151 --> 00:15:16.960
just revitalize itself

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.601
and flourish in a big way

00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:21.601
because she still has water.

00:15:21.601 --> 00:15:24.893
Water has not been lost. You know,

00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:29.100
all of you are water bottles.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.121
You

00:15:30.121 --> 00:15:31.999
You’re little more than them

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:34.420
but

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.089
this is a water body, isn't it?

00:15:37.089 --> 00:15:37.951
Hmm?

00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:40.591
Seventy percent water, just shake and see

00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:43.653
So

00:15:44.773 --> 00:15:48.125
7.3 billion people.

00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:51.225
Let’s say on an average,

00:15:51.225 --> 00:15:53.824
all of them weigh sixty kilograms.

00:15:53.824 --> 00:15:56.124
I’m not taking into the heavyweights

00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:58.457
taking into account the heavyweights

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.004
but let’s say on an average,

00:16:00.004 --> 00:16:02.217
sixty kilograms everybody weighs.

00:16:02.217 --> 00:16:03.622
Out of sixty,

00:16:03.622 --> 00:16:05.989
at least forty kilograms of water,

00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:11.421
that means forty liters of water per person carrying.

00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:15.890
Forty liters into 7.3 billion,

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.381
how many liters?

00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:21.605
It’s almost an ocean by itself.

00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:22.892
So where is the water?

00:16:22.892 --> 00:16:24.978
It’s all here

00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:28.348
It’s never left the atmosphere and gone anywhere.

00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:31.786
The volume of water that was here a billion years ago

00:16:31.786 --> 00:16:33.292
is still here

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:39.366
but all in unworthy packages

00:16:44.496 --> 00:16:45.816
So

00:16:45.816 --> 00:16:48.326
the impact of the sun and the moon,

00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:51.405
the gravitational impact is noticed,

00:16:51.405 --> 00:16:56.735
but the reverberational impact is not largely felt by people.

00:16:56.735 --> 00:17:00.856
But the Eastern societies have seen this in a

00:17:00.856 --> 00:17:02.627
as an immense possibility

00:17:02.627 --> 00:17:04.169
and making use

00:17:04.169 --> 00:17:06.957
How to make use of pournami and amavasya

00:17:06.957 --> 00:17:09.076
or the full moon and the new moon

00:17:09.076 --> 00:17:11.589
is an entire process by itself.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.767
If you do not know this,

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:17.008
before the British came to India,

00:17:17.008 --> 00:17:21.538
pournami means or full moon means three days holiday.

00:17:21.538 --> 00:17:26.138
Amavasya means… New moon means two days holiday.

00:17:26.138 --> 00:17:29.110
So totally, five days holiday in a month.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.449
No Sunday, Monday and all this stuff,

00:17:31.449 --> 00:17:33.128
only by looking at the moon

00:17:33.128 --> 00:17:37.189
because this is not just arithmetic calculation,

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.583
this is a life-related thing that’s happening.

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:41.369
Whatever happens to the moon,

00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:42.598
whatever happens to the sun,

00:17:42.598 --> 00:17:43.921
whatever happens to the planet,

00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:45.838
happens to us

00:17:45.838 --> 00:17:47.724
and to be in tune with that,

00:17:47.724 --> 00:17:49.551
those days you’re not supposed to work.

00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:52.320
You use those days to stabilize yourself,

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.270
balance yourself,

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.596
raise yourself to higher possibilities

00:17:55.596 --> 00:17:58.356
and other days you go to work.

00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:01.736
So

00:18:03.886 --> 00:18:05.051
these two days

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.703
or even in between, in different phases,

00:18:06.703 --> 00:18:08.966
it has different ty… kind of impacts –

00:18:08.966 --> 00:18:13.861
what is generally noticed is rising of the water in the form of a tide.

00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:20.901
Suppose yesterday high tide was let’s say at 9:30

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:25.423
(Talks aside: We have few more minutes because we started late?)

00:18:25.423 --> 00:18:29.183
Yesterday it started at 9:30,

00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:32.225
today it will be at 10:20

00:18:32.225 --> 00:18:36.385
because there is a fifty minute lapse between the moon’s way of doing things

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:38.239
and the earth’s way of doing things.

00:18:38.239 --> 00:18:40.444
This does it in twenty-four hours,

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:42.704
that does it in twenty-four hours and fifty minutes,

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:47.564
so there’s approximately forty-eight to fifty minutes of difference in the ti… high tide

00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:49.828
from one day to the next.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:51.597
So, when you look at this,

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:53.714
every… every monthly, monthly cycle,

00:18:53.714 --> 00:18:56.997
it becomes a complex affair

00:18:56.997 --> 00:18:59.034
to calculate and to be

00:18:59.034 --> 00:19:02.710
Today of course, it’s all being done in a digital way

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.169
through the satellites,

00:19:04.169 --> 00:19:11.916
otherwise a sailor had to have a very complex kind of arrangement in his head

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:13.132
as to how this is

00:19:13.132 --> 00:19:14.194
because if you don’t know this,

00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:15.680
you won’t survive.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.110
Many

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.156
Almost every creature of the sea knows this very well

00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:25.706
and the birds which migrate know this very well

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:28.386
and there’re some incredible facts

00:19:28.386 --> 00:19:31.106
about the navigating birds which travel

00:19:31.106 --> 00:19:34.805
or which migrate during certain seasons and get back,

00:19:34.805 --> 00:19:38.804
as to how they manage this entire process.

00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:40.241
The water,

00:19:40.241 --> 00:19:43.845
the… the gravitational pull of the moon,

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:46.157
it affects the flying objects too,

00:19:46.157 --> 00:19:49.155
particularly when you’re flying on your own power,

00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:50.518
flapping your wings.

00:19:50.518 --> 00:19:53.513
Even slightest movement in the gravitation

00:19:53.513 --> 00:19:55.155
and the reverberation affects them.

00:19:55.155 --> 00:19:56.544
How they manage this,

00:19:56.544 --> 00:19:58.555
how they go through this

00:19:58.555 --> 00:20:01.153
is a very, very interesting story –

00:20:01.153 --> 00:20:02.306
not just birds,

00:20:02.306 --> 00:20:03.963
even insects

00:20:03.963 --> 00:20:06.896
because dragonflies in Southern India

00:20:06.896 --> 00:20:12.374
every year make a trip to East Africa and come back.

00:20:12.374 --> 00:20:13.730
How’s that for you?

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.676
Safari

00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:18.728
Dragonfly, this big

00:20:18.728 --> 00:20:23.060
every year, they go all the way to East Africa,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.473
breed there,

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:25.943
then come up

00:20:25.943 --> 00:20:30.380
and multiply their numbers about three or four times

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.018
and come back to India

00:20:36.828 --> 00:20:38.318
And they know the way,

00:20:38.318 --> 00:20:40.057
they’ve never missed the way.

00:20:40.057 --> 00:20:42.803
All the way they go and come back every time.

00:20:42.803 --> 00:20:44.022
But now,

00:20:44.022 --> 00:20:48.226
the navigational activity on the big ships and airplanes,

00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:49.795
they’re disturbing them

00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:52.138
and many of them are losing their way

00:20:52.138 --> 00:20:53.939
because the reverberations have changed.

00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:57.210
One big jet goes and it completely disturbs

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.210
and freaks their ability to navigate.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.700
That’s happening to I think every creature,

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.050
including human beings,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.840
that whatever we were capable of naturally

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.750
is all going away

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.780
because of too many gadgets doing things

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.192
and too many vibrations happening around us,

00:21:13.192 --> 00:21:15.884
sensitivity will become less and less.

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:18.833
About the influence on the human mind,

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:20.510
human body –

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.815
the maximum impact of these planetary objects

00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:26.284
upon water

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:29.094
and the maximum impact is on the human being,

00:21:29.094 --> 00:21:30.830
not on the other creatures

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.573
because we are vertical in our spine.

00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:36.415
If we were like this

00:21:36.415 --> 00:21:38.843
it wouldn’t impact us to the same extent.

00:21:38.843 --> 00:21:40.667
Because we are like this

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:42.835
we are a stand-up bottle,

00:21:42.835 --> 00:21:45.201
because of that the pull is big

00:21:45.201 --> 00:21:49.190
and the rise of the water affects us quite substantially.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.220
We know that

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.013
it disturbs certain people,

00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:56.990
certain people get headaches on full moon days,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.238
some people get mentally disturbed

00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:00.624
and all these things.

00:22:00.624 --> 00:22:02.796
The moon or the position of the moon

00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:05.176
or the gravitational impact of the moon

00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:07.616
does not cause either mental imbalance

00:22:07.616 --> 00:22:08.866
or headache

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:10.310
or any other problem.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.557
It only rises,

00:22:12.557 --> 00:22:15.347
it only enhances you on that day

00:22:15.347 --> 00:22:19.393
because there is more pressure upon your brain,

00:22:19.393 --> 00:22:22.987
there is more flow of fluids into the brain.

00:22:22.987 --> 00:22:25.466
If you are loving,

00:22:25.466 --> 00:22:28.586
you’ll become far more loving.

00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:29.994
If you’re joyful,

00:22:29.994 --> 00:22:32.177
you become far more joyful.

00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:33.525
If you’re miserable,

00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:35.430
you become far more miserable.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.309
if you’re meditative, you become far more meditative.

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:41.496
If you’re mad, you become far more mad.

00:22:41.496 --> 00:22:44.296
It is not trying to bring any particular quality,

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:47.955
it is just that the waters are rising.

00:22:47.955 --> 00:22:48.936
Because of that,

00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:52.427
whatever is your quality right now gets enhanced.

00:22:52.427 --> 00:22:56.578
So, the impact of

00:22:56.578 --> 00:23:02.501
different positions of the moon and sun upon the human body is phenomenal.

00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:05.109
If we go into the details of it,

00:23:05.109 --> 00:23:07.067
it’s an entire process of itself.

00:23:07.067 --> 00:23:08.149
As I said,

00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:13.278
generally people are noticing only the gravitational impact upon the water

00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:15.315
but not the vibrational impact.

00:23:15.315 --> 00:23:16.199
But today,

00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:18.839
there are lots of studies telling you that

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:21.083
if you create different kinds of vibrations

00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:23.352
or different kind of sounds,

00:23:23.352 --> 00:23:25.569
the water responds in different ways.

00:23:25.569 --> 00:23:27.919
I don’t know if we have that video with us.

00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:30.999
(Talks aside: Do we? Can we play this?)

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:34.868
So, depending upon the type of sounds we create,

00:23:34.868 --> 00:23:38.271
accordingly the water takes on different shapes and forms

00:23:38.271 --> 00:23:39.123
and patterns,

00:23:39.123 --> 00:23:42.257
which are very geometrically correct kind of patterns

00:23:42.257 --> 00:23:44.511
for different sounds.

00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:47.660
And you know that

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.972
the Sheffield University first did this a few years ago,

00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:52.675
now people are telling me

00:23:52.675 --> 00:23:55.837
NASA has published something,

00:23:55.837 --> 00:23:57.475
that talking about

00:23:57.475 --> 00:24:00.483
they recorded the sound of the sun.

00:24:00.483 --> 00:24:01.884
Have you heard about this?

00:24:01.884 --> 00:24:03.014
Hmm?

00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:06.786
So clearly, sound Aum is coming.

00:24:06.786 --> 00:24:10.365
So these things are not new to us,

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:13.063
these things something we have noticed

00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:17.564
because every cell in this body is solar-powered,

00:24:17.564 --> 00:24:19.181
okay.

00:24:19.181 --> 00:24:21.255
You may call it so many things

00:24:21.255 --> 00:24:22.516
but essentially,

00:24:22.516 --> 00:24:24.037
whether you burn coal

00:24:24.037 --> 00:24:26.764
or you burn diesel or petrol

00:24:26.764 --> 00:24:28.329
or nuclear energy,

00:24:28.329 --> 00:24:30.151
whatever the hell you do,

00:24:30.151 --> 00:24:34.665
essentially all of it is solar energy converted and stored in different ways, isn't it?

00:24:34.665 --> 00:24:36.566
If there’s no sun,

00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:39.528
there would be no hydrocarbons for sure,

00:24:39.528 --> 00:24:42.137
there’s no question about that.

00:24:42.137 --> 00:24:43.137
So, the reverberations of… Yeah

00:24:43.137 --> 00:24:44.856
So everything that’s happening in nature,

00:24:44.856 --> 00:24:46.941
whatever shapes and forms that

00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:50.290
different life forms are taking

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:55.292
is essentially largely related to how the water reverberates,

00:24:55.292 --> 00:24:56.964
including yourself.

00:24:56.964 --> 00:24:59.314
How the water is reverberating within yourself,

00:24:59.314 --> 00:25:01.291
that is the kind of form.

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:05.295
Both the physical form and the psychological form that you take

00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:10.293
is largely dependent upon this and thank you very much
