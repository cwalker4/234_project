00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.380
On May 9th, 1967

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.340
11 year old Joel Hoag and his 13 year old brother, William, came home covered in mud

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.560
The brothers were 2 of 11 children

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.620
and they lived in Mark Twains hometown

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.060
Hannibal, Missouri

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.660
When their parents asked why they were so muddy

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.880
the boys explained that they were doing some cave exploring

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.000
their parents scolded them, and the next day when they wanted to go out and play

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840
they were told they weren't allow to leave the backyard.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.820
but sadly, boys will be boys,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.260
and the 2 Hoag brothers left the backyard.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.480
the brothers were last seen by firefighters heading towards a cave on the south side of Hannibal

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.900
with shovels and a flashlight

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.660
When the family didn't find the boys in the backyard, they searched the neighborhood for them

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.960
The weren't found in the neighborhood so they contacted the police

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.920
and a larger search was launched

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.680
Around the same time that the police started searching for the Hoag brothers,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.880
the parents of another boy in Hannibal realise that he was missing

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.660
14 year old Craig Dowell was an acquaintance of the Hoag brothers

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.660
and a few witnesses thought that they saw him with the Hoags as they walked towards the cave

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.000
There were 2 problems facing the searchers.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.460
The first was that the caves were a series of tunnels

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.860
and in the tunnels there were several deep pools of water and steep drop-offs

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.440
The second problem was thanks to nearby construction,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.360
there was a cave-in in the area where the boys were last seen

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.920
The initial conclusion was that the boys got trapped in the tunnel after the cave-in.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.700
Expert cave searchers and skin divers from around the country came to Hannibal and helped search for the boys for 38 days

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.220
but no trace of them has ever been found

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.120
39 years after the disappearance,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.700
a construction project caused a new entrance to open up on the tunnel

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.760
and on one of the walls someone had painted an arrow

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.680
the families were hoping that it was a tunnel that had not been searched

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.300
the tunnel was searched

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.020
But again, there was no trace of the 3 boys

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.740
Since absolutely no trace of the boys' bodies

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.440
or any other equipment that they had with them on the day that they went missing has ever been found

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.300
it has led to some speculation that the boys aren't in the tunnels at all

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.940
and they were kidnapped instead

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.940
but again, there's no physical evidence to back up that theory either

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.340
and the whereabouts of the boys, remains a mystery

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.860
In the early 1977,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.680
29 years old Leslie Guthrie and her husband, Tim Senior,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.200
were living apart.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.880
Tim Senior was living in Katonah, New York

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.040
and Leslie was living with her mother, and the couple's 2 children in nearby White Plains

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.480
although the couple was split up,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.160
they still had amicable relationship

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.720
At 1:30 on the afternoon of February 5th, 1977

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.760
Leslie picked up her daughter Julie, who was 6

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.160
and her son, Timothy, who was 3

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.400
at their father's home

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.280
and they drove off in Leslie's 1974, green Ford Maverick that had a white roof

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.080
and that was the last time any of their family ever saw them again

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.080
in over 40 years, not even their car has been found

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.340
At first, the police thought the most logical explanation was that the car crashed into one of the lakes

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.000
that are beside the highway that leads from Katonah to White Plains

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.820
and the car is still submerged

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.380
But according to historical weather forecast,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.000
1977 was a cold Winter in that part of New York

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.420
and the ice of the lakes would have been thick enough for a car to drive on

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.620
The next theory was that Tim Senior was responsible for their disappearance

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.280
After all, he was the last person to see them alive

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.220
The police quickly ruled him out as a suspect

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.860
and in the ensuing years he spent his life savings hiring private investigators

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.980
and personally following up on tips and possible leads

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.540
The police thought that it was possible that since their bodies

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.540
and car weren't found that they are still alive

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.320
and either chose, or were forced to disappear

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.220
Just a year after they disappeared,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.660
a tabloid newspaper published a story about a hermit who lived in Utah, near the Arizona border,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.420
with several wives

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.020
There was a picture of the wives, and one of the women looked like Leslie

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.480
and in the captioned it said that the woman's name was Leslie

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.360
The woman in the picture looked enough like Leslie,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.540
that Tim Senior and a detective flew out to Utah to check out the hermit and his wives

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.620
by the time that they got there, the hermit and his wives had left the area

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.220
and no one knew where they went

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.820
Over the past 40 years

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.340
there have been several sightings of Leslie

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.300
but non of them have ever been confirmed

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.700
and there had been no sightings of the children

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.180
If they are still alive, at the time of this video

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.980
Leslie would be 69

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.800
Julie would be 46

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.140
and Timothy Jr. would be 43

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.880
On July 29th, 1965

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.180
3 men armed with guns stormed into a bank in Gothenburg, Sweden

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.520
They were dressed in women's clothes and they had blonde wigs on them

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.580
One of the robbers watched the door while the other two walked into the bank, firing wildly into the ceiling

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.060
which sent many of the employees and customers scurrying for cover

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.560
One of the customers didn't flee, and instead, he tried to wrestle the gun away from one of the robbers

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.300
and the robber ended up shooting himself in the leg

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.760
after robbing the bank, they ran to a nearby river and discarded their disguises

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.180
underneath women's clothes, they were wearing wet-suits

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.220
the plan was to jump into the water and swim to a getaway boat

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.140
but they were all arrested before making it to the boat

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.740
Later the same night in Gothenburg,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.460
the family of 16 year old Kjell Åke Johansson became worried when he didn't come home

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.660
and, over the next several days

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.940
the families of 22 year old Gay Karlsson, and 21 year old Jan Olof Dahlsjö

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.300
also noticed that they were missing

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.740
The 3 young men were acquaintances and worked together

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.700
Months later, the authorities realised that they were all together when they went missing

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.400
They were all seen in a midnight blue, 1956 Volvo PV444 on the day of the robbery

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.660
The young men in the car, have never been found

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.420
But the story only gets weirder from there

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.440
In July 1965, Hübner Lundqvist was hitchhiking from Skåne to Lysekil

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.020
and when his parents didn't hear from him after a few weeks, they contacted the police

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.520
The last time the Lundqvist family heard from him was a postcard that was mailed form Gothenburg on July 29th

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.780
which is the same day that the 3 young men disappeared

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.520
and it was the same day as the robbery

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.260
this has led people to speculate that the 4 disappearances and the robbery are all connected

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.140
One theory is that the young men saw the robbers prepping for the heist

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.840
and the robbers killed them to keep them quiet

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.460
Another possibility is that the 3 young men were actually involved in the robbery

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.280
and chose to disappear when it went wrong

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.120
Lundqvist may have either been killed by the 6 of them

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.200
or he wasn't involved and his disappearance is a total coincidence

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.620
Or it is wholly possible that the disappearances of the 3 young men and Lundqvist

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.320
and the robbery aren't connected at all

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.400
Perhaps the 3 young men got into a car accident in a remote area

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.740
or crashed into the water, and their car just hasn't been found

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.880
Lundqvist was hitchhiking,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.460
so it's either possible that he was in the car with them

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.360
It's also possible that Lundqvist is still alive

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.600
There are 2 people who said that they saw Lundqvist after he disappeared

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.840
but their claims have never been verified

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.420
and he has never returned home or contacted any friends or family

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:13.220
Sadly, the families of the 4 young men have been waiting over 50 years to find out what happend to them

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.820
but they are no closer to any answers

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.040
The Jack family of Prince George, British Columbia were young

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.480
aboriginal family that were struggling to make ends meet

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.060
On the night of August 1st, 1989

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.340
the family's patriarch, 24 year old Ronald Jack

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.680
was seen talking to a Caucasian man at a local pub

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.780
after talking for a little bit, Ronald left the pub with the man

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.920
Ronald then went home and told his wife,

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.580
26 year old Doreen

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.240
that he had got them jobs at a logging camp out of town

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.200
They were apparently great jobs that included day care

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.400
but in order to get the jobs, they had to leave that night

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.220
So they gathered up some of their belongings, and got their two sons,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.580
9 year old Russel, and 4 year old Ryan into the car,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.260
and then they drove off

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.320
At about 1:30 AM, Ronald called his mother and told her about the jobs

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.340
Ronald told his mother some details about the jobs

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.900
but he didn't say where the camp was located

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.460
He also said that the family would be gone for 10 days to 2 weeks

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.460
Tragically, that was the last time anyone heard from the family

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.860
After the call, they disappeared and not even their car has been found

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.340
After the family was reported missing,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:36.220
the police went to their home in Prince George and it looked like the family planned to return after a short time

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.180
Next they traced the call that Ronald made to his mother

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.780
and they learned that the call was placed 30 miles away from Prince George, near Bednesti Lake

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.340
But in terms of clues, that was it, and the case quickly froze over

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.900
Nearly 7 years later, on January 28th, 1996

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.260
the Prince George police department received a call from an anonymous man

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.620
the voice was muffled and it was hard to hear

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.020
but the man said that the family was buried at the end of a ranch

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.280
after cleaning up the audio, they couldn't say for sure, but they thought that the caller said Gordie's ranch

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.740
Based on the call the police did end up searching a ranch, but there was no trace of the family

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.520
They also traced this call and it came from a home about an hour away from Prince George

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.560
On the night that the call was made there was a party happening at the house

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.520
The party guests were interviewed but they all claimed that they didn't know who made the call

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.200
Where the Jack family went missing suggests that they may have been victims of foul play

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.740
They were heading West on British Columbia, Highway 16

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.400
on a stretch of highway infamously known as the Highway of Tears

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.900
The Highway of Tears is a stretch of 450 miles of Highway 16

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.900
that runs between the cities of Prince George and Prince Rupert

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.800
Since 1969,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.360
9 confirmed women have gone missing or were murdered while hitchhiking on Highway 16

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.860
But Highway 16 isn't the only deadly highway in that area of British Columbia

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.140
On Highways 5 and 97,

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.720
there are another 9 confirmed missing or murdered women

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.040
However, many people think that the number of victims is actually much higher than that

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.820
quite possibly in the 40s

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.020
and that includes the Jacks

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.060
Many of the victims are aboriginal women

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.220
and for years neither of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.720
nor the Canadian government put a lot of effort into solving these cases

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.680
For example, Stephen Harper

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.040
who was Canada's prime minister from February 2006 to November 2015

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.640
continuously rejected pleas for an inquest into the missing and murdered women

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.460
When Harper was asked to doing an inquest into the missing and murdered aboriginal women,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.060
in the run up to the 2015 election,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.100
he said,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.620
"Um it, it isn’t really high on our radar, to be honest.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.380
You know, our ministers will continue to dialogue,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:56.880
ah,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.380
with,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:57.880
ah,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.020
those who are concerned about this."

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.160
Despite indifference from the government,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.440
in 2012,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.800
the RCMP announced that they have a suspect for some of the Highway of Tears murders

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.880
and he was quite possibly the person who is responsible for the disappearance of the Jacks

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:20.920
His name was Bobby Jack Fowler and he was a transient who traveled extensively through the United States and Canada for over 40 years

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.700
In 2002, the RCMP announced that Fowler's DNA had been linked to one of the cold cases from 1974

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:34.220
16 year old Colleen MacMillen was last seen hitchhiking on Highway 97 in August 1974

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.720
and her body was found a month later

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.820
Unfortunately, by the time the police learned that Fowler was MacMillen's killer, he had been dead for 6 years

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:50.920
He died in prison in 2006 while serving the 10th year of a 16 year sentence for raping a woman he met at a bar

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.680
The question is,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.980
was Fowler the man who was seen talking to Ronald Jack on the night that he disappeared?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.780
That question may never be answered with certainty

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.680
because it's unclear where Fowler was in 1989

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.920
and the police are still trying to piece together his past

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.260
Fowler would move from town to town,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.780
sometimes staying no more than a day

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.680
He lived in rundown motels and made money by doing odd jobs

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.360
The police in Canada and The United States

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.420
think it's possible that Fowler is responsible for over 20 murders

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.500
That being said,

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.420
it's not possible that Fowler is responsible for all the Highway of Tears murders,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.860
because at least 3 happened after 1996

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.560
which is when he was incarcerated for rape

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.980
Meaning there is at least one other killer who used the interior of British Columbia as their hunting grounds

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.980
and they are still possibly free today

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.160
On the morning of July 2nd, 1966

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.840
21 year old Ann Miller picked up her two friends,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.760
19 year old Patricia Blough

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.380
and 19 year old Renee Bruhl

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.380
at their Chicago area homes

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.940
Bruhl and Blough were friends from high school

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.340
and they met Miller because the women all boarded their horses at the same stable

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.000
They were heading to the beach at the Indiana dunes

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.280
which is about an hour's drive from Chicago

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.780
and is on the shores of lake Michigan

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.160
The women arrived at the beach at about 10 AM

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.780
and since it was a hot day,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.980
and it was the Saturday of a long weekend,

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.640
the beach was very busy

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.920
Many hours later, as the sun started to set

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.140
the young couple on the beach flagged down a park ranger

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.720
The couple told the ranger that they saw three young women go into the water at about noon

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.640
and while in the water, they talked to a man on a boat

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.900
Another set of witnesses described the man as well tanned

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.620
in his early 20s with dark wavy hair

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.420
The boat had three hulls,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420
an airborne motor,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.960
and it was about 16 - 18 feet long

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.220
and it was white with a blue interior

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.440
The three women boarded the boat but they didn't return

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.960
and their belongings were still lying on the beach

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.120
On the blanket were the women's purses, shoes, and clothes

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.840
The ranger gathered up the belongings and took it to the rangers office where they were forgotten about

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.180
because it was a busy long weekend

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.880
2 days later,

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.540
the rangers office got a call from Renee Bruhl's father and he sounded panicked

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.340
The ranger checked the belongings

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:21.500
and found the set of car keys that belonged to a car that was in the parking lot that had not moved since Saturday

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.540
The ranger called the Chicago police and found out that the car belonged to Ann Miller

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.700
He also learned that Miller and her two friends had been reported missing 2 days earlier

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.860
Searches were conducted on both land and the waters of lake Michigan

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.040
but at this point, the young women had been missing for 48 hours

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.940
During those 48 hours,

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.040
thousands of people visited the beach

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.540
so finding any possible clue at the scene of their disappearance was impossible

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.920
At first, the police and the rangers thought that the boat that the women were on sank

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.960
Not far from where they were last seen,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.360
searchers found pieces of what they believed to be seats of a boat

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.160
some oil in gas cans,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.300
and also a piece of wood

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.440
but it was hard to tell how long the debris from the boat had been in the water

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.160
the coast guard had no records of a boat going missing that day

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.980
also, two of the women were very strong swimmers

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.600
so the police don't think that they drowned

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.360
The next theory is that the women wanted to disappear

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.100
Out of the three women

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.120
only Renee Bruhl was married

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.280
In her purse that was found on the beach was a letter addressed to her husband of 15 months

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.200
Bruhl wrote that she was leaving him because he spent too much time working on his cars

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.060
and hung out with his friends too much

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.280
the letter was dated two weeks before she disappeared

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.000
and it is unclear why she never gave it to her husband

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
the husband was interviewed and he said that he had no idea that she was unhappy

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.400
Bruhl's family thinks that she may have written the letter in a fit of anger then decided not to give it to her husband

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.620
She may have even forgotten that it was in her purse

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.340
The police concluded that all three women had personal problems

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.320
but nothing serious enough to fake their death over

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:09.600
If the three women didn't drown, and didn't chose to disappear, they may have met with foul play

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.980
If they did meet with foul play, then there are two very different sets of suspects

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.360
The first set of suspects are a pair of abortionists

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.200
Just before the three women disappeared, Miller told friends that she was three months pregnant

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.960
Patricia Blough may have also been pregnant

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.980
at the time, abortion was illegal in Illinois

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.860
so it's possible the women went to Indiana to meet a husband and wife team

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.340
named Helen and Frank Largo to perform black market abortions

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.480
On the day that the women went missing,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.920
the nephew of the Largos was at the same beach,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.900
and he matched the description of the man seen on the boat

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.060
The theory is that the nephew picked up the girls at the beach

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.180
and then took them to a house boat where the Largos performed the abortions

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.940
They think that something went wrong

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.060
and all three women were killed to ensure that they would stay quiet

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.580
and that their bodies were dumped in the river

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:05.440
This is only speculation and there is no evidence implicating the Largos in the murder of the three women

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.700
The second theory of who may have killed the three women

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.380
is based on the stable where the women kept their horses

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.100
4 months before she disappeared,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:20.220
friends and family of  Patricia Blough noticed injury on her face which could have been caused by a fist

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.380
When she was asked about the injury,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.980
she said she was having some problems with some syndicate people

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.660
How this is linked to the stable is that the stable was owned by a man named George Jayne

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.000
His maternal half brother was a rival horse breeder and a stable owner named Silas Jayne

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.720
who went by Si

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.220
Si thought of himself as a businessman,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.600
but he was actually more of a psychotic gangster

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.040
than a businessman

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.500
Specifically he was the head of a criminal network called the Horse Syndicate

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.800
The criminal network consisted of riders,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.180
trainers, owners, and veterinarians

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.040
who developed plans to kill horses

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.280
to collect insurance money

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.480
Si hated George because in 1961,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.380
one of George's horses beat one of his in a competition

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.160
After the lost, Si swore that he would kill his half brother

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:17.320
In June 1965, George asked a riding instructor named Cherie Rude to run an errand for him and to take his car

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.080
When Rude started the car, a car bomb exploded and she was killed instantly

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.820
The police knew that Si planted the bomb but they couldn't prove it

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.080
Since the bomb was planted at the stables

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.860
where Miller, Bruhl, and Blough boarded their horses,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.260
the theory is that one or all three women saw something that they shouldn't have

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.460
and they were killed to silence them

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.260
Besides trying to kill his brother,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:45.520
Si did have a reputation for violence, and he has been linked to some of Chicago's most notorious crimes

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.720
Si's criminal history dates back to when he was just 17 years old

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.940
He was convicted of rape and sent to a state reformatory for a year

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.600
The first major crime that he was connected to as an adult was the murder of 14 year old Robert Peterson,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.300
and two brothers, 13 year old John, and 11 year old Anton Schuessler

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.920
On October 16th, 1955

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.520
the boys went to downtown Chicago to see a movie and they didn't return home

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.340
Their nude bodies were found 2 days later

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.320
They had been severely beaten and strangled

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.140
While the case wouldn't be solved until 1994,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.860
what happened was that the boys were hitchhiking

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.180
and they were picked up by a horse trainer named Kenneth Hansen

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.820
Hansen took the three boys to Si's stable

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.700
where he was an employee

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.260
Once at the farm, he killed all three boys

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.320
and then Si apparently waked in on the murders

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.600
Si was worried that the scandal would ruin his reputation

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.060
so he helped Hansen dump the bodies

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.560
Then, 8 months later, the stable where the murders took place just happen to catch fire

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.200
It's believed that Si ordered the fire to be started

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.200
to destroy any evidence of the murders

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.200
and for the insurance money

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.600
Then, over the next 10 years,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.040
Si continued to threaten and harass his half brother

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.100
He also hired several people to kill him

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.600
In 1966

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.280
One of the men who Si asked to kill his half brother

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.420
went to the police but when it came time to testify against him in court,

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.780
the man said that he had amnesia

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.920
the man was sent to jail for 30 days for contempt and Si was acquitted

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.400
Obviously, George was nervous and feared for his own life so he had a tracker placed on Si's car

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.060
On January 19th, 1969

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.440
George had 28 year old Frank Michelle

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.480
who was the son of one of his employees

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.980
go to Si's house and change the battery on the tracker

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.760
Hours later, Michelle would be dead

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.840
According to Si, he was watching TV when someone rang the doorbell

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.960
He grabbed a gun and asked who was at the door

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.780
Si said the man fired three shots into the door

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.460
so he fired back.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:22:00.280
Si then went upstairs, grabbed two more guns including an M1 rifle and continued to fire at Michelle from the second floor as he was trying to flee

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.840
Si then walked outside and found Michelle bleeding to death

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.220
From 8 feet away, he fired his rifle twice killing the already dying man

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.020
The shooting was ruled self defense and Silas was never charged

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.680
On October 28, 1970

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.920
Si finally managed to kill his half brother George

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.780
As George was playing cards in his home with his family on his son's 16th birthday,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.940
a bullet fired by a hitman hired by Si came through a window

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.100
and he was fatally wounded

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.460
Si was arrested, and in 1973 he was only convicted of conspiracy to commit murder

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.460
and not the murder itself

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.300
He was given a sentence of 6 - 20 years in prison

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.540
and he served under 7 years

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.600
Si was released from prison in 1979

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.900
and he died from leukemia on July 13th 1987

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.340
After Si was dead and there were no longer the fear of appraisals,

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.860
witnesses started to come forward about crimes that Si and the syndicate were responsible for

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.780
One crime that tied all the syndicate crimes together

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.240
is one that they might not have committed

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.020
That's the case of 65 year old candy heiress Helen Brach

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.900
who was last seen alive on February 17th, 1977

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.240
leaving the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.620
Jack Matlick who worked as her chauffeur and houseman

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:24.460
claims that she was home for a few days and then he drove her to the airport so she could go to Florida

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.540
He didn't report her missing for two weeks

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.220
and during that time he had two rooms repainted in Brach's home

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.140
and the carpet in one of the rooms was replaced

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.840
He took two polygraph tests about her whereabouts and he failed both of them

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.680
He also admitted he got into a fight with her before she disappeared and that he stole money from her

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.540
What's interesting is that the investigation led to a second suspect,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.540
a gigolo and a horse seller named Richard Bailey

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.220
Bailey's business partner in the horse business was Si's nephew

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.360
Frank Jayne

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.560
Bailey had been dating Brach at the time of her disappearance

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.960
and he was selling her horses at inflated prices

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.540
The police thought that Brach found out that Bailey was swindling her

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.720
and she was going to tell the police

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.600
The police said that Bailey arranged to have her killed

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.720
quite possibly on the orders of Si

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.800
who was in prison at the time

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.600
In 1995, Bailey pleaded guilty to 16 counts of racketeering and fraud

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.680
but he denied swindling Brach

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.240
and he swore that he didn't have her killed

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.300
Amazingly

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.800
even though Bailey wasn't charged with Brach's murder,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.580
the judge thought that it was more probable that he committed the murder than not

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.620
so he sentenced Bailey to 30 years in prison

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.900
Bailey has been in prison ever since

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.160
and in 2017 he asked for a clemency hearing.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:46.660
Matlick was never charged in conduction with the disappearance of Brach and he died in a nursing home in 2011

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.720
Investigation to Brach's disappearance have covered more of the syndicate's crimes

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.680
which includes killing horses in horrific ways for insurance money

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.640
It also led to Kenneth Hansen being charged in 1994

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.820
with the 1955 murders of Robert Peterson, and John and Anton Schuessler

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.720
During the 39 years that he spent free

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.180
it's suspected that he has abused hundreds of other boys and teenagers

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.220
He was convicted of all three murders in 1995 and he appealed the convictions

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.380
He went to trial again in 2000 and he was found guilty yet again

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.620
Hansen died in prison in 2007

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.300
Today it is unclear if Silas Jayne

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.200
or anyone else involved with the horse syndicate is responsible for the disappearances of Ann Miller,

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.300
Patricia Blough, and Renee Bruhl

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.460
and the case is currently cold
