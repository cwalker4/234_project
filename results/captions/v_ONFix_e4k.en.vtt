00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:09.460
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:14.285
On February, 8, 2012,
my father passed away.

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.726
The truth is that was the day
his heart stopped beating.

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.606
For all intents and purposes,
my father had died years earlier.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:26.926
It started with memory lapses,

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.805
and as time went on,
his memory failed more and more,

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:31.975
and it got to the point
where he didn't know

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:34.356
his own kids who came in to see him.

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:36.175
His personality changed,

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:39.087
and his ability to take care
of himself was completely gone.

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:40.866
And...

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:46.687
If you could make a list of all the things
that could ever happen to you,

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:50.566
the very last thing on your list,
at the very bottom of the list,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.687
the thing you want the least
is Alzheimer's disease,

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:56.597
because when you lose your memory,
you lose everything.

00:00:57.327 --> 00:00:59.468
You lose everyone
who ever mattered to you.

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:04.156
If you could look into the brain
of a person who has this disease,

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:12.399
what you see is, between the brain cells
are these unusual looking structures.

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:16.146
Beta-amyloid protein
comes out of the cells,

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:20.558
and it accumulates
in these little meatball-like structures

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:24.158
that are in front of you,
on a microscopic slide.

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:26.768
They shouldn't be there,

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:29.179
and they are a hallmark
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:33.859
This disease affects about half
of Americans by their mid 80s.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.459
You could say to your doctor,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.088
"OK, I don't want that.
What can I do to stop that?"

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:43.692
Your doctor will say,
"Well, its old age and it's genetics."

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.998
There's a gene - it's called
the APOE-[epsilon]4 allele.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.283
If you have this gene
from one parent, your risk is tripled;

00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:53.689
if you got it from both parents,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.319
your risk is 10 to 15 times
higher than it was before.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:00.349
What's the answer? Get new parents?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.120
No, I don't think so. That's not it.

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.627
So, I'm sorry: it's old age,
it's genes, period, that's it;

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:09.658
there's not a darn thing you can do
just wait for it to happen.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.881
Or maybe not.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.740
In Chicago, researchers
started something called

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.956
the Chicago Health and Ageing Project.

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:19.569
What they did was they looked
at what people in Chicago were eating.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.329
They did very careful dietary records
in hundreds and hundreds of people,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.870
and then they started to see
who, as the years go by,

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.310
stayed mentally clear,
and who developed dementia.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.516
The first thing they keyed in on

00:02:34.517 --> 00:02:38.930
was something that I knew about as a kid
growing up in Fargo, North Dakota -

00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.979
My mom had five kids, we would run
down to the kitchen to the smell of bacon.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.600
My mom would take a fork,

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:47.999
and she'd stick it into the frying pan
and pull the hot bacon strips out

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.989
and put them on
a paper towel to cool down,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.150
and when all the bacon was out of the pan,
she would carefully lift up that hot pan

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.860
and pour the grease
into a jar to save it -

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.590
that's good bacon grease,
you don't want to lose that!

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:03.640
My mother would take that jar,

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.190
and she would put it

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:09.190
not in the refrigerator
but she'd put it on the shelf,

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.201
because my mother knew
that as bacon grease cools down,

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:13.451
what happens to it?

00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:14.700
It solidifies.

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.880
And the fact that it's solid
at room temperature

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:22.960
is a sign that bacon grease
is loaded with saturated fat, bad fat.

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:25.631
We've known for a long time
that that raises cholesterol,

00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:27.421
and there's a lot of in bacon grease.

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:28.851
And by the way, the next day,

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.642
she'd spoon it back
into the frying pan and fry eggs in it;

00:03:31.643 --> 00:03:34.121
it's amazing any of her children
lived to adulthood.

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:35.442
That's the way we lived.

00:03:35.443 --> 00:03:38.314
The number one source of saturated fat
is actually not bacon,

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:41.442
it's dairy products,
cheese, and milk, and so forth;

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:43.110
and meat is number two.

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:46.600
In Chicago, some people ate
relatively little saturated fat,

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.700
around 13 grams a day,

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.502
and others ate about twice that much,

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:54.614
and the researchers just looked
at who developed Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:56.123
And can I show you the figures?

00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:58.469
Here's the low group,
and there is the high group.

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.202
In other words, if you are avoiding
the bad fat, your risk was pretty low,

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:05.712
but if you were tucking
into the cheese and the bacon strips,

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:10.109
your risk was two,
three, or more-fold higher,

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.833
Then they looked
not just at saturated fat,

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:15.852
they looked at the fat
that's in doughnuts and pastries;

00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:19.392
you know what that is, that's trans fats
you'll see on the labels.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.430
They found the very same pattern
in there, too.

00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:27.695
So, the people who tended to avoid
the saturated fat and the trans fats,

00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:32.375
wanted to avoid them for cholesterol
and heart disease reasons,

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:35.426
but they also seem to affect the brain.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.434
Then researchers in Finland said,
"Wait a minute, let's go further."

00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:43.735
There is a condition we call
mild cognitive impairment.

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:46.320
You're still yourself -
you're managing your checkbook,

00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:48.450
you're driving,
your friends know it's you -

00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:52.697
but you're having mental lapses,
especially for names and for words.

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:56.845
They brought in over 1,000 adults,
they were 50 years old,

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:58.825
and they looked at their diets.

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:00.955
Then, as time went on, they looked to see

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:03.485
who developed mild cognitive impairment.

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:06.133
Some of these people
ate relatively little fat,

00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:07.853
some people ate a fair amount,

00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:11.815
and then they looked
at whose memory started to fail.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:14.750
They found exactly the same pattern.

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:18.446
In other words, it's not just,
"Will I get Alzheimer's disease?"

00:05:18.447 --> 00:05:22.677
but, "Will I just have
old age memory problems?"

00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:28.135
Well, what about that gene,
that APOE-[epsilon]4 allele

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:31.316
the one that condemns you
to Alzheimer's disease?

00:05:31.317 --> 00:05:35.676
Well, they then redid the study,
and they focused only on those people,

00:05:35.677 --> 00:05:38.070
and some of these people ate
relatively little fat,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.377
some people ate more,

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:40.647
and--

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:43.346
...Exactly the same.

00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:45.966
In other words, if you are
avoiding the bad fats,

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:48.867
even if you have the gene,

00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:54.161
your risk of developing
memory problems was cut by 80%.

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:56.636
And this is my most important point:

00:05:56.637 --> 00:06:00.046
genes are not destiny.

00:06:00.047 --> 00:06:02.436
Let's take another look in those plaques.

00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:07.506
We know there's beta amyloid protein,
but there's also iron and copper.

00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:09.435
Metals in my brain?

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:14.177
That's right, there are metals in foods,
and they get into the brain.

00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:16.927
Now think about this:
I have a cast-iron pan,

00:06:17.607 --> 00:06:21.086
and we had a backyard barbecue,
and a week later, I remember,

00:06:21.087 --> 00:06:22.377
"Oh...

00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:26.146
I left my frying pan on the picnic table,
and it rained last week."

00:06:26.147 --> 00:06:27.627
What happened to my pan?

00:06:28.197 --> 00:06:31.297
It rusted, and that rust is oxidation.

00:06:31.298 --> 00:06:34.888
Or you take a shiny new penny,
and does it stay shiny forever?

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.968
No, it oxidizes too.

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:43.290
Well, iron and copper
oxidize in your body,

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:44.888
and as they do that,

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.665
they cause the production
of what are called free radicals.

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.107
You've heard of free radicals:

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:51.187
free radicals are molecules

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:53.297
that are swimming around
in your bloodstream,

00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:56.479
and they get into the brain,
and they act like sparks

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.928
that seam through the connections
between one cell and the next.

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:02.520
So, how is this happening?

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:05.809
Where am I getting all this iron?
Where am I getting all this copper?

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.810
How can that be?

00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:08.810
How many people have a cast iron pan?

00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:09.829
Let me see hands.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.626
If that's your once a month pan,
I'm going to say, "Who cares?"

00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:17.909
But if it's every single day,
you're getting the iron into your food,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.729
and it's more iron than your body needs.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.721
Or copper pipes. Who has copper pipes?

00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:27.700
That water sits
in the copper pipes all night long,

00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:30.000
and in the morning
it goes into the coffee maker,

00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:31.817
and you're drinking that copper,

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.129
you get more than you need,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.390
and it starts producing
these free radicals that go to the brain.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.842
If you're a meat eater,
of especially liver,

00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:41.930
there's iron and copper
in those foods too.

00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.373
And we used to think, "Isn't that great?"

00:07:44.374 --> 00:07:48.570
until we realized
iron is a double-edged sword.

00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:52.163
You need a little bit,
but if you have too much,

00:07:52.943 --> 00:07:54.682
it becomes toxic.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:55.791
Vitamins.

00:07:55.792 --> 00:07:58.875
Vitamin manufacturers
put in vitamin A, and the B vitamins,

00:07:58.918 --> 00:08:00.892
and vitamin C, and vitamin D.

00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:04.460
And then they throw in iron and copper,
thinking, "Well, you need these,"

00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:07.761
not recognizing you're already
getting enough in foods,

00:08:07.762 --> 00:08:12.294
and if they add it to your supplement,
you are getting too much.

00:08:13.454 --> 00:08:14.973
OK, so what am I saying?

00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:19.602
What I'm saying is aside from the fact
that the saturated fat and the trans fats

00:08:19.603 --> 00:08:22.711
will increase our risk,
these metals will, too,

00:08:22.712 --> 00:08:25.101
and they are causing sparks
to form in the brain,

00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:28.271
free radicals to form
that seam through the connections.

00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:31.514
And if that's the case,
then I need a fire extinguisher.

00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:34.918
And we have one,
and it's called vitamin E.

00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:38.001
Vitamin E is in spinach,
and it's in mangoes,

00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:40.222
and it's especially in nuts and seeds.

00:08:40.222 --> 00:08:42.121
And in Chicago,

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:45.329
some people eat a little bit of it,
and some people eat a lot of it,

00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:49.611
and the beauty of this
is vitamin E is an antioxidant:

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.623
it knocks out free radicals.

00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:53.863
So, if what I'm saying is true,

00:08:53.864 --> 00:08:58.863
then the people in Chicago
who ate only a little bit of vitamin E

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:01.448
would be at much higher risk
than people who ate a lot,

00:09:01.568 --> 00:09:05.569
and that's exactly
what the research showed.

00:09:06.084 --> 00:09:08.484
People getting eight milligrams
a day of vitamin E

00:09:08.485 --> 00:09:11.674
cut their risk of Alzheimer's
by about half

00:09:11.675 --> 00:09:14.284
compared to people getting less than that.

00:09:14.285 --> 00:09:17.063
Hmm, OK, how do I get that?

00:09:17.064 --> 00:09:21.424
It's very, very easy: run to the store
and just buy a bottle of vitamin E pills.

00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:24.212
No, I don't think so, and here's why not.

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:27.474
Nature has eight forms of vitamin E.

00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:31.046
It's built into nuts and into seeds,

00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:34.414
but if I put it into my supplement pill,

00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:38.465
I can legally call it vitamin E
if it has only one form.

00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:41.050
And if you're eating too much
of one form of vitamin E,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.025
it reduces your absorption
of all the others.

00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:47.143
So, you want to get it from food;

00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:49.403
that's the form that nature
has designed for us,

00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:51.464
and that's the form
that we've evolved with.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.372
We can go a step further.

00:09:54.373 --> 00:09:56.183
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you.

00:09:56.184 --> 00:09:57.542
How much should I have?

00:09:57.543 --> 00:10:01.105
If I put some nuts or seeds
into the palm of my hand,

00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:04.065
by the time it hits your fingers,
that's just one ounce,

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:06.925
and that's about five milligrams
of vitamin E, right there.

00:10:06.926 --> 00:10:09.746
The trick is: don't eat it;

00:10:09.747 --> 00:10:11.695
because if you do,
you know what happens.

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:14.575
If you have those diced salty almonds,
and you've eaten them:

00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:17.510
you fill your hand again,
and then you eat it again.

00:10:17.511 --> 00:10:20.595
There's something about salty cashews
and almonds, is it just me?

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:24.041
There's something about them, they're
a little bit addicting in some way.

00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:26.931
So, don't do that, that's going to be
way more than you need.

00:10:26.932 --> 00:10:29.245
The answer is pour them into your hand,

00:10:29.246 --> 00:10:33.288
and then crumble them up,
and put them on your salad,

00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:36.258
or put them on your oatmeal,
or on your pancakes, or something.

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:39.237
Use them as a flavoring
not as a snack food,

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:40.637
then you're going to be OK.

00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:43.174
All right, researchers
at the University of Cincinnati

00:10:43.294 --> 00:10:45.082
went one step further.

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:48.847
Not just saturated fat,
not just trans fats, not just vitamin E,

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:49.909
but they said,

00:10:51.549 --> 00:10:52.929
"What about color?"

00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:58.638
Look at blueberries and grapes:
that color that they have is dramatic.

00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:01.899
And the colors of blueberries
aren't just there to make them pretty,

00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:04.460
those are called anthocyanins.

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:08.586
They brought in a group of individuals
into a research study:

00:11:08.587 --> 00:11:13.389
average age: 78, and everyone
was already having memory problems.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.518
And what they asked them to do
was to have grape juice, a pint a day.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.328
A cup in the morning, a cup at night.

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:22.399
Three months later, they tested everyone,

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.539
and their memory was better,
and their recall was better.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.099
Three months?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.069
That sounds too easy. How can that be?

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.906
Well, think about it:
a grape has a rough life.

00:11:32.907 --> 00:11:36.847
A grape has to sit on the vine,
all day long under the sun,

00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:39.520
and exposed to the elements,
and it has no protection.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.179
Or does it?

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.260
That purple color, those anthocyanins

00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.498
happen to be powerful antioxidants,
just like vitamin E,

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:51.100
but they're the grape form,

00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:54.851
and if you consume them,
they go into your bloodstream.

00:11:55.161 --> 00:11:57.510
And if that's true,
it doesn't have to be grapes,

00:11:57.511 --> 00:11:59.921
it could be anything that has that color.

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:01.860
Like blueberries.

00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:03.249
So, back into the laboratory:

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.459
a new group of patients, they came in,
they all had memory problems.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.143
And three months on blueberry juice,

00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:13.401
Their memory was better,
their recall was better.

00:12:13.402 --> 00:12:16.513
Now, the moral of the story
is not to have grapes and blueberries,

00:12:16.514 --> 00:12:18.335
and blueberry juice, and grape juice.

00:12:18.336 --> 00:12:20.372
No, the answer is color.

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:24.382
If you look at the colorful foods,
there's an important lesson there for us.

00:12:24.383 --> 00:12:26.041
You walk into the grocery store,

00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:30.481
and from a hundred feet away,
looking at the produce department,

00:12:30.482 --> 00:12:33.705
you can recognize beta-carotene,

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.251
lycopene, anthocyanins.

00:12:37.265 --> 00:12:38.734
Your retina can detect them

00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:43.604
because that's the orange color
of a carrot, or the red color of a tomato,

00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:45.972
or the purple color of a grape.

00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:50.343
And the brain also tells you
they're pretty, they're attractive,

00:12:50.344 --> 00:12:53.193
you can recognize antioxidants,
you're drawn to them.

00:12:53.194 --> 00:12:55.772
So, back in 2009, my organization,

00:12:55.773 --> 00:12:58.118
the Physicians Committee
for Responsible Medicine,

00:12:58.119 --> 00:13:00.008
went to the Department of Agriculture.

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:03.542
We said, "This is important.
Let's throw out the pyramid."

00:13:03.543 --> 00:13:06.083
The pyramid was a nice shape,

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:10.094
but it had a meat group,
and it had a dairy group,

00:13:10.095 --> 00:13:13.534
despite the fact that people
who don't eat meat or dairy products

00:13:13.535 --> 00:13:16.633
happened to be healthier
than people who eat them.

00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:19.343
And also, who eats off a pyramid anyway?

00:13:19.344 --> 00:13:20.763
We eat off a plate.

00:13:20.764 --> 00:13:22.373
So, we devised a plate that said

00:13:22.374 --> 00:13:26.304
fruits, and grains, and legumes
- that's the bean group - and vegetables,

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:28.982
those should be the staples.

00:13:28.983 --> 00:13:33.126
Well, we gave this to the USDA in 2009,
and we didn't hear back from them.

00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:36.712
So, in 2011, we sued
the federal government,

00:13:36.713 --> 00:13:39.441
the Physicians Committee
filed a lawsuit against the USDA,

00:13:39.561 --> 00:13:41.765
simply to compel response.

00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:44.637
And did you see what the US government
came out with in 2011?

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.645
I'm not taking any credit for this,

00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:50.395
but this is now US government policy,
it's called MyPlate,

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.204
and it does look in some way similar

00:13:52.205 --> 00:13:54.635
to what we'd sent them
a couple of years earlier.

00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:56.484
Fruits, and grains, and vegetables,

00:13:56.485 --> 00:14:00.685
and they have this thing
called 'the protein group.'

00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:03.324
The protein group could be meat,

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:06.936
but it could be beans, or tofu, or nuts,
or anything that's high in protein,

00:14:06.937 --> 00:14:08.436
it doesn't have to be meat.

00:14:08.437 --> 00:14:12.626
In fact, there is no meat group anymore
in federal guidelines.

00:14:12.627 --> 00:14:16.568
There's a dairy group there,
but to their credit, soy milk counts.

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:18.477
So, things are improving.

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:20.885
So far, what we've talked about

00:14:20.886 --> 00:14:25.197
is getting away from the saturated fats,
that's in cheese, and bacon, and meats;

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.794
getting away from the trans fats
and snack foods;

00:14:27.795 --> 00:14:30.374
you're having the vitamin E
and the colorful foods;

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:32.798
and there's one more step.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:36.685
It's not all food, there's something
to say about exercise.

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:38.638
At the University of Illinois,

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.947
researchers brought in
a large group of adults, 120 of them,

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:45.395
and they said, a brisk walk,
three times a week.

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:50.298
After a year, everyone went
into the laboratory for a brain scan.

00:14:50.778 --> 00:14:52.818
They measured the hippocampus

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:56.448
which is at the center of the brain,
and it's the seat of memory:

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:58.828
it decides what should be
let through into memory,

00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:01.107
and what should not be let through.

00:15:01.108 --> 00:15:03.098
It turned out that this organ,

00:15:03.099 --> 00:15:05.728
which is gradually shrinking
in older adults,

00:15:05.729 --> 00:15:07.497
suddenly, stopped shrinking.

00:15:08.277 --> 00:15:09.918
The exercisers found

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:12.148
that their hippocampus
was a little bit bigger,

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:14.459
and a little bit bigger,
and a little bit bigger,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.919
it was as if time was going backwards:
It reversed brain shrinkage,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.249
and on memory tests,
they did substantially better.

00:15:21.739 --> 00:15:24.022
So, I've devised my own exercise plan.

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:26.849
I'd like to present it to you,
I do this three times a week.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.370
Arrive at the airport as late as possible,

00:15:29.371 --> 00:15:32.671
carry massively heavy luggage,
and just run for the plane.

00:15:32.672 --> 00:15:34.311
(Laughter)

00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:37.900
At the University of Illinois
they had their own ideas,

00:15:37.901 --> 00:15:40.371
and their idea was a little simpler.

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:44.260
Do a ten-minute walk,
and do it three times a week.

00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:47.931
And then, next week,
let's do a 15-minute walk,

00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:49.490
and the week after that, 20.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:53.951
All they did was add five minutes a week
until they got to 40 minutes.

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:56.111
And a 40-minute brisk walk

00:15:56.112 --> 00:15:59.791
- this is not a trudge,
but it's a good brisk walk -

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.541
40 minutes, three times a week

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:05.741
is all you need to improve memory
and reverse brain shrinkage.

00:16:05.742 --> 00:16:07.023
Very simple.

00:16:08.523 --> 00:16:12.559
What I would like to do
is to go back in time,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.581
and I want to sit down with my dad,

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:17.919
and I want to say, "Dad, I found out
something really important.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.151
We can change our diet,

00:16:19.152 --> 00:16:21.401
we don't really need
that cheese and that bacon.

00:16:21.402 --> 00:16:23.707
There's plenty of healthy things
that we can eat.

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:26.180
Let's bring in
the colorful vegetables and fruits,

00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:28.892
let's make them part of our everyday fair.

00:16:28.893 --> 00:16:31.592
Let's lace up our sneakers,
let's exercise together."

00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:34.852
It's too late for him.

00:16:35.842 --> 00:16:37.602
But it's not too late for you.

00:16:37.882 --> 00:16:39.653
It's not too late for me either,

00:16:39.903 --> 00:16:44.132
and if we take advantage
of what we have now learned

00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:46.222
about how we can protect our brain,

00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:51.272
then perhaps, families will be able
to stay together a little bit longer.

00:16:51.273 --> 00:16:52.952
Thank you very much.
