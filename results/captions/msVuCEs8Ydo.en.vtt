♪ (PBS Digital Studios theme) ♪

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.220
Does the speed of light actually
have anything to do with light?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.140
♪ (Space Time theme) ♪

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.160
So what is it about the speed
of light that's so special?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.580
Why does the universe
seem to conspire to,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.400
1) keep photons from traveling at any speed but 300,000 kilometers per second

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.440
in a vacuum, according to
 any observer, and,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.120
2) keep anything from traveling faster than that speed?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.380
The answer: this statement is
false, or at least backwards.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.960
The universe doesn't arrange itself
to keep the speed of light constant.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.480
In fact, spacetime couldn't
care less about light.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.760
The cosmic speed limit is
about something much deeper.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.760
This universal constant is, perhaps more accurately, 
the 'speed of causality'.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.480
In a previous episode, we talked about causality
by way of the 'spacetime interval'.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.800
Causal connections give us the only ordering of events that all observers will agree on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.100
But why must causality
have a maximum speed?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.800
And why is that speed the
same as the speed of light?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.240
To understand this, let's first get our heads around two of the most important insights in physics ever.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.920
Ready?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.380
First, 1632—frilly collars,
pilgrims in Plymouth,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020
and in Italy, Galileo was
about to be dragged off

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.110
by the Inquisition for his
book supporting Copernicus

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.840
and the whole, "Earth is not the
center of the universe," thing.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.780
But in his book, there's another, less 
well known idea—his 'Principle of Relativity'.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.140
This is not Einstein's Relativity, but instead, the brilliant precursor.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.100
Not only is Earth or, indeed,
any other location not special,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.660
but Galileo posits that no
velocity is special, either.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.960
To put it another way, all experiments should give the same results regardless of the velocity

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.320
of your non-accelerating, or
inertial, frame of reference.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.600
This Galilean Relativity
is an incredible insight

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.660
that Isaac Newton would later
codify into his Laws of Motion.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.620
Fast forward to the 1800s—
top hats, steam trains,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.600
and mad experiments to uncover
the laws of electricity and magnetism.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.900
Enter James Clerk Maxwell,
scientific maestro,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.960
who weaves these laws into
his eponymous equations,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.130
describing the entire electromagnetic 
phenomenon with such elegance.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.100
By the late 1800s, we
have Maxwell's equations,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.960
Newton's mechanics, various
other awesome theories.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.460
And there's this sense
that physics might be done,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.660
except there are hints of something horribly wrong lurking in the math—actually, two hints.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.320
The first clues to the bizarre 
quantum nature of reality had emerged.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.480
And more importantly
for this episode,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.140
Maxwell's equations had cast confusion
on the sacred Galilean Relativity.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.680
In fact, we now know that
even Newton's mechanics

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.340
were using assumptions that implied an 
infinite speed of light, which is really bad.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.500
It would imply that space and
time and matter don't exist.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.160
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.660
First, let me explain the
issue with Maxwell's equations.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.740
Imagine a pony on roller blades 
with a monkey skateboarding along its back.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.680
And make it an electric monkey.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.180
Why? Well, magnetism comes from
moving electric charges.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.200
So an electric skater monkey
on a rollerblading pony

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.760
generates a magnetic
field, obviously.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.340
And I can figure out the 
field strength from Maxwell's equations

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.320
based on what I see is the monkey's total velocity.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.820
But what is that velocity?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.900
Galileo and Newton tell
us that total monkey speed

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.900
equals pony blade speed
plus monkey skate speed.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.100
But what if this very clever pony
also solves Maxwell's equations?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.360
She sees the monkey moving at only monkey skate speed, and so gets a totally different magnetic field.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.040
So who's right, me or the pony?

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.760
The key lies in what
we actually measure.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.380
We don't measure magnetic field.
We measure its effect. We measure force.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.400
And the pony measures
the same force that I do.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.760
See, there's a velocity-dependent trade-off between the electric and magnetic fields.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.660
The two work together to give you the same electromagnetic—the Lorentz—force,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.380
regardless of reference frame.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.800
This tells us that the electromagnetic force holds clues

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.040
to the fundamental interplay between 
space, time, and velocity.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.820
How do we unravel that connection?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.950
It's going to be encoded in the transformation that

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.440
will allow Maxwell's equations to jump seamlessly

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.720
between reference frames—the transformation

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.260
that represents space and time in our reality.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.620
This transformation thing,
it's like a mathy magic wand

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.120
that you wave at your description 
of spacetime or your physical laws.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.480
And it'll bump you between
reference frames, Harry Potter-style.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.740
Wingardium leviosa.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.830
An example is the Galilean transformation,
which basically says that

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.540
velocities add together and space and time
 don't depend on velocity.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.740
Newton's mechanics use it, and we just applied it

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.060
to Maxwell's equations to get total monkey speed.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.520
But it turns out that there's no way 
to write out Maxwell's equations so

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.380
that they give consistent results 
under the Galilean transformation.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.160
They aren't invariant
to that transformation.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.720
They sort of give the right force at low speeds, 
but the fields are a mess.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.360
And at high speeds—
forget about it.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.300
So does this mean
Maxwell was wrong?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.020
No, it means that Galilean
transformation is wrong.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.660
The transformation underpinning
Newton's mechanics is wrong.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.840
The only transformation that works 
is called the Lorentz transformation.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.820
And it was discovered even
before Einstein's Relativity.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.400
But it was Einstein who realized
that the Lorentz transformation

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.920
tells us how space
and time are connected

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.060
and that it also predicts
the speed of causality.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.720
Now, you can get to this transformation the way Lorentz and Einstein did by requiring a constant speed of light.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.240
As an example, there's
a link to the derivation

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.920
via the spacetime interval
in the description.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.960
But forget about
the speed of light.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.380
This transformation is so profound 
that it is inevitable

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.860
based on a few simple statements 
about the nature of space and time.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.940
Let me show you how.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.300
First, we're not going to pretend 
that we know how velocities add.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.360
We don't know that, "total monkey speed equals pony blade speed plus monkey skate speed."

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.880
Why would you assume
such as a thing?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.760
Next, no preferred
inertial reference frame.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.200
Under our new transformation,
the laws of physics will work the same

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.500
regardless of position, orientation, or velocity.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.100
It doesn't matter where the
pony is, how fast it's going,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.140
or in what direction
it's skating.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.580
This must be true.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.200
The Earth is whizzing around the sun,
the sun around the Milky Way.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.440
Position, orientation, and velocity 
are changing massively.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.120
Yet our experiments don't
seem to care about that.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.200
Finally, assume that
the universe make sense.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.260
Require that we can consistently 
transform between reference frames.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.300
I should be able to use
the same transformation

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.340
to get to the monkey's frame 
as I use to get to the pony's frame

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.360
just by using the different velocities.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.390
I should also be able
to jump consistently

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.620
through multiple frames of
reference and back again.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.300
E.g., I can go to the monkey's frame
by first going to the pony's frame,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.900
and then going from pony to monkey.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.910
And I can also get
back to my frame

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.160
by putting a minus
sign on the velocities.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.900
Essentially, we're just
requiring basic consistency

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.640
in how the dimensions work.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.160
Finally, finally—use these axioms 
to do a teensy bit of algebra.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.820
See the link in the description.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.640
The result is the
Lorentz transformation.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.980
It's the only one that satisfies all of these pretty fundamental statements

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.880
about the relativity, symmetry, 
and consistency of our universe.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.460
It must describe our reality.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.160
And therefore, there must
be a cosmic speed limit. Why?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.540
This absolute speed limit—let's call it 'c'—is the one parameter defining the Lorentz transformation.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.280
Through this parameter,
the Lorentz transformation

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.700
predicts the cosmic speed limit.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.780
Now, the Galilean transformation 
turns out just to be

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.800
a special case of the Lorentz transformation 
where c equals infinity.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.180
And honestly, just from the symmetry and relativity arguments that we made, c could be infinity.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.820
But for other reasons—still unrelated to light—
we know that it cannot be.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.740
The Lorentz transformation finally allows us

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.150
to write down a version of Maxwell's equation

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.060
that is invariant
to transformation.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.520
With it, we can write down
one law for electromagnetism

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.580
that works in all
frames of reference.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.110
This is further evidence
that our new transformation

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.360
accurately describes
our reality.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.760
But it only works for a
very specific value of c.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.920
That value has to
be a combination

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.560
of the fundamental constants
of Maxwell's equations.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.320
For the laws of electricity
and magnetism to work,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.420
we need a finite maximum cosmic speed, 
even without considering light.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.600
But check this out: the exact same combination that gives us the cosmic speed limit

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.280
also happens to define the speed of propagation

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.500
of electromagnetic waves—the speed of light.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.600
c is the speed of light.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.380
But it's the speed
of causality first.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.820
It's the maximum speed at which any two parts of the universe can talk to each other.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.880
In fact, it's the
maximum speed at which

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.920
any observers can see two
parts of the universe talk to each other.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.360
Because of this,
it's the only speed

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.720
that any massless
particle can travel.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.860
So lights or photons, also gravitational waves
and gluons, all have no mass.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.320
And so they travel at the
maximum possible speed.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.640
Mass is an impediment to motion.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.300
No mass, no impediment.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.740
So massless things go as
fast as it's possible to go.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.680
In fact, the very existence
of mass and space and time

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.700
tells us that the universal
speed limit is finite.

00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:23.260
Einstein's interpretation of the meaning 
of the Lorentz transformation

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.120
gives us the Special Theory of Relativity—
time dilation, length contraction,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.000
and, of course, mass
to energy equivalence,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.440
as described by the famous
equation, E=mc².

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.460
Awesome episode
on that one here.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.580
These are unavoidable 
conclusions once we have

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.120
the basic relationship between
 space and time

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.810
as described by the 
Lorentz transformation,

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.780
and we accept Einstein's
 interpretation of it.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.160
So what happens without a
universal speed limit

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.580
and we pretend c equals infinity?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.920
There is no matter, because it would take 
infinite energy to make any mass.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.480
There is only massless particles
traveling at infinite speed.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.220
Time dilation and length
contraction are infinite.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.200
There is no time and space,
no cause or effect,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.820
because all locations and times 
communicate with each other instantly.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.040
The universe is an
infinitesimal here-and-now.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.840
This is all pretty paradoxical, and so there are, 
by definition, inconsistencies in this picture.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.740
However, the paradox itself tells us that
an infinite speed limit is impossible.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.640
The finite speed of causality is fundamental to us having a universe in the first place.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.040
And we want a universe, so I can see you back here 
on the next episode of "Space Time."

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.660
Last time on "Space Time," we talked about the edge of the universe and Counter-Strike.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.920
Let's get into the comments.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.900
Denny Hiu asks how a universe
that is already infinite [can] expand,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.680
and what is it expanding into?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.860
Great question. The weird thing here is that some infinities can be bigger than other infinities.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.060
Imagine an infinitely long ruler 
with markings spaced at every inch.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.520
If we stretched the ruler
so that the markings are

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.660
spaced at every two inches, 
the ruler is still infinitely long.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.200
But every section of the
ruler has twice as much space.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.940
Now replace the
markers with galaxies,

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.840
and that's basically what's
happening with our universe.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.300
It doesn't need to
expand into anything.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.400
Every chunk of internal
volume is just getting bigger.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.380
RedomaxRedomax asks what you would see

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.600
if you traveled 18 times the distance to

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.900
the particle horizon to come back to where you started.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.620
So that number, 18 times
the particle horizon,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.630
only applies if the universe
has positive curvature—

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.630
making it a hyposphere—and the curvature

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.080
is the maximum that it could be,
given the current flatness measurements.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.860
But if you travelled that distance—

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.580
again, assuming the universe froze in its expansion, which it won't—

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.320
then you'd get back to your starting point
a long, long, long time later.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.520
If you travelled at
the speed of light,

00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:54.310
it would take around
750 billion years,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.980
or 55 times the current
age of the universe.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.800
The Milky Way would have
merged with Andromeda,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.620
and all stars besides red
dwarves would be long dead.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.580
Epsilon Lazerface says that, "… if you go outside the universe, you become a Super Saiyan."

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.020
Well, there really would be no way to know that

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.860
unless you traveled outside *The Universe*.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.600
LassieDog999 makes fun of
the way I say "geodesic".

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.920
"geo-dez-ic" "geo-dee-zic"
"to-may-to" "to-mah-to"

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.880
If it's good enough for the Queen of England,
it's good enough for me.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.020
Tenebrae says, "This was
the most intelligent way

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.580
they have ever heard of saying,
'We have absolutely no idea.'"

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.760
Thank you.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.580
I knew my PhD would end up
being good for something.
