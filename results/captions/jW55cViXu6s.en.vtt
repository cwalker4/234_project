00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:05.300
MATTHEW O'DOWD: This episode is
supported by "The Great Courses

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.380
plus."

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.020
The idea of Dyson spheres has
captured our imaginations.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.200
Vast mega structures, capable
of harvesting the power

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.110
output of entire stars, the as
yet inexplicable Kepler Space

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.760
Telescope observation of
swarms of somethings partially

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.000
eclipsing a distant star has
led to some rampant speculation.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.740
Today we ask, are Dyson
spheres plausible?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.120
And are they inevitable?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.560
In 1960, astrophysicist
Freeman Dyson

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.430
proposed that a sufficiently
advanced civilization

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.290
would have such extreme real
estate and energy requirements

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.680
that they might build
artificial habitats

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.380
in the form of vast shells
surrounding their parent star.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.650
Such Dyson spheres would
be possible targets

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.560
for our search for
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.920
appearing only as strange
points of infrared lights

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.030
but otherwise black at
visible wavelengths.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850
We don't really
know how the energy

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.050
requirements of advanced
civilizations evolve.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.960
It may be that their most
natural progression does not

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.620
require cosmic levels
of consumption.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.490
On the other hand,
securing access

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.380
to an entire star's
energy output

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.180
officially elevates
a civilization

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.220
to type 2 on the
Kardashev scale.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.190
We're currently type 0.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.250
So obviously it would be nice
to unlock the achievement.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.460
Let's assume that access to
10 to the power of 26 watts

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.680
is desirable.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.630
Are Dyson spheres the way to go?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.590
The plausibility
of a solid sphere

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.460
the size of a planetary orbit
is not really in question.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520
They are not plausible.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.420
The incredible stresses
on a solar structure

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.460
that size are vastly
greater than could

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.751
be sustained by any known
or yet imagined material.

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:58.000
Even if a super advanced
material with enough strength

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.100
was discovered, you'd need
impossibly large quantities,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.520
much more than there is
non-hydrogen or helium

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520
matter in all of the
planets in the solar system.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.650
The sphere would
not be habitable,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.490
having only a tiny gravitational
pull at its surface,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.220
and that would be
towards the sun.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.100
And finally, it would
be hopelessly unstable.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.340
Any small bump would cause
one side to fall into the sun.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.270
Some of these issues
could be dealt with.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.470
But in the end, it's
just not an efficient way

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.650
to start your galactic empire.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.900
So do we ditch
Dyson's original idea

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.870
in our quest to reach type 2?

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.180
Not so fast.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.070
It's not feasible to build
a giant solar sphere.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.840
But collecting the entire
output of our home star

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.040
may still be the smart choice.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.630
In fact, we can get around all
of the issues I just described

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.450
with a simple adjustment.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.970
Instead of building
a Dyson sphere,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.290
build a Dyson swarm,
individual solar collectors

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.940
that are only kilometers
or less in diameter

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.780
and each with its own
independent stable orbit

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.250
around the sun.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.420
Build enough of
these, and you can

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.140
read the entire sun
in all directions,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.700
absorbing its entire
energy output.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.950
The crazy thing
about the Dyson swarm

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.230
is that we could probably
start building one

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.190
in the not too distant future.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.330
In fact, we could get started
on the first collector

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.010
pretty much right away.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.150
The thing that makes it
seem a crazy prospect

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.230
is the sheer scope.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.160
We'd have to disassemble entire
planets for the raw materials

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.240
alone.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.260
But believe it or
not, there is a plan.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.530
It was proposed by Stuart
Armstrong, AI expert

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.090
and futurist.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.180
The idea is to cannibalize
the planet Mercury.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.020
And that's just to
begin the swarm.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.210
Mercury is ideal, because
it has a gigantic solid iron

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.470
core, comprising over
40% of the planet's mass.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.850
Combine that with the
abundant oxygen in its crust,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.480
and we can make hematite, a
naturally occurring, highly

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.180
reflective iron oxide that
has been used for millennia

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.860
as primitive mirrors.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.960
So each of the swarms
collectors would then

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.340
be a giant polished hematite
mirror, perhaps a kilometer

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.490
across, but as thin as tinfoil.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.930
It would reflect light
into a small solar power

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.149
plant that would
then beam energy

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.980
somewhere useful, perhaps
with a laser or a maser.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.560
The other nice
thing about Mercury

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.880
is that its gravity
is low enough

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.410
that launching mined
raw material into space

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.510
for construction is
pretty efficient.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.420
Building the first collector
would be the slowest.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.280
We start with limited
mining, space launch,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.340
and orbital construction
facilities, all of it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.980
autonomous.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.230
Energy supply is the big
limiting factor at the start,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.510
so it takes about 10 years
to build the first collector.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.290
But once it's complete, we
have orders of magnitude

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.100
more available power.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.250
We use it to power
replicator robots,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.660
building new mining and
manufacturing facilities,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.130
as well as replicatable
replicators.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.540
It's an exponential process.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.780
Every new collector
increases the energy

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.050
available to build
more collectors.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.180
Within 70 years, we have
a partial Dyson swarm,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.590
and Mercury is nothing
more than a debris field.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.160
To fully encompass
the sun, we'd probably

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.180
need to devour Venus, Mars,
and a good number of asteroids

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.950
and outer solar
system moons, too,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.540
assuming we want to
leave Earth intact.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.960
Let's assume that.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.560
Sound over the top?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.480
It's totally nuts.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.380
But it's likely doable.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.560
Autonomy in manufacturing,
mining, and transportation

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.840
are all progressing
exponentially.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.090
Engineers are in the
serious planning phases

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.930
for all sorts of space-based
assembly projects,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.750
including 3D printing of
giant telescope mirrors.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.820
Real companies are gearing up to
do autonomous asteroid mining,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.000
perhaps within a
couple of decades.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.260
And all of this is
without considering

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.970
nano robotics, which could
change the game entirely.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.600
Frankly, there's no
obvious deal breaker here.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.500
Once complete, the Dyson swarm
would harvest a good fraction

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.940
of the sun's energy,
so trillions of times

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.760
the current energy
output of the planet.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.090
What we then do with that
energy is another matter.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.230
But is the Dyson swarm really
the best path to type 2 status?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.730
Would other civilizations
have gone that route,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.350
casting very conspicuous
shadows on their home stars

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.570
for us to detect?

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.250
The advantage of using sunlight
is that the sun is already

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.240
making it.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.780
However, in terms
of power efficiency,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.430
it's not all that great.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.270
Only 0.7% of the rest mass
of the ingoing hydrogen

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.070
fuel at the sun's core
is converted to energy.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.860
Also, we need a mega
structure to harvest it,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.640
with a raw material
requirement close

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.450
to that of all the terrestrial
planets in the solar system.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.130
Is there a better way?

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.410
Maybe.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.620
What if instead of converting
0.7% of fuel rest mass

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.220
into energy we could
achieve 100% efficiency?

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.620
Anti-matter engines do this.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.310
But currently it
takes more energy

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.652
to create the anti-matter
fuel than we get back out.

00:07:15.652 --> 00:07:18.600
Perhaps we can do better
there, but there are also

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.110
other options, for example,
black hole engines.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.300
Energy can be harvested
from a black hole,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.020
either from the Hawking
radiation, from heat generated

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.740
from infalling material, or
by extracting angular momentum

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.730
from the black hole's spin.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.060
We talked about one
example, the Kugelblitz,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.110
in our previous episode on
possible starship engines.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.280
The show "Space" also
did a great episode

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.840
on the Kugelblitz.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.600
Tapping the Hawking radiation
from an artificial black hole

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.240
is appealing,
because once formed,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.220
we could perhaps sustain
it from evaporation

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.260
by feeding it with new matter.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.800
This is really 100% efficient
conversion of mass into energy,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.250
assuming we can
find a way to pump

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.390
new matter into the proton-sized
Kugelblitz against the tide

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.140
of Hawking radiation.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.120
And we only need 1
billion Kugelblitzes

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.180
to equal the sun's output.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.570
That's nothing,
compared to the hundreds

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.260
of quadrillion solar collectors
in a full Dyson swarm.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.630
Added benefits.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.040
We get to keep Venus and Mars.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.790
And also Kugelblitz and other
100% efficient mass converters

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.590
are indefinitely scalable.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.820
The Dyson sphere/swarm
can absorb

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.270
at most the entire
energy output of the sun.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.150
However, there's enough
mass in the solar system

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.370
to run a type 3
civilization's Kugelblitz

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.494
swarm for many times the
current age of the universe.

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.410
Of course, the trick is
making the black holes

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.550
in the first place.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.090
To make an industry
standard, 600 million

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.140
kilogram Kugelblitz,
it takes something

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.080
like 10% of the sun's energy
output each second, focused

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.390
into a single attometer
at a single instant.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.610
But wait.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.820
That's the power we get from
even a partial Dyson swarm.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.710
So there's something to do
with the swarm's energy.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.180
Burn through Mercury.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.480
Then use that partial
Dyson swarm's energy

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.510
to build Kugelblitzes, in
orbit, say, around Jupiter.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.190
Type 3, here we come.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.500
Maybe this is why we
don't see Dyson swarms

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.920
all through the galaxy.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.420
Aliens build partial swarms
to provide the energy

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.180
to build more efficient
engines, which would

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.360
be essentially undetectable.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.030
Or they try building
their first Kugelblitz,

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.430
and it goes very, very badly.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.310
Either way, Fermi
paradox solved.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.980
Admittedly, the fading that
the Kepler Space Telescope

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.020
observed in Tabby's
star is sort of

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.130
consistent with a partial swarm.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.460
I guess it couldn't
hurt to point some radio

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.990
telescopes, to look
for power leakage

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.440
from the Kugelblitz swarm.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.180
But no.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.630
It's never aliens, unless every
other explanation is exhausted.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.250
And we don't go in for
that hokey stuff here

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.480
on "Space Time."

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.020

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.940
Hey guys, quick announcement.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.415
We'll be taking a break week
next week while I travel

00:11:01.415 --> 00:11:03.040
and then coming back
the following week

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.160
with the answer to the
quantum eraser lottery

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.930
challenge and some
intriguing physics news.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.370
Also, I'm planning to
head to Austin for South

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.850
by Southwest in September, to
do a panel that we're calling

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.320
"We Are All Scientists."

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.940
It will be with Joe Hanson,
from "It's OK To Be Smart"

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.790
and Katie Mack, astrophysicist
and cosmic genius.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.520
But first, I want to
ask you guys to head

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.270
to the South by
Southwest panel picker

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.262
page, link in the description.

00:11:30.262 --> 00:11:34.540
You just need to make a quick
account and vote for our panel,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.570
please and thank you very much.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.550
A couple of weeks ago, we talked
about the mysterious delayed

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.380
choice quantum eraser.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.590
There was some
heated discussion.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.530
A few of you pointed out
that an important bit of info

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.230
was emitted from
the description.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.570
Now, we did this because we
wanted to expand on that point

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.010
through last week's
challenge question.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.930
Now that we've done that, we
can talk a bit more about it.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.530
The point is that in order
to resolve the photon

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.520
distributions at
the screen, you need

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.630
to know which
detector was triggered

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.530
by every one of those
photon's entangled twins.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.710
This is done with
coincidence electronics.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.220
If we see exactly
the right time offset

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.790
between a hit on the screen and
a hit at one of the detectors,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.110
that means that those two
photons were an entangled pair.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.900
After the experiment is done,
we can pick out off the screen

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.520
all of the photons that had
twins hitting, say, detector

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.210
A. Those photons turn out to
show no interference pattern.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.490
But the photons
associated with C or D

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.180
do have an interference pattern.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.490
However, there is
no way to figure out

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.420
which photons correspond
to which detectors

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.140
until the arrival
times at the screen

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.720
are compared to the arrival
times at the other detectors.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.150
And that information
has to be sent

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.450
at regular,
slower-than-light speeds.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.360
In a way, this is
even more crazy.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.630
Those locations are
recorded on the screen,

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.970
and the interference patterns
are embedded in them.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.520
Those interference
patterns hold information

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.330
about future events.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.660
But we can't extract
that information

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.980
until those future
events have occurred,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.860
and we can compare notes between
the screen and detectors.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.610
We'll go into all of this in
more detail in the challenge

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.560
question answer and also
when we come back to quantum

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.550
entanglement.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.360
On a related note,
David Stagg would

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.820
like to know what the
interference screen looks

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.040
like before you know what the
data is at detectors A, B, C,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.040
and D. Well, the screen just
looks like a blur of photons.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.970
You see, it's not just that
the blur of photons connected

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.980
to detectors A and B are
overlaid with an interference

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.060
pattern from C and D, no.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.290
Even C and D produce
a blur until you

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.520
compare coincidence data.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.460
As I mentioned in the
challenge question,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.080
the interference pattern
of C has the opposite phase

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.350
to that of D. Its peaks line
up with D's valleys and vice

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.160
versa.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.640
It's like adding a
sign in a cosine wave.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.680
It adds up to a
flat distribution,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.870
and it's only when you look
at the photons connected

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.672
to C and D separately
that you see the bands.

00:14:14.672 --> 00:14:17.820
Jose Iturria would like to bring
up the topic of the Berenstain

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.250
Bears.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.090
Good one.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.480
I actually got that.
