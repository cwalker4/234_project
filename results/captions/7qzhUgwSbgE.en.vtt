00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.080
It was around the 5th year since the Galactic
Empire came into power, and on the Outer Rim

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.619
planet of Eriadu was a family of 3 who made
their living as air scrubbing farmers.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.860
Air scrubbing was the practice of recycling
air and turning it back into Oxygen, which

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.870
was vital on colonised planets that didn’t
possess plant life to do that process naturally.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.100
The family of 3 possessed of a father and
2 kids: a 12 year old son and his younger

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.010
sister named Xea, with the mother of the family
having had long passed away shortly after

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.610
giving birth to the daughter.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.210
Anyway, during one late night, a group of
rebels were discovered trying to steal some

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.850
of the machines used for air scrubbing from
the farm.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.229
They had attached cables to a few of the machines
and were attempting to air lift them from

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:48.449
their starfighter.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.249
The father of course tried to prevent this,
bringing out his blaster rifle and firing

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.219
at the thieves who were stealing his family’s
livelihood.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.190
During the shootout, one of the cables snapped
and caused one of the large air scrubbing

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.749
machines to fall right into the family’s
home, crushing the bedroom portion of it.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.280
Having been outside during the firefight,
the 12 year old boy ran back into the house

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.680
only to discover that his younger sister Xea,
who had been in her bed, was crushed to death

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.900
right before his eyes.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.600
It was at that very moment he knew what he
wanted to do when he grew up: to kill rebels.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.780
The rebels ultimately escaped leaving only
a father and his son to mourn the death of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.000
their youngest family member.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
Shortly after the attack, Imperial forces
came to check up on the report that the father

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.440
gave, and along with the stormtroopers arrived
the Governor of the planet, Wilhuff Tarkin.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.120
While Tarkin was being detailed of what happened
from the father, the young boy was fascinated

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.800
by the white armored soldiers of the Empire,
and after giving a playful salute to one of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.280
them, he decided he was going to become a
Stormtrooper when he was older and fight against

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.720
the rebels in order to avenge his sister.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.090
A few years later, he was old enough to apply
to the Junior Academy in the nearest city

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.850
of his family’s farm.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.100
However the boy’s father was strictly against
this, not wishing to lose another one of his

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
children.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.039
But the boy’s determination to become a
stormtrooper and to avenge his sister was

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.640
too great to be stopped, so one night he snuck
out of the farm and ran off to the Junior

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.459
Academy and applied to it all on his own,
leaving behind only a note to his father of

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.689
his departure.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.780
The Junior Academy’s purpose was to weed
out the weak among the young teens before

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.790
sending them to the actual, adult academies
of the world.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.129
The boy recalled the Junior Academy to be
a complete breeze, and that he and his peers

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.200
were treated extraordinary well, with all
of the members of his initial class making

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.730
it toward graduation.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.980
Although he had successfully made his first
steps into becoming a stormtrooper, the boy’s

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.549
father did not attend his graduation or even
bothered to show up on the day he was supposed

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.029
to leave for the adult academy that was stationed
at Eriadu’s capital city.

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.680
Such an act left him sad as there were so
many things he never got to say to his father,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.420
and he really hated having to leave without
even saying goodbye to him.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.019
But he put his emotions aside and got on the
transport to tackle his next step into becoming

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.769
a stormtrooper.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.819
Also just a heads up, the boy’s real name
is never mentioned in the story, however he

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.169
did eventually get his operating number TK-462,
which is what we’ll be referring to him

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.549
from now on.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.519
Anyway, upon arriving to the second Imperial
Academy, it’s atmosphere was completely

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.389
different from what 462 had experienced at
the Junior Academy.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.849
First off the instructor he and his squad
were assigned to was an old clone trooper

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.849
named Lasser.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.799
And it was quite obvious the retired clone
held disdain toward regular Human recruits,

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.120
viewing them as house pets that were attempting
to train to become wild, dangerous beasts.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.549
To make matters worse, Lasser called out 462
for being the shortest cadet among the class

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.059
and that he was going to be out of there within
a week.

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:55.200
And from that day on Lasser went out of his
way to make 462’s life a living hell.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.550
The clone instructor had the other cadets
in the squad beat up 462 every single morning,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.799
an act the other cadets reluctantly obeyed
as they themselves didn’t want to get on

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.230
Lasser’s bad side.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.569
Although this of course made the training
program much harder for 462, it did harden

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.329
his resolve to pushing through and graduating
as a Stormtrooper.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.180
As to him, had he quit on day one, that meant
he took an entire beating for nothing.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.820
And each day after that it just meant more
beatings he would have taken for nothing had

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.310
he quit later on.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.400
No matter the physical beatings or verbal
insults levied toward 462 from Lasser, he

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.730
still was determined into becoming a stormtrooper
no matter what.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.950
A few years later and there were only a few
weeks left before graduation from the academy.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.760
During this time, 462 and his squad were forced
to run a 5k in their full armor on the hottest

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.160
day of the year.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.400
After they finished, Lasser gave a toast to
their accomplishment, though he was the only

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.420
one who drank.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.730
After he finished his drink, the clone instructor
crushed his wine glass with his feet and then

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.780
ordered 462 to put all the glass shards in
his boots, and to then have him put them back

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.940
on before another race.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.720
Despite the unimaginable pain the glass shards
gave him, 462 was able to run about 500 meters

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.010
before falling unconscious due to the torture
the glass shards were giving his feet.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.730
He later woke up in a medical bay where a
nurse explained to him that a surgery was

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.870
performed to reconstruct his feet.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.630
The very first thing 462 wanted to do was
confront Lasser, but the nurse told him he

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.660
needed to rest for 2 weeks, and that he’d
be out of her care right after he graduated.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.630
The comment surprised him and blew away all
other thoughts.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.830
He couldn’t believe he was actually slated
for graduation despite his failure in the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.830
race.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.770
He was finally going to become a stormtrooper.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.660
He then thought of how proud his sister would
have been for him at that moment, and at last

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.520
he was going to avenge her death.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.550
A few weeks later, and 462’s first assignment
as an Imperial Stormtrooper was within the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.550
fashion district in the capital city of Eriadu.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.220
There he spent much of his time arresting
shoplifters and petty thieves.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.340
While he was happy to serve the Empire in
anyway he could, he was a bit disappointed

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.800
in his assignment as he had hoped to be doing
a bit more, like being in the frontlines and

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.690
actually confronting enemy fighters.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.080
Though the day for that chance came fairly
quickly, as a report arrived that the Empire

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.320
needed more troops on the planet Lothal.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.980
462 was among the very first to volunteer
and was swiftly transported toward the new

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.500
planet as a result.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.070
When he arrived he noticed the rough living
conditions the people were in.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.320
While the people of his homeworld seemed to
have been benefiting from Imperial rule, the

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.900
same could not be said of the people on Lothal,
whose lives seemed to be worse off due to

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.880
the large scale mining operations that were
being done on their planet by the Empire.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.460
When 462 was placed within his new squad on
Lothal, one of his first missions was to destroy

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.860
and burn down an entire village out in the
far lands that was suspected of helping the

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.240
local Rebels.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.820
462 tried to justify the act as something
that was for the greater good of the Empire.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.340
To him, it was like exterminating the diseased
animals of a farm, as well as any animal that

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.380
was near the sick just to be safe, as doing
so was the only sure way of saving the rest

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.700
of the livestock.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.520
Although he had convinced himself that destroying
the small village was going to save more lives

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.860
down the road, he still couldn’t get the
screams of the children out of his head, and

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.060
he hated how he was the one who had to live
with these horrors and not the Imperials on

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.390
the top who had given the command.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.400
One day 462 and his squad were ordered to
retrieve a crate of stolen kyber crystals.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.310
Lucky for them they ended up finding it abandoned,
as apparently the original thieves panicked

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.980
and left the crate behind.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.740
But still on orders of finding the rebel thieves,
the captain of 462’s squad went into the

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.600
town the thieves were suspected of hiding
in and grabbed a random Rodian shopkeeper.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.810
The captain then placed his blaster on the
Rodian’s head and announced that he was

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.040
going to pull the trigger on a count of 3
unless the original thieves of the kyber crystal

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.700
crate gave themselves up.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.120
He reached the count of 3, and no one came
up.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.400
So the Rodian was shot, and then the Captain
grabbed another random person and started

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.520
the counter again.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.370
However, this time when he reached the count
of 3, a random man from a nearby building

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.180
took out a blaster and aimed it at the stormtrooper
captain, but before he could fire his blaster

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.730
he was instead quickly shot on the spot by
462.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.820
The man from the building quickly fell down,
dead.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.080
Shortly afterwards a little girl came from
behind, and tried to get him up.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.930
It was his daughter, and upon realizing her
father had died, she just fell on top of him

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.930
crying.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:29.270
462 and the rest of the town square saw this,
and thus chaos erupted as among some of the

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.920
crowd began to attack the other stormtroopers.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.460
As he started to provide cover for his comrades,
462 was then shot right in his chestplate.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.380
He had just enough time to turn his head to
see who it was.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.740
It was the little girl, the one whose father
he had killed.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.029
She was barely holding her father’s blaster,
which was as big as her, and had it aimed

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:51.290
right at the blaster hole within 462’s chest
plate.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.750
While the chest plate prevented the blaster
bolt from blowing a giant hole into his body,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.230
it did shatter the insides of the armor plate,
resulting in the small shards penetrating

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.240
his flesh and causing deep internal bleeding.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.180
As he fell down to his knees, 462 took off
his helmet and looked at the little girl.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.970
She was staring right back at him, and did
not shoot another blaster bolt.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.410
She knew he was going to die, and so did he.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:19.080
462 didn’t blame her for what she did, and
he knew exactly what she was feeling at that

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.970
very moment, she was just like him all those
years ago.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.560
Just instead of rebels killing his young sister,
it was a stormtrooper who had killed her father.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.740
462 then began to smile, which confused both
the little girl and even himself, as he didn’t

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.320
really know why he was happy right before
his death.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.820
Perhaps it was because he knew the little
girl was going to grow up wanting to kill

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.120
Imperials now, and that he was the one who
gave her that fiery purpose that was going

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.779
to be with her for the rest of her life, the
same way the rebels long ago gave him.

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:50.690
And for that he felt satisfied.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.490
In the end, 462 eventually succumbed to his
injuries, with his final thoughts being that

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:11.450
he was finally going to join his younger sister
in whatever afterlife there was.
