00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:14.937
THEORIES FOR DECADES.

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:15.838
OFTEN MOCKED FOR TALKING

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.839
ABOUT IT MAYBE THEY

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.875
SHOULDN'T BE MOCKED.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:22.278
COMMANDER DAVID GAVE ROW

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.213
SPENT 18 YEARS AS A NAVAL

00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:24.514
PILOT.

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:29.252
2004 HE HAD UNFORGETTABLE

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:30.286
CONTACT WITH AIRCRAFT HE

00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:33.189
SAID WAS DEFYING THE LAW OF

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.623
PHYSICS.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.191
THANKS FOR COMING ON

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:35.525
TONIGHT.

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:37.393
TELL US WHAT YOU SAW.

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:41.130
TRAINING MISSION.

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.332
WHEN WE JOINED UP WE WERE

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.100
TOLD THAT THE EVENT WAS

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:48.538
TASKING AND SENT OUT TO THE

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.838
WEST.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.309
SOUTHWEST OF SAN DIEGO

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.544
BETWEEN SAN DIEGO AND MEXICO

00:00:54.545 --> 00:01:01.684
ON A CLEAR, PERFECT DAY WHY

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:02.785
GET OUT TO THE SPOT THEY

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:03.820
TELL US IT IS AT.

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:04.554
WE START LOOKING AROUND.

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:06.389
BOTH OF US, BOTH AIRPLANES

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.230
TIC-TACS SHAPED OBJECT JUST

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:18.768
THERE IS NO WINGS, NOTHING.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:20.503
AS WE DRIVE AROUND IN A

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:22.105
CLOCKWISE FLOW WE GET TO THE

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:22.905
9:00 POSITION AND I SAID I'M

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:24.240
GOING TO GO DOWN AND CHECK

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.508
IT OUT AND OTHER JET IS

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.275
GOING TO STAY HIGH.

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:27.510
AS WE GO DOWN, WHEN WE GET

00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:32.982
IT'S IN A CLOCKWISE FLOW AND

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.320
IT'S IN A DECLINE WE ARE IN

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:37.687
DISSENT.

00:01:37.688 --> 00:01:39.389
WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT TAKES

00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:42.425
I GET OVER TO THE 8:00

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:42.859
PRESIDENCY.

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:46.396
AND SEE WHAT IT IS.

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:47.830
IT'S ABOUT 2,000 FEET BELOW

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.768
AS I GET TO WITHIN ABOUT A

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.103
HALF MILE OF IT RAPIDLY

00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:57.907
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WHAT WOULD YOU

00:01:57.908 --> 00:01:58.775
ESTIMATE THE SPEED?

00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:01.310
&gt;&gt; WELL ABOVE SUPER SONIC.

00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:02.712
IT LIKE BULLET OUT OF A GUN

00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:04.847
IT TOOK OFF.

00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:05.548
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SO FROM WHAT YOU

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.886
KNOW ABOUT AERODYNAMICS,

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:11.421
MECHANICS, PHYSICS, SHOULD

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:13.189
THIS BE POSSIBLE WHAT YOU

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.456
SAW?

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:14.657
&gt;&gt; NOT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:17.660
THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:19.328
NOT AT ALL.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.797
&gt;&gt; Tucker: EVEN NOW, EVEN 13

00:02:20.798 --> 00:02:21.697
YEARS LATER?

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:28.671
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT UNOF YOUT

00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:28.704
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT UNOF YOUA

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:31.174
KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:32.942
&gt;&gt; WHEN WE SAW THE VIDEO OF

00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:33.676
THE IR.

00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:35.678
IT HAS NEXT SAWS.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.480
NO DISCERNIBLE THINGS OF

00:02:41.318 --> 00:02:42.752
HOVER OVER THE WATER MOVING

00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:44.687
AROUND TO A CLIMB UP TO

00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:46.722
ABOUT 12,000 FEET TO RAPIDLY

00:02:46.723 --> 00:02:47.790
ACCELERATING AWAY IN A CLIMB

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:49.959
AND IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.760
IT WAS GONE.

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:52.528
YOU FIGURE 50 MILES OF

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.863
VISIBILITY AND CAN YOU

00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:55.198
EASILY SEE AN OBJECT THAT

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.799
SIZE EASILY AFTER 10 MILES

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.401
AND IT DISAPPEARED IN

00:02:58.402 --> 00:02:58.801
SECONDS.

00:02:58.802 --> 00:02:59.502
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:05.608
THAT ALTITUDE CHANGE?

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.210
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE ALTITUDE

00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:07.910
WOULDN'T BE BAD.

00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:10.346
IT WOULD BE THE

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:12.381
ACCELERATION.

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:12.882
&gt;&gt; Tucker: RIGHT.

00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:14.217
&gt;&gt; WELL, HONESTLY, I WANTED

00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:15.651
TO FLY IT.

00:03:15.652 --> 00:03:16.552
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YEAH, I BET.

00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:19.388
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, TALKING TO SOME

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:19.789
PHYSICISTS.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.523
THEY DON'T THINK THE HUMAN

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:22.258
BODY COULD HANDLE THAT KIND

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.193
OF FORCE.

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:24.794
&gt;&gt; Tucker: DOESN'T SOUND

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:25.828
LIKE THE HUMAN BODY OKAY

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:26.662
BOTTOM LINE, WHAT DO YOU

00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:28.431
THINK THIS WAS?

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:30.633
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE AS DO THE OTHER

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:31.801
FOLKS THAT WERE ON THE

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:34.370
FLIGHT THAT WE -- WHEN WE

00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:35.371
VISUALLY SAW IT WAS

00:03:35.372 --> 00:03:39.108
SOMETHING NOT INTEREST THIS

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:39.642
WORLD.

00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.343
&gt;&gt; Tucker: PRESUMABLY YOU

00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:41.210
EXPRESSED THAT BELIEF TO

00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:44.447
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, WE CAUGHT A LOT

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:46.315
OF GRIEF GETTING BACK TO THE

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:46.616
BOAT.

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.352
AND IT GOT PASSED OFF AS AN

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:50.520
EVENT THAT NO ONE COULD

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:50.920
EXPLAIN.

00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:52.889
KEEP IN MIND, THEY HAD BEEN

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.257
TRACKING THESE FOR TWO WEEKS

00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:55.258
PRIOR TO US SEEING IT.

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.826
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.162
APPEARED.

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:01.864
&gt;&gt; THIS FEELS LIKE A REALLY

00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:02.665
BIG STORY TO ME.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.667
IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR WHY

00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:05.735
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS MORE

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:06.469
INTERESTING THAN THIS.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.637
I THINK THIS SEEMS LIKE A

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:09.205
BIG DEAL AND COMMANDER, I

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:12.909
YOU SEEM SOBER AND

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.245
BELIEVABLE AND I APPRECIATE
