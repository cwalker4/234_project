00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.320
They billed our insurance company over $3 million for the cost of transplant. Then I have another EOB

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.050
right after it was it was another $1 million.So you're looking at a $4 million transplant. I don't know what people do without insurance.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.750
How could you even begin to pay that?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.000
We hear so much about how expensive medical bills are, we've almost become numb to it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.380
In 2017, 1/3 of the money raised on GoFundMe went towards medical campaigns. And the site raises

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.960
$650,000 a year for more than 250,000 medical campaigns.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.620
Luca was born with Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia and Hirschsprung's Disease. At

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.060
three weeks old, he had surgery to remove part of his colon. At two

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.840
months, he went into cardiac arrest. And at five months, he had a lung

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.990
transplant. His parents had to turn to fundraising almost immediately just to keep up with the medical bills.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.050
They did a clamshell approach and he has several scars from all of the other surgeries.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.270
So when did the U.S. health care system go from a philanthropic program to a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.460
multi-billion dollar industry? And where do the funds go once the bills are paid?

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.620
Today, the U.S. health care system is in a sort of tug of war between physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, shareholders and insurance companies.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.040
The list goes on. But for this video we'll just focus on these entities. Caught in the center of it all are the patients.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.880
We're often not able to provide the type of care that we want because of the cost of care.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.960
Most Those costs are now forcing a growing number of uninsured or underinsured Americans into traveling abroad for medical treatment.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.170
Everyone started thinking of health care as a business where the metrics were profit, return on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.430
investment, efficiency, and those aren't the metrics of health but that's how we judge hospitals today.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.520
You would think that they would be looking out for your chronically ill children and you know all of the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.540
medications and and things like parking at the hospital.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.850
No. No that's not covered.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.260
But before we get to all of this, let's rewind to understand how we got here.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.110
This chart is a pretty good place to start.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.920
The data shows health care spending versus life expectancy. The rest of the world pretty much stays the same course.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.100
But around 1980, the U.S. veers off.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.510
I like to say it's kind of the, the road to hell is paved in good intentions

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.680
because everything we've done was in the name of better health.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.240
To be clear, growth in U.S. health care spending has slowed over the past few years but it's still way higher  than in

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.200
other wealthy countries. Before government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Blue Cross and Blue Shield

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.740
were the main providers of health insurance in the U.S. At the time they were nonprofits and accepted everyone

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.320
who wanted to sign up. But at this point, it wasn't to control costs. It was really insurance in a worst case scenario.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.740
And after World War II, employers started offering health insurance. Suddenly demand was booming.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.980
From 1940 to 1955, Americans with health insurance went from 10% to more than 60%. That demand created

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.280
a business opportunity, and for profit companies started rolling in.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.160
Insurance was the first sector because it's in some ways the original sin, in

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.520
the sense of it separated the consumer from payment right. So it felt like nobody was paying.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.350
By 1951, Aetna in Cigna were major players in the for profit health insurance market. And in 1965, President Johnson established Medicare and Medicaid.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.960
This medical insurance for those over 65 will become effective July 1st.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.480
Even so, the for profit insurance market continued to gain steam through the 70s

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.070
and the 80s, capturing more and more of the health insurance market. Meanwhile

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.340
the first for profit hospitals started popping up around the country.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.670
When Medicare and Medicaid started, there were none. But by 1983, one in seven U.S. hospitals belonged to an investor-owned

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:33.660
multi-hospital system. By the 90s, Blue Cross and Blue Shield had merged but they were losing money, fast. And in 1994,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.200
they let their local companies turn to Wall Street to stay afloat.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.430
Hospitals I think were the first to realize, well we can charge whatever we want for these things because it feels like no one's paying.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.350
But then you know there are all these doctors in the hospitals. They see all these business consultants coming in.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.870
They see the hospital's CEO making two million dollars a year and they're

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.920
feeling like wow we're suckers. You know we're working our tails off here, and we want in too.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:09.720
Essentially hospitals went from being run as a philanthropy to being run as a corporation. But these corporations aren't selling just another widget.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.150
They're putting a price on human health.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.410
The health care industry is now the country's biggest employer. And those employees need to get paid. Throughout

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:27.000
all of this is private capital, and lots of it. You would think that if hospitals are becoming more efficient the cost to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.540
consumers should go down too. But that hasn't necessarily been the case. And a lot of that has to do with the billing

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.770
system. Of course doctors need to get paid. There are admin costs and medical supplies and technology. But instead of

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.510
this three page bill you'd get in Belgium, medical bills in the U.S. look more like this.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:55.590
I am my son's secretary and I spent a lot of time taking care of just just medical bills ,and phone calls, and that type of thing.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.670
We talk a lot about the billers and the coders and the consultants who really are removed from health care. They're

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.780
not there because they care about health, they're there because they see a business opportunity. And you know you

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.610
can't blame them in the sense that that's what their companies are supposed to do. They're looking for business, so

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.150
a collection agency that does health care, you know to them a bill is a bill is a bill. They don't care if it's for

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:30.490
somebody's heart transplant or someone who was not very judicious and spent a lot more money on a Rolex watch that they couldn't afford. It's a bill.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.990
But how come those bills are so long? It has to do with something doctors call unbundling. Think of it like buying a

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.200
plane ticket. You pay for the ticket itself, but there are a lot of extra charges squeezed into your final bill.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.800
$30 for a checked bag. $50 for a few extra inches of leg room and another $3 for water.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.910
You get the gist. People get irate about it in an airline ticket but in

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.660
healthcare we've kind of come to accept it as, oh that's just normal. And part of the reason I wrote the book is to

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.260
say that's not normal in other countries.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.760
Hospitals do this through a complex system of codes.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:19.580
New patient visit: 99201-05. Emergency room visit: 99281-85. Burn due to water skis on fire: V9107.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.780
Yeah there really is a code in case your water skis burst into flames, you know,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.390
as they do. Different codes mean different prices. Just take the codes

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.100
for a laceration. You'll be charged a different amount depending on the size of the cut, where it's at on your body

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.960
and how complex the suture is. Coding historically was about tracking diseases., right.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:51.620
But in the U.S.,  pretty much alone, how you code a patient interaction is a billing construct. Again something

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.140
that would had scientific and medical purpose gets translated into a business asset.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:02.300
Every day we spend hours going through check boxes, typing notes, documenting things that we're supposed to

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:08.840
document for billing purposes, that we really don't think improves patient care. The more that you spend time

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.500
with computers, the more that we spend time billing, that means a lot less time for face to

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.540
face interaction with our patients. And that's why most of us got into medicine in the first place.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.790
There are benefits to taking down all that data. In theory, it can lead to better results in the long run.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:32.290
Doctors may find things later that they didn't catch in the moment. But at the end of the day, it's just not working in the U.S. Some doctors say they're

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:38.260
concerned about malpractice lawsuits, so they order more tests to protect themselves. Bills keep getting longer,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:44.470
and health outcomes aren't always getting better. The American Hospital Association declined to comment on

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.970
criticisms of the current hospital system. But they do have a fact sheet

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.600
explaining that hospitals often don't get paid the full amount that the bill.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.580
The AHA claims two-thirds of community hospitals lose money when the government

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.460
pays Medicare and Medicaid bills. And that "the hospital payment system itself is broken."

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.590
And of course a big part of that health care spending is on drugs and supplies,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.200
both of which can be hard to get insurance to fully cover.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.540
Oh, thank you Luca. Can you show us what's in that box?

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:22.870
Are these your ostomy bags? So we get 10 per box and that lasts me about two and a

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:31.900
half days. What they're currently charging me is one $1,178 this month for those boxes.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.840
Thank you!

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:41.820
Let's talk about one of the biggest issues weighing on the pharma industry right now and that is drug prices.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.040
From $18 a tablet jumping to $750 a tablet a 4000 percentage just 24 hours.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.180
Do you feel badly about what's happening? No in fact we're increasing access to patients, Meg.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.090
We've all heard about Martin Shkreli raising the price of Daraprim. But what about Colchicine or Epinephrine? The

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:04.510
prices of those drugs have both skyrocketed because one company has control over it. The response is usually

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:09.250
the same, the companies need to raise prices to fund the research and development for the next drug.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.520
For the most part high priced drugs have patent protection from the government.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:22.660
They pretty much have a monopoly in a market so very often you have someone who needs a specific cancer drug. One company makes it, they're the only

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.880
company that makes it, no one else can make it. And since it might be absolutely necessary for your life,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.670
they're in a position where they could charge anything they want.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.110
How is that possible? Well there's not really anyone stopping it.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.900
Once people realized you can get away with this stuff it became a race to the top.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.540
It's also important to remember that many of these costs are adding up during a very stressful time.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.140
Sometimes the people paying the bills aren't even conscious.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.030
The analogy I often make is firefighters when they come to a burning house. So

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.410
when your house is on fire, your family's inside, you don't want to be sitting there negotiating with

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.640
firefighters. Oh you know I'm going to pay you $300,000 they want $400,000.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.620
That's not how you want to do this. And often health care does have that character.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.270
Medical emergencies are chaotic. And health insurance is confusing.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.460
There are HMOs, PPOs, deductibles, copays and premiums to try and make sense of.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:24.320
You'd think that if people are insured, they shouldn't have to pay that much out of pocket. But that's not always the case.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.330
Not every doctor accepts every insurance plan. And some hospitals have staff employed by multiple third party

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.940
companies. So one trip to the E.R. could get you five different bills and your insurance might only cover one.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.860
I actually stopped taking ambulances.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.920
Really. We had one really really close

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:47.130
call where Luca was pretty unstable. We knew things were going south and we

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.410
drove him to the hospital instead. I sat in the back and slowly increased the

00:11:52.410 --> 00:12:02.760
oxygen the entire ride and my husband was driving 120 mpg down 95 because it was faster and cheaper for us to do it

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:09.090
that way. When you're being slammed with those type of bills like you just can't incur any extra costs.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.100
And I'm a nurse so I figured I was in the backseat and if I had to do chest compressions I was going to do chest compressions.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.250
Today nearly 30 million Americans are uninsured. That's down from roughly 55

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:27.860
million in 2010 before the Affordable Care Act. But it's still a higher percentage than countries like France, Japan and Israel.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.900
The insurance companies are supposed to be negotiating their prices lower

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.130
because in a lot of cases they're ultimately the ones footing the bill.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.120
But as we've seen over the last few decades, those costs can still get

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.600
passed onto consumers. Health costs and contribute to all sorts of inequalities in society.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:51.340
So people who are poor or middle class even, they're just one serious illness away from bankruptcy.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.580
So where do we go from here?

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.900
Once there's all this money sloshing around in the system there's this kind

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:04.500
of pile on effect where everyone wants to grab their bit of this huge pot of

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.230
money. And now what we have as we're trying to take it back and reduce costs

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.860
is everyone is desperately clinging to their piece of the pie.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:26.010
Of course, health care costs have the potential to impact your personal budget if you're paying for insurance or

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:32.360
when you get sick. But it also impacts the country's bottom line. The government currently spends more than

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.600
$1 trillion on health care. And the CBO expects spending on Medicare and Medicaid to double in the next 10 years.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.740
That's not just because the population is getting older. A large part of that spending will come from health care

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.040
getting more expensive. There's no magic solution as to what to do next.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.860
But people are at least starting to think about the steps it will take to turn things around.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.390
One is having a lot more transparency.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:03.100
Both doctors and patients and their families should have an understanding of roughly what it's going to cost.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:09.320
Alternative route, having some sort of government manufacturing facility so that you could say to Shkreli's:

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.850
"OK you want to do that, guess what? Next week, we're going to be on the market and we're going be selling this stuff for a dollar two dollars a pill."

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.510
Peekaboo. (laugh) Ready. Peekaboo.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.690
There is a very very strong possibility that Luca will need a second lung transplant before he's ten years old.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.270
He's already had one and they will list him for a second. And right now the

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:41.570
policies in our health care system is they do not list him for a third. So I do not know if I will see my child ever hit his teens or early 20s. It's pretty scary.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.330
Like I don't know if I'll ever see him get married. It's just so unknown.
