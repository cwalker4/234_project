00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:09.807
KENNEDY: THANK YOU TRISH!

00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:10.842
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CIVIL WAR

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:12.076
IS UPON US.

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:12.977
IMPEACHMENT AND SOCIALISM

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:13.711
TEARING THEM APART FROM THE

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:14.045
INSIDE.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.813
CAN NANCY PELOSI HOLD IT ALL

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:16.180
TOGETHER?

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:18.182
OR WILL THE PRESIDENT EXPLOIT

00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:19.117
THIS NEW WEAKNESS AND SKATE

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.319
INTO AN EASY REELECTION

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.121
VICTORY?IT'S BEEN ONLY TWO

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.089
MONTHS SINCE NANCY PELOSI AND

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.257
DEMOCRATS TOOK CONTROL OF THE

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:26.557
HOUSE.

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:32.230
AT THAT TIME THE RANK AND FILE

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:34.098
SPLIT OVER THESE DIVISIVE

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.066
ISSUES PREFERS HYSTERIA OVER

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:35.600
IMPEACHMENT.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:40.304
AL GREEN WANTS TO GET FILING

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:41.472
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:42.940
THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT IS

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:43.274
TUESDAY.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.009
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT AN

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.643
UNFIT PRESIDENT SHOULD BE

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.112
ALLOWED TO STAY IN OFFICE.

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:48.880
&gt;&gt; THAT'S FINE.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:53.418
LAST TIME HE HAD MORE THAN FIVE

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:54.619
DOZEN FELLOW DEMOCRATS.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.489
BUT HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.457
SAYS IT'S NOT IN THE CARDS.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.325
SHE TOOK THE OPTION OFF THE

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:00.959
TABLE.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.993
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER, SAYS THE

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:08.199
ISSUE IS JUST A DISTRACTION.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.234
BUT THE BIG SHOTS IN THE PARTY

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.069
STILL RISKING MUTINY FROM SOME

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.470
OF THE FRESHMAN UPSTARTS.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.972
AMONG THEM, CONGRESSWOMAN

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.241
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ AND

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.880
RASHIDA TLAIB.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.581
AND GIVING PELOSI A HEADACHE

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:23.381
OVER SOCIALISM.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:24.416
PUSHING THE GREEN NEW DEAL AND

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:31.323
A PLAN TO COMPLETELY DESTROY

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:31.823
THE U.S. ECONOMY.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.125
THIS PAST WEEKEND AOC SHOW JUST

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:33.992
HOW LITTLE SHE UNDERSTANDS

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.562
ABOUT BASIC ECONOMICS.

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:38.630
&gt;&gt; CAPITALISM ISN'T, TO ME, IT

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.932
IS AN IDEOLOGY OF CAPITAL.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.434
IT PUTS CAPITAL, THE MOST

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.403
IMPORTANT THING IS THE

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:48.340
CONCENTRATION OF CAPITOL AND IT

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.742
MEANS THAT WE SEEK AND

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.210
PRIORITIZE PROFIT AND THE

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:56.081
ACCUMULATION OF MONEY ABOVE ALL

00:01:56.082 --> 00:02:03.188
ELSE AND WE SEEK IT AT EVERY

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.222
HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL COST.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:05.457
THAT IS WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.226
AND TO ME, THAT IDEOLOGY IS NOT

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.327
SUSTAINABLE AND CANNOT BE

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:10.162
REDEEMED.KENNEDY: THAT'S WHAT

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:14.533
THAT MEANS.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:14.933
WORDS, YEAH.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.101
NANCY PELOSI DISMISSED THE

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.335
GREEN NEW DEAL.THE GREEN

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:18.370
DREAM IS A NONSTARTER BUT MAKE

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.771
NO MISTAKE THE PARTIES DRIFTING

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.739
LEFTWARD WHETHER SHE LIKES IT

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.339
OR NOT.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.774
AND ALL OF THAT ISN'T ENOUGH,

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.708
DEMOCRATS ALSO FORCED TO DEFEND

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.076
THEIR STANCE ON ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.012
THE SENSIBLE DEMOCRATS CAN

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.413
THINK ILHAN OMAR THAT FIASCO

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.482
AFTER SHE SUGGESTED JEWISH

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.450
LAWMAKERS HAVE A DUAL

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.918
ALLEGIANCE TO ISRAEL.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.887
AMONG OTHER STATEMENTS SHE'S

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:36.221
MADE.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.389
LAWMAKERS VEHEMENTLY DENY THIS.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.794
IT IS A DUCKY PARTY SPLITTING

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.129
APART AT THE SEAMS LIKE A

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.630
TIJUANA NIGHTCLUB?

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.864
AND HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP VIEWS

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.333
THAT TO RETAKE OR MAINTAIN THE

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:48.734
OVAL OFFICE.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.169
WITH ME NOW STRATEGIC

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.038
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.543
2020 CAMPAIGN, MARC LOTTER IS

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:57.843
BACK.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.844
WELCOME BACK.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.778
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.112
KENNEDY.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.080
KENNEDY: RAHM EMANUEL, MAYOR

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.283
CHICAGO, RIGHT-HAND MAN TO

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.684
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND CLINTON, HE

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.420
SAYS THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:15.761
GOING WAY TOO FAR LEFT AND THAT

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:16.428
IS A GIFT TO THE PRESIDENT.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.463
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:18.030
STATEMENT?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.098
&gt;&gt; ANYTHING IS A GIFT I THINK

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.832
IT'S REALITY.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.200
I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.301
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.602
CHOICE IN 2020.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.303
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.304
ECONOMIC SUCCESS WE HAVE SEEN

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:30.176
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:30.876
INVESTMENT IN THE PRIORITIES,

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.178
THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM AND

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.145
CAPITALISM VERSUS A PARTY THAT

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:36.215
HAS GONE SO FAR LEFT THAT EVEN

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.286
DEMOCRATS NOW SEE THAT THE

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.588
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS GONE.

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.822
THE DEPARTING OF YOUR FATHER

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:43.723
AND GRANDFATHER IS NOT THERE

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.324
ANYMORE.

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:50.763
IT'S A PARTY OF SOCIALISM.

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:51.731
KENNEDY: I WOULD TEND TO AGREE

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:52.432
WITH YOU THERE.

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:53.867
I DON'T THINK IS JUST ONE PARTY

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:55.268
AND I DON'T THINK THE COMPETING

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.236
IDEOLOGIES CAN STAY IN THE SAME

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:58.271
PLACE FOR VERY LONG BECAUSE

00:03:58.272 --> 00:03:59.572
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SPLIT

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:00.306
AND IT WILL DEPEND ON WHO THE

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:01.341
NOMINEE IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:02.275
THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS SEEM TO

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.476
BE JOE BIDEN AND BERNIE

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:04.077
SANDERS.

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:07.147
THAT FRESH, YOUNG BLOOD AND

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:12.886
WHOEVER EMERGES VICTORIOUS IN

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:14.354
THE DEMOCRAT NOMINATION

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:15.188
PROCESS, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY A

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.589
LOT ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.890
PARTY.

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:19.659
AND I KNOW DEMOCRATS REALLY

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.326
TRIED TO HEAL THE RIFT FROM

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.895
2016 AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:23.663
THEY HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:24.531
BECAUSE I WAS AFTER NANCY

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:30.303
PELOSI MAKES THAT STATEMENT

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:31.271
ABOUT IMPEACHMENT IS NOT ON THE

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:32.172
TABLE, IT IS TO DIVISIVE.

00:04:32.173 --> 00:04:33.606
YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE AL GREEN

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.542
AND AOC COMPLETELY BUCKING THAT

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:37.210
SAYING NO, NO WE ARE STILL GOOD

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:37.710
WITH IMPEACHMENT.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.178
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:40.446
THEN YOU HAVE THE BILLING OR

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.948
LIBERAL DONORS OUT THERE ANGRY

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:42.849
THAT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS NOT

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.285
FOLLOWING THE PATH.

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:46.753
BUT TO SHOW YOU HOW FAR OUT OF

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.656
SORTS THEY'VE GOTTEN, THE

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:51.692
AFL-CIO PUBLISHED A LETTER

00:04:51.693 --> 00:04:52.459
SAYING WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THE

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.663
GREEN DEAL BECAUSE IT'S GOING

00:04:55.664 --> 00:04:57.164
TO IMPACT OF THEIR HARD-WORKING

00:04:57.165 --> 00:04:59.633
BLUE-COLLAR AMERICANS AND THEIR

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:00.301
FAMILIES.

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:02.369
THEY ARE LOSING LABOR.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.337
THEY HAVE ALREADY LOST THE

00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:03.671
WORKERS.

00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:06.140
BUT THE LABOR LEADERS ARE

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:06.607
FOLLOWING SUIT.

00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:08.375
IT JUST SHOWS YOU HOW FAR LEFT

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:15.683
THEY HAVE GONE.

00:05:15.684 --> 00:05:17.184
AND I THINK MANY DEMOCRATS,

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:18.385
MANY BLUE-COLLAR AMERICANS WHO

00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:19.620
MAY HAVE BEEN

00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:20.721
MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD, MAYBE EVEN

00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:21.989
SLIGHTLY LEFT OF CENTER, HAVE

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.823
TO LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:24.124
RESULTS, MORE MONEY IN THEIR

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:28.229
PAYCHECKS, MANUFACTURING JOBS

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.762
COMING BACK.

00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:29.863
AGAINST A PARTY THIS IS WE WANT

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:31.565
TO ELIMINATE YOUR HEALTH

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:31.932
INSURANCE.

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:33.067
WE WANT TO PAY MONEY TO PEOPLE

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:34.134
WHO DON'T EVEN WANT TO WORK.

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.536
KENNEDY: WE WANT TO ELIMINATE

00:05:35.537 --> 00:05:36.437
THE CHOICE YOU HAVE IN HEALTH

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:37.571
INSURANCE AND WE WANT TO

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:40.307
ELIMINATE ENTIRE SECTORS OF THE

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:43.577
ECONOMY THAT HAPPENED TO EMPLOY

00:05:43.578 --> 00:05:44.545
A LOT OF UNION LABOR LIKE THE

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.481
AIRLINE INDUSTRY.

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:48.983
&gt;&gt; AIRLINE INDUSTRY, AUTOMOBILE

00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:50.351
INDUSTRY.

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:54.088
KENNEDY: MARC, DON'T FORGET THE

00:05:54.089 --> 00:06:00.227
FARMING INDUSTRY!

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:02.263
&gt;&gt; I LIKE COWS.

00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:02.997
KENNEDY: THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

00:06:02.998 --> 00:06:04.031
LISTEN TO CORY BOOKER AND AOC

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:05.266
ON THESE MATTERS.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:06.267
LET'S TALK A LITTLE ABOUT AL

00:06:06.268 --> 00:06:07.735
GREEN AND THE ARTICLES OF

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:08.636
IMPEACHMENT.

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.137
IT IS JUST DIFFERENT WAYS OF

00:06:10.138 --> 00:06:12.239
GOING ABOUT THE SAME THING.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.973
BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE JERRY

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:15.809
NADLER AND ADAM SCHIFF WHO

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.511
THINK THAT THEY ARE MAKING MORE

00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:19.847
NUANCED ARGUMENTS FOR THE SAME

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:20.247
THING.

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:22.116
AND THEY MAY NOT USE THE TERM

00:06:22.117 --> 00:06:23.517
IMPEACHMENT, BUT WHAT THEY ARE

00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:24.451
REALLY TRYING TO DO IS HARM THE

00:06:24.452 --> 00:06:31.692
PRESIDENT SO MUCH THAT HE IS

00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:32.259
RENDERED UNELECTABLE.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:40.868
&gt;&gt; THERE TRYING TO CRIMINALIZE

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.369
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.270
THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY OUR

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:43.971
COUNTRY WORKS.

00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:45.906
THEY HAVE TRIED OVER AND OVER

00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:46.874
AGAIN WITH COUNTLESS

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.175
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:06:48.176 --> 00:06:49.276
WITH THE NEVER-ENDING WITCHHUNT

00:06:49.277 --> 00:06:51.378
STILL NOT SHOWING ANYTHING, NO

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.845
RESULTS FOR IT.

00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:52.546
KENNEDY: DO THINK THAT NANCY

00:06:52.547 --> 00:06:53.814
PELOSI DOES WITH THE RESULTS OF

00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:55.683
THE MUELLER REPORT ARE?AND

00:06:55.684 --> 00:06:56.617
THAT'S WHY SHE'S TRYING TO

00:06:56.618 --> 00:06:58.052
SOFTEN THE BLOW BY CURTAILING

00:06:58.053 --> 00:06:58.819
IMPEACHMENT TALK?

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.121
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF SHE KNOWS

00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:04.425
THE RESULTS OF THE

00:07:04.426 --> 00:07:04.892
INVESTIGATION.

00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:05.860
WHAT I PROBABLY THINK IS THAT

00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:07.194
SHE KNOWS THE RESULTS OF

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:08.229
POLLING.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.931
BECAUSE IF YOU NOTICE, SINCE IT

00:07:09.932 --> 00:07:10.498
PIVOTED AWAY FROM NO

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:11.632
IMPEACHMENT, THEY STARTED

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:12.600
TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:14.001
TRIED TO CARRY THE DAY IN 2016

00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:15.036
AND SO MY GUESS IS, IT'S

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:16.037
STRICTLY A GUESS, IS NOT ABOUT

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:17.939
THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THERE

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.706
ISN'T ANY.

00:07:18.707 --> 00:07:19.640
IT'S ABOUT POLLING BECAUSE MOST

00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:21.142
AMERICANS DON'T BELIEVE IN THE

00:07:21.143 --> 00:07:22.944
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS.

00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:24.312
THEY BELIEVE IN OUR

00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:25.046
CONSTITUTIONAL WAY OF ELECTING

00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:25.947
OUR PRESIDENT, THE VICE

00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:27.515
PRESIDENT AND NO AMOUNT OF

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:28.449
WHINING AND INVESTIGATION WILL

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.750
OVERTURN THAT.

00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:30.451
KENNEDY: SWING STATES IN THE

00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:34.188
RUST BELT RATHER ARE

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:35.690
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THE

00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:38.526
PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:07:38.527 --> 00:07:40.228
IT SEEMS LIKE A FAR LEFT SUPER

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:41.729
SOCIALISTIC MESSAGE, IT WILL

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:47.168
NOT RESONATE WITH THE VOTERS.

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:52.240
-- AND PURPLE DISTRICTS THEY'VE

00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:59.647
TAPPED INTO WHAT THE VOTERS

00:07:59.648 --> 00:08:00.582
RESPONDED TO PEER WHEN YOU

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:01.883
THINK THEY'LL WAKE UP AND

00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:02.851
REALIZE THAT WORK DO YOU HOPE

00:08:02.852 --> 00:08:04.252
THAT THEY REMAIN ASLEEP?&gt;&gt;

00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:05.653
AND I THINK THEY ACTUALLY CAN

00:08:05.654 --> 00:08:08.123
REVERSE THIS TREND BECAUSE YOU

00:08:08.124 --> 00:08:09.424
HAVE SUCH AN ANGRY BASE OUT

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:10.358
THERE OF SUPPORTERS.

00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:11.359
WHETHER THEY ARE DONORS, THOSE

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.361
THAT KNOCK ON DOORS AND FOR ALL

00:08:13.362 --> 00:08:15.263
OF THOSE NEW INCOMING FRESHMEN

00:08:15.264 --> 00:08:16.598
THAT WON IN THE SUBURBAN

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:17.432
DISTRICTS, MANY OF THOSE

00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:19.401
DISTRICTS THAT THE PRESIDENT

00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:20.335
WON IN 2016, THEY WILL NOW FIND

00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:22.370
THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFICULT

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.438
POSITION HAVING TO DEFEND THEIR

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:30.213
COLLEAGUES IN THE DEMOCRATIC
