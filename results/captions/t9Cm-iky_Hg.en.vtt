LEADER McCONNELL THAT SOCIAL

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE THE

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.626
LEADING DRIVERS OF THE DEFICIT

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:46.292
AND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.418
ME SAY THANK YOU TO KSDK AND

00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:58.000
THEIR PARTNERS FOR HAVING US

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.126
TONIGHT.

00:02:58.126 --> 00:02:59.459
I WANT TO FIRST INTRODUCE A

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.584
SPECIAL GUEST IN THE AUDIENCE

00:03:00.584 --> 00:03:02.960

THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.001
I WANT TO SAY TO MY TWO LITTLE

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.626
BOYS AT HOME, THEY'RE SUPPOSED

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:09.418
TO BE IN BED, BUT I'M KIND OF

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:10.001
GUESSING THAT THEY ARE --

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.543
THEY'RE WITH GRANDMA AND

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:12.626
GRANDPA, SO I'M GUESSING THEY'RE

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.001
UP AND PROBABLY WATCHING, SO I

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:15.876
JUST WANT TO SAY, BOYS, WE SURE

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.376
DO LOVE YOU POP TO YOUR

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:20.001
QUESTION, JUDY, I DO NOT SUPPORT

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.334
CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY OR

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.084
MEDICARE.

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:23.000
I DON'T SUPPORT ANY CHANGES TO

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.668
THOSE PROGRAMS FOR ANYONE WHO IS

00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:26.418
CURRENTLY REFERRING BENEFITS OR

00:03:26.418 --> 00:03:29.001
WHO IS GOING TO BE RECEIVING

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.209
BENEFITS ANYTIME IN THE NEAR

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.376
FUTURE.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:33.000
I THINK IT IS VITAL THAT WE

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
PROTECT THESE PROGRAMS THAT

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.084
AMERICANS HAVE PAID INTO WITH

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.668
THEIR HARD-EARNED CASH.

00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:40.001
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.543
DISAGREE WITH SENATOR McCASKILL

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:43.918
ABOUT IS SHE VOTED TO CUT

00:03:43.918 --> 00:03:45.251
$716 BILLION FROM MEDICARE IN

00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.960
ORDER TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.918
I THINK THAT WAS WRONG.

00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:50.418
I THINK THOSE CUTS OUGHT TO BE

00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:52.000
RESTORED AND IF WE WANT TO TALK

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND THE

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.626
DRIVERS OF DEFT SPENDING, I

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:56.376
WOULD START WITH OBAMACARE.

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:58.001
GOING TO COST OVER 2 TRILLION

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.918
MORE OVER THE NEXT DECADE.

00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:02.584
IT HAS PROVEN TO BE OUTRAGEOUSLY

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:04.334
EXPENSIVE FOR FEDERAL TAXPAYERS,

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:07.584
BUT WORSE THAN THAT, IT HAS

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.251
PROVEN TO BE OUTRAGEOUSLY

00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.292
EXPENSIVE FOR THE FAMILIES OF

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:10.626
MISSOURI.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.126
HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THIS STATE

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:15.459
ARE UP 145%, PREMIUMS ARE, SINCE

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:15.793
2013.

00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:19.000
THAT'S BEFORE -- THAT'S BETWEEN

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.876
2013 AND 2017, BY THE WAY.

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:45.000
I'VE HAD FAMILY AFTER FAMILY --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.668
CONDITION AND ALSO YOUNG

00:04:51.668 --> 00:05:03.876
PEOPLE -- REVENUES ARE DOWN AND

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:05.000
WAGES ARE STAGNANT.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.376
IN FACT, WAGES ARE 1.8% LOWER IN

00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:08.960
THIS COUNTRY THAN THEY WERE A

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.543
YEAR AGO.

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.167
THAT IS ALSO ONE OF OUR BIG

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:11.543
PROBLEMS.

00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:14.209
WE SHOULD NOT BE ADDING TO THE

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:15.501
DEFICIT IN A STRONG ECONOMY LIKE

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:16.626
WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:17.960
IT IS THE TAX CUTS.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.751
IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT JOSH

00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:21.000
MENTIONED THE 716 BILLION.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.167
THAT WAS NOT A CUT TO MEDICARE

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:27.626
IN ACA, THAT WAS A CUT TO THE

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:28.876
PROFITS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:29.042
COMPANIES.

00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:31.876
THAT WAS GIVING A HAIRCUT TO THE

00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:33.001
GUARANTEED PROFITS OF THE HEALTH

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:34.000
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM, AND

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.626
WHAT DID WE DO WITH THAT

00:05:38.626 --> 00:05:40.000
$716 BILLION?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
WE FILLED THE DONUT HOLE FOR

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.042
MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION PROGRAM

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.543
PART D SO THAT SENIORS IN

00:05:46.543 --> 00:05:48.543
MISSOURI CAN NOW ENJOY MORE

00:05:48.543 --> 00:05:50.000
PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS WHICH

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.334
THEY DESPERATELY NEED RIGHT NOW.

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:53.001
THE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO CUT

00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:54.042
MEDICARE IS IN FACT JOSH HAWLEY.

00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:57.835
IN HIS LAWSUIT, IF IT IS

00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:00.418
SUCCESSFUL!$!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:02.001
SUCCESSFUL, THAT BENEFIT GOES

00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.751
AWAY AND GUESS WHO GETS A PAY

00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:05.960
DAY?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.710
THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.793
OF $715 BILLION.

00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:09.000
THE PERSON WHO IS ACTUALLY USING

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.501
TAX DOLLARS TO GO TO COURT TO

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:11.918
NOT ONLY GET RID OF EVERY

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.710
CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THE LAW

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.710
THAT MISSOURIANS APPRECIATE, BUT

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.042
ALSO REMOVING FREE PREVENTION

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:19.209
PROGRAMS IN MEDICARE AND

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.251
REMOVING THE BENEFIT FOR THE

00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:24.000
DONUT HOLE IN MEDICARE PART D.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.418
AND THE 145% HE CITES

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.793
CONSTANTLY, THAT IS THE COST ON

00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:30.000
THE EXCHANGES FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.918
DON'T QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES.

00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:34.209
IT IS TOO HIGH, BUT IT'S ONLY 5%

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:35.042
OF MISSOURI.

00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:37.876
WE NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEMS IN

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:39.668
OBAMACARE, NOT THROW IT OUT, AND

00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:42.000
HIS LAWSUIT IS SO RECKLESS

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.292
BECAUSE THERE'S NO BACKUP HERE.

00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:45.793
THERE'S NO BACKUP PLAN FOR

00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:47.000
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IF HE'S

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.001
SUCCESSFUL.

00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:49.418
IF HE BELIEVES WE SHOULD PROTECT

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:50.334
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS --

00:06:50.334 --> 00:06:51.668
TWO MINUTES --

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:52.918
HE SHOULD ASK TOMORROW FOR

00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:56.000
THE CASE TO BE DISMISSED.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.501
Judy: MIKE BUSH.

00:06:56.501 --> 00:07:00.167
Mike: MR. HAWLEY, JUST PIGGY!$!!!!

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:03.000
PIGGYBACKING OFF WHAT THE

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.334
SENATOR SAID, LAST FALL THE

00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:07.501
TREASURY SECRETARY SAID THE TAX

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:08.751
CUT WOULD PAY ITSELF AND PAY

00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:09.209
DOWN DEBT.

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.001
A YEAR LATER, AS JUDY MENTIONED,

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:14.000
THE DEFICIT IS UP, CORPORATE TAX

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.167
PAYMENTS ARE DOWN AND ALL THIS

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:16.459
WITH A STRONG ECONOMY.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.000
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LOWER THE

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.001
DEBT, SHOULDN'T THE TAX CUTS BE

00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:21.001
ON THE TABLE?

00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.501
Hawley: I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF

00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:25.084
RAISING TAXES AND I THINK THE

00:07:25.084 --> 00:07:26.042
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS VERY CLEAR

00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:27.251
ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IF

00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:29.501
THEY REGAIN POWER.

00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:30.876
THIS SEAT HERE IN MISSOURI, THIS

00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:32.376
RACE HERE IN MISSOURI IS GOING

00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:33.251
TO DECIDE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS

00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:35.251
THE SENATE AND IT'S A BIG CHOICE

00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.543
BETWEEN THE PARTY LINE

00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:37.292
LIBERALISM OF SENATOR McCASKILL

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:39.167
AND WHAT YOU VOTED FOR IN 2016

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.459
AND THOSE TWO ARE VERY DIFFERENT

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:40.710
THINGS.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.626
THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE VOTED

00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:43.084
TO GET TAXES DOWN ON WORKING

00:07:43.084 --> 00:07:45.000
FAEMTION AND THE MIDDLE CLASS.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
SENATOR McCASKILL HAD A CHANCE

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.876
TO VOTE FOR A MIDDLE CLASS TAX

00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:48.084
CUT.

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:49.751
SHE VOTED NO AND IN FACT SHE'S

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:52.126
VOTED TO RAISE TAXES OR FEES 200

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:53.960
TIMES WHILE SHE HAS BEEN IN THE

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.876
UNITED STATES SENATE.

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:57.167
THAT IS NOT WHAT THE FAMILIES OF

00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.000
OUR STATE NEED, SO IN ORDER TO

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.126
GET THE DEFICIT DOWN -- BY THE

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:01.626
WAY, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:03.418
DEBT AND DEFICIT EXPLODED UNDER

00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:05.042
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND NOW I NOTICE

00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:06.459
THE DEMOCRATS SAY THAT NOW THAT

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:08.000
THERE'S BEEN A MIDDLE CLASS TAX

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.543
CUT, NOW SUDDENLY THEY HAVE A

00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:10.918
PROBLEM WITH IT, BUT I WOULD SAY

00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:11.001
THIS.

00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:12.584
WE'VE GOT TO GET SPENDING UNDER

00:08:12.584 --> 00:08:14.000
CONTROL AND I WOULD START WITH

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.001
OBAMACARE.

00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:16.167
IT HAS BEEN A GIVEAWAY TO BIG

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:17.876
INSURANCE AND BIG PHARMA.

00:08:17.876 --> 00:08:19.334
BIG INSURANCE AND BIG PHARMA

00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:22.376
TOGETHER WROTE OBAMACARE.

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:23.126
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

00:08:23.126 --> 00:08:25.000
GETTING RECORD PROFITS.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.835
THEY'RE DOING GREAT AND I'M

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:27.626
SURPRISED TO HEAR SENATOR

00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:28.793
McCASKILL SAY THAT SHE'S FINE

00:08:28.793 --> 00:08:30.292
WITH THE PRICE INCREASES IN THIS

00:08:30.292 --> 00:08:30.459
STATE.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:31.751
THE AVERAGE PRICE INCREASE ON

00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:33.918
THE EXCHANGE NOW UP TO ALMOST

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:37.918
$500 A MONTH IN PREMIUMS.

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:39.543
MAYBE SHE CAN AFFORD THAT.

00:08:39.543 --> 00:08:41.000
MOST MISSOURI FAMILIES CANNOT.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.876
MISSOURI FAMILY AFTER MISSOURI

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:43.626
FAMILY COMES TO ME AND SAYS THEY

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:46.918
HAVE DESPERATE FOR HELP.

00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:47.793
THE DESERVE IT.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.084
Judy: MR. HAWLEY, VERY

00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:50.668
QUICKLY TO GET BACK TO THE

00:08:50.668 --> 00:08:51.418
ORIGINAL QUESTION.

00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:53.459
ARE YOU SAYING THAT MEDICARE AND

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:54.209
SOCIAL SECURITY DON'T NEED IN

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:56.835
ANY WAY TO BE REINED IN.

00:08:56.835 --> 00:08:58.292
Hawley: I WOULD IN THE

00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:00.126
SUPPORT CUTS TO MEDICARE AND --

00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:01.084
Judy: AND THEY ARE NOT

00:09:01.084 --> 00:09:02.209
DRIVERS TO THIS DEFICIT.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.126
Hawley: I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.292
TOUCH THEM.

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.000
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S QUITE A BIT

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.543
OF SPENDING WITH THEM, BUT THESE

00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:11.501
ARE PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES

00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:12.835
HAVE TO BE KEPT.

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:16.000
Judy: THE NEXT QUESTION GOES

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.209
TO SENATOR McCASKILL.

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:20.167
McCaskill: DO I GET -- I JUST

00:09:20.167 --> 00:09:21.626
WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT THE RULES

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:21.918
ARE.

00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:23.042
DO WE BOTH ANSWER QUESTIONS OR

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:24.001
JUST ONE OF US.

00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:25.918
Judy: IF THERE'S SOMETHING

00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:28.501
THAT MR. HAWLEY SAID YOU WANT TO

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.960
RESPOND TO, WE'RE GIVING YOU

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.000
TIME TO DO SO.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
McCaskill: I DIDN'T GET A

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.001
CHANCE TO ANSWER MIKE BUSH'S

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:34.292
QUESTION.

00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:36.209
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.793
REMEMBER THAT WE WERE IN A

00:09:37.793 --> 00:09:39.543
DRAMATIC RECESSION AFTER THE

00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:42.668
BUSH ADMINISTRATION, LOSING

00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:44.000
$800,000 JOBS A MONTH AND, OF

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.626
COURSE, WE HAD TO GO TO

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:46.543
EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES TO PULL

00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:47.876
OURSELVES OUT OF THE RECESSION

00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:49.501
AND THE DEFICIT DID GET TOO

00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:49.751
HIGH.

00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:51.626
AND THE ENTIRE TIME, THE OTHER

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:53.000
PARTY WAS SCREAMING ABOUT THE

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
DEBT AND DEFICIT.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.376
IT GOT TO OVER A TRILLION

00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:56.543
DOLLARS, BUT GUESS WHAT?

00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:58.793
THEN WE WENT TO WORK AND WE CUT

00:09:58.793 --> 00:09:59.918
IT IN HALF.

00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:01.626
AND NOW WE'RE HER NOT IN THE

00:10:01.626 --> 00:10:03.209
MIDDLE OF -- HERE WE ARE NOT IN

00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:04.876
THE MIDDLE OF A RECESSION AND

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.209
IT'S GOING BACK UP AGAIN.

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:08.000
IN FACT, THE INCREASE TO THE

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.167
DEBT, 62 BILLION OF IT IS JUST

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:10.292
INTEREST.

00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:11.418
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LOVES TO

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:12.876
TALK ABOUT DEBT AND DEFICIT

00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:14.251
UNTIL THEY'RE IN CHARGE, AND

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:17.292
THEN IT'S CRICKETS.

00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:18.835
IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRICKETS.

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.251
YES, WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL OF

00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:20.584
IT.

00:10:20.584 --> 00:10:22.000
NO CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY NO,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.084
CUTS TO MEDICARE.

00:10:23.084 --> 00:10:25.000
AS I SAID, JOSH HAWLEY IS

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.501
PROPOSING CUTS TO MEDICARE BY

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:28.626
HIS LAWSUIT.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:30.876
Hawley: THAT'S NOT -- I JUST

00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:32.960
HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.334
IT'S FLATLY FALSE.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:35.835
ONLY ONE PERSON ON THIS STAGE

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.001
HAS VOTED TO CUT MEDICARE

00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:37.960
SPENDING AND IT'S SENATOR

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.126
McCASKILL.

00:10:38.126 --> 00:10:40.001
YOU CAN GO LOOK IT UP.

00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:41.126
SHE CAN CHARACTERIZE IT AND PUT

00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:44.000
AS MUCH LIPSTICK ON IT AN IS SHE

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.167
WANTS, BUT THE TRUTH IS, SHE

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.918
VOTED TO CUT $716 BILLION FROM

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:51.459
MEDICARE TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE.

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:53.167
I CAN DEBATE THE MERITS OF IT,

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:55.292
BUT I DON'T SUPPORT THE CUTS.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:56.418
I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THAT.

00:10:56.418 --> 00:10:57.668
Judy: THE NEXT QUESTION GOES

00:10:57.668 --> 00:10:58.876
TO SENATOR McCASKILL.

00:10:58.876 --> 00:11:00.334
MOST OF THE QUESTIONS TONIGHT

00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:02.626
ARE GOING TO BE ON DOMESTIC

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:04.000
POLICY, BUT AS UNITED SENATOR,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
YOU HAVE OVERVITE OVER FOREIGN

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
POLICY AS WELL.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.042
THIS IS A QUESTION ABOUT U.S.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.000
RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.751
AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:15.710
SAUDI JOURNALIST JAMAL

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.543
KHASHOGGI, ALL THE ATTENTION HAS

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.000
BEEN FOCUSED ON THE SAUDI

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.835
GOVERNMENT AND THE CROWN PRINCE.

00:11:19.835 --> 00:11:20.835
PACED ON WHAT YOU KNOW, DO YOU

00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:22.459
BELIEVE THAT HE WAS COMPLICIT IN

00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:24.876
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A HORRIFIC

00:11:24.876 --> 00:11:27.376
MURDER AND IF SO, WHAT SPECIFIC

00:11:27.376 --> 00:11:28.668
ACTION SHOULD THE U.S. TAKE?

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:30.209
SHOULD IT BE A CUTBACK IN

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:33.001
MILITARY AID, SOME SORT OF

00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:36.418
ECONOMIC SANCTION OR SOME OTHER

00:11:36.418 --> 00:11:38.251
STEP, OR IS THE ALLIANCE TOO

00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:40.668
IMPORTANT TO TAMPER WITH?

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:42.084
McCaskill: I BELIEVE IF IT IS

00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:44.918
SHOWN THAT THE PRINCE OF SAUDI

00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:47.418
ARABIA WAS INVOLVED IN ORDERING

00:11:47.418 --> 00:11:50.584
THE MURDER OF THIS JOURNALIST IN

00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:53.000
A BRUTAL FASHION, AS IS BEING

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.710
REPORTED IN TURKISH PRESS, THEN

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.876
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ON THE

00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:57.000
TABLE.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.459
YOU KNOW, WE ARE A BEACON TO THE

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:00.960
WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.042
DEMOCRACY AND OUR VALUES.

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:04.710
WE HAVE A ROLE IN THE WORLD.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.000
I DO NOT THINK WE CAN ABANDON

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.793
OUR PLACE ON ON TOP OF THE HILL

00:12:09.793 --> 00:12:11.668
TELLING THE REST THE WORLD THAT

00:12:11.668 --> 00:12:12.418
WE APPRECIATE FREEDOM OF THE

00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:13.960
PRESS AND WE BELIEVE IN HUMAN

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.876
RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY, AND THEN

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:19.001
LOOK THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE IT

00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:21.668
MIGHT CAUSE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF

00:12:21.668 --> 00:12:23.000
SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.126
TRANSACTIONS.

00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:26.751
SO I BELIEVE THERE MUST BE -- I

00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:31.626
THINK THE MAGNITSKY SANCTIONS

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.918
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE, I THINK

00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:35.000
OTHER SANCTIONS WOULD BE

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
APPROPRIATE, BUT THIS IS A VERY

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
SERIOUS SITUATION AND I HOPE

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.668
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE

00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:40.000
SAUDI GOVERNMENT TO WHITE WASH

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.334
THIS IF IN FACT THE FACTS ARE

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:42.626
PROVEN.

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:43.626
THEY'RE NOT EVEN BRIEFING

00:12:43.626 --> 00:12:45.459
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW, JUDY O WHAT

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:46.292
ACTUALLY THEY KNOW IN THE

00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:47.501
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.000
WE'RE NOT -- WE'VE BEEN DENIED A

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.292
BOB CORKER HAS SAID THAT THEY

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:52.876
HAVE TOLD HIM NO, THEY WON'T

00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:54.000
EVEN GIVE HIM A BRIEF.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.167
OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, WE

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:57.000
HEAR, BELIEVES THERE'S

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.668
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT

00:12:57.668 --> 00:12:59.793
THIS WAS AN ORDERED HIT BY THE

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:00.543
SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

00:13:00.543 --> 00:13:01.126
Judy: IN HAWLEY.

00:13:01.126 --> 00:13:03.042
Hawley: I THINK WE NEED TO

00:13:03.042 --> 00:13:05.001
GET THE FACTS AND I THINK

00:13:05.001 --> 00:13:06.376
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS DEMANDED

00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:08.000
THE FACTS FROM THE SAUDI

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.292
GOVERNMENT, HAS GIVEN THEM A

00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:10.626
DEADLINE, WE WANT THE FACTS BY

00:13:10.626 --> 00:13:11.835
THIS DATE.

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:12.835
WORKING WITH THE TURKISH

00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:13.960
GOVERNMENT AS WELL TO GET

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.334
EVERYTHING THEY KNOW AND IF

00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:17.042
INDEED THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT HAS

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:19.126
BEEN INVOLVED OR IN ANY WAY IN

00:13:19.126 --> 00:13:21.000
THE DEATH OF THIS JOURNALIST,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.710
THEN I THINK THAT ALL OPTIONS DO

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.001
NEED TO BE ON THE TABLE AND THAT

00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:29.001
THE CONSEQUENCES NEED TO BE

00:13:29.001 --> 00:13:29.376
SEVERE.

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:32.000
I THINK PRESIDENCY HAS PURSUED A

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.876
POLICY OF STRENGTH ABROAD, WHICH

00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:35.501
I AGREE WITH, CONFRONTING THOSE

00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:37.167
WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO HARM THIS

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:38.835
COUNTRY, CONFRONTING THOSE WHO

00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:40.000
ATTEMPTED TO RIP OFF THIS

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.001
COUNTRY.

00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:42.626
I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING.

00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:44.876
FOR TOO LONG WE HAD A POLICY OF

00:13:44.876 --> 00:13:46.584
WEAKNESS AND APPEASEMENT ABROAD.

00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:47.501
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK

00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:48.334
TO THAT.

00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:49.918
I KNOW A SENATOR McCASKILL'S

00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:52.000
PARTY SUPPORTED A POLICY OF

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
WEAKNESS AND APPEASEMENT ABROAD

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.543
FOR YEARS.

00:13:54.543 --> 00:13:55.292
BARACK OBAMA TALKED ABOUT

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:56.251
LEADING FROM BEHIND.

00:13:56.251 --> 00:14:00.000
IF YOU LEAD FROM BEHIND, YOU GET

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.918
LEFT BEHIND.

00:14:00.918 --> 00:14:02.543
THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD THIS

00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:02.960
POLICY STRAIGHT.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.000
Judy: BOTH OF YOU ARE SAYING

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE, EVEN

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.543
IF IT MEANS UPSETTING U.S. ALLY

00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:10.876
ISRAEL, WHICH IS VERY SUPPORTIVE

00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:11.167
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.042
POLICY APPROACH TO SAUDI ARABIA.

00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:13.751
SENATOR McCASKILL?

00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:14.543
McCaskill: I THINK THE

00:14:14.543 --> 00:14:15.835
PROBLEM IS WE'VE GOT -- WE'RE

00:14:15.835 --> 00:14:18.000
TRYING TO CHECK IRAN.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.376
THAT IS THE COMPLICATED PART

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:21.000
HERE AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S AT THE

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.751
TOP OF ISRAEL'S LIST IS THEY ARE

00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:27.626
VERY CONCERNED THAT THERE IS A

00:14:27.626 --> 00:14:28.960
UNITED FRONT AGAINST IRAN AND

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.000
MAYOR MISDEEDS IN A VERY --

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
THEIR MISDEEDS IN A VERY

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.876
DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT

00:14:33.876 --> 00:14:34.876
THERE ARE TIMES WE HAVE TO SAY

00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:36.751
TO OUR ALLIES, WE CAN'T LOOK THE

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.000
OTHER WAY ON THIS.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.251
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT JOSH

00:14:40.251 --> 00:14:42.418
WOULD SAY THAT I SOMEHOW SUPPORT

00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:42.751
APPEASEMENT.

00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:43.668
I DON'T THINK MY COLLEAGUES ON

00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:44.960
THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.292
WOULD AGREE WITH HIM.

00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:49.000
I GET CHEWED ON BY THE LEFT IN

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.626
MY PARTY FOR MY VIEW THAT THERE

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:54.000
IS PEACE TO STRENGTH AND MY

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.292
SUPPORT OF THE INCREASES TO THE

00:14:55.292 --> 00:14:56.000
MILITARY BUDGET.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
IT HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT RECORD

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
OF MINE AND YES, SOMETIMES IT

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.376
MEANS I SEPARATE FROM MY PARTY,

00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:01.793
BUT THAT'S I THINK WHAT

00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:03.167
MISSOURIANS DEMAND OF ME, THAT I

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:07.501
DON'T ALWAYS TAKE A PARTY LINE.

00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:08.251
Judy: THE ISRAEL POINT.

00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:09.292
Hawley: I THINK THAT'S AN

00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:09.918
IMPORTANT ONE.

00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:11.292
I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF DOING

00:15:11.292 --> 00:15:13.001
ANYTHING THAT END DANGERS OUR

00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:13.459
ALLY ISRAEL.

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:16.501
IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE TO BE

00:15:16.501 --> 00:15:18.668
TOUGH WITH SAUDI ARABIA IF THEY

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.126
PARTICIPATED, BUT WHEN THE COMES

00:15:20.126 --> 00:15:22.000
TO ISRAEL, SENATOR McCASKILL

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.710
VOTED -- OR WASN'T SUPPORTIVE OF

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.001
THE DISASTROUS IRAN DEAL.

00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:26.584
YOU TALK ABOUT TURNING YOUR BACK

00:15:26.584 --> 00:15:27.710
ON THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.501
SHE ALSO SUPPORTED MILITARY

00:15:29.501 --> 00:15:30.584
CUTS, DRASTIC TO THE BONE CUTS

00:15:30.584 --> 00:15:31.918
TO OUR MILITARY.

00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:33.793
I'VE GOT A SISTER WHO'S A

00:15:33.793 --> 00:15:34.418
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER IN THE

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:35.584
UNITED STATES NAVY, SHE'S TOLD

00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:37.000
ME ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THOSE

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.960
CUTS ON TROOP MORALE AND

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.710
READINESS THAT SENATOR McCASKILL

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.376
HAS SUPPORTED.

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:41.710
SHE DID THAT BECAUSE IT WAS THE

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.418
PARTY LINE AND I THINK WE DON'T

00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:45.918
NEED A PARTY LINE LIBERAL IN

00:15:45.918 --> 00:15:46.126
WASHINGTON.

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:47.000
THAT'S MY CRITICISM.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.918
Judy: SENATOR McCASKILL, YOU

00:15:48.918 --> 00:15:51.126
WANT TO RESPOND OR WE HAVE

00:15:51.126 --> 00:15:52.084
ANOTHER FOLLOW-UP?

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.584
McCaskill: JOSH'S CAMPAIGN

00:15:53.584 --> 00:15:54.751
HAS A TORTURED RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:55.167
THE TRUTH.

00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:56.418
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

00:15:56.418 --> 00:15:57.751
THERE WERE CUTS THAT WERE AGREED

00:15:57.751 --> 00:15:59.626
TO BY BOTH PARTIES AT A TIME

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.209
WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:04.251
OUT HOW TO CAP SPENDING WHEN

00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:05.793
REPUBLICANS WERE WORRIED ABOUT

00:16:05.793 --> 00:16:08.459
DEFICITS, BUT I HAVE VOTED -- I

00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:10.710
JUST VOTED ALONG WITH PRESIDENT

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.167
TRUMP, AGREEING WITH PRESIDENT

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:13.000
TRUMP THAT WE NEEDED A BIG

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.918
INCREASE TO OUR MILITARY BUDGET.

00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:16.626
Hawley: BUT SHE VOTED FOR THE

00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:16.876
CUTS.

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:18.501
SHE DID VOTE FOR THE CUTS THAT

00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:20.501
WERE DEVASTATING TO OUR

00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:20.710
MILITARY.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.626
Judy: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A

00:16:22.626 --> 00:16:23.751
QUESTION NOW FROM MISSOURI

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:27.001
VOTERS AND TO NINE NETWORK'S

00:16:27.001 --> 00:16:30.251
RUTH EZELL.

00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:34.292
I'M HERE WITH MARIA FROM

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:34.543
ARNOLD.

00:16:34.543 --> 00:16:35.251
HER QUESTION IS TO ATTORNEY

00:16:35.251 --> 00:16:37.000
GENERAL HAWLEY AND HER QUESTION

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.918
IS GUN VIOLENCE.

00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:39.000
ON THIS THURSDAY EVENING A

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.334
YEAR AGO, I WAS IN THE E.R. OF A

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.960
ST. LOUIS PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.000
WITH MY 9-YEAR-OLD SON WHEN A

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.751
CODE SILVER WAS ANNOUNCED.

00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:51.292
THAT MEANS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER.

00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:52.584
DURING THIS VERY HOUR, I WAS

00:16:52.584 --> 00:16:54.876
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:16:54.876 --> 00:16:56.793
BARRICADE THE DOOR TO MY SON'S

00:16:56.793 --> 00:16:58.584
ROOM AND HIDE HIM.

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:01.209
GUN VIOLENCE HAS AFFECTED MY

00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:03.793
FAMILY, MY COMMUNITY, AND IS

00:17:03.793 --> 00:17:05.000
PERVASIVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.584
I AM FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY WHEN I

00:17:07.584 --> 00:17:10.710
SEE CALLS FOR COMMON SENSE LAWS

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.376
TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE MET WITH

00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:19.126
POWERFUL RESISTANCE FROM THE GUN

00:17:19.126 --> 00:17:21.418
LOBBY FOLLOWED BY INACTION FROM

00:17:21.418 --> 00:17:22.751
OUR ELECTED LEADERS.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.209
IF ELECTED, WHAT WOULD YOU DO

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:26.501
ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC.

00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:27.835
Hawley: MARIA, FIRST OF ALL,

00:17:27.835 --> 00:17:28.751
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.

00:17:28.751 --> 00:17:30.000
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.251
EVENING AND I'M SORRY TO HEAR

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:32.626
ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE AND AS A

00:17:32.626 --> 00:17:36.543
FATHER OF TWO LITTLE BOYS, I CAN

00:17:36.543 --> 00:17:39.710
ONLY BE -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.000
COURAGE.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.501
YOU KNOW, LET ME JUST SAY, JUST

00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:43.960
START THERE, THAT AS A FATHER OF

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.000
TWO YOUNG SONS, WHEN MY WIFE AND

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.835
I DROP OUR BOYS OFF AT SCHOOL OR

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:50.710
SEND THEM ANYWHERE, WE WANT THEM

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.167
TO BE SAFE.

00:17:52.167 --> 00:17:54.126
YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DESERVE TO

00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:55.793
BE SAFE JUST LIKE YOUR SON

00:17:55.793 --> 00:17:56.710
DESERVES TO BE SAFE AND YOU

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:57.418
DESERVE TO BE SAFE.

00:17:57.418 --> 00:17:59.292
I THINK WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING

00:17:59.292 --> 00:18:01.000
TO KEEP FIREARMS OUT OF THE

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
HANDS OF CRIMINALS, FOLKS WHO

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.376
ARE DANGEROUS, THE MENTALLY ILL

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.084
AND INSTABLE.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.167
HERE'S WHERE I WOULD START.

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:07.918
I THINK WE NEED TO FIX THE

00:18:07.918 --> 00:18:09.000
NATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.584
SYSTEM.

00:18:09.584 --> 00:18:10.918
WE HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK

00:18:10.918 --> 00:18:12.000
SYSTEM, A NATIONAL SYSTEM, BUT

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.292
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.000
BECAUSE THERE'S A GIANT LOOPHOLE

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.543
RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

00:18:16.543 --> 00:18:18.001
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH

00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:18.126
RECORDS.

00:18:18.126 --> 00:18:20.334
IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOLKS TO SEE

00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:21.334
HAS THERE BEEN A MENTAL HEALTH

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:23.918
INCIDENT IN THIS PERSON'S PAST.

00:18:23.918 --> 00:18:26.000
WE NEED TO FIX THAT BACKGROUND

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.668
CHECK SYSTEM SO FOLKS CAN SEE --

00:18:27.668 --> 00:18:29.751
YOU LOOK AT MANY OF THE TERRIBLE

00:18:29.751 --> 00:18:31.126
ATROCITIES COMMITTED IN JUST IN

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:32.918
RECENT MONTHS, OFTENTIMES, I

00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:34.459
THINK MOST TIMES THE PERPETRATOR

00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:36.084
UNFORTUNATELY HAS SOME SORT OF

00:18:36.084 --> 00:18:37.626
MENTAL HEALTH INCIDENT IN THEIR

00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:38.292
BACKGROUND THAT MAYBE LOCAL LAW

00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:39.710
ENFORCEMENT KNEW ABOUT, BUT THE

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.918
FOLKS WHO SOLD THE FIREARMS

00:18:40.918 --> 00:18:42.251
DIDN'T OR THE FEDERAL AGENTS

00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:42.626
DIDN'T.

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:44.543
WE NEED TO FIX THAT SYSTEM.

00:18:44.543 --> 00:18:45.584
CONGRESS COULD HAVE DONE THIS.

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:47.042
THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO DO IT,

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:49.376
BUT THEY HAVEN'T AND FRANKLY, IT

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:51.710
BAFFLES ME AS TO WHY.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.418
SENATOR McCASKILL VOTED AGAINST

00:18:52.418 --> 00:18:54.501
INCLUDING HEALTH RECORDS IN THE

00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:55.209
BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM.

00:18:55.209 --> 00:18:56.584
I THINK THAT WAS WRONG.

00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:57.918
I KNOW THAT WAS THE PARTY LINE,

00:18:57.918 --> 00:18:59.292
BUT I THINK THAT WAS WRONG.

00:18:59.292 --> 00:19:00.835
I THINK WE NEED SOMEBODY TO

00:19:00.835 --> 00:19:02.334
STAND UP AND SAY WE NEED TO DO

00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:03.251
WHAT IS RIGHT.

00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:04.292
I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND

00:19:04.292 --> 00:19:08.000
AMENDMENT, I BELIEVE IN

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
PROTECTING THE SECOND AMENDMENT

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.292
RIGHT OF EVERYBODY AND

00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:12.000
LAW-ABIDING FOLKS.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.418
WE HAVE TO KEEP WEAPONS OUT OF

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:15.042
HANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE CRIMINAL,

00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:16.209
THOSE WHO ARE DANGEROUS AND

00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:18.459
PROVEN TO BE SO, AND PROTECT THE

00:19:18.459 --> 00:19:20.376
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF

00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:21.918
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS TO WE CAN

00:19:21.918 --> 00:19:23.251
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:24.376
Judy: THANK YOU.

00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:25.000
SENATOR McCASKILL.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
McCaskill: OF COURSE, I

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.751
BUT WHAT THE NRA HAS PED DEAD

00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:33.292
TELLED FOR YEARS IS YOU CAN'T --

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:35.251
PED DELD FOR YEARS IS YOU CAN'T

00:19:35.251 --> 00:19:36.751
SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND

00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:37.960
GUN SAFETY AT THE SAME TIME, AND

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.418
YOU CAN.

00:19:38.418 --> 00:19:41.626
I WAS RAISED IN A HOUSEHOLD IN

00:19:41.626 --> 00:19:43.376
RURAL MISSOURI WHERE MY DAD

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:44.334
HUNTING WAS SOMETHING WE ALL

00:19:44.334 --> 00:19:47.918
KNEW WE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE

00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:51.167
WAY BECAUSE IT WAS WAY MORE

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:53.167
IMPORTANT TO HIM AT CERTAIN

00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:54.918
TIMES OF YEAR THAN WE WERE.

00:19:54.918 --> 00:19:56.876
WE CAME VERY CLOSE TO PASSING

00:19:56.876 --> 00:19:57.626
THE BACKGROUND CHECKS.

00:19:57.626 --> 00:20:00.000
THE NRA WAS WORKING AS HARD AS

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.793
THEY COULD TO STOP UNIVERSAL

00:20:01.793 --> 00:20:02.376
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:04.251
I SUPPORT BANNING BUMP STOCKS.

00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:05.001
YOU WOULD THINK AFTER LAS VEGAS

00:20:05.001 --> 00:20:06.084
THAT WOULD BE SO EASY FOR US TO

00:20:06.084 --> 00:20:08.000
GET DONE, BUT NO.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.334
THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE,

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.209
INCLUDING MOST OF THE

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.042
REPUBLICANS, THAT ARE AFRAID OF

00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:12.876
THE NRA.

00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:15.000
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO -- WE HAVE

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.126
OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:17.209
TELLING US THIS THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:19.000
THAT ARE SO DANGEROUS,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.251
TERRORISTS, THAT THEY CAN'T FLY

00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:21.793
IN OUR AIRPLANES, BUT THEY CAN

00:20:21.793 --> 00:20:24.000
GO TO ANY GUN SHOW IN AMERICA

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.167
AND IN FACT TERRORISTS MAGAZINES

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:27.334
HAVE ADVISED THEM TO DO SO, AND

00:20:27.334 --> 00:20:28.418
GET WEAPONRY.

00:20:28.418 --> 00:20:31.793
THESE ARE THE THINGS WE MUST DO.

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:33.000
COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TURN ON

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.251
YOUR TELEVISION AND YOU CAN TELL

00:20:36.251 --> 00:20:38.042
WHO IS SUPPORTING WHO.

00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:40.418
THE NRA IS VERY MUCH IN JOSH

00:20:40.418 --> 00:20:42.209
HAWLEY'S CORNER BECAUSE THEY

00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:44.000
BELIEVE HE WILL TOE THEIR LINE

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.918
AND BE AGAINST UNIVERSAL

00:20:44.918 --> 00:20:47.543
BACKGROUND CHECKS, BE AGAINST

00:20:47.543 --> 00:20:50.501
BANNING BUMP STOCKS, BEING

00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:52.584
AGAINST NO FLY, NO BUY.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.084
I ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVE VERY

00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:55.543
MUCH WE SHOULD GET THOSE THINGS

00:20:55.543 --> 00:20:57.167
Judy: YOU WANT TO RESPOND?

00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:58.001
Hawley: IT IS TRUE THAT

00:20:58.001 --> 00:20:59.292
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS AN F

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:01.000
RATING FROM THE NRA AND IT'S

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.835
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY

00:21:03.835 --> 00:21:05.459
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS FOR

00:21:05.459 --> 00:21:06.001
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS AND I

00:21:06.001 --> 00:21:06.459
DON'T.

00:21:06.459 --> 00:21:08.251
THE POINT IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:10.126
DO THAT TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM

00:21:10.126 --> 00:21:10.543
VIOLENCE.

00:21:10.543 --> 00:21:11.292
I AM MISSOURI'S CHIEF LAW

00:21:11.292 --> 00:21:12.793
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:15.000
IT IS MY JOB TO PROTECT THE

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.584
PEOPLE OF MISSOURI.

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:16.960
THAT IS SOMETHING I'M COMMITTED

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.000
TO, BOTH AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.626
OFFICER AND AS A FATHER AND

00:21:19.626 --> 00:21:20.334
THERE ARE STEPS WE CAN TAKE

00:21:20.334 --> 00:21:22.001
RIGHT NOW AND SHOULD TAKE.

00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:22.793
FRANKLY, SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN

00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:24.084
A LONG TIME AGO IF FOLKS HAD

00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:25.292
BEEN WILLING TO CROSS THE PARTY

00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:25.668
LINE.

00:21:25.668 --> 00:21:28.167
I WILL TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF

00:21:28.167 --> 00:21:29.000
THIS STATE.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.292
Judy: JO MANNIES HAS A

00:21:30.292 --> 00:21:30.584
FOLLOW-UP.

00:21:30.584 --> 00:21:32.292
Jo: BOTH OF YOU, I GUESS

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.000
SENATOR McCASKILL GETS IT FIRST.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.042
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:36.626
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ARMING

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:37.584
TEACHERS, GETTING FEDERAL MONEY

00:21:37.584 --> 00:21:39.543
TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ARM

00:21:39.543 --> 00:21:40.000
TEACHERS.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.876
THAT'S BEEN A RATHER

00:21:40.876 --> 00:21:41.334
CONTROVERSIAL IDEA.

00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:43.000
SOME FEEL STRONGLY, SOME DON'T.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.042
WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON THAT

00:21:44.042 --> 00:21:46.000
AND HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.042
THAT?

00:21:46.042 --> 00:21:47.000
McCaskill: I KNOW WHAT THE

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.418
NEEDS ARE RIGHT NOW.

00:21:48.418 --> 00:21:49.668
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE

00:21:49.668 --> 00:21:49.918
DEFICIT.

00:21:49.918 --> 00:21:51.126
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A

00:21:51.126 --> 00:21:52.334
PRIMARY FUNDER OF EDUCATION IN

00:21:52.334 --> 00:21:53.042
THIS COUNTRY.

00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:54.459
THAT'S DONE AT THE STATE AND

00:21:54.459 --> 00:21:55.501
LOCAL LEVEL.

00:21:55.501 --> 00:21:56.126
I WOULD NEVER SUPPORT USING

00:21:56.126 --> 00:21:58.876
FEDERAL MONEY WITH ALL THE NEEDS

00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:00.710
WE HAVE TO BUY GUNS FOR SCHOOLS.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.126
IF LOCAL COMMUNITIES WANT TO DO

00:22:02.126 --> 00:22:04.000
THAT, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.001
SHOULD BE PROHIBITED AS LONG AS

00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:07.835
THERE WAS PROPER TRAINING, BUT I

00:22:07.835 --> 00:22:09.251
WOULD BE AGAINST USING FEDERAL

00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:10.292
DOLLARS TO DO THAT.

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:11.793
Hawley: I THINK IT'S UP TO

00:22:11.793 --> 00:22:13.000
THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.334
I THINK LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:15.918
CAN MAKE THESE DECISIONS ABOUT

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.751
WHAT'S BEST TO THEM, BUT I THINK

00:22:17.751 --> 00:22:19.876
WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT

00:22:19.876 --> 00:22:20.751
PROTECTING OUR SCHOOLS.

00:22:20.751 --> 00:22:21.835
WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS -- WE

00:22:21.835 --> 00:22:23.793
SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND

00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:25.042
RESOURCES PROTECTING THINGS LIKE

00:22:25.042 --> 00:22:26.584
FOOTBALL GAMES AND ROCK CONCERTS

00:22:26.584 --> 00:22:27.876
AND THAT'S FINE, THAT'S GOOD,

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:29.584
BUT AS A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG

00:22:29.584 --> 00:22:30.960
CHILDREN, I WANT TO SEE OUR

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.042
SCHOOLS PROTECTED.

00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:33.000
WHETHER TEACHERS SHOULD BE ARMED

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.459
OR NOT, AGAIN, THESE A DECISION

00:22:35.459 --> 00:22:37.918
FOR LOCAL FOLKS TO MAKE.

00:22:37.918 --> 00:22:38.668
Judy: DO YOU THINK FEDERAL

00:22:38.668 --> 00:22:40.543
MONEY SHOULD GO INTO ARMING

00:22:40.543 --> 00:22:40.751
TEACHERS?

00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:42.126
Hawley: I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:22:42.126 --> 00:22:44.000
BETTER TO GIVE FEDERAL MONEY TO

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.543
A SCHOOL SAFETY PROGRAMS WHERE

00:22:45.543 --> 00:22:46.835
LOCAL FOLKS CAN DECIDE HOW TO DO

00:22:46.835 --> 00:22:48.918
IT AND HOW TO USE IT AND WHAT

00:22:48.918 --> 00:22:51.001
PROGRAMS WORK BEST FOR THEM.

00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:52.000
Judy: WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.292
QUESTION FROM A MISSOURI VOTER

00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:54.292
AND BACK TO RUTH.

00:22:54.292 --> 00:22:57.626
WE RECEIVED THIS POSTING FROM

00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:57.793
CHRISTY.

00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:59.251
SHE LIVES IN AFFTON.

00:22:59.251 --> 00:23:01.710
SHE WRITES, WHERE DOES EACH OF

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.000
THE CANDIDATES STAND ON TARIFFS?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.501
THEY HURT MISSOURI FARMERS AND

00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:08.459
WHAT'S YOUR STANCE ON GIVING

00:23:08.459 --> 00:23:09.209
FARMERS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE?

00:23:09.209 --> 00:23:10.334
Judy: THIS IS A QUESTION FOR

00:23:10.334 --> 00:23:12.543
SENATOR McCASKILL AND, OF

00:23:12.543 --> 00:23:14.001
COURSE, A REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT

00:23:14.001 --> 00:23:16.000
TRUMP'S TARIFFS, MAINLY AGAINST

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.668
CHINA AND THEN THE RETALIATORY

00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:20.334
TARIFFS THAT HAVE AFFECT THE

00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:20.668
UNITED STATES.

00:23:20.668 --> 00:23:22.793
McCaskill: YEAH, THE TARIFFS

00:23:22.793 --> 00:23:25.251
ARE BRUTAL FOR MISSOURI.

00:23:25.251 --> 00:23:27.918
YOU KNOW, WE -- I LOVE WHERE I

00:23:27.918 --> 00:23:28.000
LIVE.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.001
I LOVE OUR STATE, AND I LOVE

00:23:30.001 --> 00:23:32.918
EVERY PART OF IT, INCLUDING THE

00:23:32.918 --> 00:23:34.251
STRENGTH WE HAVE IN AGRICULTURE,

00:23:34.251 --> 00:23:37.000
AND OUR ECONOMY IS SO DEPENDENT

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.376
ON THE EXPORTING OF AGRICULTURAL

00:23:40.376 --> 00:23:41.793
GOODS.

00:23:41.793 --> 00:23:42.835
THESE TARIFFS HAVE KILLED

00:23:42.835 --> 00:23:43.710
COMMODITY PRICES.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.876
THERE'S NOT A BEAN FARMER IN

00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:45.918
MISSOURI THAT'S GOING TO COME

00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:47.751
OUT EVEN THIS YEAR AND THE HELP

00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:49.251
THAT THEY'RE BEING GIVEN,

00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:51.042
FRANKLY, IN SOME INSTANCES IS

00:23:51.042 --> 00:23:51.459
INSULTING.

00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:54.543
CORN, A PENNY A BUSHEL?

00:23:54.543 --> 00:23:57.292
ALMOST NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

00:23:57.292 --> 00:23:59.876
THEY SAID A BUCK 60 FOR BEANS

00:23:59.876 --> 00:24:02.000
AND NOW SONNY PERDUE HAS JUST

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL ONLY BE

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.710
80 KRENSS AND THEY CAN'T EVEN

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.000
PROMISE THEY'RE GOING TO GET

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.042
REST OF THE 80 CENTS.

00:24:08.042 --> 00:24:09.751
FARMERS ARE TRYING TO PLAN AND

00:24:09.751 --> 00:24:11.584
THE MARKET IN CHINA IS BEING

00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:11.835
DESTROYED.

00:24:11.835 --> 00:24:13.000
WE WORKED YEARS TO ESTABLISH A

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.418
MARKET FOR BEANS IN CHINA.

00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:16.751
IT TOOK A LOT OF MONEY.

00:24:16.751 --> 00:24:18.751
THE FARMERS OF THIS STATE ARE --

00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:20.918
ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OR FOUR

00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:22.000
ROWS OF BEANS IN MISSOURI GOES

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.835
TO CHINA AND THAT MARKET IS NOT

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:26.000
GOING TO COME BACKS, EVEN IF THE

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.876
TARIFFS GO AWAY BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:24:27.876 --> 00:24:28.918
FILLING THAT HOLE WITH IMPORTS

00:24:28.918 --> 00:24:31.042
FROM OTHER STATES AND PAYING

00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:33.001
THEIR FARMERS TO GROW MORE

00:24:33.001 --> 00:24:33.751
BEANS.

00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:36.126
SO IT IS REALLY A PROBLEM HERE

00:24:36.126 --> 00:24:39.876
AND THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE -- I

00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:41.459
MEAN, JOSH HAWLEY HAS SAID I

00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:42.918
DISAGREE WITH NOTHING THE

00:24:42.918 --> 00:24:44.000
PRESIDENT HAS DONE.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.626
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I HAVEN'T

00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:47.001
DISAGREED ON SOMETHING.

00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:48.918
AND THIS IS WHERE A SENATOR FROM

00:24:48.918 --> 00:24:51.334
MISSOURI HAS TO STAND TALL FOR

00:24:51.334 --> 00:24:52.459
AGRICULTURE AND SAY THIS --

00:24:52.459 --> 00:24:54.334
THESE TARIFFS ARE HURTING OUR

00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:56.000
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.501
SAY NOTHING OF SMALL

00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:00.334
MANUFACTURING AND THE RAW COSTS.

00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:06.000
WE'VE GOT A NAIL FACTORY IN

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.751
POPLAR BLUFF THAT IS HANGING ON

00:25:07.751 --> 00:25:09.042
BY A FINGERNAIL RIGHT NOW

00:25:09.042 --> 00:25:10.751
BECAUSE OF THE RAW COSTS GOING

00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:12.376
UP OF THEIR INPUT COSTS AND I

00:25:12.376 --> 00:25:14.626
HAVE DOZENS OF MANUFACTURERS I'M

00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:16.084
ADVOCATING FOR RIGHT NOW FOR AN

00:25:16.084 --> 00:25:18.000
EXCLUSION PROCESS THAT'S CHAOTIC

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.710
AND INCOMPETENT.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.042
Judy: TWO MINUTES,

00:25:20.042 --> 00:25:20.918
MR. HAWLEY.

00:25:20.918 --> 00:25:21.668
Hawley: FIRST OF ALL, AS

00:25:21.668 --> 00:25:22.710
SOMEBODY THAT COMES FROM A

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.918
FARMING FAMILY, THIS IS AN ISSUE

00:25:23.918 --> 00:25:25.710
THAT MATTER AND LOT TO ME AND

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:26.960
I'M PROUD TO HAVE SUPPORT OF THE

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.918
FARMERS ACROSS OUR STATE.

00:25:28.918 --> 00:25:31.626
THE MISSOURI FARM BUREAU HAS

00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:33.042
ENDORSED ME AND MANY OTHERS.

00:25:33.042 --> 00:25:34.292
I AGREE WITH SENATOR McCASKILL

00:25:34.292 --> 00:25:38.000
ON ONE THING, DEDO NEED -- WE DO

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.668
NEED A SENATOR THAT STANDS TALL

00:25:40.668 --> 00:25:42.000
FOR MISSOURIANS AND IT ISN'T HER

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.001
AND I WISH IT HAD BEEN.

00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:45.751
FARMERS TELL ME AS I TRAVEL ALL

00:25:45.751 --> 00:25:47.668
OVER THE STATE THAT SHE WON'T

00:25:47.668 --> 00:25:48.918
EVEN MEET WITH THEM.

00:25:48.918 --> 00:25:49.876
PRESIDENT OF THE FARM BUREAU

00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:52.626
TOLD ME SHE ONES TAKE HIS PHONE

00:25:52.626 --> 00:25:53.000
CALLS.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.751
MISSOURI, YOU'RE IS OUR NUMBER

00:25:54.751 --> 00:25:55.710
ONE INDUSTRY IN THE STATE.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:56.876
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT,

00:25:56.876 --> 00:25:57.918
MAYBE SHE CAN TELL US.

00:25:57.918 --> 00:25:59.084
THE TRUTH IS WE NEED SOMEBODY

00:25:59.084 --> 00:26:00.376
WHO'S GOING TO STAND UP FOR

00:26:00.376 --> 00:26:01.960
FARMERS AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.501
AS TO THE TARIFFS, LISTEN, WE'RE

00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:04.501
IN A TRADE WAR.

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:06.001
THERE'S A TRADE WAR THAT WE DID

00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:08.167
NOT START, CERTAINLY OUR FARMERS

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:09.001
DIDN'T START IT.

00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:10.626
CHINA STARTED IT MANY YEARS AGO,

00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:11.960
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.626
WAR, I'M FOR WINNING IT AND I

00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:14.751
THINK WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND

00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:16.000
LOOK TO WIN IT.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.668
I THINK THIS PRESIDENT HAS HAD

00:26:18.668 --> 00:26:19.751
RECENT SUCCESS THAT'S TREMENDOUS

00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:21.418
IN CANADA AND MEXICO, OUR TWO

00:26:21.418 --> 00:26:23.167
LARGEST TRADING PARTNERS, ABOUT

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:24.584
75% OF OUR AGRICULTURE EXPORT

00:26:24.584 --> 00:26:25.209
DEVELOP THERE.

00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:27.000
THAT'S A GREAT VICTORY.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.876
I WISH SENATOR McCASKILL WOULD

00:26:27.876 --> 00:26:28.960
HAVE BEEN WILLING TO STAND UP

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.876
EARLIER TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:26:29.876 --> 00:26:31.000
BEEN RIPPING OFF OUR FARMERS OR

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.334
JUST PHRASE THE PRESIDENT FOR

00:26:32.334 --> 00:26:34.000
THE GOOD WORK HE'S -- PRAISE THE

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
PRESIDENT FOR THE GOOD WOSH HE'S

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.251
DONE WITH THIS GRAEMENT.

00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:37.918
I DO DISAGREE WITH THE SENATOR

00:26:37.918 --> 00:26:38.626
ON AID.

00:26:38.626 --> 00:26:39.960
I THINK IF OUR FARMERS ARE

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.000
GETTING RETALIATED AGAINST BY

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.126
CHINA, THEY DESERVE TO BE

00:26:43.126 --> 00:26:44.000
SUPPORTED, BUT WHEN THE

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.501
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HIS AID

00:26:45.501 --> 00:26:47.376
PACKAGE, HE SAID IT WAS PICKING

00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:48.960
WINNERS AND LOSERS, INTERVENING

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.418
IN THE MARKET.

00:26:49.418 --> 00:26:52.167
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I WANT TO

00:26:52.167 --> 00:26:54.209
PICK LOSERS AND WINNERS.

00:26:54.209 --> 00:26:55.209
I WANT TO PICK MISSOURI FARMERS

00:26:55.209 --> 00:26:57.584
AS WINNERS AND CHINA AS A

00:26:57.584 --> 00:26:57.710
LOOSER.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.793
McCaskill: BY THE WAY, WHEN I

00:26:58.793 --> 00:27:00.334
SAID THAT, IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS

00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:01.376
TALKING TO FARMERS.

00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:02.793
THEY DON'T WANT A HANDOUT, THEY

00:27:02.793 --> 00:27:03.459
WANT A MARKET.

00:27:03.459 --> 00:27:04.918
IT WAS ME HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:27:04.918 --> 00:27:07.543
WITH FARMER, NOT THEIR LOBBYIST,

00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:08.459
NOT A TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT

00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.000
MAKES THEIR DECISIONS ON A WHOLE

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.626
LOT OF STUFF OTHER THAN FARMING

00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:12.751
STUFF.

00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:13.626
IT WAS FARMERS.

00:27:13.626 --> 00:27:16.584
I CALL THEM, I GO TO THEM, I'M

00:27:16.584 --> 00:27:20.418
ON THEIR FARMS, AND THEY FRANKLY

00:27:20.418 --> 00:27:22.000
KNEW THAT THIS BUCK-60 WAS TO

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.668
THE GOING TO GET THEM WELL ON

00:27:23.668 --> 00:27:27.000
BEANS, MUCH LESS A PENNY A

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.543
BUSHEL ON CORN.

00:27:28.543 --> 00:27:33.000
YES, IT'S GREAT, AND I DO, IF

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
YOU ASK ME WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.167
HAS DONE, GETTING A NEW DEAL ON

00:27:36.167 --> 00:27:37.835
NAFTA HAS GREAT PROMISE FOR

00:27:37.835 --> 00:27:38.626
CONTINUITY AND STABILITY FOR

00:27:38.626 --> 00:27:39.334
FARMERS IN MISSOURI.

00:27:39.334 --> 00:27:41.584
THAT'S TERRIFIC, I'M NOT AFRAID

00:27:41.584 --> 00:27:42.960
TO COMPLIMENT THE PRESIDENT, BUT

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.209
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS TRADE

00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:45.626
WAR WITH CHINA HURTS AND IT'S

00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:47.376
GOING TO HURT FOR A LONG TIME

00:27:47.376 --> 00:27:48.710
FOR MISSOURI AG.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.001
Judy: THE NEXT QUESTION IS

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.209
FOR IN HAWLEY AND JO MANNIES HAS

00:27:52.209 --> 00:27:52.418
THAT.

00:27:52.418 --> 00:27:55.209
Jo: WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

00:27:55.209 --> 00:27:56.626
YOUR FAVORITE TOPIC, HEALTHCARE.

00:27:56.626 --> 00:27:59.626
THIS IS A TWO-PARTER, SO I HAVE

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:01.000
ONE VERSION FOR THE ATTORNEY

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.376
GENERAL, ONE VERSION FOR THE

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.710
SENATOR, SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.000
WHEN YOU WANT TO RESPOND.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.376
OKAY, FIRST FOR HAWLEY.

00:28:07.376 --> 00:28:08.710
YOU ARE PART OF A LAWSUIT THAT

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.167
WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE

00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:12.084
PROVISIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE

00:28:12.084 --> 00:28:13.876
CARE ACT, INCLUDING THE

00:28:13.876 --> 00:28:14.793
PROTECTIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:15.584
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER

00:28:15.584 --> 00:28:18.501
PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING

00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:20.000
CONDITIONS WITHOUT PAYING HIGHER

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.209
PREMIUMS.

00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:22.292
YOU SAY CONGRESS CAN KEEP THAT

00:28:22.292 --> 00:28:25.000
PROTECTION WITHOUT THE ACA, BUT

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.167
INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY THEIR

00:28:26.167 --> 00:28:27.376
PRICES WILL SKYROCKET IF THEY

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:29.501
HAVE TO COVER PRE-EXISTING

00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:32.626
CONDITIONS WITHOUT A MANDATE

00:28:32.626 --> 00:28:34.000
THAT EVERYONE HAVE INSURANCE.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.543
YOUR PLAN THAT YOU PROPOSED

00:28:35.543 --> 00:28:37.000
EARLIER HAS GOTTEN MIXED

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.084
REVIEWS.

00:28:37.084 --> 00:28:38.626
SOME SAY IT WON'T WORK.

00:28:38.626 --> 00:28:40.001
HOW WOULD YOU RESOLVE THIS,

00:28:40.001 --> 00:28:41.459
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DO WANT TO

00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:42.835
GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING?

00:28:42.835 --> 00:28:44.167
Hawley: WELL, THANK YOU, JO.

00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:45.584
FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY THIS

00:28:45.584 --> 00:28:47.501
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S PERSONAL

00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:49.000
TO ME, AS YOU KNOW.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.209
EARLIER THIS YEAR, MY WIFE AND I

00:28:51.209 --> 00:28:54.793
LEARNED THAT MY OLDER BOY, OUR

00:28:54.793 --> 00:28:57.292
5-YEAR-OLD, HAS A RARE CHRONIC

00:28:57.292 --> 00:28:57.835
ILLNESS.

00:28:57.835 --> 00:29:00.418
IT'S A HIP AND JOINT CONDITION,

00:29:00.418 --> 00:29:02.000
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, AND

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.418
WE'RE ON THE FRONT END OF THAT

00:29:04.418 --> 00:29:06.292
JOURNEY WITH HIM AND AS A

00:29:06.292 --> 00:29:07.501
FAMILY, AND I THINK THERE'S

00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:09.001
PROBABLY HARDLY A FAMILY IN

00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:10.376
MISSOURI WHO HASN'T BEEN THROUGH

00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:12.668
THAT EITHER WITH A CHILD OR FOR

00:29:12.668 --> 00:29:14.042
YOURSELF OR CERTAINLY WITH A

00:29:14.042 --> 00:29:15.376
LOVED ONE.

00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:16.334
WRANGLING WITH THE INSURANCE

00:29:16.334 --> 00:29:17.584
COMPANIES, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:29:17.584 --> 00:29:20.334
IS THIS IN NETWORK, IS IT NOT,

00:29:20.334 --> 00:29:22.000
CAN WE GET IT COVERED AND

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
THINKING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.710
DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.001
IT'S AN IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT

00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:25.668
TOPIC.

00:29:25.668 --> 00:29:27.000
THE LAWSUIT IS ABOUT OBAMACARE.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
IT'S ABOUT GETTING RID OF

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.501
OBAMACARE, AND YES, I THINK WE

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:30.876
SHOULD REPEAL AND REPLACE

00:29:30.876 --> 00:29:32.334
OBAMACARE BECAUSE I THINK THAT

00:29:32.334 --> 00:29:33.501
PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING

00:29:33.501 --> 00:29:35.835
CONDITIONS LIKE MY BOY ARE BEING

00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:37.001
HELD HOSTAGE TO THE DRAMATIC

00:29:37.001 --> 00:29:38.418
PRICE INCREASES THAT THEY'RE

00:29:38.418 --> 00:29:39.334
BEING FORCED TO PAY.

00:29:39.334 --> 00:29:42.001
I WAS JUST TALKING TO A FAMILY

00:29:42.001 --> 00:29:43.918
IN SIKESTON DOWN IN THE BOOT

00:29:43.918 --> 00:29:45.584
HEEL TELLING ME ABOUT THEIR SON

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:48.376
WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

00:29:48.376 --> 00:29:50.167
HIS INSURANCE USED TO BE $300 A

00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:52.710
MONTH AND NOW IT'S $1200 A MONTH

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.167
AND INCREASING.

00:29:55.167 --> 00:29:55.751
AGAIN, SENATOR McCASKILL SEEMS

00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:57.626
TO MAKE LIGHT OF THAT, BUT FOR

00:29:57.626 --> 00:30:00.710
MOST FAMILIES, THAT IS SIMPLY

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.918
UNAFFORDABLE AND UNSUSTAINABLE.

00:30:01.918 --> 00:30:03.084
THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO REPEAL

00:30:03.084 --> 00:30:04.584
AND REPLACE.

00:30:04.584 --> 00:30:06.000
I FAVOR FORCING INSURANCE

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.084
COMPANIES TO COVER PEOPLE LIKE

00:30:07.084 --> 00:30:08.584
MY OWN BOY WITH PRE-EXISTING

00:30:08.584 --> 00:30:09.167
KNLS IN THE LAW.

00:30:09.167 --> 00:30:11.334
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS, JO,

00:30:11.334 --> 00:30:12.418
TO TAKE THAT INTO EFFECT.

00:30:12.418 --> 00:30:13.918
YOU CAN DO IT LIKE THE STATE OF

00:30:13.918 --> 00:30:16.000
MAINE HAS DONE IT WITH A FORM OF

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.459
REINSURANCE.

00:30:16.459 --> 00:30:17.960
YOU CAN DO IT WITH FEDERAL

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.376
EXCHANGES, DO IT WITH DIRECT

00:30:19.376 --> 00:30:19.626
SUBSIDIES.

00:30:19.626 --> 00:30:20.793
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS.

00:30:20.793 --> 00:30:22.334
MY QUESTION IS WILL SENATOR

00:30:22.334 --> 00:30:23.918
McCASKILL SUPPORT ANY PLAN, ANY

00:30:23.918 --> 00:30:26.376
PLAN TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH

00:30:26.376 --> 00:30:27.084
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT

00:30:27.084 --> 00:30:28.126
ISN'T OBAMACARE?

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.501
ANY PLAN THAT ISN'T OBAMACARE.

00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:31.501
WHAT WE SEE FROM THE DEMOCRATS

00:30:31.501 --> 00:30:34.001
IS A FULL-THROATED DEFENSE OF

00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:36.000
OBAMACARE DAY AND NIGHT, BUT

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.543
VERY LITTLE TALK ABOUT ACTUALLY

00:30:37.543 --> 00:30:39.000
PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.418
CONDITIONS UNLESS IT'S ABOUT

00:30:40.418 --> 00:30:40.918
OBAMACARE.

00:30:40.918 --> 00:30:41.501
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE

00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:43.334
HELD HOSTAGE TO THAT PARTY LINE.

00:30:43.334 --> 00:30:47.543
I THINK WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO

00:30:47.543 --> 00:30:51.000
WILL WORK ACROSS THE AISLE.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Jo: LET ME ASK THE SENATOR

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.918
THIS RELATED QUESTION.

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.209
YOUR CAMPAIGN CENTER FEES IS

00:30:55.209 --> 00:30:57.000
YOUR SUPPORT FOR REQUIRING

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.001
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER

00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:59.459
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT YOU

00:30:59.459 --> 00:31:00.084
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AFFORDABLE

00:31:00.084 --> 00:31:01.501
CARE ACT ARE MONTHS PERFECT.

00:31:01.501 --> 00:31:03.960
WHAT ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS AND

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.292
HOW -- IS NOT PERFECT.

00:31:05.292 --> 00:31:07.000
WHAT ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS AND

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.292
HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THEM,

00:31:08.292 --> 00:31:09.918
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S STILL A

00:31:09.918 --> 00:31:10.876
REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:31:10.876 --> 00:31:13.001
AND REPUBLICANS STILL CONTROL

00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:13.793
CONGRESS?

00:31:13.793 --> 00:31:15.209
McCaskill: I THINK IT WILL BE

00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:15.418
DIFFICULT.

00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:16.960
THEY PROMISED TO REPEAL AND

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.501
REPLACE OVER AND OVER AND OVER

00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:18.876
AGAIN.

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:20.209
THEY'RE THIS CHARGE.

00:31:20.209 --> 00:31:20.960
THEY WOULDN'T GET ENOUGH

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.084
REPUBLICAN VOTES FOR THEIR

00:31:22.084 --> 00:31:23.251
REPLACE PLAN BECAUSE IT WAS

00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:26.751
GOING TO HURT PEOPLE SO MUCH.

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:27.501
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE

00:31:27.501 --> 00:31:28.835
RELUCTANT TO VOTE FOR IT.

00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:30.042
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS COME

00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:31.626
TOGETHER AND FIX THE PARTS WE

00:31:31.626 --> 00:31:33.000
CAN FIX.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.042
I AGREE WITH JOSH HAWLEY WE CAN

00:31:34.042 --> 00:31:35.251
DO MORE WITH REINSURANCE.

00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:37.126
WE HAVE A BILL TO DO THAT.

00:31:37.126 --> 00:31:38.876
IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL WITH

00:31:38.876 --> 00:31:42.042
SUSAN COLLINS AND SENATOR

00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:42.710
NELSON.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.000
MITCH McCONNELL PROMISED TO VOTE

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.543
ON IT AND HE REFUSED TO LET US

00:31:46.543 --> 00:31:47.543
VOTE ON IT.

00:31:47.543 --> 00:31:49.751
THERE'S ANOTHER BILL TO DO A

00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:51.000
PLAN THAT BRINGS MORE PEOPLE

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.042
INTO THE SCHAPTION AT CHEAPER

00:31:52.042 --> 00:31:53.543
RATES AND ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE NOT

00:31:53.543 --> 00:31:55.918
BEING ALLOWED TO VOTE ON IT.

00:31:55.918 --> 00:31:57.000
LET'S REALLY DRILL DOWN ON WHAT

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.960
JOSH HAWLEY IS SAYING.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.751
BY THE WAY, I AM SO SORRY THAT

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:02.292
YOU INTERPRETED MY RETWEETING OF

00:32:02.292 --> 00:32:04.000
A BLOG THAT I WAS BEING CRITICAL

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.042
OF YOUR FAMILY.

00:32:05.042 --> 00:32:06.751
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

00:32:06.751 --> 00:32:08.000
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
YOUR SON IS CUTE AND I CAN SEE

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.793
YOU AND YOUR WIFE LOVE HIM VERY

00:32:11.793 --> 00:32:13.459
MUCH, SO I CERTAINLY HAD NO

00:32:13.459 --> 00:32:15.668
INTENTION, I'M NOT RUNNING MY

00:32:15.668 --> 00:32:17.876
CAMPAIGN ON ATTACKING SOMEBODY'S

00:32:17.876 --> 00:32:18.000
FAMILY.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.376
SOMEBODY IS, BUT IT'S NOT ME.

00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:26.000
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT IT IS --

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.543
THIS IS ALL ABOUT A CAMPAIGN NOW

00:32:28.543 --> 00:32:30.126
WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL HAWLEY

00:32:30.126 --> 00:32:32.000
BECAUSE HE HAS NO BACKUP IF HIS

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.001
LAWSUIT IS SUCCESSFUL.

00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:35.167
THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS

00:32:35.167 --> 00:32:36.710
AND MEDICARE GO AWAY, THE

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.626
INSURANCE COMPANIES GET A PAY

00:32:38.626 --> 00:32:38.918
DAY.

00:32:38.918 --> 00:32:43.000
THERE'S NO MORE FREE PREVENTION

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.960
PROGRAMS, NO MORE KIDS ON YOUR

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.960
POLICIES UNTIL THEY'RE 26, NO

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.000
MORE LIMIT ON WHAT INSURANCE

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.835
COMPANIES CAN SPEND ON CEOS AND

00:32:51.835 --> 00:32:53.084
HIRING PEOPLE TO DENY YOUR

00:32:53.084 --> 00:32:53.584
CLAIM.

00:32:53.584 --> 00:32:54.793
HERE'S WHAT TELLS YOU A LOT.

00:32:54.793 --> 00:32:55.960
FIRST OF ALL, THE LAWYERS ASK

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.292
THE JUDGES NOT TO DECIDE THE

00:32:57.292 --> 00:33:00.001
CASE UNTIL AFTER NOVEMBER.

00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:02.000
WONDER WHY?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.126
SECONDLY, WHEN A REPUBLICAN

00:33:03.126 --> 00:33:04.251
TRIED TO GIVE HIM COVER AND

00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:06.751
INTRODUCE A BILL TO COVER BRIE

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:07.251
EXISTING CONDITIONS AND JOSH

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:08.126
HAWLEY IMMEDIATELY TWEETED HE

00:33:08.126 --> 00:33:10.918
WAS FOR IT, GUESS WHAT THE BILL

00:33:10.918 --> 00:33:11.000
DID?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.793
IT SAID YOU COULD -- HAD TO GIVE

00:33:12.793 --> 00:33:13.918
INSURANCE FOR PRE-EXISTING

00:33:13.918 --> 00:33:15.042
CONDITIONS, BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE

00:33:15.042 --> 00:33:17.418
TO COVER THE PRE-EXISTING

00:33:17.418 --> 00:33:17.668
CONDITION.

00:33:17.668 --> 00:33:19.292
Judy: MR. HAWLEY, DO YOU WANT

00:33:19.292 --> 00:33:20.000
TO RESPOND?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.126
Hawley: WELL, THERE'S A LOT

00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:23.584
THERE TO RESPOND TO.

00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:26.042
LISTEN, HERE'S THE BASIC --

00:33:26.042 --> 00:33:28.000
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.918
SENATOR McCASKILL WILL NOT

00:33:28.918 --> 00:33:30.000
SUPPORT ANY PLAN TO COVER PEOPLE

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.251
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS

00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:33.209
THAT ISN'T OBAMACARE.

00:33:33.209 --> 00:33:34.710
OBAMACARE WAS WRITTEN TO HOLD

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.292
HOSTAGE PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING

00:33:37.292 --> 00:33:38.000
CONDITIONS SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.668
OBAMACARE SUPPOSEDLY TO GET

00:33:39.668 --> 00:33:40.793
THERE COVERAGE AND THAT'S

00:33:40.793 --> 00:33:42.543
EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S BASED THIS

00:33:42.543 --> 00:33:44.000
CAMPAIGN ON AND THAT'S SIMPLY

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.042
FALSE.

00:33:44.042 --> 00:33:45.626
WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE AND WE

00:33:45.626 --> 00:33:47.960
MUST WITH PRE-EXISTING

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.126
CONDITIONS, BUT THEY SHOULDN'T

00:33:49.126 --> 00:33:50.876
BE FORCED TO PAY THE PRICES

00:33:50.876 --> 00:33:52.167
THEY'RE PAYING NOW.

00:33:52.167 --> 00:33:53.918
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE

00:33:53.918 --> 00:33:54.668
NARROWING OF NETWORKS WE'RE

00:33:54.668 --> 00:33:55.501
SEEING ALL OVER THE STATE

00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:56.543
BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.

00:33:56.543 --> 00:33:58.251
I WILL WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES

00:33:58.251 --> 00:33:59.292
WITH ANYBODY WHO SHARES THE GOAL

00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:01.000
OF PROTECTING THOSE WITH

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.126
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND I

00:34:02.126 --> 00:34:03.876
THINK, TOO, YOUNG PEOPLE ON

00:34:03.876 --> 00:34:05.376
THEIR PARENTS INSURANCE, BUT I

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.876
DO NOT THINK FOLKS SHOULD BE

00:34:06.876 --> 00:34:08.000
HELD HOSTAGE TO THE LIBERAL

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.918
FAILED EXPERIMENT OF OBAMACARE

00:34:08.918 --> 00:34:10.376
AND WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT

00:34:10.376 --> 00:34:12.668
JUST TOGETHER THE PARTY LINE ON

00:34:12.668 --> 00:34:12.960
THIS.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.835
Judy: SENATOR McCASKILL, DID

00:34:13.835 --> 00:34:15.835
YOU WANT TO RESPOND?

00:34:15.835 --> 00:34:17.418
I HAVE A QUICK FOLLOW-UP.

00:34:17.418 --> 00:34:18.000
McCaskill: SURE.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.001
Judy: THAT IS FOR MR. HAWLEY.

00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:22.000
LET'S TALK SPECIFICS FOR JUST A

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.084
MOMENT.

00:34:23.084 --> 00:34:24.042
THE REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVES TO

00:34:24.042 --> 00:34:25.000
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON --

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.376
THE LANGUAGE ON PRE-EXISTING

00:34:26.376 --> 00:34:27.126
CONDITIONS, THIS IS BOTH THE

00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:29.334
HOUSE AND SENATE VERSION, WOULD

00:34:29.334 --> 00:34:30.918
ASSURE COVERAGE OF PRE-EXISTING,

00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:33.001
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT WOULD

00:34:33.001 --> 00:34:34.626
ALLOW STATES TO GIVE INSURANCE

00:34:34.626 --> 00:34:37.000
COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO RAISE

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.251
RATES AND NOT COVER CERTAIN

00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:39.000
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.543
SO MY QUESTION IS, IS THAT

00:34:40.543 --> 00:34:42.876
ACCEPTABLE TO YOU OR IS IT

00:34:42.876 --> 00:34:43.751
PREFERABLE TO GO TO THE LANGUAGE

00:34:43.751 --> 00:34:46.001
IN THE ORIGINAL -- IN THE

00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:46.960
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH YOU

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.000
FILED SUIT AGAINST?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.292
Hawley: THAT IS NOT

00:34:49.292 --> 00:34:51.710
ACCEPTABLE TO ME, WHAT YOU JUST

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.000
PROPOSED, JUDY, AND CERTAINLY

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
THAT'S NOT MY -- OR WHAT YOU

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
JUST READ.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.918
THAT'S NOT MY PROPOSAL.

00:34:56.918 --> 00:34:58.000
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.251
FIRST OF ALL, FOR INSURANCE

00:34:59.251 --> 00:34:59.668
COMPANIES.

00:34:59.668 --> 00:35:01.626
SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER, JO,

00:35:01.626 --> 00:35:02.626
THAT I THINK THE INSURANCE

00:35:02.626 --> 00:35:04.334
COMPANIES SAY WE NEED THIS OR

00:35:04.334 --> 00:35:04.501
THAT.

00:35:04.501 --> 00:35:06.626
THEY'RE GETTING RICH OFF

00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:06.918
OBAMACARE.

00:35:06.918 --> 00:35:08.167
THEY HAVE THESE OPEN-ENDED

00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:09.751
PAYMENTS THAT OBAMACARE GIVES

00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:09.918
THEM.

00:35:09.918 --> 00:35:11.001
THAT'S YOUR TAX DOLLARS.

00:35:11.001 --> 00:35:13.292
THEY'RE MAKING RECORD PROFITS.

00:35:13.292 --> 00:35:14.084
SENATOR McCASKILL TAKES MORE

00:35:14.084 --> 00:35:16.084
MONEY THAN ANYBODY IN CONGRESS

00:35:16.084 --> 00:35:17.000
FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.251
EXCEPT FOR ONE OTHER LIBERAL, SO

00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:20.167
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON THE

00:35:20.167 --> 00:35:20.793
INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

00:35:20.793 --> 00:35:21.793
BUT I WILL SAY THIS.

00:35:21.793 --> 00:35:23.167
I THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT TO

00:35:23.167 --> 00:35:24.459
REQUIRE THEM TO COVER PEOPLE

00:35:24.459 --> 00:35:26.000
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ON

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.501
THE SAME TERMS AS EVERYBODY

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:29.960
ELSE, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.042
SHOULD PROVIDE A GUARANTEE FOR

00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:31.209
THAT.

00:35:31.209 --> 00:35:33.042
WE CAN DO THAT, IT WOULD BE MUCH

00:35:33.042 --> 00:35:34.626
LEST COSTLY THAN OBAMACARE, BUT

00:35:34.626 --> 00:35:37.000
IT WOULD COVER THE FOLKS WHO

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.835
NEED THE COVERAGE.

00:35:38.835 --> 00:35:39.876
McCaskill: YOU KNOW, THIS IS

00:35:39.876 --> 00:35:40.835
SO FRUSTRATING.

00:35:40.835 --> 00:35:41.751
HE HAS NO PLAN.

00:35:41.751 --> 00:35:44.334
HE HAS NO PLAN THAT WILL WORK.

00:35:44.334 --> 00:35:45.960
THE ONLY PLAN HE'S PUT OUT THERE

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.793
WAS A PRESS RELEASE PLAN AND

00:35:48.793 --> 00:35:51.001
BOTH ED TOWARD BOARDS SAID --

00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:53.001
EDITORIAL BOARDS SAID IT WAS

00:35:53.001 --> 00:35:54.626
ALMOST LAUGHABLE HOW UNWORKABLE

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.209
IT WAS.

00:35:56.209 --> 00:35:59.000
YOU DON'T GO TO COURT AND GET

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.376
RID OF PROTECTIONS WHEN THERE'S

00:36:00.376 --> 00:36:01.710
NO BACKUP, WHEN PEOPLE WILL BE

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.668
IN A FREE FALL.

00:36:02.668 --> 00:36:03.835
YOU WAIT AND WORK WITH PEOPLE

00:36:03.835 --> 00:36:05.501
AND TRY TO FIX IT AND CHANGE IT.

00:36:05.501 --> 00:36:06.543
THAT'S WHY I HAVE A RECORD THAT

00:36:06.543 --> 00:36:07.793
I WORK ACROSS THE AISLE.

00:36:07.793 --> 00:36:10.126
I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK

00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:12.001
WITH ANYBODY TO MAKE SURE THESE

00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:13.584
PROTECTIONS STAY IN PLACE, BUT I

00:36:13.584 --> 00:36:15.042
SURE AS HECK WOULD NOT GO TO

00:36:15.042 --> 00:36:16.084
COURT WITH TAXPAYER MONEY AND

00:36:16.084 --> 00:36:18.167
GET RID OF IT BEFORE THE BACKUP

00:36:18.167 --> 00:36:19.710
WAS IN PLACE.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.960
Judy: A QUESTION FROM

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.835
MISSOURI VOTER.

00:36:24.835 --> 00:36:27.042
RUTH EZELL.

00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:29.000
WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.334
SENATOR AND IT REGARDS POLICE

00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:32.126
COMMUNITY RELATIONS.

00:36:32.126 --> 00:36:33.501
WHAT LEGISLATION IN YOUR

00:36:33.501 --> 00:36:34.960
OPINION CAN BE DRAFTED TO HELP

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.042
EASE RACIAL TENSION BETWEEN

00:36:36.042 --> 00:36:37.084
CITIZENS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:36:37.084 --> 00:36:40.251
WITHOUT INCREASING LAW

00:36:40.251 --> 00:36:41.000
ENFORCEMENT?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.001
Judy: THAT'S TO SENATOR

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:45.584
McCASKILL, CORRECT?

00:36:45.584 --> 00:36:47.001
EITHER AND BOTH.

00:36:47.001 --> 00:36:48.167
Judy: STARTING WITH SENATOR

00:36:48.167 --> 00:36:48.751
McCASKILL.

00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:49.918
WHEN I WAS THE PROSECUTOR

00:36:49.918 --> 00:36:51.459
OVER IN KANSAS CITY, WE HAD A

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.793
HUGE PROBLEM AND IT WAS A LAW --

00:36:53.793 --> 00:36:56.000
IT WAS A HOMICIDE RATE AND WHAT

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.126
WE FOUND WAS WE WERE HAVING A

00:36:57.126 --> 00:36:59.376
GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY GETTING

00:36:59.376 --> 00:37:01.334
WITNESSES TO HELP US SOLVE

00:37:01.334 --> 00:37:03.000
HOMICIDES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.543
TRUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:37:03.543 --> 00:37:06.084
NO ONE WANTED TO TALK TO THE

00:37:06.084 --> 00:37:09.710
POLICE, MUCH LESS PUT IT OUT

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.584
THERE, AND NAIL SOMEBODY FOR A

00:37:12.584 --> 00:37:12.876
HOMICIDE.

00:37:12.876 --> 00:37:15.960
SO WE BEGAN WORKING ON COMMUNITY

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.376
POLICING, AND NOT ONLY DID WE DO

00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:19.376
COMMUNITY POLICING, WE WENT A

00:37:19.376 --> 00:37:21.167
STEP FURTHER AND DID COMMUNITY

00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:21.376
PROSECUTION.

00:37:21.376 --> 00:37:24.000
SO IN ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.001
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WERE

00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:26.167
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH HIGH

00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:29.501
CRIME RATES, THE NEIGHBORS KNEW

00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:30.251
WHO THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE

00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:32.000
THAT THEY COULD CALLS A TRUSS

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
AND THEY EVEN KNEW WHICH -- CALL

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.251
AND TRUST AND THEY EVEN KNEW

00:37:37.251 --> 00:37:38.960
WHICH PROSECUTOR TO CALL AND

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.000
TRUST.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.084
WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE POINT

00:37:40.084 --> 00:37:41.126
WHERE POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT

00:37:41.126 --> 00:37:43.000
JUST ANSWERING 911 CALLS.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.084
THEY NEED TO HAVE ESTABLISHED

00:37:44.084 --> 00:37:45.000
ROUTES IN A COMMUNITY BECAUSE

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.292
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRUST.

00:37:46.292 --> 00:37:47.251
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE

00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:48.167
COMMUNITY FEELING THAT THE

00:37:48.167 --> 00:37:50.334
POLICE ARE WORKING IN THEIR BEST

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:51.376
INTEREST AND THE POLICE

00:37:51.376 --> 00:37:52.418
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE VAST

00:37:52.418 --> 00:37:53.918
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT

00:37:53.918 --> 00:37:55.000
NEIGHBORHOOD NEED NOTHING MORE

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.835
THAN PROTECTION FROM THEM.

00:37:56.835 --> 00:37:59.000
AND THAT'S HOW WE REBUILD THIS.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.334
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN IF WE COULD

00:38:00.334 --> 00:38:01.793
GET THE RIGHT RESOURCES INTO

00:38:01.793 --> 00:38:03.000
COMMUNITY POLICING AND THE

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.001
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN HELP WITH

00:38:05.001 --> 00:38:05.501
THAT.

00:38:05.501 --> 00:38:07.000
Judy: MR. HAWLEY.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.710

IT'S A HUGELY IMPORTANT

00:38:19.668 --> 00:38:21.126
QUESTION, AND AS THE STATE'S

00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:22.167
CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER,

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:24.251

00:38:24.251 --> 00:38:25.000

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.126
I WANT TO SAY THIS, THAT MY

00:38:27.126 --> 00:38:29.209
BEDROCK PRINCIPLE IS THAT EVERY

00:38:29.209 --> 00:38:30.584
PERSON IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN

THIS STATE DESERVES THE FAIR AND

00:38:31.793 --> 00:38:33.000
EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF

00:38:34.334 --> 00:38:35.626
BENEFIT OF THE RULE OF LAW,

00:38:35.626 --> 00:38:37.292

00:38:37.292 --> 00:38:39.000

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:43.167
THAT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT.

00:38:43.167 --> 00:38:44.251
PART OF WHAT I DO AS ATTORNEY

00:38:45.626 --> 00:38:49.000
UNDER THE LAW IS EVERY YEAR WE

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
ASSEMBLE A REPORT ABOUT WHERE

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
PEOPLE ARE STOPPED, VEHICLES

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.668
STOPPED IN THE STATE.

00:38:51.668 --> 00:38:53.626
WE GET IT FROM ALL THIS DATA,

00:38:53.626 --> 00:38:54.167

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.376
STATE AND WE PUT IT TOGETHER AND

00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:58.835
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SHOW WHAT ARE

00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:00.543
THE RACIAL BACKGROUNDS OF PEOPLE

00:39:00.543 --> 00:39:02.334
BEING STOPPED, WHY WERE THEY

00:39:02.334 --> 00:39:04.000
STOPPED, WHERE DID THEY COME

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.042
FROM.

00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:05.292
WE MADE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO

00:39:05.292 --> 00:39:06.459
THAT REPORT TO GET MORE

00:39:06.459 --> 00:39:08.001
INFORMATION THAT HELP US

00:39:08.001 --> 00:39:09.626
UNDERSTAND AND I THINK TAKING

00:39:09.626 --> 00:39:11.001
STEPS LIKE THAT WHERE WE PROMOTE

00:39:11.001 --> 00:39:13.000
THIS DIALOGUE THAT YOU WERE

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.960
TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN LAUNCHES

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.292
AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES IS

00:39:15.292 --> 00:39:16.042
CRITICAL.

00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:18.000
I DO WANT TO SAY AS SOMEBODY WHO

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.835
WORKS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, WITH

00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:22.000
COPS FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.876
I KNOW OUR COPS ARE WORKING HARD

00:39:24.876 --> 00:39:26.000
AND THEY WANT TO BRING THE FAIR

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.376
AND EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE RULE

00:39:27.376 --> 00:39:28.000
OF LAW.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
I THINK THEY'RE DOING A GREAT

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.126
JOB.

00:39:30.126 --> 00:39:31.084
THEY'RE CERTAINLY OUT THERE

00:39:31.084 --> 00:39:32.501
RISKING THEIR LIVES AND COPS

00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:33.960
FROM EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD, EVERY

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.042
CITY, ALL KINDS OF BACKGROUNDS,

00:39:35.042 --> 00:39:36.167
THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB AND

00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:38.000
IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO GET TO WORK

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.167
WITH THEM.

00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:40.626
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.

00:39:40.626 --> 00:39:42.543
McCaskill: IF I CAN FOLLOWS

00:39:42.543 --> 00:39:43.418
UP ON THAT.

00:39:43.418 --> 00:39:44.543
I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH JOSH THAT

00:39:44.543 --> 00:39:46.001
OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE BRAVE

00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:47.960
AND WONDERFUL AND I'M HONORED TO

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.084
WORK WITH SO MANY OF THEM OVER

00:39:49.084 --> 00:39:51.167
THE YEARS RG BUT I WAS SURPRISED

00:39:51.167 --> 00:39:53.668
WHEN THE REPORT CAME OUT, THE

00:39:53.668 --> 00:39:54.960
RACIAL PROFILING REPORT THAT WAS

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.418
DONE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:39:56.418 --> 00:39:57.584
OFFICE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS WERE

00:39:57.584 --> 00:39:58.918
GOING THE WRONG WAY.

00:39:58.918 --> 00:40:00.251
RACIAL PROFILING WAS GOING UP,

00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:01.876
NOT DOWN, AND I EXPECTED THERE

00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:03.084
TO BE A PRESS CONFERENCE.

00:40:03.084 --> 00:40:04.960
I EXPECTED THERE TO BE A SUMMIT

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.126
CALLED.

00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:07.835
I EXPECTED THERE TO BE A PUBLIC

00:40:07.835 --> 00:40:09.000
DIALOGUE ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.710
THESE NUMBERS WERE GOING THE

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.459
WRONG DIRECTION, AND THERE WAS

00:40:14.459 --> 00:40:14.751
NOTHING.

00:40:14.751 --> 00:40:15.251
THERE WAS NOTHING.

00:40:15.251 --> 00:40:16.584
Hawley: I THINK THAT WAS

00:40:16.584 --> 00:40:17.584
DIRECTED AT ME.

00:40:17.584 --> 00:40:19.126
RATHER THAN GRAND STANDING OR

00:40:19.126 --> 00:40:21.042
RUSHING TO A MICROPHONE OR

00:40:21.042 --> 00:40:23.042
TRYING TO SCORE CHEAP POLITICAL

00:40:23.042 --> 00:40:24.459
POINTS, WHAT WE DID WAS ACTUALLY

00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:25.334
WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES WHO

00:40:25.334 --> 00:40:26.042
WERE AFFECTED.

00:40:26.042 --> 00:40:28.418
WE SAT DOWN WITH COMMUNITY

00:40:28.418 --> 00:40:29.501
LEADERS, KANSAS CITY AND

00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:30.793
ST. LOUIS AND FROM ACROSS THE

00:40:30.793 --> 00:40:32.292
COUNTRY OR ACROSS THE STATE,

00:40:32.292 --> 00:40:33.584
RATHER, AND WE SAID WHAT NEEDS

00:40:33.584 --> 00:40:35.000
TO HAPPEN IN THIS REPORT, WHAT

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
NEEDS TO CHANGE HERE.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.501
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAID IS WE

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:40.251
NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE GET

00:40:40.251 --> 00:40:41.918
THE DATA, WE NEED MORE

00:40:41.918 --> 00:40:43.584
INFORMATION, WE NEED TO SEE WHAT

00:40:43.584 --> 00:40:44.751
COMMUNITIES THESE FOLKS ARE

00:40:44.751 --> 00:40:46.835
FROM, HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO IT,

00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:49.000
GET EVEN MORE INFORMATION, SO

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.292
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE DOING

00:40:51.292 --> 00:40:52.418
THAT, NOT SO WE CAN TAKE

00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:54.668
POLITICAL CREDIT FOR IT, BUT SO

00:40:54.668 --> 00:40:56.334
WE CAN PEOPLE KEEP SAFE.

00:40:56.334 --> 00:40:57.418
Judy: WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:40:57.418 --> 00:40:58.876
QUESTION FROM A MISSOURI VOTER

00:40:58.876 --> 00:41:00.876
AND THIS IS FOR THE ATTORNEY

00:41:00.876 --> 00:41:01.000
GENERAL.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
THIS IS KIM RUDOLPH, HE'S

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
FROM BRENTWOOD AND HE HAS A

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.918
QUESTION ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:41:05.918 --> 00:41:07.251
DESPISE WARNINGS FROM THE

00:41:07.251 --> 00:41:08.000
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT WE

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
MUST SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.209
EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING, MUCH

00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:14.126
LARGE CORPORATIONS OPPOSES

00:41:14.126 --> 00:41:16.042
FEDERAL LAWS WHICH BURDEN THEIR

00:41:16.042 --> 00:41:16.501
BUSINESSES.

00:41:16.501 --> 00:41:17.626
WHAT SHOULD THE UNITED STATES DO

00:41:17.626 --> 00:41:19.876
TO ENSURE WE PROTECT THE PLANET

00:41:19.876 --> 00:41:23.209
WITHOUT SACRIFICING OUR ABILITY

00:41:23.209 --> 00:41:24.668
TO BE ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE?

00:41:24.668 --> 00:41:27.251
AND IT'S TIM?

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:28.501
NICE TO MEET YOU AND THANK

00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:29.918
YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND THANK

00:41:29.918 --> 00:41:31.960
YOU FOR YOUR PASSION FOR THIS

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.292
ISSUE.

00:41:32.292 --> 00:41:33.418
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:41:33.418 --> 00:41:35.793
CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:36.710
TOPIC, OF COURSE, AND IT'S

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.835
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:41:37.835 --> 00:41:38.710
AWARE OF.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.501
I'M SURE THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING

00:41:40.501 --> 00:41:41.710
AND THAT HUMANS ARE CONTRIBUTING

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.084
TO IT AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT

00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.251
SCIENCE AND SEE WHAT THE

00:41:44.251 --> 00:41:45.459
OUTCOMES CAN BE AND WHAT WE CAN

00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:45.710
DO.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.376
I WILL SAY THIS.

00:41:46.376 --> 00:41:48.001
AS SOMEBODY WHO COMES FROM A

00:41:48.001 --> 00:41:50.000
FARMING FAMILY IN A STATE WHERE

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.251
AGRICULTURE IS OUR NUMBER ONE

00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:53.626
INDUSTRY, I AM VERY CONCERNED

00:41:53.626 --> 00:41:56.001
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:57.710
COMING FROM THE EPA AND

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:59.084
ELSEWHERE THAT CHOKE OFF OUR

00:41:59.084 --> 00:42:01.584
FAMILY FARMS, THAT CHOKE OFF

00:42:01.584 --> 00:42:02.001
SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:03.710
AS I TALK TO FARMERS ALL OVER

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.876
OUR STATE, WHAT I HEAR FROM THEM

00:42:05.876 --> 00:42:08.126
OVER AND OVER IS THE EPA IS

00:42:08.126 --> 00:42:09.167
REGULATING HOW THEY CAN USE

00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:11.000
WATER, IT'S REGULATING THE LAND

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.584
THEY CAN USE, IT'S REGULATING

00:42:12.584 --> 00:42:14.459
HOW THEY CAN DO BUSINESS, AND I

00:42:14.459 --> 00:42:15.876
THINK FRANKLY IT'S ALL OUT OF

00:42:15.876 --> 00:42:17.084
PROPORTION AND I THINK IT'S A

00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:19.000
PROBLEM, IT'S A DANGER.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS SUPPORTED

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
THOSE ANTICIPATE REGULATIONS$

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
LIKE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.418
THAT SHE VOTED TO KEEP AFTER

00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:27.501
MISSOURI FARMERS SAID OVER AND

00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:32.918
OVER AND OVER THAT IT WAS

00:42:32.918 --> 00:42:34.835
DETRIMENTAL TO THEM AND HARMING

00:42:34.835 --> 00:42:36.126
THEIR LIVE LIE HOOD.

00:42:36.126 --> 00:42:37.751
WE HAVE TO PROTECT FOLKS LIKE

00:42:37.751 --> 00:42:38.668
OUR FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES

00:42:38.668 --> 00:42:40.459
WHO ARE PROVIDING OUR FOOD AND

00:42:40.459 --> 00:42:42.418
JOBS AND WAGES.

00:42:42.418 --> 00:42:43.000
Judy: SENATOR McCASKILL.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.876
McCaskill: THERE'S TWO ISSUES

00:42:44.876 --> 00:42:45.042
HERE.

00:42:45.042 --> 00:42:48.835
ONE IS MAKE SURE REGULATION IS

00:42:48.835 --> 00:42:49.000
REASONABLE.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.001
I ACTUALLY OPPOSED WOTUS AND

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:53.000
THERE WERE OTHER REGULATIONS,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.626
LIKE REGULATING FARM DEATH ANDS

00:42:55.626 --> 00:42:58.251
I SAID ARE YOU KIDDING, YOU'RE

00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:00.251
NOT GOING DO THAT.

00:43:00.251 --> 00:43:01.334
KEEP IN MIND THAT ATTORNEY

00:43:01.334 --> 00:43:03.000
GENERAL HAWLEY THOUGHT SCOTT

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.376
PRUITT WAS A GREAT CHOICE FOR

00:43:04.376 --> 00:43:05.000
THE EPA.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.292
SCOTT PRUITT IS SOMEONE WHO

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:07.668
BELIEVES THE EPA SHOULD NOT EVEN

00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:08.084
BE THERE.

00:43:08.084 --> 00:43:09.751
THERE SHOULD BE NO REGULATIONS

00:43:09.751 --> 00:43:10.000
WHATSOEVER.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.084
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES

00:43:11.084 --> 00:43:12.626
FROM CHINA AND ALL THE PEOPLE

00:43:12.626 --> 00:43:14.501
WALKING AROUND WITH MASKS ON,

00:43:14.501 --> 00:43:16.292
YOU KNOW, IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE TO

00:43:16.292 --> 00:43:17.918
STOP AT THE CITY LIMITS OF

00:43:17.918 --> 00:43:20.918
ST. LOUIS TO GET YOUR MASK

00:43:20.918 --> 00:43:23.126
BEFORE YOU WENT TO THE CARDINAL

00:43:23.126 --> 00:43:23.292
GAMES.

00:43:23.292 --> 00:43:24.710
OR HOW ABOUT WATER FROM THE TAPS

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.793
TO MIX FORMULA.

00:43:25.793 --> 00:43:27.167
MOST PLACES IN THE WORLD, YOU

00:43:27.167 --> 00:43:28.668
CAN'T USE TAP WATER TO MIX

00:43:28.668 --> 00:43:30.000
FORMULA BECAUSE THE DRINKING

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.876
WATER IS SO DANGEROUS.

00:43:30.876 --> 00:43:32.042
THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, IT'S

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:34.584
TIME WE TRUST OUR SCIENTISTS.

00:43:34.584 --> 00:43:36.126
IT'S TIME WE ACCEPT SOME

00:43:36.126 --> 00:43:38.334
REASONABLE REGULATION TO KEEP

00:43:38.334 --> 00:43:41.459
OUR WATER CLEAN AND OUR AIR

00:43:41.459 --> 00:43:42.376
POLLUTION-FREE AND OBVIOUSLY

00:43:42.376 --> 00:43:44.000
TURNING TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS IS

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.376
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:43:44.376 --> 00:43:46.167
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN A BIG

00:43:46.167 --> 00:43:48.251
SUPPORTER OF BIOFUELS, BIG

00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:51.626
SUPPORTER OF SOLAR AND WIND, A

00:43:51.626 --> 00:43:53.334
BIG SUPPORTER OF THE FUEL

00:43:53.334 --> 00:43:54.584
EFFICIENCY STARNS THAT THE

00:43:54.584 --> 00:43:56.418
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO ABANDON.

00:43:56.418 --> 00:43:58.334
ALL THESE THINGS MATTER WHEN IT

00:43:58.334 --> 00:43:59.459
COMES TO CLIMATE.

00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:01.042
WE'RE SEEING EXTREME WEATHER

00:44:01.042 --> 00:44:03.835
BECAUSE OF CLIMATE.

00:44:03.835 --> 00:44:05.918
IF WE DON'T START RESPECTING THE

00:44:05.918 --> 00:44:07.001
SCIENCE, WE'RE DOING A HUGE

00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:09.376
DISSERVICE TO MY 11, ALMOST 12

00:44:09.376 --> 00:44:09.751
GRANDCHILDREN.

00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:11.000
Judy: ALL RIGHT.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.251
THE NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM

00:44:12.251 --> 00:44:12.751
MIKE BUSH.

00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:15.000
Mike: MR. HAWLEY, MISSOURI

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.918
VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTED

00:44:16.918 --> 00:44:20.835
MAKING MISSOURI A RIGHT-TO-WORK

00:44:20.835 --> 00:44:22.001
STATE, 67 TO 32%.

00:44:22.001 --> 00:44:23.292
YOU'VE SAID IN THE PAST THAT

00:44:23.292 --> 00:44:26.584
NOBODY SHOULD BE FORCED TO PAY

00:44:26.584 --> 00:44:28.084
UNION DUES.

00:44:28.084 --> 00:44:29.376
THIS YEAR THE NATIONAL

00:44:29.376 --> 00:44:30.418
RIGHT-TO-WORK COMMITTEE IS

00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:32.459
TELLING THEIR SUPPORTERS THAT

00:44:32.459 --> 00:44:33.292
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PROMISED,

00:44:33.292 --> 00:44:35.084
PERSONALLY PROMISED, T SIGN A

00:44:35.084 --> 00:44:36.459
NATIONAL RIGHT-TO-WORK BILL IF

00:44:36.459 --> 00:44:38.000
IT COMES ACROSS HIS DESK.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.876
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD

00:44:39.876 --> 00:44:40.000
SUPPORT?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.084
Hawley: I'D HAVE TO -- I'M

00:44:41.084 --> 00:44:42.626
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT PLEDGE,

00:44:42.626 --> 00:44:45.501
MIKE, SO I'D HAVE TO SEE THE

00:44:45.501 --> 00:44:46.543
DETAILS OF WHAT HE'S TALKING

00:44:46.543 --> 00:44:46.960
ABOUT.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.001
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF MISSOURI

00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:49.209
HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR ON THIS

00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:50.418
ISSUE, THEY GOT THE CHANCE TO

00:44:50.418 --> 00:44:52.042
VOTE ON IT AND THE MARGIN WAS

00:44:52.042 --> 00:44:53.793
PRETTY OVERWHELMING AND WHAT THE

00:44:53.793 --> 00:44:55.543
PEOPLE SAY IS WHAT GOES.

00:44:55.543 --> 00:44:59.000
AND I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.876
WILL SUPPORT AND THE PEOPLE OF

00:45:00.876 --> 00:45:02.710
MY STATE SUPPORT AND I HAVE A

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.918
CRITICISM OF SENATOR McCASKILL,

00:45:03.918 --> 00:45:05.167
IT'S NOT THAT SHE IS A BAD

00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:05.376
PERSON.

00:45:05.376 --> 00:45:06.000
SHE'S NOT.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.918
I THINK SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

00:45:07.918 --> 00:45:09.000
IT'S NOT THAT HER RECORD HAD

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:09.918
BEEN TERRIBLE.

00:45:09.918 --> 00:45:11.001
SHE'S HAD 36 YEARS OF

00:45:11.001 --> 00:45:11.751
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE TO THE

00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:13.501
STATE AND THIS COUNTRY, BUT SHE

00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:14.918
DOES NOT REPRESENT THIS STATE

00:45:14.918 --> 00:45:15.000
ANYMORE.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.042
SHE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE

00:45:16.042 --> 00:45:18.418
PEOPLE OF MISSOURI.

00:45:18.418 --> 00:45:22.001
SHE HAS NOT ACCEPTED WHAT THE

00:45:22.001 --> 00:45:23.918
PEOPLE SAID IN 2016.

00:45:23.918 --> 00:45:25.000
SHE HAS WORKED WITH THIS

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
PRESIDENT OR ADMINISTRATION ON

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.876
ANY MAJOR PRIORITIES.

00:45:26.876 --> 00:45:28.584
SHE HAS NOT STOOD UP AND VOTED,

00:45:28.584 --> 00:45:29.668
WHETHER IT'S THE SUPREME COURT

00:45:29.668 --> 00:45:30.751
OR WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

00:45:30.751 --> 00:45:34.292
WHICH SHE VOTED TO KEEP, BY THE

00:45:34.292 --> 00:45:34.501
WAY.

00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:36.042
SHE HAS SIMPLY NOT VOTED WITH

00:45:36.042 --> 00:45:37.000
THIS STATE ANYMORE.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
SHE'S BECOME A PARTY LINE

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.793
LIBERAL AND THAT IS, I THINK,

00:45:39.793 --> 00:45:41.835
THE BIGGEST CRITICISM I HAVE.

00:45:41.835 --> 00:45:45.292
Mike: JUST SO I'M CLEAR, YOU

00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:47.251
NO LONGER SUPPORT RIGHT TO WORK

00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:48.000
IN MISSOURI.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:48.918
Hawley: YOU ASKED ME ABOUT

00:45:48.918 --> 00:45:49.876
THE PRESIDENT AND I DON'T WHAT

00:45:49.876 --> 00:45:51.376
HE SAID ON THAT AND YOU ASKED ME

00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:54.418
ABOUT A BILL THAT I HAVEN'T

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:54.793
SEEN.

00:45:54.793 --> 00:45:55.501
McCaskill: THAT'S A DODGES

00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:58.084
ABOUT I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO

00:45:58.084 --> 00:45:59.292
SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN THE

00:45:59.292 --> 00:46:00.292
PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED

00:46:00.292 --> 00:46:01.793
WHAT HAPPENS IF HE SAYS ANYTHING

00:46:01.793 --> 00:46:03.001
DIFFERENT THAN THE PRESIDENT.

00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:04.292
JOSH HAWLEY HAS VERY CLEAR THAT

00:46:04.292 --> 00:46:06.501
HE SUPPORTED RIGHT-TO-WORK.

00:46:06.501 --> 00:46:08.000
HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN, WHICH WAS A

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.626
VERY SHORT TIME AGO.

00:46:09.626 --> 00:46:11.543
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE LADDERS

00:46:11.543 --> 00:46:11.793
AD.

00:46:11.793 --> 00:46:14.292
A VERY SHORT TIME AGO, HE SAID

00:46:14.292 --> 00:46:17.334
HIS CAMPAIGN WAS FUNDED, ALMOST

00:46:17.334 --> 00:46:19.918
ENTIRELY, BY THE BIGGEST

00:46:19.918 --> 00:46:21.084
RIGHT-TO-WORK ADVOCATE IN THE

00:46:21.084 --> 00:46:22.710
STATE.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.626
75%, OVER $4 MILLION, FROM

00:46:24.626 --> 00:46:26.376
FAMILY TO HIS CAMPAIGN TO PUT

00:46:26.376 --> 00:46:28.084
HIM IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:46:28.084 --> 00:46:28.334
OFFICE.

00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:31.000
OBVIOUSLY HE SUPPORTED

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:31.084
RIGHT-TO-WOK.

00:46:31.084 --> 00:46:32.292
HE'S AGAINST INCREASING THE

00:46:32.292 --> 00:46:32.793
MINIMUM WAGE.

00:46:32.793 --> 00:46:36.459
HE WON'T TELL YOU HOW HE VOTED

00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:37.751
ON PROP A.

00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:39.000
HERE'S THE THING WHEN YOU GO TO

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.751
THE SENATE.

00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:41.501
I KNOW I CAST VOTES THAT A LOT

00:46:41.501 --> 00:46:43.376
OF MISSOURIANS DISAGREE W I GET

00:46:43.376 --> 00:46:43.668
THAT.

00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:45.418
BUT YOU HAVE TO CAST A VOTE AND

00:46:45.418 --> 00:46:46.501
YOU HAVE TO BE UP FRONT ABOUT

00:46:46.501 --> 00:46:47.251
WHERE YOU STAND.

00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:48.501
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE

00:46:48.501 --> 00:46:50.000
EVERYBODY HAPPY AND I WILL TELL

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.376
YOU, I WILL NEVER BE AFRAID TO

00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:53.835
TELL A PRESIDENT, WHETHER I WAS

00:46:53.835 --> 00:46:54.584
PRESIDENT OBAMA ON KEYSTONE

00:46:54.584 --> 00:46:55.292
PIPELINE OR WHETHER IT'S

00:46:55.292 --> 00:46:57.501
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON RIGHT-TO-WORK

00:46:57.501 --> 00:46:59.292
FOR LESS, I AM NEVER GOING TO BE

00:46:59.292 --> 00:47:00.418
AFRAID TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I

00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:02.000
BELIEVE IN AND WHAT I THINK I

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.751
OWE THE PEOPLE OF MISSOURI IN

00:47:03.751 --> 00:47:06.459
TERMS OF A CLEAR ANSWER.

00:47:06.459 --> 00:47:08.000
Judy: MR. HAWLEY, I JUST WANT

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.584
TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING THE

00:47:09.584 --> 00:47:10.543
SENATOR SAID.

00:47:10.543 --> 00:47:11.710
SHE MENTIONED MINIMUM WAGE WHICH

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:13.000
OF COURSE IS ON THE BALLOT IN

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.626
MISSOURI THIS YEAR.

00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:15.835
WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON IT, ON

00:47:15.835 --> 00:47:17.960
RAISING IT, AND, SENATOR, IF YOU

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.251
CAN CLARIFY YOUR POSITION.

00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:23.000
Hawley: I'M GOING TO VOTE NO

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.292
ON THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION.

00:47:24.292 --> 00:47:26.000
WE NEED A WAGE INCREASE AND WE

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.376
NEED IT ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT

00:47:27.376 --> 00:47:29.000
I'M GOING TO VOTE NO ON THE

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
MISSOURI MEASURE BECAUSE I'M

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.459
WORRIED THAT IT WILL RAISE THE

00:47:31.459 --> 00:47:32.668
MINIMUM HERE QUICKLY AND OUT OF

00:47:32.668 --> 00:47:33.918
STEP WITH OTHER STATES.

00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:35.001
I DON'T WANT TO SEE JOBS LOST.

00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:37.376
LET ME SAY THIS, THOUGH, JUDIES

00:47:37.376 --> 00:47:39.084
ABOUT WAGE GROWTH IS AT A

00:47:39.084 --> 00:47:40.793
TEN-YEAR HIGH IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:47:40.793 --> 00:47:42.710
WAGES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.876
DECADES.

00:47:42.876 --> 00:47:44.000
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS BEEN IN

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
POLITICS FOR 36 YEARS.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.918
DURING THAT ENTIRE TIME, JOBS

00:47:46.918 --> 00:47:49.251
HAVE GONE OVERSEAS.

00:47:49.251 --> 00:47:50.376
SHE'S WATCHED THOUSANDS OF JOBS

00:47:50.376 --> 00:47:52.000
LEAVE THIS STATE.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
WANELS HAVE BEEN FLAT OR

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.001
DECLINING IN THIS STATE.

00:47:54.001 --> 00:47:55.626
THEY ARE JUST NOW BEGINNING TO

00:47:55.626 --> 00:47:56.000
GROW.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.251
MIDDLE CLASS INCOME BEGINNING TO

00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:59.418
GROW, REACHING A NEW HIGH, AND

00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:00.292
WHAT DOES SENATOR McCASKILL WANT

00:48:00.292 --> 00:48:01.251
TO DO?

00:48:01.251 --> 00:48:03.000
ADOPT THE PARTY LINE, RAISE YOUR

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:03.251
TAXES.

00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.376
SHE'S ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT

00:48:04.376 --> 00:48:04.876
TONIGHT.

00:48:04.876 --> 00:48:06.543
SHE VOTED NO ON THE TAX CUT.

00:48:06.543 --> 00:48:08.584
SHE WANTS TO REVERSE IT AND

00:48:08.584 --> 00:48:10.918
RAISE YOUR TAXES, RAISE MIDDLE

00:48:10.918 --> 00:48:12.000
CLASS TAXES.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.626
I THINK WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GO

00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:15.000
BACK TO FALLING WAGES AND

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.459
SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS AND THAT'S

00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:19.000
WHY I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR THE

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
LIBERAL PARTY LINE.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:20.626
McCaskill: I NEVER SAID I

00:48:20.626 --> 00:48:25.459
WOULD RAISE STACKS -- RAISE

00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:27.000
TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS, EVER,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.084
EVER.

00:48:27.084 --> 00:48:28.626
I SAID LET'S TALK ABOUT PEOPLE

00:48:28.626 --> 00:48:29.793
THAT ARE MAKING MILLIONS OF

00:48:29.793 --> 00:48:31.751
DOLLARS ON THEIR TAXES.

00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:34.000
THIS IS FASCINATING TO ME.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
THIS IS SUCH A REASONABLE

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
MINIMUM WAGE PROPOSAL.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.251
HE LIKES TO LECTURE ABOUT THE

00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:40.710
WORKING PEOPLE AND FLYOVER

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.000
COUNTRY AND HOW THEY'RE GETTING

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.042
IGNORED.

00:48:43.042 --> 00:48:47.000
THIS IS AN 85 CENTS A YEAR

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.876
INCREASE.

00:48:47.876 --> 00:48:49.626
GRADUALLY GOING UP TO $12 AN

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:50.835
HOUR AND AMAZON IS ALREADY

00:48:50.835 --> 00:48:53.001
PAYING $15 AN HOUR.

00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:55.000
WE HAVE OVER 100,000 PARENTS IN

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.167
MISSOURI THAT ARE TRYING TO

00:48:56.167 --> 00:48:58.000
RAISE THEIR CHILDREN ON A

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.751
MINIMUM WAGE JOB.

00:48:58.751 --> 00:48:59.960
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS THE

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.000
RIGHT THING TO DO, AND WAGES ARE

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
NOT GROWING.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.710
BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR,

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:10.918
THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS, REAL

00:49:10.918 --> 00:49:14.584
WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN 1.8%.

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:15.751
THAT'S AFTER THE TAX CUT THAT

00:49:15.751 --> 00:49:17.126
WAS SUPPOSED TO PUT ALL THIS

00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:19.543
MONEY IN EVERYBODY'S POCKET.

00:49:19.543 --> 00:49:21.668
CORPORATE PROFITS ARE WAY UP,

00:49:21.668 --> 00:49:23.167
THE DEFICIT IS UP, BUT WAGES

00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:23.584
AREN'T.

00:49:23.584 --> 00:49:24.710
WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE MINIMUM

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:25.960
WAGE AND DIE 100%.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.334
Hawley: LET ME BE CLEAR.

00:49:27.334 --> 00:49:28.334
SENATOR McCASKILL HAD THE CHANCE

00:49:28.334 --> 00:49:30.334
TO VOTE FOR A MIDDLE CLASS TAX

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:30.501
CUT.

00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:33.000
SHE'S RAISED YOUR TAXES OVER 200

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.126
TIMES.

00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:35.001
SHE HAD THE CHANCE TO VOTE FOR

00:49:35.001 --> 00:49:35.251
ONE.

00:49:35.251 --> 00:49:36.251
SHE VOTED NO.

00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:37.751
SHE VOTED TO KEEP YOUR TAXES

00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:39.000
HIGHER AND SHE REFERRED TO THEM

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:39.960
AS SCRAP.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.000
THAT WASN'T NANCY PELOSI.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.960
NANCY PELOSI CALLED THEM CRUMBS.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.000
SENATOR McCASKILL CALLED THEM

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:45.376
SCRAPS.

00:49:45.376 --> 00:49:47.668
NOW, THEY MAY BE SCRAPS TO HER,

00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:49.000
BUT THEY ARE NOT SCRAPS.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.793
THOSE TAX CUTS IS PUTTING MORE

00:49:50.793 --> 00:49:52.501
MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF

00:49:52.501 --> 00:49:54.042
HARD-WORKING MISSOURIANS

00:49:54.042 --> 00:49:56.251
BUSINESS DOUBLING THE CHILD TAX

00:49:56.251 --> 00:49:56.668
CREDIT.

00:49:56.668 --> 00:49:57.376
AVERAGE MISSOURI FAMILIES SAVE

00:49:57.376 --> 00:49:59.251
ABOUT $1200 A YEAR.

00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:00.209
THAT'S REAL MONEY FOR THE PEOPLE

00:50:00.209 --> 00:50:00.960
OF MISSOURI.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.626
I DO NOT WANT TO SEE IT TAKEN

00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:04.960
AWAY.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.376
WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT JUST

00:50:06.376 --> 00:50:07.835
FOLLOWING THE LIBERAL PARTY

00:50:07.835 --> 00:50:08.000
LINE.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.710
McCaskill: THE WAGES HAVE NOT

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.292
GONE UP AND THE REASON I WAS

00:50:11.292 --> 00:50:13.292
AGAINST THE TAX BILL IS NOT

00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:15.000
BECAUSE I WAS NOT WILLING TO

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.001
VOTE FOR MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS.

00:50:17.001 --> 00:50:18.751
IT WAS BECAUSE IT SO FAVORED AND

00:50:18.751 --> 00:50:20.292
HEAVILY TOWARD THE VERY RICH.

00:50:20.292 --> 00:50:22.000
Judy: THE NEXT QUESTION FROM

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.001
A MISSOURI VOTER.

00:50:23.001 --> 00:50:24.960
KEVIN SMITH FROM CANTON HAS A

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.626
QUESTION ABOUT THE BORDER WALL.

00:50:27.626 --> 00:50:29.334
BORE DEER SECURITY IS A

00:50:29.334 --> 00:50:31.167
VERY -- BORDER SECURITY IS A

00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:32.459
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME.

00:50:32.459 --> 00:50:33.918
AS A RETIRE VETERAN, I THINK

00:50:33.918 --> 00:50:37.126
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SECURE OUR

00:50:37.126 --> 00:50:37.543
BORDERS.

00:50:37.543 --> 00:50:38.418
WILL YOU TONIGHT COMMIT TO

00:50:38.418 --> 00:50:39.209
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORT

00:50:39.209 --> 00:50:43.001
TO BID A WALL ON OUR SOUTHERN

00:50:43.001 --> 00:50:44.000
BORDER?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.918
McCaskill: I HAVE CERTAIN

00:50:44.918 --> 00:50:47.000
VOTED AND WORKED ON A BILL THAT

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
WOULD HAVE GIVE TREND

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.835
$25 MILLION TOWARDS BORDER

00:50:49.835 --> 00:50:50.000
SECURITY.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.710
I'VE BEEN TO THE BORDER, I'VE

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.376
GONE TO NIGHT FIRST AND GOAL

00:50:53.376 --> 00:50:56.209
WITH THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS.

00:50:56.209 --> 00:50:57.626
I'VE ASKED THEM WHAT DO WE NEED

00:50:57.626 --> 00:50:59.000
TO SECURE THE BORDER AND THEY

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.668
SAID THE NUMBER ONE THING THEY

00:51:00.668 --> 00:51:01.918
NEEDED WAS TECHNOLOGY.

00:51:01.918 --> 00:51:03.000
THE ABILITY TO SEE WHO WAS

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.167
COMING AND WHERE.

00:51:04.167 --> 00:51:06.251
THEY WERE RELYING ON EQUIPMENT,

00:51:06.251 --> 00:51:07.710
FRANKLY, THAT THEY TAPED

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.001
TOGETHER TO TRY TO HAVE CLEAR

00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:09.334
VISUAL.

00:51:09.334 --> 00:51:11.876
NUMBER TWO, LATERAL ACCESS

00:51:11.876 --> 00:51:12.167
ROADS.

00:51:12.167 --> 00:51:14.000
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
SMUGGLERS ARE COMING ACROSS AND

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
THEY CAN'T GET TO THEM SAFELY OR

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.167
PROTECT THEIR FELLOW BROTHERS

00:51:18.167 --> 00:51:20.209
AND SISTERS THAT ARE SECURING

00:51:20.209 --> 00:51:21.376
THE BORDER.

00:51:21.376 --> 00:51:23.584
AND CERTAINLY MORE PERSONNEL,

00:51:23.584 --> 00:51:25.000
AND I HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY WHO HAS

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.376
IN FACT WORKED TO SECURE MORE

00:51:26.376 --> 00:51:28.126
PERSONNEL ON THE BORDER.

00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:30.000
AND MORE BARRIERS IN SOME

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.626
PLACES.

00:51:30.626 --> 00:51:31.751
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DOWN THERE

00:51:31.751 --> 00:51:34.418
ON THE BORDER, YOU GO ALONG THE

00:51:34.418 --> 00:51:36.209
WALL AND THEN THERE'S THIS BIG

00:51:36.209 --> 00:51:37.084
HOLE WHERE THERE'S A PICKUP

00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:38.042
TRUCK SITTING.

00:51:38.042 --> 00:51:40.167
I SAID WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:41.668
WHY DOES THAT GUY HAVE TO SIT

00:51:41.668 --> 00:51:43.000
THERE IN A PICKUP TRUCK?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.126
THEY SAID WELL, THE LITIGATION

00:51:44.126 --> 00:51:47.000
OVER THE GOVERNMENT TAKING THE

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.376
FARMLAND IS STILL ONGOING AND

00:51:50.376 --> 00:51:52.918
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS, TEN YEARS,

00:51:52.918 --> 00:51:53.459
15 YEARS.

00:51:53.459 --> 00:51:56.001
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS JUST SAYING

00:51:56.001 --> 00:51:57.167
SHINING SEA TO SEA WALL.

00:51:57.167 --> 00:51:59.292
SOME PLACES WE DO NEED MORE WALL

00:51:59.292 --> 00:52:00.710
AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:01.126
SUPPORT THAT.

00:52:01.126 --> 00:52:03.251
ALL THESE THINGS IS WHY THE

00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:05.292
BORDER PATROL AGENTS WHO ALSO

00:52:05.292 --> 00:52:07.000
ENDORSED PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.960
ENDORSED ME IN THIS SENATE RACE.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.334
Judy: MR. HAWLEY.

00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:12.209
Hawley: KEVIN, THANK YOU VERY

00:52:12.209 --> 00:52:13.918
MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION.

00:52:13.918 --> 00:52:16.000
I THINK YOU SAID YOU'RE A

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.209
VETERAN.

00:52:16.209 --> 00:52:17.126
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO

00:52:17.126 --> 00:52:18.000
THIS COUNTRY.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.042
I THINK I CAN ANSWER YOUR

00:52:19.042 --> 00:52:20.626
QUESTION MORE SIMPLY THAN ALL OF

00:52:20.626 --> 00:52:21.000
THAT.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.918
YES IS THE ANSWER.

00:52:21.918 --> 00:52:23.751
I SUPPORT A BORDER WALL AND I

00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:24.418
WANT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT

00:52:24.418 --> 00:52:26.001
GETTING FUNDING FOR A BORDER

00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:26.501
WALL.

00:52:26.501 --> 00:52:29.334
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS CALLED THE

00:52:29.334 --> 00:52:30.376
WALL EMBARRASSING.

00:52:30.376 --> 00:52:33.000
YOU PICK UP THAT A LITTLE, BUT

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.334
THAT'S HER WORDS.

00:52:34.334 --> 00:52:35.459
SHE HAS MOCKED PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:52:35.459 --> 00:52:36.459
FOR WANTING TO BUILD A WALL.

00:52:36.459 --> 00:52:38.000
I THINK WE NEED A WALL AND I

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.543
THINK WE NEED TO SECURE OUR

00:52:39.543 --> 00:52:39.876
BORDER.

00:52:39.876 --> 00:52:41.793
IT'S A BASIC RULE OF LAW ISSUE.

00:52:41.793 --> 00:52:43.000
I'M A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.292
WE NEED TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE

00:52:44.292 --> 00:52:46.000
LAWS THEREFORE COUNTRY.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.292
NOW -- OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:52:48.292 --> 00:52:52.501
NOW THEY HAVE MIGRANT CARRY

00:52:52.501 --> 00:52:55.167
CARAVAN COMING TOWARDS THE

00:52:55.167 --> 00:52:57.000
BORDER, THOUSANDS BY THE DAY.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.292
THIS COULD BE A DISASTROUS

00:52:58.292 --> 00:52:58.584
SITUATION.

00:52:58.584 --> 00:52:59.918
WASHINGTON HAS HAD THE CHANCE TO

00:52:59.918 --> 00:53:01.084
DO FOR YEARS AND THEY HAVEN'T

00:53:01.084 --> 00:53:02.000
DONE IT.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.001
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS VOTED

00:53:03.001 --> 00:53:05.459
AGAINST FUNDING FOR THE WALL.

00:53:05.459 --> 00:53:06.918
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN AGREE TO THE

00:53:06.918 --> 00:53:08.376
PRESIDENT'S DACA PLAN, A VERY

00:53:08.376 --> 00:53:10.000
GENEROUS PROPOSAL, BUT WHY?

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.668
IT HAD WALL FUNDING IN IT, SO

00:53:11.668 --> 00:53:13.042
SHE VOTED AGAINST IT.

00:53:13.042 --> 00:53:14.710
WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:18.751
STAND WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:53:18.751 --> 00:53:19.918
AGENTS ON THE BORDER, SOMEBODY

00:53:19.918 --> 00:53:22.835
NA KNOWS WE NEED TO SECURE THIS

00:53:22.835 --> 00:53:25.501
BORDER AND ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT

00:53:25.501 --> 00:53:27.668
THE SOVEREIGN RIGHTS OF THIS

00:53:27.668 --> 00:53:29.000
COUNTRY.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.835
WE DON'T NEED PARTY LINE

00:53:31.835 --> 00:53:32.835
LIBERALISM, WE NEED SOMEBODY TO

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:34.001
RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THIS

00:53:34.001 --> 00:53:35.292
STATE AND I WILL.

00:53:35.292 --> 00:53:36.876
Judy: DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE?

00:53:36.876 --> 00:53:38.292
McCaskill: THE BORDER PATROL

00:53:38.292 --> 00:53:41.001
AGENTS ON THE BORDER HAVE

00:53:41.001 --> 00:53:42.543
ENDORSED ME, NOT ATTORNEY

00:53:42.543 --> 00:53:44.209
GENERAL HAWLEY, AND IT IS

00:53:44.209 --> 00:53:46.126
BECAUSE OF MY THOUGHTFUL -- AND

00:53:46.126 --> 00:53:48.710
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS A

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.876
ONE-LINER.

00:53:48.876 --> 00:53:52.167
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

00:53:52.167 --> 00:53:54.918
IT IS NOT -- I MEAN, MOST OF THE

00:53:54.918 --> 00:53:56.376
PEOPLE WHO WE ARE HAVING TO DEAL

00:53:56.376 --> 00:53:58.626
WITH ON THE BORDER ARE NOT

00:53:58.626 --> 00:54:00.543
TRYING TO EVADE, THEY'RE WALKING

00:54:00.543 --> 00:54:06.376
UP TO THE PORTS OF ENTRY AND

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.793
SAYING WE'RE TURNING OURSELVES

00:54:07.793 --> 00:54:08.000
IN.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.501
THE WALL DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT

00:54:09.501 --> 00:54:10.334
TO THAT.

00:54:10.334 --> 00:54:11.584
THIS IS COMPLICATED AND HARD AND

00:54:11.584 --> 00:54:13.251
THAT'S WHY I SAT IN A ROOM FOR

00:54:13.251 --> 00:54:15.459
DAYS WITH 15 REPUBLICANS AND 13

00:54:15.459 --> 00:54:16.543
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO WORK OUT

00:54:16.543 --> 00:54:18.167
COMPROMISES AND WE ALMOST GOT

00:54:18.167 --> 00:54:18.418
THERE.

00:54:18.418 --> 00:54:20.000
WE GOT TO 58 VOTES.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.001
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL

00:54:22.001 --> 00:54:24.501
WE GET TO 60 FOR COMPREHENSIVE

00:54:24.501 --> 00:54:25.751
IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT INCLUDES

00:54:25.751 --> 00:54:26.626
GOOD BORDER SECURITY.

00:54:26.626 --> 00:54:28.584
Hawley: I WOULD JUST SAY

00:54:28.584 --> 00:54:29.751
THAT, LOOK, SENATOR McCASKILL

00:54:29.751 --> 00:54:31.126
HAS BEEN IN WASHINGTON A LONG

00:54:31.126 --> 00:54:32.418
TIME, 12 YEARS.

00:54:32.418 --> 00:54:34.167
SHE'S BEEN IN POLITICS 36 YEARS.

00:54:34.167 --> 00:54:38.000
SHE HAS HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.042
TO STEP FORWARD AND ACROSS THE

00:54:40.042 --> 00:54:41.251
PARTY AISLE, WORK ACROSS PARTY

00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:42.584
LINES AND GET THIS DONE FOR THE

00:54:42.584 --> 00:54:44.459
SECURITY OF THIS COUNTRY AND SHE

00:54:44.459 --> 00:54:45.459
HAS NOT DONE IT.

00:54:45.459 --> 00:54:47.960
SHE HAS VOTED NO ON WALL

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:48.001
FUNDING.

00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:50.543
SHE HAD MOCKED THE IDEA OF IT.

00:54:50.543 --> 00:54:53.501
SHE REJECTED A DREAMERS

00:54:53.501 --> 00:54:54.835
COMPROMISE PLAN BECAUSE OF WALL

00:54:54.835 --> 00:54:56.126
FUNDING AND I'M AFRAID IT'S A

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.793
VERY SIMILAR STORY, WHETHER IT'S

00:54:57.793 --> 00:55:00.000
HEALTHCARE, PROTECTING MEDICARE,

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
YOU CAN GO DOWN THE LIST.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.960
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS BEEN IN

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.084
OFFICE 12 YEARS IN WASHINGTON.

00:55:04.084 --> 00:55:05.501
IT'S JUST THE PARTY LINE OVER

00:55:05.501 --> 00:55:06.751
AND OVER AND OVER.

00:55:06.751 --> 00:55:09.084
THAT'S NOT WHAT MISSOURI WANTS.

00:55:09.084 --> 00:55:12.001
Judy: JUST A QUICK FOLLOW-UP

00:55:12.001 --> 00:55:14.292
TO THAT, ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:15.459
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WHO

00:55:15.459 --> 00:55:17.001
REPRESENTS THE LONGEST STRETCH

00:55:17.001 --> 00:55:20.835
OF THE BORDER ON THE SOUTHERN

00:55:20.835 --> 00:55:22.876
SIDE IS CONGRESSMAN WILL HURT OF

00:55:22.876 --> 00:55:23.042
TEXAS.

00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:25.000
HIS COMMENT ON THE WALL, AMONG

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
OTHERS, HE SAID WHAT WE HAVE TO

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.543
REMEMBER IS EVERY MILE OF THE

00:55:27.543 --> 00:55:28.584
BORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY

00:55:28.584 --> 00:55:29.042
OTHER MILE.

00:55:29.042 --> 00:55:31.543
BUILDING A 30-FOOT-HIGH CONCRETE

00:55:31.543 --> 00:55:34.209
STRUCTURE THAT TAKES FOUR HOURS

00:55:34.209 --> 00:55:36.001
TO PENETRATE IS THE EQUIVALENT

00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:37.042
OF THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE.

00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:38.042
I'M QUOTING HIM.

00:55:38.042 --> 00:55:39.918
HE SAID IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

00:55:39.918 --> 00:55:42.710
BORDER PATROL TO RESPOND TO

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.000
THREATS ON A PHYSICAL STRUCTURE,

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.001
THAT PHYSICAL STRUCTURE IS NOT

00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:46.418
ACTUALLY A BARRIER.

00:55:46.418 --> 00:55:48.960
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, HERE'S A

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.000
FELLOW REPUBLICAN WITH THIS

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.209
Hawley: THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:55:51.209 --> 00:55:51.459
EXCUSES.

00:55:51.459 --> 00:55:53.126
WASHINGTON MAKES EXCUSES ALL THE

00:55:53.126 --> 00:55:54.167
TIME, WE'VE HEARD SOME HERE

00:55:54.167 --> 00:55:55.835
TONIGHT ABOUT WHY THIS CAN'T

00:55:55.835 --> 00:55:56.626
QUITE BE DONE.

00:55:56.626 --> 00:55:58.918
SENATOR McCASKILL SAYS WE NEED

00:55:58.918 --> 00:56:01.001
TO WAIT UNTIL WE GET HEALTHCARE

00:56:01.001 --> 00:56:01.376
REFORM.

00:56:01.376 --> 00:56:03.000
THE PEOPLE OF MISSOURI HAVE BEEN

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.626
WAITING A AWFULLY LONG TIME.

00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:07.209
WHILE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING,

00:56:07.209 --> 00:56:08.501
YOU'RE PRICES HAVE GONE THROUGH

00:56:08.501 --> 00:56:09.167
THE CEILING.

00:56:09.167 --> 00:56:11.042
WHILE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING, THE

00:56:11.042 --> 00:56:13.209
DOCTORS PRICES HAVE GONE UP AND

00:56:13.209 --> 00:56:14.918
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE MADE A

00:56:14.918 --> 00:56:15.000
KILLING.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
WHILE WE'VE BEEN WAITING,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.960
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.334
POURING ACROSS THE BORDER,

00:56:19.334 --> 00:56:20.626
BRINGING GANGS AND DRUGS AND

00:56:20.626 --> 00:56:21.793
VIOLENCE AND PUSHING DOWN WAGES

00:56:21.793 --> 00:56:23.376
AS WELL IN THIS STATE AND

00:56:23.376 --> 00:56:23.626
ELSEWHERE.

00:56:23.626 --> 00:56:25.960
I THINK IT'S ENOUGH WAITING,

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.584
ENOUGH EXCUSES, LET'S GET

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:28.292
SOMEONE DONE.

00:56:28.292 --> 00:56:29.710
WE NEED SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:31.459
CROSS PARTY LINES TO DO IT.

00:56:31.459 --> 00:56:33.000
McCaskill: LET ME SAY QUICKLY

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.001
IN 2000, THERE WERE 1.6 MILLION

00:56:35.001 --> 00:56:36.835
PEOPLE APPREHENDED ON THE

00:56:36.835 --> 00:56:37.292
BORDER.

00:56:37.292 --> 00:56:42.835
1.6 AM UN -- 1.6 MILLION.

00:56:42.835 --> 00:56:44.251
LAST YEAR IT'S 300,000.

00:56:44.251 --> 00:56:46.126
WE DO NOT HAVE AN INCREASING

00:56:46.126 --> 00:56:46.418
PROBLEM.

00:56:46.418 --> 00:56:49.000
WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM, I'M NOT

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.793
MINIMIZING IT, BUT THERE ARE FAR

00:56:50.793 --> 00:56:51.668
FEWER PEOPLE COMING ACROSS AND

00:56:51.668 --> 00:56:54.876
BEING APPREHENDED ILLEGALLY LAST

00:56:54.876 --> 00:56:56.626
YEAR THAN THERE WAS A DECADE

00:56:56.626 --> 00:56:56.876
AGO.

00:56:56.876 --> 00:56:58.084
THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST SAY

00:56:58.084 --> 00:56:59.584
IS BY AN INDEPENDENT GROUP THAT

00:56:59.584 --> 00:57:01.918
LOOKS AT VERY VOTE, I AM THE

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.710
FIFTH MOST LIKELY MEMBER OF THE

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.501
SENATE TO BREAK WITH MY PARTY.

00:57:06.501 --> 00:57:09.751
THE FIFTH MOST LIKELY SENATOR TO

00:57:09.751 --> 00:57:11.000
BREAK WITH MY PARTY.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.376
THAT'S BECAUSE I LOOK AT EVERY

00:57:12.376 --> 00:57:14.835
ISSUE ON ITS MERITS AND NOT ON A

00:57:14.835 --> 00:57:15.418
PARTY LINE.

00:57:15.418 --> 00:57:17.000
Hawley: DESPITE VOTING WITH

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.126
CHUCK SCHUMER 90% OF THE TIME

00:57:20.126 --> 00:57:22.418
HOWEVER, SO CHUCK SCHUMER MUST

00:57:22.418 --> 00:57:24.334
BE ON THE LIST.

00:57:24.334 --> 00:57:24.835
McCaskill: AND PRESIDENT

00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:26.793
TRUMP 50% OF THE TIME.

00:57:26.793 --> 00:57:28.000
Judy: TIME NOW FOR CLOSING

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.793
COMMENTS FROM EACH OF YOU.

00:57:29.793 --> 00:57:31.001
SENATOR McCASKILL, YOU'RE FIRST.

00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:31.793
McCaskill: I HAVE TRAVELED

00:57:31.793 --> 00:57:34.000
THE STATE I LOVE AND I LISTENED.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.543
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES.

00:57:36.543 --> 00:57:39.042
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

00:57:39.042 --> 00:57:40.001
MISSOURIANS AGREE ON.

00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:42.459
CAMPAIGNS ARE A TIME THAT WE

00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:43.960
HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENCES, BUT I

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.334
THINK THEY SHOULD ALSO BE A TIME

00:57:45.334 --> 00:57:47.918
THAT VOTERS TAKE A HARD LOOK AT

00:57:47.918 --> 00:57:50.459
WHICH CANDIDATE CAN DO MORE THAN

00:57:50.459 --> 00:57:52.835
CRITICIZE THEIR OPPONENT, WHO

00:57:52.835 --> 00:57:54.126
CAN ACTUALLY FIND COMMON GROUND.

00:57:54.126 --> 00:57:55.793
I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT I'VE

00:57:55.793 --> 00:57:57.918
GOTTEN DONE IN THE SENATE.

00:57:57.918 --> 00:57:59.918
TONIGHT ON MY WEB,

00:57:59.918 --> 00:58:01.543
CLAIREMcCASKILL.COM, YOU CAN

00:58:01.543 --> 00:58:03.167
FIND 100 ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT I

00:58:03.167 --> 00:58:04.835
HAVE GOTTEN ACROSS THE FINISH

00:58:04.835 --> 00:58:06.459
LINE FOR MISSOURIANS.

00:58:06.459 --> 00:58:08.876
I DID THAT BY WORKING ACROSS THE

00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:10.626
AISLE, LISTENING AND, YES,

00:58:10.626 --> 00:58:11.960
SOMETIMES COMPROMISING, WHETHER

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960
IT'S VETERANS BENEFITS OR

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.000
BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, I WILL WORK

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.710
WITH ANYONE ANYTIME TO MAKE

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:19.501
THINGS BETTER.

00:58:19.501 --> 00:58:23.668
CAN I BE PUSHY?

00:58:23.668 --> 00:58:24.001
YES.

00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:25.000
OBNOXIOUS SOMETIMES?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.001
YEAH, MAYBE, BUT I WILL ROLL UP

00:58:27.001 --> 00:58:28.292
MY SLEEVES, BE INDEPENDENT AND

00:58:28.292 --> 00:58:30.000
WORK AS HARD AS I KNOW HOW FOR

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.418
THE FAMILIES OF MISSOURI ALL DAY

00:58:31.418 --> 00:58:31.584
LONG.

00:58:31.584 --> 00:58:33.543
I WOULD BE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:34.334
Judy: MR. HAWLEY.

00:58:34.334 --> 00:58:35.292
Hawley: THANK YOU SO MUCH AND

00:58:35.292 --> 00:58:37.000
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:37.126
TONIGHT.

00:58:37.126 --> 00:58:39.000
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:39.918
RESPECT SENATOR McCASKILL'S

00:58:39.918 --> 00:58:41.626
SERVICE, AS I SAID EARLIER.

00:58:41.626 --> 00:58:43.000
I RESPECT HER YEARS OF SERVICE

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.626
TO THE STATE AND TO THIS

00:58:44.626 --> 00:58:44.793
COUNTRY.

00:58:44.793 --> 00:58:46.418
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, IT'S

00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:48.042
JUST NOT WORKING ANYMORE.

00:58:48.042 --> 00:58:49.126
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS BEEN IN

00:58:49.126 --> 00:58:50.376

YEARS AND OVER THAT TIME, SHE

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.251
HAS BECOME A PARTY LINE

00:58:55.251 --> 00:58:55.710
POLITICIAN.

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:57.292
SHE SAID THAT SHE'D BE

00:58:57.292 --> 00:58:58.418
INDEPENDENT, SHE SAID SHE WOULD

00:58:58.418 --> 00:59:00.292
BE BIPARTISAN, BUT SHE HASN'T

00:59:00.292 --> 00:59:00.668
BEEN.

00:59:00.668 --> 00:59:03.084
WHETHER IT'S BORDER SECURITY OR

HAS VOTED AGAINST AND HERE'S

00:59:14.459 --> 00:59:15.668

WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT IT

01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:33.126
WAS A FAST HOUR WILLIAM WE

01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:34.501
HAVEN'T TALKED BECAUSE WE'VE ALL

01:01:34.501 --> 01:01:35.000
BEEN WATCHING.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.042

YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

01:01:37.543 --> 01:01:39.167
I'LL JUST START WITH YOU, DEE.

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:40.918
I DEFINITELY THINK IT WAS A

01:01:40.918 --> 01:01:41.626
FAST HOUR.

01:01:41.626 --> 01:01:43.918
THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE

01:01:43.918 --> 01:01:48.000
JUGULAR, TO LACK OF A BETTER

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.042
TERM.

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:49.626
THEY TALKED ABOUT HEALTHCARE,

01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:51.626
THE WALL, PROP A, WHICH I

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:53.251
EXPECTED MORE FIREWORKS ON, BUT

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.793
THE HOUR DID GO BY BAS.

01:01:55.793 --> 01:01:56.835
DEFINITELY JOSH HAWLEY BEING

01:01:56.835 --> 01:01:58.001
AT ATTACK AS HE HAS BEEN

01:01:58.001 --> 01:01:59.835
THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN,

01:01:59.835 --> 01:02:01.292
SPEAKING OF A PERSON WHO IS

01:02:01.292 --> 01:02:02.251
CHALLENGING AN INCUMBENT AND WE

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:05.042
SAW THAT TONIGHT, BUT WE ALSO

01:02:05.042 --> 01:02:06.292
SAW SENATOR McCASKILL AS A

01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:07.376
VETERAN CAMPAIGNER AND SHE

01:02:07.376 --> 01:02:08.292
SHOWED THAT DURING THE DEBATE

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:09.000
TONIGHT AS WELL.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.126
YEAH, JOSH HAWLEY CAME OUT

01:02:11.126 --> 01:02:12.001
SWINGING, IMMEDIATELY TALKING

01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:13.876
ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

01:02:13.876 --> 01:02:15.126
AND HIS FIRST STATEMENT AND

01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:16.292
HEALTHCARE AND FARMERS WERE A

01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:17.960
BIG THEME TONIGHT, WHICH IS NOT

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.084
SURPRISING WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:02:19.084 --> 01:02:21.376
WIN A STATEWIDE RACE IN

01:02:21.376 --> 01:02:21.710
MISSOURI.

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:23.167
I FELT LIKE, ANOTHER ANTHEM I

01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:25.710
WAS PICKING UP ON, THE ONE

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:26.918
PERSON THAT NOBODY IN THE ROOM

01:02:26.918 --> 01:02:30.084
WANTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WAS

01:02:30.084 --> 01:02:31.835
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT LARGE.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:33.292
MR. HAWLEY, I THINK WE WERE

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:36.000
KEEPING TRACK, ANITA, YOU WERE,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.251
SEVERAL TIMES USED THE PHRASE

01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:42.334
"PARTY LINE," AND WE HEARD

01:02:42.334 --> 01:02:44.292
SENATOR McCASKILL SAY TWO OR

01:02:44.292 --> 01:02:47.126
THREE TIMES THAT SHE HAS AT

01:02:47.126 --> 01:02:49.000
TIMES SIDED WITH PRESIDENT

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.001
TRUMP.

01:02:49.001 --> 01:02:51.793
SHE SAID AT THE END, 50% OF THE

01:02:51.793 --> 01:02:51.960
TIME.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.000
DID YOU PICK UP ON THAT?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.084
THE MOST PHRASES BY JOSH

01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:58.000
HAWLEY WERE PARTY LINE LIBERAL,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.209
AND FOR CLAIRE McCASKILL, TRYING

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:00.459
TO IDENTIFY HERSELF AS

01:03:00.459 --> 01:03:02.000
INDEPENDENT, THAT SHE'S WILLING

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
TO PROMISE, COMPLIMENT PRESIDENT

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.626
TRUMP, SHE VOTED WITH HIM, BUT

01:03:04.626 --> 01:03:06.126
ALSO WILLING TO STAND TO HIM.

01:03:06.126 --> 01:03:07.876
I THINK THOSE WERE DEFINITE

01:03:07.876 --> 01:03:09.084
POINTS THEY WERE TRYING TO GET

01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:11.751
BEFORE WE GO ON, LET'S GET TO

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:13.000
ONE OF HIGHLIGHTS IF WE CAN USE

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.376
A SPORT OF METAPHOR.

01:03:14.376 --> 01:03:15.501
LET'S ROLL TAPE ON ONE OF THE

01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:17.084
EARLIER MOMENTS IN THE DEBATE

01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:18.084
WHEN THEY KIND OF HAD A LITTLE

01:03:18.084 --> 01:03:22.418
BIT OF A TUSSLE BACK AND FORTH.

01:03:22.418 --> 01:03:22.960
McCaskill: THE REPUBLICAN

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.626
PARTY LOVES TO TALK ABOUT DEBT

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.001
AND DEFICIT UNTIL THEY'RE THIS

01:03:26.001 --> 01:03:27.751
CHARGE AND THEN IT'S CRICKETS.

01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:29.000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRICKETS.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.835
SO YES, WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL

01:03:30.835 --> 01:03:31.501
OF IT.

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:33.626
NO CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY, NO

01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:37.543
CUTS TO MEDICARE, AS I SAID,

01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:39.376
JOSH HAWLEY IS PROPOSING CUTS TO

01:03:39.376 --> 01:03:41.126
MEDICARE BY HIS LAWSUIT.

01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:41.668
Judy: NEXT.

01:03:41.668 --> 01:03:42.668
Hawley: I HAVE TO RESPOND TO

01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:44.835
THAT BECAUSE IT'S FLATLY FALSE.

01:03:44.835 --> 01:03:46.209
ONLY ONE PERSON ON THE STAGE HAS

01:03:46.209 --> 01:03:47.251
VOTED TO CUT MEDICARE SPENDING

01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:48.292
AND IT'S SENATOR McCASKILL AND

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:50.126
YOU CAN LOOK IT UP.

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.501
SHE CAN CHARACTERIZE IT AND PUT

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:53.001
AS MUCH LIPSTICK ON IT AS SHE

01:03:53.001 --> 01:03:56.292
WANTS, BUT THE TRUTH IS, SHE

01:03:56.292 --> 01:03:58.960
VOTED TO CUT $716 BILLION FROM

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.000
MEDICARE TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.292
OKAY, SO A LOT TO UNPACK

01:04:03.292 --> 01:04:04.501
THERE, IF YOU WILL.

01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:06.334
YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEARD

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:06.710
THAT.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.167
WE'LL START AGAIN WITH YOU.

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:09.751
IT SEEMED TO BE A DISCUSSION

01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:12.292
ABOUT SEMANTICS, RIGHT?

01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:14.793
JOSH HAWLEY KEPT GOING BACK TO

01:04:14.793 --> 01:04:16.292
CLAIRE McCASKILL WON'T SUPPORT

01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:18.668
ANYTHING UNLESS IT'S OBAMACARE.

01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:20.126
BUT SHE KEPT GOING BACK TO THE

01:04:20.126 --> 01:04:21.418
FACT THAT HE WANTS TO TEAR THIS

01:04:21.418 --> 01:04:24.000
ENTIRE THING DOWN AND THERE'S NO

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.126
FAILSAFE.

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.626
THERE IS NO PLAN, AND I THINK

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:27.292
THAT PEOPLE AT HOME, PEOPLE WHO

01:04:27.292 --> 01:04:30.000
ARE VOTING CAN SEE THE

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
REPUBLICANS COMPLAINED FOR A

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.209
VERY LONG TIME ABOUT THE ACA AND

01:04:33.209 --> 01:04:34.459
THEY COULD HAVE PASSED IT

01:04:34.459 --> 01:04:36.000
STRICTLY WITH THE PARTY, BUT

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.918
THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE.

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:41.209
MEDICARE VOTE, I WAS DOING

01:04:41.209 --> 01:04:42.960
SOME FACT CHECKING OR TRYING TO

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.000
ON THE FLY BECAUSE STUFF WAS

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.167
FLYING, BUT ONE OF THE THINS

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:47.000
ABOUT THAT $716 MILLION FIGURE,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S THROWN

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.001
OUT SINCE THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL

01:04:50.001 --> 01:04:53.251
CAMPAIGN AND PACK CHECKING

01:04:53.251 --> 01:04:55.000
GROUPS LIKE POLITIFACT,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.334
SPECIFICALLY, THIS HAS COME UP

01:04:56.334 --> 01:04:58.000
IN FLORIDA'S SENATE RACE AS

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.126
WELL, THEY SAID THAT REALLY

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:00.376
WASN'T TRUE IN TERMS OF THAT

01:05:00.376 --> 01:05:01.334
VOTE REDUCING MEDICARE.

01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:03.000
IT WAS AIMED AT CURBING

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.167
HEALTHCARE COSTS OVERALL, AIMED

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.626
AT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, NOT

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:07.001
BENEFICIARIES, BUT THAT'S

01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:08.251
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR

01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:10.001
A WHILE AND IT'S COMING BACK IN

01:05:10.001 --> 01:05:12.543
THIS RACE AS WELL.

01:05:12.543 --> 01:05:16.000
JUST BRIEFLY, THERE WAS A

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.876
TIME, AND I BELIEVE IT WAS '08

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:19.459
WHEN LIPSTICK WAS A RALLYING

01:05:19.459 --> 01:05:19.918
CRY.

01:05:19.918 --> 01:05:24.084
HOW DOES IT PLAY IN TODAY'S

01:05:24.084 --> 01:05:25.209
MEDIA CYCLE?

01:05:25.209 --> 01:05:27.000
I WOULD SAY WHEN JOSH HAWLEY

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.001
SAID YOU CAN PUT AS MUCH

01:05:28.001 --> 01:05:29.251
LIPSTICK ON IT AS YOU WANT, I

01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:30.543
KNOW THAT GOES BACK TO THE

01:05:30.543 --> 01:05:33.126
PREVIOUS CYCLE OF PUTTING

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:34.793
LIPSTICK ON A PIG.

01:05:34.793 --> 01:05:36.751
I THINK SAYING THAT TO A WOMAN

01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:38.292
IN A DEBATE SORT OF PERKED MY

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.334
EARS UP.

01:05:40.334 --> 01:05:41.376
I DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER WOMEN

01:05:41.376 --> 01:05:42.001
MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED THAT, THE

01:05:42.001 --> 01:05:43.626
IDEA OF, YOU KNOW, PUTTING

01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:44.543
LIPSTICK ON IT.

01:05:44.543 --> 01:05:46.668
AND AS WE'VE TALKED BEFORE,

01:05:46.668 --> 01:05:50.000
THE FEMALE VOTE IS BY NO MEANS A

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.167
MONOLITH, SO IT WILL PLAY

01:05:51.167 --> 01:05:52.418
DIFFERENTLY WITH DIFFERENT

01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:52.584
WOMEN.

01:05:52.584 --> 01:05:54.710
LET'S GO OUT TO THE CROWD.

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:56.543
JASON, WHO DO YOU HAVE WITH US?

01:05:56.543 --> 01:05:58.501
I'M HERE WITH FRANK FROM

01:05:58.501 --> 01:05:59.251
KIRKWOOD, MISSOURI.

01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:01.000
HE WAS OUT HERE AT THE PUBLIC

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.418
MEDIA COMMONS.

01:06:01.418 --> 01:06:03.000
I'LL JUST ASK A VERY SIMPLE

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
QUESTION.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE DEBATE

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.126
AND HOW DO YOU THINK THE

01:06:06.126 --> 01:06:08.000
CANDIDATES DID?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.001
I THINK THEY DID A GREAT JOB.

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.001
THEY COVERED A LOT OF GROUND

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.001
FROM THE HEALTHCARE, THE

01:06:14.001 --> 01:06:15.001
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, THE

01:06:15.001 --> 01:06:17.000
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THE TAXES,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.668
THE ECONOMY, THE TARIFFS, WHAT'S

01:06:18.668 --> 01:06:21.251
GOOD FOR MISSOURI, WHAT'S GOOD

01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.000
FOR THE FARMERS.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.292
BOY, THEY COVERED A LOT OF

01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:24.626
STUFF.

01:06:24.626 --> 01:06:26.000
I DON'T KNOW WHO WON.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I THINK THERE WERE PROS AND CONS

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
ON BOTH SIDES.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I THINK THEY MADE SOME GOOD

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.793
POINTS ON EITHER SIDE.

01:06:32.793 --> 01:06:34.876
I LIKE CLAIRE SAYING, YOU KNOW,

01:06:34.876 --> 01:06:37.042
SHE SUPPORTED -- SHE

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:38.418
COMPLIMENTED TRUMP ON SOME

01:06:38.418 --> 01:06:41.084
THINGS AND REACH ACROSS THE

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:41.376
AISLE.

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:43.084
I THINK SHE SCORED ON THAT ONE.

01:06:43.084 --> 01:06:45.209
I THINK JOSH ALSO SCORED ON SOME

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:46.668
OF THE STUFF -- ON SOME OF

01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:48.000
CLAIRE'S VOTES ABOUT VOTING

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.751
AGAINST THE TAX CUTS THAT

01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:50.793
OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR THE

01:06:50.793 --> 01:06:51.001
ECONOMY.

01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:52.668
I READ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A

01:06:52.668 --> 01:06:56.292
LOT AND, YOU KNOW, THEY WRITE A

01:06:56.292 --> 01:06:58.960
LOT ABOUT HOW PAY IS GOING UP.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.167
THAT'S WHY THE FED IS RAISING

01:07:00.167 --> 01:07:04.376
INTEREST RATES, THEY'RE WORRIED

01:07:04.376 --> 01:07:05.626
BIN NATION BECAUSE WAGES ARE

01:07:05.626 --> 01:07:06.292
GOING UP.

01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:08.710
I THINK THERE WERE PROS AND CONS

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:10.251
ON BOTH SIDE OF THE AISLE.

01:07:10.251 --> 01:07:13.000
HEALTHCARE HAS BECOME A

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.418
PREEMINENT ISSUE IN THIS

01:07:14.418 --> 01:07:14.751
CAMPAIGN.

01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:17.000
HOW DID YOU FEEL BOTH CANDIDATES

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.918
ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:07:17.918 --> 01:07:18.876
HEALTHCARE, PARTICULARLY

01:07:18.876 --> 01:07:20.000
PROTECTING PRE-EXISTING

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:20.042
CONDITIONS?

01:07:20.042 --> 01:07:22.584
WELL, I THINK THE, YOU KNOW,

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:23.418
WHERE CLAIRE WAS -- SHE WAS

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:25.000
TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, JOSH

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.626
KIND OF HIT HER WITH THE

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:30.000
INCREASED COSTS ON MEDICARE AS A

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.626
RESULT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:07:30.626 --> 01:07:32.000
ACT, BUT THEN SHE CAME BACK AND

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.126
SAID WE CLOSED THE DONUT HOLE.

01:07:34.126 --> 01:07:35.084
DONUT HOLE AS BIG ISSUE,

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:37.334
ESPECIALLY FOR A LOT OF SENIORS

01:07:37.334 --> 01:07:39.334
ON FIXED INCOMES.

01:07:39.334 --> 01:07:41.126
WHERE JOSH CAME IN WAS, HEY,

01:07:41.126 --> 01:07:42.918
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS,

01:07:42.918 --> 01:07:45.960
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED A ONE

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.751
SIZE FIT ALL FEDERAL PROGRAM TO

01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:49.000
ADDRESS PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.543
I THINK JOSH HAS A LOT OF GOOD

01:07:51.543 --> 01:07:53.584
IDEAS, BUT CLAIRE COUNTERED HIS

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:54.710
IDEAS ARE JUST THAT.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:56.000
THEY'RE IDEAS ON PAPER.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
THEY DON'T HAVE A FIRM POLICY

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.334
YET, SO MAYBE IT MIGHT BE

01:08:00.334 --> 01:08:02.126
PREMATURE TO HAVE A LAWSUIT

01:08:02.126 --> 01:08:02.960
AGAINST THAT.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.459
SO THAT WAS KIND OF GOODING

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:05.126
ABOUT BACK AND FORTH THERE.

01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:06.793
DID YOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

01:08:06.793 --> 01:08:08.584
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE AFTER

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.084
THIS DEBATE?

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:11.000
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT IN

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.084
FRONT OF THE CAMERA.

01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:14.000
THAT'S FAIR.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.251
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY COMING

01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:18.960
AFTER ME, BUT NO, I THINK IT'S A

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.459
GOOD INFORMATION FOR EVERYBODY

01:08:20.459 --> 01:08:20.918
HERE.

01:08:20.918 --> 01:08:23.960
SO I THINK I STILL GOT TO DO

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.167
MORE RESEARCH.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.626
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, SIR.

01:08:26.626 --> 01:08:28.501
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:29.209
CASEY, BACK TO YOU.

01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:31.000
JASON, BEFORE YOU GO,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.167
SPEAKING OF HEALTHCARE, I KNOW

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:33.793
FROM YOUR REPORTING, YOU'VE BEEN

01:08:33.793 --> 01:08:35.167
TALKING TO FOLKS THAT THIS IS A

01:08:35.167 --> 01:08:36.751
NUMBER ONE ISSUE.

01:08:36.751 --> 01:08:38.000
FOR INSTANCE, IN JEFFERSON

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.710
COUNTY, THAT'S A SUBURB SOUTH OF

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:41.000
ST. LOUIS THAT WENT HEAVILY FOR

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.376
DONALD TRUMP, BUT ALSO JUST

01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:45.000
REJECTED RIGHT-TO-WORK, SO I'M

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.835
JUST CURIOUS, DID YOU HEAR

01:08:47.835 --> 01:08:48.751
ANYTHING NEW ON HEALTHCARE

01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:50.084
TONIGHT THAT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:52.334
BEFORE FROM THESE TWO?

01:08:52.334 --> 01:08:55.459
I WOULD SAY THAT THE RHETORIC

01:08:55.459 --> 01:08:58.126
WE HEARD FROM BOTH CANDIDATES

01:08:58.126 --> 01:09:00.000
HAS BEEN REPLICATED THROUGHOUT

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.167
THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR FROM BOTH

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.334
SENATOR McCASKILL AND ATTORNEY

01:09:03.334 --> 01:09:04.418
GENERAL HAWLEY.

01:09:04.418 --> 01:09:06.626
SENATOR McCASKILL HAS MADE

01:09:06.626 --> 01:09:08.000
HEALTHCARE THE ESSENTIAL FOCUS

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.084
OF HER CAMPAIGN AND HAMMERED

01:09:10.084 --> 01:09:11.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAWLEY FOR

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.251
BEING PART OF THAT LAWSUIT.

01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:13.710
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS NO CHOICE.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.000
SHE CAN'T RUN A CAMPAIGN SAYING

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
JOSH HAWLEY IS GOING TO RUN WITH

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.084
PRESIDENT TRUMP 100% OF THE TIME

01:09:18.084 --> 01:09:19.501
BECAUSE THIS IS A STATE WHERE

01:09:19.501 --> 01:09:20.835
DONALD TRUMP STILL HAS AROUND A

01:09:20.835 --> 01:09:22.376
50% APPROVAL RATING, SO IT

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:24.376
PLACED HAWLEY ON THE DEFENSIVE,

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:27.209
BUT AS YOU SAW AT THE BEGINNING

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:30.668
OF THE DEBATE, HAUL BY WENT ON

01:09:30.668 --> 01:09:33.000
THE OFFENSIVE -- HAWLEY WENT ON

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.376
THE OFFENSIVE ON HEALTHCARE AND

01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:37.000
IT COULD BE TOUGHER FOR KEY

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.084
BATTLE GROUNDS OF THE STATE.

01:09:39.084 --> 01:09:41.584
WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU IN

01:09:41.584 --> 01:09:42.084
A MINUTE.

01:09:42.084 --> 01:09:43.626
HEALTHCARE DID SEEM TO DOMINATE

01:09:43.626 --> 01:09:46.251
A LOT OF AIR TIME TONIGHT.

01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.126
ANITA, IS THAT GOING TO BE A

01:09:48.126 --> 01:09:48.835
DECIDING ISSUE?

01:09:48.835 --> 01:09:50.001
IT'S POLLING NUMBER ONE ISSUE

01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:51.376
IN MISSOURI AND IT'S ONE OF THE

01:09:51.376 --> 01:09:52.751
NUMBER ONE ISSUES THAT DEMOCRATS

01:09:52.751 --> 01:09:54.167
ARE FOCUSING ON NATIONWIDE.

01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:57.000
SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN THE

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.751
REPORTS, TOO, THAT THIS IS ONE

01:09:58.751 --> 01:10:00.501
CONSISTENT AREA THAT DEMOCRATS

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:02.167
HAVE RALLIED AROUND.

01:10:02.167 --> 01:10:03.501
THEY KNOW -- IT'S INTERESTING TO

01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:06.000
ME BECAUSE IN 2010 AND IN 2012

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.001
AND '14, THESE WERE NOT POPULAR

01:10:10.001 --> 01:10:11.000
ISSUES FOR DEMOCRATS.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.584
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ISSUE WAS

01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:12.918
SOMETHING THEY TRIED TO STEER

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:14.459
AWAY FROM, BUT NOW AS PEOPLE

01:10:14.459 --> 01:10:17.000
HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF LOSING IT,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
IT'S BECOME MUCH MORE POPULAR

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.710
AND AS THEY REALIZE WHAT THE

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:27.167
PROVISIONS ACTUALLY ARE UNDER

01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:27.501
OBAMACARE.

01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:29.209
BUT PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP, IS

01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:30.126
THAT A LIABILITY?

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:32.459
YES, FORUMS HAVE GONE UP,

01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:33.418
ESPECIALLY ON THE -- PREMIUMS

01:10:33.418 --> 01:10:34.876
HAVE GONE UP, ESPECIALLY ON THE

01:10:34.876 --> 01:10:36.000
EXCHANGE IN NOW, AND THAT'S

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.960
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR McCASKILL

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.710
IS GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER AND

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:39.626
DEAL WITH.

01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:41.000
BUT THIS IS A REAL DISTINCTION

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.251
BETWEEN THE TWO WHEN IT COMES IN

01:10:42.251 --> 01:10:44.876
THIS ISSUE OF HEALTHCARE AND THE

01:10:44.876 --> 01:10:45.960
LAWSUIT THAT KEEPS COMING UP AND

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.209
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT

01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:49.251
IN COURT, THAT JOSH HAWLEY

01:10:49.251 --> 01:10:51.167
JOINED WITH SEVERAL OTHER

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:52.000
REPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:54.459
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:55.501
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.835
THE TIMING OF THAT IF THAT

01:10:57.835 --> 01:10:59.751
LAWSUIT TENDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE

01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:01.000
CONGRESS -- THERE'S A DECISION

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.626
ON THAT LAWSUIT BEFORE CONGRESS

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:06.001
PUT AND REPLACEMENT IN PLACE IF

01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:07.251
THE REPUBLICANS ARE STILL IN

01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:07.668
CONTROL.

01:11:07.668 --> 01:11:09.167
THAT CAN HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT, SO

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:11.000
THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.292
GOING FORWARD NO MATTER WHO WINS

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:12.835
THIS RACE.

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:16.000
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.251
DIFFERENT ON THAT?

01:11:18.251 --> 01:11:22.001
THE LAWSUIT IS THE CENTERPIECE

01:11:22.001 --> 01:11:23.126
OF COMMERCIALS.

01:11:23.126 --> 01:11:25.376
WAS MR. HAWLEY ABLE TO CHANGE

01:11:25.376 --> 01:11:26.000
THE NARRATIVE?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.126
I DON'T THINK I HEARD

01:11:27.126 --> 01:11:28.918
ANYTHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE HE'S

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:30.001
MAINTAINING YOU DON'T NEED THE

01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:31.000
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO PROTECT

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.918
PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING

01:11:34.918 --> 01:11:35.000
CONDITIONS.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.626
WHAT YOU NEED AS REPLACEMENT.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:37.584
THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.000
PLAN, THE PLAN HE PROPOSED IN

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
THE OP-ED IN THE SPRINGFIELD

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.334
NEWSPAPER, WHETHER THAT WILL

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:43.167
INDEED HELP IT.

01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:45.000
SOME ECONOMISTS SAY IT WOULDN'T

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.459
HELP THE ISSUE.

01:11:46.459 --> 01:11:47.167
THAT'S GOING THAT'S GOING TO

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:49.251
HAVE TO BE SORTED OUT, BUT HE

01:11:49.251 --> 01:11:50.751
WAS PRETTY CONSISTENT ON THAT

01:11:50.751 --> 01:11:51.001
POINT.

01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:53.960
HE FEELS HE'S CONSISTENT BECAUSE

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.626
EVEN THOUGH HE'S OPPOSING THE

01:11:55.626 --> 01:11:57.000
ACA IN COURT, HE SAYS HE WANTS

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.042
TO KEEP THE PROTECTS IN PLACE

01:11:59.042 --> 01:11:59.501
FOR CONSUMERS.

01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:01.376
HE TOLD US HE HAS A PERSONAL

01:12:01.376 --> 01:12:02.918
REASON FOR TAKING THAT ISSUE

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.126
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS

01:12:04.126 --> 01:12:05.000
INTERESTING THAT CLAIRE

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.292
McCASKILL CAME OUT AND APOLOGIZE

01:12:06.292 --> 01:12:12.000
AND SAID, LOOK, I IN NO WAY

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.918
MEANT TO INSULT YOU OR YOUR

01:12:13.918 --> 01:12:14.000
FAMILY.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.126
BUT HERE THE THINGS ABOUT THE

01:12:16.126 --> 01:12:16.334
ACA.

01:12:16.334 --> 01:12:19.000
WHEN IT WAS ENACTED, IT'S LIKE A

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.126
SPIDER, SO THERE'S ALL THESE

01:12:20.126 --> 01:12:23.835
LITTLE LEGS AND PARTS OF IT THAT

01:12:23.835 --> 01:12:28.292
EVEN PEOPLE THAT VEHEMENTLY

01:12:28.292 --> 01:12:31.000
OPPOSED OBAMACARE, THERE'S

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.334
LITTLE BENEFITS, WHETHER IT'S

01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:35.000
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.084
PRE-EXISTING, IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:12:36.084 --> 01:12:41.167
TOUGH LAW TO THROW OUT.

01:12:41.167 --> 01:12:43.668
YOU MENTIONED FACT CHECKING.

01:12:43.668 --> 01:12:44.793
LET'S GO TO SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:46.501
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET ON THIS

01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:48.793
CONVERSATION, WE'RE TRYING TO

01:12:48.793 --> 01:12:51.543
TRACK THE HASHTAG THAT SEEMS TO

01:12:51.543 --> 01:13:02.751
BE POPULAR AND THAT'S #MO!$!!

01:13:02.751 --> 01:13:03.000
#MOSENATEDEBATE.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.501
ONE PERSON SAID JOSH'S CAMPAIGN

01:13:05.501 --> 01:13:07.668
HAS LITTLE CONNECTION WITH THE

01:13:07.668 --> 01:13:08.000
TRUTH.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.334
DID YOU FIND WHETHER THERE WAS

01:13:10.334 --> 01:13:11.459
ENOUGH SAID BY EITHER CANDIDATE

01:13:11.459 --> 01:13:16.000
WHETHER THEY DID IN FACT HAVE A

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:16.543
TORTURED RELATIONSHIP.

01:13:16.543 --> 01:13:18.126
WHAT DID YOU SEE WITH THE PACK

01:13:18.126 --> 01:13:18.376
CHECKING?

01:13:18.376 --> 01:13:19.668
I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:13:19.668 --> 01:13:23.376
DEBATE, BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO

01:13:23.376 --> 01:13:24.292
EMBELLISH CERTAIN THINGS THEY

01:13:24.292 --> 01:13:26.042
SAY, BUT IT DOES APPEAR -- I

01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:28.000
WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LISTEN

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.209
TO EVERYTHING AGAIN, BUT THERE

01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:30.668
ARE SOME THINGS, PARTICULARLY

01:13:30.668 --> 01:13:31.543
THE MEDICARE VOTE.

01:13:31.543 --> 01:13:34.042
THAT MIGHT BE A BIT OF AN

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.835
EXAGGERATION THERE AND CERTAINLY

01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:37.000
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SENATOR

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.001
McCASKILL HAS TALKED ABOUT IN

01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:41.668
TERMS OF THE GUN ISSUE.

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:46.000
SHE HAS SORT OF VOTED FOR SOME

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.001
OF THOSE THINGS.

01:13:47.001 --> 01:13:50.000
SO I HESITATE TO MAKE A

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.918
DEFINITIVE JUDGMENT ON THAT,

01:13:50.918 --> 01:13:53.626
CASEY, BUT I THINK THERE WERE

01:13:53.626 --> 01:13:54.626
SOME THINGS THERE THAT

01:13:54.626 --> 01:13:55.918
DEFINITELY NEED TO BE FACT CHECK

01:13:55.918 --> 01:13:57.418
ON JOSH HAWLEY'S SIDE AND

01:13:57.418 --> 01:13:58.084
PERHAPS EVEN ON SENATOR

01:13:58.084 --> 01:13:59.793
McCASKILL'S SIDE AS WELL.

01:13:59.793 --> 01:14:01.292
I WOULD SAY WHEN SENATOR MFL

01:14:01.292 --> 01:14:03.918
SAID THAT AND THE -- SENATOR

01:14:03.918 --> 01:14:05.126
McCASKILL SAID THAT AND THE

01:14:05.126 --> 01:14:07.543
AUDIENCES REACTION AND I THINK

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:09.918
WHAT SHE WAS HOPING FOR WAS

01:14:09.918 --> 01:14:10.668
IMPLICATING PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:11.710
A DIFFICULT RELATION TO THE

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.626
TRUTH AND TRYING TO TIE JOSH

01:14:12.626 --> 01:14:13.334
HAWLEY TO THAT.

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:14.918
A LOT OF HER THEME WAS JOSH

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:16.251
HAWLEY SAYS HE DOESN'T DISAGREE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.042
WITH ANYTHING DONALD TRUMP DOES

01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:21.918
AND REALLY TRYING TO KEEP THAT

01:14:21.918 --> 01:14:23.000
THREAD GOING THROUGHOUT THE

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:23.084
NIGHT.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.751
AT THE SAME TIME, MAKING SURE

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:25.418
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SHE

01:14:25.418 --> 01:14:27.042
SOMETIMES AGREES WITH MR. TRUMP

01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:27.835
AS WELL.

01:14:27.835 --> 01:14:29.084
YES, SHE WAS VERY NICE.

01:14:29.084 --> 01:14:33.000
I THOUGHT THE DEBATE WAS VERY

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:33.334
POLITE.

01:14:33.334 --> 01:14:35.001
IT'S HOPING FOR MORE FIREWORKS

01:14:35.001 --> 01:14:35.626
PERSONALLY, BUT I DON'T THINK

01:14:35.626 --> 01:14:37.000
EITHER CANDIDATE DEVIATED OFF

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.459
THE STANDARD TALKING POINTS

01:14:38.459 --> 01:14:40.126
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD.

01:14:40.126 --> 01:14:41.835
CASEY, YOU MENTIONED EVERYBODY

01:14:41.835 --> 01:14:42.668
NOTICED JOSH HAWLEY WALKING OUT

01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:45.209
AND ENGAGING WITH THE AUDIENCE,

01:14:45.209 --> 01:14:46.042
BUT CLAIRE DIDN'T.

01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:47.501
YOU TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:50.710
CLAIRE, MOST PEOPLE KNOW SHE'S A

01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:52.418
BIT VERTICALLY CHALLENGED, SO

01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:53.418
SHE HAD A PLATFORM.

01:14:53.418 --> 01:14:55.000
I'M SORRY, I'M TOLD THAT WAS

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.126
WRONG.

01:14:55.126 --> 01:14:56.918
I GAVE YOU BAD INFORMATION.

01:14:56.918 --> 01:14:57.960
NO, I APOLOGIZE.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.042
EARLIER WHEN THEY WERE TESTING

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:00.084
THINGS OUT, THERE WAS A LITTLE

01:15:00.084 --> 01:15:01.376
BIT OF A STOOL.

01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:03.334
I WAS TOLD IN THE LAST COUPLE

01:15:03.334 --> 01:15:06.000
MINUTES THAT SHE JUST CHOSE, I'M

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.668
TOLD, TO NOT STEP OUT.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:10.000
BUT I SAW ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.292
WELL THAT THAT SEEMED FORMULAIC.

01:15:12.292 --> 01:15:13.710
OF COURSE, THEY MAY NOT BE A FAN

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.626
OF MR. HAWLEY, BUT EVERYTHING IS

01:15:15.626 --> 01:15:16.751
PARSED WHEN YOU MAKE DECISIONS

01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:17.543
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

01:15:17.543 --> 01:15:19.042
THERE'S A LOT OF STAGING WHEN

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:20.876
IT COMES TO DEBATES AND A LOT OF

01:15:20.876 --> 01:15:22.001
SORT FORMATS AND WHERE PEOPLE

01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:23.334
ARE GOING TO STAND AND WHERE

01:15:23.334 --> 01:15:24.459
THEY'RE GOING TO WALK AND WHAT

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:27.042
YOU'RE GOING TO DO, AND SOMEONE

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:28.751
LIKE SENATOR McCASKILL WHO HAS

01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:30.000
RUN THESE CAMPAIGNS BEFORE, SHE

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.543
CERTAINLY HAS HER WAY OF DOING

01:15:32.543 --> 01:15:32.751
THINGS.

01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:33.751
WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

01:15:33.751 --> 01:15:34.668
TONIGHT AS WELL.

01:15:34.668 --> 01:15:36.543
LET'S GO BACK TO THE CROWD.

01:15:36.543 --> 01:15:38.000
JASON STANDING BY AGAIN.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
JASON, CATCH US UP WITH WHERE

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
YOU ARE AND WHOM YOU'VE FOUND.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.251
I'M HERE RIGHT NOW WITH

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:47.918
TIYELLE, HE WAS ONE OF THE

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.751
PEOPLE THAT SKZ ASKED A

01:15:50.751 --> 01:15:52.000
QUESTIONS I WAS HEART TENNED

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
THAT YOU ASKED THE QUESTION

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.292
ABOUT BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN

01:15:55.292 --> 01:15:56.292
POLICE OFFICERS AND AFRICAN

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:56.876
AMERICANS.

01:15:56.876 --> 01:16:00.960
THAT WAS A QUESTION CONSPICUOUS!$!!!!!!!!!!

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.918
CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IN 2006

01:16:03.918 --> 01:16:06.000
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
DID YOU FEEL THAT THE CANDIDATES

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION TO YOUR

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:11.001
SATISFACTION?

01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:13.000
IN MY OPINION, THE CANDIDATES

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:13.876
DANCED AROUND.

01:16:13.876 --> 01:16:17.000
I ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD ANY

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.042
LEGISLATION IN MIND THAT DIDN'T

01:16:18.042 --> 01:16:19.710
INCLUDE INCREASING LAW

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:19.960
ENFORCEMENT.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.793
I THINK THAT THREW THEM FOR A

01:16:21.793 --> 01:16:22.000
LOOP.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.543
THEY BOTH TALK ABOUT THINGS DONE

01:16:23.543 --> 01:16:25.000
IN THE PAST AS FAR AS COLLECTING

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.292
DATA ON RACIAL PROFILING AND

01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:27.918
THINGS OF THAT NATURE, BUT THOSE

01:16:27.918 --> 01:16:29.000
AREN'T THINGS THAT GO INTO

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.459
STOPPING THE ISSUE, THAT GO INTO

01:16:30.459 --> 01:16:33.084
ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROBLEM.

01:16:33.084 --> 01:16:35.042
TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY POLICING,

01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:37.000
I'M NOT SURE WHAT COMMUNITY

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.584
POLICING REALLY IS, BUT I KNOW

01:16:39.584 --> 01:16:42.418
THAT IT HASN'T HAD AN EFFECT OR

01:16:42.418 --> 01:16:44.000
DEFINITELY NOT A POSITIVE EFFECT

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:44.960
ON OUR COMMUNITY.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.292
IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS SINCE

01:16:46.292 --> 01:16:48.292
MICHAEL BROWN'S SHOOTING DEATH.

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:49.334
DO YOU FEEL THAT MISSOURI

01:16:49.334 --> 01:16:52.251
POLITICAL LEADERS LIKE CLAIRE

01:16:52.251 --> 01:16:54.001
McCASKILL AND JOSH HAWLEY ARE

01:16:54.001 --> 01:16:55.292
TAKING THE ISSUE OF POLICE

01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:56.918
ACCOUNTABILITY AND BRIDGING THE

01:16:56.918 --> 01:16:58.876
DIVIDE BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:16:58.876 --> 01:17:00.334
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SERIOUSLY?

01:17:00.334 --> 01:17:02.000
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THINGS CAN BE

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.459
DONE AT A FEDERAL LEVEL OR IS IT

01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:05.126
MORE OF A LOCAL LEVEL ISSUE?

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:07.751
I THINK IT HAS TO BE LOCAL

01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:08.376
AND FEDERAL.

01:17:08.376 --> 01:17:09.251
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE TAKING THE

01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:12.167
ISSUE SERIOUSLY.

01:17:12.167 --> 01:17:13.251
I THINK THAT AS AFRICAN

01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:14.835
AMERICANS IN A PRETTY TOUGH

01:17:14.835 --> 01:17:16.001
COMMUNITY AND A TOUGH

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:17.668
NEIGHBORHOOD, WE'RE BEING

01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:19.292
GROUPED IN TOGETHER AND BEING

01:17:19.292 --> 01:17:20.835
DEMONIZED AND HUNG OUT TO DRY.

01:17:20.835 --> 01:17:22.751
WE WANT TO BE SAFE, WE WANT TO

01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:24.000
LIVE OUR LIFE SAFELY.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.668
WE WANT TO GO AND WORK AND WE

01:17:25.668 --> 01:17:27.000
WANT TO BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.668
SOCIETY, SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO

01:17:28.668 --> 01:17:30.584
DO THAT LOOKING OVER YOUR

01:17:30.584 --> 01:17:33.000
DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR MIND

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.167
ABOUT WHO YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:36.292
FOR WAS CHANGED BY THIS DEBATE

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:38.209
OR HOW THEY ANSWERED YOUR

01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.418
QUESTION?

01:17:38.418 --> 01:17:41.000
NO, I'M STILL GOING TO DO A

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.501
LITTLE BIT MORE RESEARCH TO GET

01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:44.835
A BIT MORE INFORMED ON BOTH OF

01:17:44.835 --> 01:17:46.209
THEIR BACKGROUNDS AND FACT CHECK

01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:49.668
WHAT THEY SAID IN HERE.

01:17:49.668 --> 01:17:52.793
I DO FEEL LIKE ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:55.084
HAWLEY CAMPAIGNED TO ME A LOT.

01:17:55.084 --> 01:17:56.626
I FEEL LIKE CLAIRE ANSWERED MORE

01:17:56.626 --> 01:17:57.459
QUESTIONS AND HE WAS

01:17:57.459 --> 01:17:57.626
CAMPAIGNING.

01:17:57.626 --> 01:17:59.626
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR, AND

01:17:59.626 --> 01:18:04.418
I REALLY PRECIOUS -- APPRECIATE

01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:06.751
YOUR TIME AND YOUR QUESTION.

01:18:06.751 --> 01:18:07.793
CASEY, BACK TO YOU.

01:18:07.793 --> 01:18:08.876
JASON, THANK YOU.

01:18:08.876 --> 01:18:12.084
SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS THERE,

01:18:12.084 --> 01:18:14.334
NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERY SERIOUS

01:18:14.334 --> 01:18:15.292
ISSUES HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, HE

01:18:15.292 --> 01:18:18.000
FELLS LIKE HE GOT A PAT ANSWER

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.668
TO HIS QUESTION THAT WE'VE HEARD

01:18:19.668 --> 01:18:20.000
BEFORE.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.876
COMMUNITY POLICING, WHAT IS

01:18:22.876 --> 01:18:23.292
THAT?

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:26.668
WE HEAR THAT A LOT, BUT TAME,

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.292
IT'S HARD TO TACKLE A NUANCED

01:18:28.292 --> 01:18:30.000
ISSUE IN A DEBATE WHEN YOU'RE

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.292
TALKING IN SOUNDBITES.

01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:33.835
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:18:33.835 --> 01:18:35.626
POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS,

01:18:35.626 --> 01:18:36.000
ESPECIALLY IN THE AFRICAN

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.418
AMERICAN COMMUNITY, TO GET

01:18:37.418 --> 01:18:39.000
POLITICAL FOR A MOMENT, CLAIRE

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
McCASKILL WOULD NEED BIG

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:40.626
TURNOUTS FROM THE AFRICAN

01:18:40.626 --> 01:18:41.584
AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN ST. LOUIS

01:18:41.584 --> 01:18:42.793
AND KANSAS CITY AND SOME OF THE

01:18:42.793 --> 01:18:44.292
OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE TO WIN

01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:46.918
ON ELECTION DAY, AND THERE HAS

01:18:46.918 --> 01:18:49.710
BEEN SOME TALK THROUGHOUT THE

01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:50.918
SEASON HERE ABOUT HOW SHE'S

01:18:50.918 --> 01:18:52.000
DOING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.793
IS SHE GOING TO REALLY GET THE

01:18:53.793 --> 01:18:55.793
TURNOUT THAT SHE NEEDS.

01:18:55.793 --> 01:18:57.000
SO I THOUGHT THOSE WERE A COUPLE

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.668
OF CRITICAL MOMENTS ABOUT THE

01:18:58.668 --> 01:18:59.626
VIOLENCE QUESTION AND HIS

01:18:59.626 --> 01:19:00.626
QUESTION ABOUT COMMUNITY

01:19:00.626 --> 01:19:02.543
POLICING IN TERMS OF ANSWERING

01:19:02.543 --> 01:19:04.000
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:04.876
PEOPLE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:19:04.876 --> 01:19:06.418
COMMUNITY IN MISSOURI HAVE HAD

01:19:06.418 --> 01:19:06.584
ABOUT CLAIRE McCASKILL

01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:09.000
THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.835
AND I THINK WHEN HE SIGNALED

01:19:10.835 --> 01:19:11.793
TO THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T

01:19:11.793 --> 01:19:13.292
REALLY GET AN ANSWER, I THINK A

01:19:13.292 --> 01:19:14.960
LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS IS

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.001
NOT AN ISSUE THAT EITHER ONE OF

01:19:17.001 --> 01:19:18.167
THEM HAS NECESSARILY BEEN

01:19:18.167 --> 01:19:20.376
VISIBLE AND OUT FRONT ON, SO

01:19:20.376 --> 01:19:22.292
WHEN YOU GET A CANDIDATE OFF

01:19:22.292 --> 01:19:24.000
THEIR TALKING POINTS, SOMETIMES

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.459
THEY TEND TO STRUGGLE AND LET'S

01:19:26.459 --> 01:19:28.501
BE HONEST.

01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:29.835
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

01:19:29.835 --> 01:19:31.000
COMMUNITIES, WHETHER THEY'RE

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.001
MINORITY COMMUNITIES OR LOWER

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.292
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THE

01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:34.418
POLICE ARE STRAINED AND THERE'S

01:19:34.418 --> 01:19:36.000
NO SIMPLE ANSWER FOR THAT TO

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
YOUR POINT AND TO EASY WAY TO

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.001
GET A QUICK SOUND BITE.

01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:43.668
YOU MENTIONED THE

01:19:43.668 --> 01:19:45.584
OH YEAH, LET'S GET INTO IT.

01:19:45.584 --> 01:19:47.167
WELL, TAKE IT AWAY.

01:19:47.167 --> 01:19:49.292
I JUST -- YOU KNOW, CAMPAIGN

01:19:49.292 --> 01:19:50.001
SEASON, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:50.918
GOING TO HEAR.

01:19:50.918 --> 01:19:52.751
A BUNCH OF ATTACKS, THEY'RE NOT

01:19:52.751 --> 01:19:55.459
GOING TO DO THIS FOR YOU, WHERE

01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:57.292
HAS SHE BEEN, WHAT IS HE DOING?

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.334
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR, YOU

01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:00.584
KNOW, A LITTLE MORE DIRECT

01:20:00.584 --> 01:20:00.918
IMPACT.

01:20:00.918 --> 01:20:02.584
YOU KNOW, I FELT LIKE WE WERE

01:20:02.584 --> 01:20:03.710
WATCHING A BOXING MATCH AND

01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:05.751
THERE WAS A LOT OF SHADOW BOXES,

01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:08.459
BUT VERY FEW DIRECT HITS IN MY

01:20:08.459 --> 01:20:10.000
WELL, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.501
THE ADS WE'RE SEEING.

01:20:11.501 --> 01:20:14.459
RIGHT, RIGHT.

01:20:14.459 --> 01:20:16.334
YOU WRAP UP ALL THE RHETORIC AND

01:20:16.334 --> 01:20:18.000
WE GET HERE AND IT'S LIKE, YOUR

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:18.418
FAMILY IS LOVELY.

01:20:18.418 --> 01:20:21.000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, WHEN

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.084
SENATOR McCASKILL APOLOGIZED

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:23.001
ABOUT THE FAMILY THING AND

01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:24.459
TALKING ABOUT THE FAMILY, SHE

01:20:24.459 --> 01:20:25.835
SAID I DON'T ATTACK FAMILIES,

01:20:25.835 --> 01:20:27.000
BUT OTHER PEOPLE DO, I THINK IN

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.459
REFERENCE TO SOME OF THE ADS

01:20:28.459 --> 01:20:29.209
AGAINST HER HUSBAND.

01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:31.084
YEAH, DEFINITELY SOME JABS

01:20:31.084 --> 01:20:32.418
THERE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THAT THE

01:20:32.418 --> 01:20:34.000
TENSION THERE IS.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
THAT CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN PERSONAL

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.501
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS HERE AND

01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:40.251
AS WE GET CLOSER TO ELECTION

01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:42.292
DAY, THEY'VE INTERACTED WITH

01:20:42.292 --> 01:20:43.000
EACH OTHER.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.459
YOU'VE SEEN THE CAMPAIGN ADS, SO

01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:45.418
IT WAS INTERESTING THAT WE

01:20:45.418 --> 01:20:47.209
DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT MORE OF SOME

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.084
OF THESE, MAYBE NOT MINOR

01:20:49.084 --> 01:20:52.126
ISSUES, BUT SOME OF THESE

01:20:52.126 --> 01:20:54.000
EXTRACURRICULAR ISSUES THAT

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.084
AREN'T ABOUT SUBSTANCE TONIGHT.

01:20:55.084 --> 01:20:57.000
THIS REALLY WAS A SUBSTANTIVE

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.001
DEBATE AND I THINK IT'S A CREDIT

01:20:58.001 --> 01:20:59.584
TO THE PANELISTS AND ALSO THE

01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:00.960
VOTER QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD AS

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.292
OKAY, SPEAKING OF QUESTIONS

01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:05.960
FROM VOTERS, THIS IS KATHY RYAN

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.876
ON SOCIAL MEDIA ON TWITTER.

01:21:06.876 --> 01:21:09.000
THIS RACE IS GOING TO COME DOWN

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.876
TO VOTER PARTICIPATION, YOUTH,

01:21:11.876 --> 01:21:14.292
COLLEGE VOTE WILL BE HUGE IN

01:21:14.292 --> 01:21:15.000
THIS STATE.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.543
YOU WORK FIRST HAND WITH OUR

01:21:16.543 --> 01:21:18.084
YOUTH COLLEGE VOTE.

01:21:18.084 --> 01:21:19.835
AND ANYONE WHO'S IN MY CLASS

01:21:19.835 --> 01:21:21.543
WILL TELL YOU, MY MANTRA FROM

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.126
START TO FINISH IS VOTE, VOTE IN

01:21:23.126 --> 01:21:24.835
EVERY ELECTION, HAVE YOUR VOICE

01:21:24.835 --> 01:21:25.918
HEARD, PARTICIPATE IN OTHER

01:21:25.918 --> 01:21:26.000
WAYS.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.626
I WOULD SAY THAT TO EVERYONE IN

01:21:27.626 --> 01:21:28.918
OUR STATE.

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:32.042
OUR VOTER TURNOUT IN 2014 WAS

01:21:32.042 --> 01:21:32.334
35%.

01:21:32.334 --> 01:21:34.000
THAT'S VOTER TURNOUT MIDTERM

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:34.126
ELECTIONS.

01:21:34.126 --> 01:21:35.626
SO I WOULD SAY TO EVERYONE, NO

01:21:35.626 --> 01:21:37.876
MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE

01:21:37.876 --> 01:21:39.001
BALLOT INITIATIVES, THE

01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:41.000
SENATORIAL RACE, HAVE YOUR VOICE

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.876
DON'T STAY HOME.

01:21:42.876 --> 01:21:45.292
AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME

01:21:45.292 --> 01:21:46.960
INCREASED VOTER TURNOUT, VOTER

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.000
REGISTRATION NUMBERS ACROSS THE

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
THAT'S ONE BENEFIT OF HAVING A

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:50.793
RELATIVELY EARLY VOTER

01:21:50.793 --> 01:21:51.960
REGISTRATION DEADLINE, YOU CAN

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.001
SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE

01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:54.501
REGISTERED SO VOTE AND THERE

01:21:54.501 --> 01:21:55.793
DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE A LOT

01:21:55.793 --> 01:21:58.751
MORE INTEREST IN VOTING IN THIS

01:21:58.751 --> 01:22:00.042
ELECTION, WHETHER IT'S THE

01:22:00.042 --> 01:22:01.292
PRESIDENT TRUMP FACTOR OR OTHER

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:02.751
THINGS, SO IT WILL BE

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.209
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT

01:22:04.209 --> 01:22:05.000
MANIFESTS AND FOR WHICH

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
CANDIDATE ON ELECTION DAY AS

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I WOULD COUNTER TO THAT,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.334
THOUGH, HISTORICALLY WHEN IT

01:22:10.334 --> 01:22:11.793
COMES TO MID TERMS, OLDER PEOPLE

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.584
TEND TO SHOW UP MORE THAN YOUNG

01:22:13.584 --> 01:22:13.876
PEOPLE.

01:22:13.876 --> 01:22:15.042
YOUNG PEOPLE TEND TO SHOW UP FOR

01:22:15.042 --> 01:22:18.626
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, BUT

01:22:18.626 --> 01:22:20.126
NOT AS MUCH FOR THE MIDTERM.

01:22:20.126 --> 01:22:22.000
SO FOR A COUNTRY -- A COUNTRY

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.126
AND A STATE, REALLY, OUR CYCLE

01:22:24.126 --> 01:22:25.251
IS SO SHORT.

01:22:25.251 --> 01:22:26.876
ERIC GREITENS, YOU REMEMBER HIM?

01:22:26.876 --> 01:22:27.876
THAT WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO.

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.584
REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT

01:22:29.584 --> 01:22:31.668
THAT MIGHT AFFECT THIS ELECTION.

01:22:31.668 --> 01:22:33.543
AND IT HAS NO BEARING

01:22:33.543 --> 01:22:33.793
WHATSOEVER.

01:22:33.793 --> 01:22:35.626
HE'S NONEXISTENT IN THIS THING.

01:22:35.626 --> 01:22:37.376
IT'S SO INTERESTING, ONE, HOW

01:22:37.376 --> 01:22:39.000
QUICKLY THE CYCLE TURNS, AND

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.459
TWO, IF PEOPLE YOUNG AND YOUNG

01:22:40.459 --> 01:22:42.000
VOTERS ARE GOING TO TURN OUT.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.626
I ALMOST SUSPECT PAR FOR THE

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:44.626
COURSE, THIS IS GOING TO COME

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:45.793
DOWN TO OLDER VOTERS.

01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:48.459
I'M INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE

01:22:48.459 --> 01:22:51.626
BALLOT INITIATIVES MIGHT AFFECT

01:22:51.626 --> 01:22:51.793
THAT.

01:22:51.793 --> 01:22:52.751
HAVING MINIMUM WAGE AND

01:22:52.751 --> 01:22:56.543
MARIJUANA ISSUES ON THE BALLOT.

01:22:56.543 --> 01:22:59.000
MIGHT BRING OUT YOUNGER VOTERS.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.292
BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH

01:23:00.292 --> 01:23:02.001
THAT IT MIGHT NOT TAKE MUCH?

01:23:02.001 --> 01:23:03.668
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME

01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:04.292
CLAIRE McCASKILL RUNS FOR

01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:05.710
SENATE, IT IS A CLOSE ELECTION

01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:06.459
AND I DON'T THINK THIS TIME

01:23:06.459 --> 01:23:07.626
WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT.

01:23:07.626 --> 01:23:09.626
YOU MENTIONED THE MINIMUM WAGE,

01:23:09.626 --> 01:23:11.042
A LOT OF EFFORT MOBILIZING

01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:12.126
BEHIND THAT.

01:23:12.126 --> 01:23:13.543
MEDICAL MARIJUANA, CLEAN

01:23:13.543 --> 01:23:14.710
MISSOURI, ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:16.251
ON THE GROUND FOR THOSE RACES,

01:23:16.251 --> 01:23:17.000
AND THAT WILL BRING PEOPLE TO

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
THE POLLS.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.001
THERE WERE SOME OTHER ISSUES

01:23:20.001 --> 01:23:22.126
THAT CAME UP THAT ARE GETTING

01:23:22.126 --> 01:23:23.084
NATIONAL ATTENTION.

01:23:23.084 --> 01:23:24.376
TAKE FOR INSTANCE TARIFFS.

01:23:24.376 --> 01:23:27.418
THAT HAVE A REAL EFFECT HERE IN

01:23:27.418 --> 01:23:28.710
MISSOURI, ON MISSOURI FARMERS

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:31.292
AND THAT TRICKLES THROUGHOUT THE

01:23:31.292 --> 01:23:31.710
ECONOMY.

01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:32.918
DO YOU SEE ISSUES LIKE THAT

01:23:32.918 --> 01:23:34.710
BEING IMPORTANT TO VOTERS HERE

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.668
LOCALLY OR THIS IS GOING TO COME

01:23:36.668 --> 01:23:37.835
DOWN TO SOMETHING MORE PERSONAL,

01:23:37.835 --> 01:23:39.584
MORE OF A GUT FEELING?

01:23:39.584 --> 01:23:41.084
I THINK TARIFFS ARE PERSONAL

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:43.334
FOR SOME PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY

01:23:43.334 --> 01:23:44.543
THOSE IN THE MANUFACTURING

01:23:44.543 --> 01:23:45.084
COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN AFFECTION BY

01:23:45.084 --> 01:23:47.376
THAT AND FARMERS.

01:23:47.376 --> 01:23:48.459
WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

01:23:48.459 --> 01:23:51.084
TENSION TONIGHT ABOUT, OKAY,

01:23:51.084 --> 01:23:53.000
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THIS ISSUE

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:53.876
BECAUSE FARMERS AND AGRICULTURE

01:23:53.876 --> 01:23:55.000
HAVE BEEN HURT IN THIS STATE

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.876
THAT SOME SAY BECAUSE OF THE

01:23:56.876 --> 01:23:57.001
TARIFFS.

01:23:57.001 --> 01:23:58.543
WE HAVE THE COMPANY IN POPLAR

01:23:58.543 --> 01:23:59.668
BLUFF THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS

01:23:59.668 --> 01:24:01.501
THAT THEY WERE REDUCING THEIR

01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:02.418
WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS

01:24:02.418 --> 01:24:03.000
OF THE TARIFFS.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.835
AND YOU SAW, AGAIN, CLAIRE

01:24:05.835 --> 01:24:06.960
McCASKILL TRYING TO DRAW THE

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.126
LINE HERE.

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.876
SHE DID COMPLIMENT THE PRESIDENT

01:24:09.876 --> 01:24:14.292
ON THE RENEGOTIATED NAFTA, THE

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:18.543
NEW UM -- US MCA, I BELIEVE IS

01:24:18.543 --> 01:24:20.251
THE NEW NAME FOR NAFTA, BUT

01:24:20.251 --> 01:24:22.668
STILL TRYING TO CRITICIZE THE

01:24:22.668 --> 01:24:24.000
PRESIDENT, GOING AFTER THE

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
PRESIDENT ON THE CHINA ISSUE

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:25.793
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY

01:24:25.793 --> 01:24:26.543
RESOLUTION TO THAT.

01:24:26.543 --> 01:24:27.918
WE HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS

01:24:27.918 --> 01:24:28.084
LEFT.

01:24:28.084 --> 01:24:30.793
REAL QUICKLY, DID YOU SEE A

01:24:30.793 --> 01:24:31.000
WINNER?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.668
DID ONE OUTSHINE THE OTHER?

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:34.000
I'M GOING TO GO LAST.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.876
WHAT DECISION?

01:24:34.876 --> 01:24:36.835
I'M GOING TO SECOND THAT.

01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:37.710
THAT'S A SAFE BET.

01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:41.334
YEAH, YEAH, LET'S GO WITH

01:24:41.334 --> 01:24:44.292
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, AS IS THIS

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:46.001
STATE IF YOU BELIEVE THE POLL

01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:46.334
NUMBERS.

01:24:46.334 --> 01:24:48.251
IT WILL BE UP TO THE VOTERS

01:24:48.251 --> 01:24:49.960
NOVEMBER 6th.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.751
