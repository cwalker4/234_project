00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.945
We've all found ourselves in conversation and felt attacked

00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:06.578
like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted 

00:00:06.578 --> 00:00:12.430
our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, 
lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.408
Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but 

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:18.498
this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson 

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:22.266
was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone 

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.646
who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb.

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:30.001
So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.978
that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:37.030
how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.075
having earned more respect than you had going in.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:43.147
So first off, to stop a conversational bully,

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:46.442
you have to realize what's going on before it's too late.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.138
Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on 

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:53.606
with their tone of voice and their word choice — kind of like this —

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:57.646
...but I wasn't specifically aiming this message at young men to begin with;

00:00:57.646 --> 00:00:59.322
it just kind of turned out that way but—

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:01.806
And it's mostly, you admit, it's mostly men listening.

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:06.961
In this case, Cathy is indicating very clearly that 
she thinks Jordan has done something wrong.

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.570
Otherwise, why would she use the word "admit?"

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.890
She makes her stance clear a moment later when she implies 
that he should be bothered for being divisive. Just watch.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.522
Does it bother you that your audience is predominantly male? Is that a bit divisive?

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:24.470
The point here is that even when they're being passive-aggressive,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.320
people will often indicate that they're about to attack you before they actually do.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.092
So if you hear someone say something like, 

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.738
"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?" be prepared.

00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:37.642
That person thinks that you've done something wrong and you need to be 

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:41.626
very careful what you say next not because you did do something wrong

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:45.876
but because a conversational bully may be trying to trap you into saying 

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:49.736
something that you disagree with so that they can attack that straw man.

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:55.416
And the first way that this often happens is called 
the "so-you're-saying trap." Here's what it looks like.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:02:00.137
So you're saying women have some sort of 
duty to sort of help fix the crisis of masculinity?

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:02.775
Women want to dominate — is that what you're saying?

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:07.753
So you're saying that anyone who believes in equality whether 
you call them feminists or whatever you want to call them

00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:10.737
should basically give up because "it ain't gonna happen."

00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:16.313
Let me just get this straight; you're saying that we should 
organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:19.593
The general pattern here is that someone says, "So you're saying..."

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:23.701
and then proceeds to oversimplify or mischaracterize what you actually said.

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:26.213
I won't spend too long here because it's very easy to spot 

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.843
and it's rather simple to avoid and get around by saying,

00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:31.823
"Well, actually, what I was saying is..." and then repeat yourself.

00:02:31.823 --> 00:02:32.999
...along the lines of the lobsters.

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.855
I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity 

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:39.289
in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:44.647
But there's a much sneakier way that people may 
mischaracterize your beliefs and then attack them.

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:50.633
Basically, it's when someone's words imply that you 
believe something you don't and they don't actually say it.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:54.200
So in business, they call this "assuming the sale" like when a car salesman says,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.102
"So would you like that with the leather interior or with the 
fabric interior?" before you even decided to buy the car.

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:04.276
Now, with the several thousand dollar purchase, you're likely to notice this and say,

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:06.748
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said I was buying in the first place?"

00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:14.044
But it's very likely that this is happening to you in conversation 
all the time and you don't even notice. Here's how it might look.

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:16.935
[Cathy talks over Jordan] Yeah, but why? 
Why should woman put up with those reasons?

00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:21.738
Embedding the question "why should women put up with it?" 
are several important presuppositions; namely —

00:03:21.738 --> 00:03:27.054
one, that there is something to put up with and two, 
that Jordan thinks woman should put up with it.

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:30.530
Now, the trap here for Jordan would be to answer Cathy's question directly 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.416
and many of us fall into it in similar situations 

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:37.390
then we start arguing for things that we don't even really believe just out of habit.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.080
Instead, you need to identify that hidden presupposition and then call it out.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.274
So watch how carefully Jordan listens to Cathy's questions 

00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:48.920
so that he can catch what she's not saying.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.725
"Why should women put up with it?" I'm not saying they 
should put up with it. I'm saying that the claim—

00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:57.429
Here's another example of assuming-the-sale from later in that conversation.

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:02.513
See if you can spot the hidden presupposition and 
ask yourself what you might say to respond to it.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:03.921
...which women do a lot of. 

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:07.191
But why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children?

00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:09.279
So what's the hidden presupposition —  

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:14.697
that Jordan thinks women must have children. And of course, 
he defends a woman's right to make any decision about that.

00:04:14.697 --> 00:04:17.113
...the right to choose and demand it, correct?

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:19.368
They do. They can. Yeah, that's fine.

00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:21.062
But you're saying that makes them unhappy.

00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:24.330
Here's one more example. See if you can spot the hidden presupposition here.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.535
[Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your 
followers now, "Quit the abuse. Quit the anger."

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:33.092
Did you catch it? The presupposition is that Jordan's followers are abusing people.

00:04:33.092 --> 00:04:38.396
Now, he can't answer that question directly; he has 
to address that hidden point first and he does.

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:44.047
Well, we'd need some substantial examples of the abuse 
and the anger before I could detail that question.

00:04:44.047 --> 00:04:45.226
There's a lot of it out there.

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:51.638
When I cut the clips like this, it makes it very easy to see these 
hidden presuppositions but in real time, this can be difficult.

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:55.862
One simple thing that you can do to make it easier on yourself is to purposely 

00:04:55.862 --> 00:05:00.406
assume a relaxed posture as Jordan does throughout this entire conversation.

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:04.362
Now, this posture actually helps you to think less frantically because your body 

00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:08.315
is signalling to your brain that everything is okay; you're in control.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:12.068
You'll also want to give yourself some time to pause after each question 

00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:14.790
which Jordan definitely does. In addition,

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.833
you're going to want to study up on frames and frame games because 

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:22.558
there's a clearly a whole level of conversation that is going on behind the words.

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:24.456
Now, I've talked about this in other videos 

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:27.194
specifically the one on Tyrion Lanister from Game of Thrones 

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:30.312
and I'll leave a link to that in the description if you want to check it out.

00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:35.883
Moving along though, the last clip contains a small 
example of the third conversational bully tactic 

00:05:35.883 --> 00:05:39.309
in this video which I'm naming the "smash technique." Take a look.

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:43.635
[Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your 
followers now, "Quit the abuse. Quit the anger."

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:49.167
It's subtle here but Cathy smashes together 
two very different terms — abuse and anger.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:53.557
Now, by ending on anger, it would be easier for 
Jordan to just forget it and answer the question.

00:05:53.557 --> 00:05:57.349
But that would tacitly accept that his followers were abusing people.

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:03.731
That's why the smash technique is so frustrating; people are 
embedding hidden statements that you actually disagree with and

00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:07.304
then moving through them before you have the time to voice that disagreement.

00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:10.096
You may also have seen people barrage you with questions 

00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:13.250
just to overwhelm you into having to accept their points like this —

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.394
...otherwise, why would that only be seven women 
running FTSE 100 companies in the UK?

00:06:17.394 --> 00:06:21.272
Why would there still be a pay gap... [Jordan talks over Cathy]

00:06:21.272 --> 00:06:26.012
Why are women at the BBC saying that they're getting paid illegally less than men—

00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:29.454
It can be easy to get overwhelmed and to lose focus as you try to answer 

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:33.631
all of these questions but with the smash technique in general, the best policy is 

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:36.718
to slow down the tempo of conversation 

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:39.935
and tackle one question or one point at a time.

00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:44.395
Let's just go to the first question; those both are complicated questions.

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:47.616
So hopefully, now you're more aware of the so-you're-saying trap 

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.375
when people "assume the sale" and of course, the smash technique.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.984
This moves us to the second section of this video which is

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:55.733
how to persuade someone in these kinds of situations.

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:59.563
And I will say, it seems to me that it doesn't look like Jordan is necessarily 

00:06:59.563 --> 00:07:04.282
trying to change Cathy's mind but simply to debate in front of an audience.

00:07:04.282 --> 00:07:08.204
There are still some valuable tips to be gleamed 
from this video and a few things that I'd add

00:07:08.204 --> 00:07:13.984
First, do not straw man the other person's ideas even if they're doing it to you.

00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:15.716
And to be clear, I don't know if I mentioned this,

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:22.112
straw manning is when you create a caricature of their ideas 
and then attack those rather than what they truly believe.

00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:27.264
Instead, show the other person that you are truly engaging in their real points,

00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:32.178
attempt to understand them, and sometimes this mean that 
you have to ask them to repeat themselves so that you can.

00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:35.098
Seven? Seven women... repeat that one—

00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:38.070
Seven women running the top FTSE 100 companies in the UK.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.240
Well, the first question might be.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.595
After you've made an honest attempt to understand them, you need to make sure 

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:47.027
that they can understand you which is necessary for persuasion.

00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:50.738
And to do that, you often have to use the visual imagery.

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:55.549
For instance, here's a very abstract point without any images that Jordan makes.

00:07:55.549 --> 00:08:01.563
...that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way 
that animals and human beings organize their structures.

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:08.791
It's absolutely inevitable. And there is one-third of 
a billion years of evolutionary history behind that.

00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:12.609
Now, maybe you can understand that but it kind of lacks any emotional oomph.

00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:18.961
But notice how the addition of a concrete example 
makes that one-third of a billion years just feel different.

00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:25.127
That's so long that a third of a billion years ago, 
there weren't even trees; it's a long time.

00:08:25.127 --> 00:08:29.521
So adding concrete examples especially ones that people can easily imagine 

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:34.247
is a smart persuasive move and lastly, when you're arguing, oftentimes 

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:38.537
the best way to get someone to change their position is not by changing their mind 

00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:42.123
but by gently showing them that they are already agreeing with you.

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:45.560
I talked about this in the frame video but here's an example from this interview.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.934
Why should your rights to freedom of speech 
trump a trans-person's right not to be offended?

00:08:51.934 --> 00:08:56.421
Because in order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive.

00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:58.818
I mean, look at the conversation we're having right now.

00:08:58.818 --> 00:09:02.888
You know, like, you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth.

00:09:02.888 --> 00:09:06.232
Why should you have the right to do that? It's been rather uncomfortable.

00:09:06.232 --> 00:09:10.324
This is huge. Jordan is no longer arguing that her point is wrong;

00:09:10.324 --> 00:09:15.448
he's arguing that she already agrees with him — 
her behavior and her previous statements demonstrate 

00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:19.108
that she cares more about free speech than not offending people.

00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:24.636
And then Jordan doesn't try to make this point wrong; 
he shows her how they're actually very much in alignment.

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:28.286
You're doing what you should do which is 
digging a bit to see what the hell's going on.

00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:33.562
And I gave you what you should do but you're exercising 
your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me.

00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:37.730
And that's fine. I think — more power to you as far as I'm concerned.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.104
And then of course Cathy feels stumped because she 
does actually agree with Jordan and she's proven it herself.

00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:46.330
People have a strong desire to remain consistent 

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.706
with things they've already said and done so oftentimes, this becomes 

00:09:49.706 --> 00:09:53.756
one of the few ways to persuade someone who's really dug in their heels.

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:56.132
You're basically showing them that they don't have to move

00:09:56.132 --> 00:10:00.178
in order to agree with you; they already do right where they're dug in.

00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:02.686
And then of course, Jordan hits her with the "gotcha."

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:09.990
...uh, and... [sighs] I'm just trying to work that out but I mean... [sighs] 

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.569
Jordan: Hah. Gotcha.
Cathy: You have got me. You have got me.

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:15.902
Even though I laughed at that phrase at the time I was watching the interview,

00:10:15.902 --> 00:10:21.016
I have to say that last bit "gotcha" does not improve Jordan's persuasive case.

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:24.452
It actually makes Cathy feel silly and wrong as opposed to 

00:10:24.452 --> 00:10:28.202
happy to discover that she and Jordan are really on the same team all along 

00:10:28.202 --> 00:10:31.195
and if I had to give one last point of constructive criticism,

00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:34.376
it would be that Jordan answered all of Cathy's questions 

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:39.620
rather than trying to proactively address her deeper unstated emotional concern.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.680
And in my opinion, that emotional concern is that Jordan is her enemy —

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.396
that if he believes something, it must be against her interests.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:51.328
If Jordan could have found that and pointed to a more common ground

00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:54.832
that they share which we all of course have, I don't think the interview 

00:10:54.832 --> 00:10:57.642
would have continued in such an argumentative fashion but 

00:10:57.642 --> 00:11:01.039
Jordan's role isn't necessarily to convince Cathy Newman of anything —

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:03.492
it's to debate for an audience and to promote his book 

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:05.779
which I think he did at an A+ level. 

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:08.142
If you think that I missed something or you just want to discuss,

00:11:08.142 --> 00:11:11.584
leave a comment below. I'm actually to be checking periodically but

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:15.267
I will be most active in the comments for that first hour after the video goes live 

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:20.190
which is now 2 p.m. Eastern on Mondays so hit subscribe and hit the notification bell

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.019
to make sure that you're notified when I am here and chatting.

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:25.849
That way you can hop on if you want to discuss anything with me 

00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:27.582
or if you have a question that you'd like to ask.

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:31.896
I also think that this video makes a very strong companion for both the Tyrion video 

00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:34.665
that I mentioned about frames which are super interesting 

00:11:34.665 --> 00:11:38.044
and the previous Jordan Peterson video which will teach you how to get respect

00:11:38.044 --> 00:11:41.342
without being a bully so click the screen if you want to check either of those out.

00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:44.564
Hopefully, you guys enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one.
