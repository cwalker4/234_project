NEVER THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE

YEAH, OR NIGHTMARES.

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:48.347

HAVE WORKED ON THINGS YOU REALLY

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.083 align:start position:0%
CAN'T DISCUSS WITH THE REST OF
US.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.351 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.220
LIKE EVERYONE WHO WORKS FOR THE
F.B.I., YOU LIVE A VERY PRIVATE

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.224 align:start position:0%
THE WORK THAT WE DO IS
OFTENTIMES-- IT'S ALWAYS

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:58.758 align:start position:0%
SENSITIVE.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:00:59.959 align:start position:0%
IT'S OFTEN CLASSIFIED.

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:01.461
IT'S THINGS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LEGALLY, DO YOU
HAVE TO LOOK AND DRESS LIKE AN

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:07.900 align:start position:0%
EXTRA FROM "DRAGNET" TO BE IN
THE F.B.I.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.567 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE,.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.201
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S A GOOD LOOK.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.303 size:88% position:44%
I TRY TO ROCK IT WHEN I CAN.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.471 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; GOT IT.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:15.074
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, YOUR NEW BOOK
IS CALLED "THE THREAT," AS I

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:16.876 size:84% position:42%
SAID BEFORE "HOW THE F.B.I.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.812 align:start position:0%

YOU HAVE TO GIVE THIS TO DONALD

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:23.749 align:start position:0%
TRUMP.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:27.353
HE IS SINGLEHANDEDLY SAVING THE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IN AMERICA

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:30.957
BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO EVER SPENT
FIVE MINUTES IN A ROOM WITH HIM

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.193
IS JUST STAMPEDING A PUBLISHER
TO SAY, "YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.530 align:start position:0%
THIS GUY SAID!"
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S A SERIES OF

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:40.433
AMAZING INCIDENTS WHEN YOU HAVE
TO INTERACT WITH THE PRESIDENT.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.235 align:start position:0%
SO IT'S GREAT FODDER FOR STORY
S.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.338 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen:  AT ALL-- AT ALL
TIMES, BUT THIS PRESIDENT IN

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.606 align:start position:0%
PARTICULAR.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.876
YOU-- AS I SAID, YOU WERE ACTING
DIRECTOR AFTER COMEY WAS FIRED.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.913 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND OPENED TWO
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:54.881 size:81% position:41%
PRESIDENT, IF I'M CORRECT.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.216 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S ACTUALLY ONE
INVESTIGATION WITH A DUAL

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.883 align:start position:0%
PURPOSE.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.585
SO THERE'S A CRIMINAL CONCERN.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.421
WE THOUGHT THAT THERE MAY HAVE
BEEN A FEDERAL CRIME COMMITTED

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.257 align:start position:0%
-- THAT BEING OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.726 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN HE FIRED
COMEY.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.527 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.761 align:start position:0%
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.763
AND WE ALSO FELT LIKE THERE WAS
A POSSIBILITY THAT A THREAT TO

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:13.533
NATIONAL SECURITY MIGHT EXISTED.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.102
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE HE MIGHT
BE COLLUDING OR CONSPIRING WITH

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
THE RUSSIANS, OR THEY MIGHT HAVE
SOME COMPROMMATE ON HIM.

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:23.576 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
GENERAL THAN THAT.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.112
IF YOU THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES MAY HAVE

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.647
FIRED THE DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.552 align:start position:0%
FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERFERING
WITH OR STOPPING OUR

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.887 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
MALIGN INFLUENCE IN THE

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.025 align:start position:0%
CAMPAIGN, THE QUESTION YOU HAVE
TO ASK YOURSELF IS, "WHY?

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.993 align:start position:0%
WHY WOULD ANY PRESIDENT DO
THAT?"

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:44.263
AND THAT GIVES RISE TO THE
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE CONCERN?

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.966 align:start position:0%
WHY WOULD THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES BE TRYING TO

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.834 align:start position:0%
OBSTRUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO
RUSSIA'S ACTIVITY?

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
AND WHAT-- WHAT MAKES YOU, THAT
THE PRESIDENT FIRED COMEY

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:55.241 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION, OTHER THAN THE

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.643
FACT THAT HE SAID THAT OUT LOUD?

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:02.515 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:06.252 align:start position:0%
<i> ( CHEERS )</i>
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.220 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.055 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING
OTHER THAN THAT?

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:14.293 align:start position:0%
IS THERE OTHER THAN, LIKE, WHAT
HE SAID TO LESTER HOLT.

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:17.230 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.631 align:start position:0%
AND IT WAS SOMETHING WE WERE
AWARE OF.

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.299 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S CALLED A LEAD
IN THE BUSINESS.

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:21.667
&gt;&gt; IT WAS AN INVESTIGATIVE LEAD.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.469 align:start position:0%
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS
THAT CONCERNED US.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.539 align:start position:0%
AS WE INVESTIGATED THE
POSSIBILITY OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THROUGH
THE FALL.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:30.943 align:start position:0%
SO THAT'S THE INVESTIGATION THAT
JIM COMEY HAD MADE PUBLIC.

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:34.213
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT IS IT LIKE TO
BE IN A ROOM WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:37.383 align:start position:0%
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING AND
EVENTUALLY DECIDE TO, WHAT'S IT

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.986 size:88% position:44%
LIKE TO BE IN THAT ROOM WHEN
YOU'RE HAVING TO SERIOUSLY

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
CONSIDER WHETHER TO INVESTIGATE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:42.154 align:start position:0%
STATES?

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:43.422 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:47.059
I MEAN, LOOK, WE DON'T TRAIN AT
QUANTICO FOR, "HERE'S WHAT TO DO

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.961 align:start position:0%
WHEN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO
INVESTIGATE THE PRESIDENT OF THE

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:50.429 align:start position:0%
UNITED STATES."

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.565 align:start position:0%
IT'S JUST NOT A TOPIC THAT WE
TALK ABOUT.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:55.668 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
BUT WHAT WE DO TRAIN ON IS WE

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:58.037 align:start position:0%
SAY, "LOOK, THESE ARE THE
AUTHORITIES WE HAVE.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.774 align:start position:0%
AND THIS IS HOW WE LAWFULLY
EXECUTE THEM."

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:05.011 align:start position:0%
WHEN WE HAVE INFORMATION OR
FACTS THAT INDICATE A CRIME MAY

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:08.281
HAVE BEEN COMMITTED OR THAT A
THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY MAY

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.984
EXIST, THEN WE ARE OBLIGATED AS
THE F.B.I. TO INVESTIGATE THAT

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:14.420 size:81% position:41%
MATTER, WHETHER IT'S THE
PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY ELSE.

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:17.390 align:start position:0%
WE DON'T OPEN INVESTIGATIONS
BECAUSE WE LIKE SOMEONE OR DON'T

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.925 align:start position:0%
LIKE THEM OR BECAUSE THEY'RE A
REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.929
WE OPEN INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WE
HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:27.166 size:84% position:42%
PREDICATE AN INVESTIGATION.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.670 align:start position:0%
WE HAD THAT IN THIS INSTANCE,
UNDENIABLY.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:34.974 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT, YOU
DESCRIBE THE PERIOD OF TIME

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:40.746
AFTER DIRECTOR COMEY WAS FIRED
AS-- AS A PERIOD OF CHAOS AND

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:41.714 align:start position:0%
FRENZY AT THE F.B.I.

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:42.148 align:start position:0%
HEADQUARTERS.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:42.815 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:43.616
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT IS THE F.B.I.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.118 align:start position:0%
LIKE WHEN IT'S IN A CHAOTIC
FRENZY?

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.954 align:start position:0%
THAT'S A DISCONCERTING
DESCRIPTION.

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:53.426
&gt;&gt; OUR DARK TIES ARE SLIGHTLY
ASKEW ON OUR WHITE SHIRTS.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.095 align:start position:0%
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME.

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:58.097 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JUST, THAT OKAY?

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.432 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.834 align:start position:0%

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:02.168 align:start position:0%
QUEENS.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.435 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.538
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE RUNNING THROUGH THE HALLS

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.540 size:75% position:38%
WITH THEIR HAIR ON FIRE.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.809 size:84% position:42%
IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS TIME.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:14.547 align:start position:0%
I HAD-- YOU KNOW, I FELT THAT MY
TIME AS ACTING DIRECTOR WOULD

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.648 align:start position:0%
LIKELY BE VERY SHORT.

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:18.484 align:start position:0%
I KNEW THAT BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT TOLD ME THAT WAS THE

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:19.485 align:start position:0%
LIKELY RESULT.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:21.487 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
AND I KNEW THERE WAS WORK WE

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.057 align:start position:0%
NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THE
INVESTIGATIONES OF ON ROCK-SOLID

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.225 align:start position:0%
GROUND.

00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:29.595 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS SAYS THAT YOU ASKED FOR A

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:33.366 align:start position:0%
BACKUP PLAN TO PROTECT RUSSIA
EVIDENCE.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.235 align:start position:0%
WHAT-- WHAT-- WHAT WAS THAT
BACKUP PLAN?

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:39.605
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T TELL YOU THE DETAILS
OF THE BACKUP PLAN, BUT I CAN

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:41.073 align:start position:0%
SAY THIS, STEPHEN.

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:42.575 size:84% position:42%
WE-- THAT'S OUR JOB, RIGHT?

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:46.812 align:start position:0%
THAT'S OUR JOB TO PREPARE FOR
VERY WELLITY.

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.816
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS IT ON, LIKE, A
THUMB DRIVE INSIDE A BRICK SOME

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.386 align:start position:0%
PLACE AT DUPONT CIRCLE?

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.921 align:start position:0%
DID YOU HAVE TO DO SPY STUFF TO
HIDE IT?

00:05:55.954 --> 00:06:00.159
&gt;&gt; IT'S ON THE TAPE REELS THAT
TURN TO SMOKE AT THE BEGINNING

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:01.327 align:start position:0%
OF THE SHOW.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.529
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, YOU JOKE,
BUT NOW I KNOW THOSE ARE REAL

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:05.164 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE IT'S ITS FIRST THING YOU
THOUGHT OF.

00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:06.132 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:09.869 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY--
&gt;&gt; NO, WE NEEDED TO DO IF

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:13.672 align:start position:0%
DIRECTOR MUELLER WAS SBL FIRED
AND HIS TEAM WAS DISBANDED.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:16.041
AND WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO IN THAT
CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TO BE ABLE TO

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:18.778 align:start position:0%
TAKE OUR CASES BACK AND CONTINUE
THAT INVESTIGATION.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.814 align:start position:0%
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE THOUGHT
THROUGH.

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:23.215 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU WORKED FOR
MUELLER, DIDN'T YOU?

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:24.784 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; I DID, FOR MANY YEARS.

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:26.452 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S HE LIKE AS
A PERSON?

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:27.820 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE'S A TOUGH GUY.

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:32.191 align:start position:0%
HE IS-- HE IS A LOT OF WHAT
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM.

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:33.592
HE IS AN INVESTIGATOR AT HEART.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.594 size:88% position:44%
THAT IS WHAT HE LOVES TO DO.

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:36.462 align:start position:0%
HE LOVES CASES.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:39.432 align:start position:0%
HE LOVES TO GET HIS HANDS ON
THEM.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:42.234
HE LOVES TO HEAR THE DETAILS,
TALK TO THE INVESTIGATORS, PLAN

00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:43.736 align:start position:0%
STRATEGY, AND MOVE
INVESTIGATIONS FORWARD.

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:48.507
SO I AM SURE THAT HE IS JUST AS
HAPPY AS HE CAN POSSIBLY BE IN

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.809
THE POSITION HE'S CURRENTLY IN.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.310 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE LOOKS HAPPY.

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:51.677 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER ).</i>

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:56.048
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JUST A BIG, SILLY
GRIN ALL THE TIME ON HIS FACE.

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:59.185 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S-- THAT'S ABOUT AS
HAPPY AS HE GETS.

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.286 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  ).</i>

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.621 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
HIM IN CHAOS OR FRENZY?

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:05.925 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S THE MOST EXERCISED YOU'VE
SEEN ROBERT MUELLER?

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.993 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I'VE SEEN HIM FRUSTRATED.

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:11.864 align:start position:0%
I'VE SEEN HIM, YOU KNOW,
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE THINGS WE

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
WERE TELLING HIM.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.000 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DOES HE DO?

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:16.936 align:start position:0%
LIKE, HOW DOES HE EXPRESS
HIMSELF?

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.472 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WHEN DIRECTOR
MUELLER WOULD GET FRUSTRATED WE

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:22.341 align:start position:0%
HAD THIS SIGN THAT WE WOULD
ALWAYS LOOK FOR.

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:28.414
IF HIS HEAD CAME DOWN INTO HIS
HAND, WE KNEW IT WAS A PROBLEM.

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:29.448 align:start position:0%
WE'RE OFF THE RAILS.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.250 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S FAIRLY
COMMON AMONG ALL HUMANS.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:33.652 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.

00:07:33.685 --> 00:07:35.788 align:start position:0%
AGAIN, YOU KNOW --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: EXACTLY, YOU'RE A

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:36.789 align:start position:0%
TOM BRADY F.B.I. MAN.

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.391 align:start position:0%
YOU SEE THOSE THINGS.

00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:44.163 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A TELL.

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:44.763 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LIKE THIS.

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.232 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:50.402
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, IN THE BOOK,
IN THE BOOK, WHICH IS A GOOD

00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:51.403 align:start position:0%
READ.

00:07:51.436 --> 00:07:53.272 align:start position:0%
YOU LAY THINGS OUT-- WELL, LIKE
AN INVESTIGATOR.

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:56.108 align:start position:0%
YOU LAY THINGS OUT IN AN ORDERLY
WAY.

00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:57.476 size:78% position:39%
IT'S AN INTERESTING READ.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:58.677 size:75% position:38%
A VERY INTERESTING READ.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.346 size:78% position:39%
I RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:04.917
I HAVE TO SAY ROD ROSENSTEIN
DOES NOT COME OFF GREAT IN THIS

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.151 align:start position:0%
BOOK.

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.387 align:start position:0%
YOU MENTION HE FEELS LIKE THE
BLAME FOR FIRING COMB SEGOING TO

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.555 align:start position:0%
BE PINNED ON HIM.

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:12.791
HE'S AFRAID IT'S GOING TO BE
PINNED ON HIM BECAUSE HE GAVE

00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:17.162 align:start position:0%
THE PRESIDENT A LETTER JUSTICING
THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY.

00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:18.363 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:21.033 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA WHY HE WOULD DO THAT IF HE

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:26.472 align:start position:0%
DIDN'T, IT WAS ACTUALLY
JUSTIFIED?

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:30.609
BECAUSE YOU AND COMEY IN YOUR
BOOK AND IN HIS BOOK ARE VERY

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:34.613
CLEAR WHERE YOU WILL NOT ALLOW
YOURSELF TO BE PUSHED, WHERE YOU

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:36.916 align:start position:0%
WILL NOT GO.

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:41.921
AND I GET THE SENSE THAT ROD
ROSENSTEIN FEELS HE WAS PUSHED

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.722 align:start position:0%
INTO A PLACE HE DIDN'T WANT TO
BE.

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:47.693
&gt;&gt; LOOK, I CAN'T-- I CAN'T TELL
YOU WHAT'S IN ROD'S HEAD, BUT

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:51.530 align:start position:0%
FROM WHAT I OBSERVED, I DON'T
THINK THAT ROD REGRETTED WRITING

00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:52.564 align:start position:0%
THE MEMO.

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:55.801 align:start position:0%
I'M SURE HE WOULD STILL STAND BY
THAT TO THIS DAY.

00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:58.470
WHAT HE WAS TROUBLED BY WAS THE
ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO MAKE

00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:02.541
IT SEEM AS IF THE ENTIRE THING
WAS HIS IDEA WHEN IN FACT, HE

00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:05.945 align:start position:0%
KIND OF STEPPED INTO THE PROCESS
AT THE LAST SECOND AND

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:07.413
VOLUNTEERED TO WRITE THAT MEMO.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:10.049
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ONE OF THE-- ONE
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU-- NOT IN

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:16.422 align:start position:0%
THE BOOK BUT IN INTERVIEWS, YOU
SAID THAT-- THE TWO OF YOU

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:20.259 align:start position:0%
DISCUSSED, ROD ROSENSTEIN
BROUGHT UP THE IDEA OF INVOKING

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:22.995 align:start position:0%
THE 25th AMENDMENT WHICH
ALLOWS THE VICE PRESIDENT OR THE

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:25.831 size:88% position:44%
MAJORITY OF THE CABINET, THE
SENATE AND HOUSE LEADERS TO

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:29.335 align:start position:0%
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT FROM
OFFICE.

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.202 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW DID THAT COME
UP AGAIN?

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.272 align:start position:0%
I KNOW PELLEY ASKED YOU THIS
QUESTION.

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:36.442 align:start position:0%
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN-- HOW
DID THAT SUBJECT COME UP?

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:40.779
&gt;&gt; IFT CAME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF
A CHAOTIC AND LONG CONVERSATION

00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:42.548 align:start position:0%
ABOUT WHAT WERE WE GOING TO DO
NEXT?

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:46.085 align:start position:0%
AND, AGAIN, I CAN'T EVEN
DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:48.287
HEAD-SPINNING THIS WAS TO BE THE
HIGHEST RANKING OFFICIAL IN THE

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.357
F.B.I., AND ONE OF THE HIGHEST
RANKING OFFICIALS IN THE JUSTICE

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.627
DEPARTMENT CONSIDERING, WE HAVE
A PRESIDENT WHO WE THINK MAY

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.030 size:84% position:42%
HAVE ATTEMPTED TO OBSTRUCT
JUSTICE, MAY ALSO PRESENT A

00:09:58.063 --> 00:09:59.932 align:start position:0%
NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO THE
NATION.

00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:01.567 size:78% position:39%
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.802 align:start position:0%
IN MY LANE THAT MEANS
INVESTIGATION, RIGHT.

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:05.137
I'M RUNNING THE INVESTIGATORS.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.906 align:start position:0%
SO THE QUESTION FOR ME WAS DO WE
INVESTIGATE THIS?

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.141 align:start position:0%
IS IT FSO, HOW?

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:10.943
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT?

00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:14.113 align:start position:0%
AND ROD WAS REALLY JUST KIND OF
SPIN THRIEWG A NUMBER OF

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.281 align:start position:0%
DIFFERENT TOPICS.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:18.384 align:start position:0%
THAT'S ONE THICK HE MENTIONED IN
THE COURSE OF THAT CHAOTIC

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.518 align:start position:0%
CONVERSATION.

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.720 size:84% position:42%
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M
AWARE OF THAT EVER WENT ANY

00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:23.622 align:start position:0%
FURTHER THAN THAT-- THAT BRIEF
MENTION.

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:27.626 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO THE QUESTION
WAS IF WE HAD TO GET THE

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:30.129 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT OUT OF OFFICE, HOW
WOULD I DO THAT?

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.131 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE WAYS YOU COULD
--

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.134 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REMOVE A PRESIDENT
FROM OFFICE.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.368 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.871
LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS CALLED THIS
A-- HE-- LET ME GET THIS RIGHT.

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:44.376 align:start position:0%
HE WANTS TO INVESTIGATE A
POTENTIAL COUP.

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:48.414 align:start position:0%
HOW COUP-YDID IT FEEL TO YOU IN
THE MOMENT?

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:51.283 align:start position:0%
IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL COUP IN A
WAY, BUT IT'S A GREW.

00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:53.485 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S A
CONTRADICTION IN AND OF ITSELF.

00:10:53.518 --> 00:10:54.820 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: A CONSTITUTIONAL
COUP?

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:56.121 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:59.658 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LIKE JUMBO SHRIMP,
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:00.258 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  ).</i>

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:02.528 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT VERY COUP-Y.

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.864 align:start position:0%
AGAIN, IT WAS A MENTION IN THE
MIDSTAVE WIDE-RANGING

00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:07.065 align:start position:0%
CONVERSATION.

00:11:07.098 --> 00:11:11.236 align:start position:0%
I'M NOT AWARE THAT ROD EVER TOOK
ANY EFFORTS TO PURSUE THAT.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:14.039 align:start position:0%
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY MEET
BUSINESS IT OR OTHER DISCUSSIONS

00:11:14.072 --> 00:11:15.140 align:start position:0%
ON IT.

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:19.044 align:start position:0%
IT WAS FOR ME REALLY AN
INDICATOR OF JUST HOW FRENZIED

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:21.947 align:start position:0%
AND FRAUGHT THE SITUATION WAS
THAT WE WERE IN.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.117 align:start position:0%
AND THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS
THAT WERE BOUNCED AROUND.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.854
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LET'S GET TO THE
MUELLER PROBE FOR JUST A MOMENT

00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:30.088 align:start position:0%
HERE.

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:35.561 align:start position:0%
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE LAST
TWO YEARS THAT MAKES YOU LESLESS

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:39.098 align:start position:0%
SUSPICIOUS OF THE PRESIDENT, OR
LESS INDICATIVE THAT HE HAD

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:42.101
IMPROPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE
RUSSIANS, POSSIBLE COLLUSION OR

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:42.401 align:start position:0%
CONSPIRACY?

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:43.335 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.537 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
DID I ANSWER TOO QUICKLY?

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:54.980 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO
<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>

00:11:55.013 --> 00:11:58.717
IT DOES SEEM ODD-- IT DOES SEEM
ODD IT MIGHT BE JUST SORT OF

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.154 size:88% position:44%
USEFUL FOR HIM TO SAY OR DO
ANYTHING THAT PUTIN WOULDN'T

00:12:02.187 --> 00:12:05.924
LIKE, JUST TO SORT OF TAKE OF
HEAT OFF OF HIM, MAKE HIM SEEP

00:12:05.957 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
LESS SUSPICIOUS, BUT HE WON'T DO
THAT.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.328 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE.

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:14.133
AND I THINK ON THE-- IN ADDITION
TO THAT, AS A RESULT OF THE WORK

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:17.636
THAT THE MUELLER TEAM HAS DONE
AND WHAT WE KNOW OF THAT WORK

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:21.473
FROM WHAT'S BEEN DISCLOSED TO
THE PUBLIC, I MEAN, YOU HAVE AN

00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:25.244 align:start position:0%
INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN
THE CAMPAIGN, CLOSE TO THE

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:29.581 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT, WHO HAD NUMEROUS
CONTACTS WITH RUSSIANS, PEOPLE

00:12:29.614 --> 00:12:32.184 align:start position:0%
CONNECTED TO RUSSIAN
INTELLIGENCE.

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:35.287
AND NOW WE HAVE MANY OF THOSE
SAME PEOPLE WHO ACTIVELY TRIED

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.822 size:84% position:42%
TO COVER UP THOSE CONTACTS.

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:41.460
I MEAN, IT'S-- IT ALL SEEMS TO
GET MORE SUSPICIOUS EVERY DAY.

00:12:41.493 --> 00:12:43.529 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A
BREAK.

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:44.730 align:start position:0%
DON'T GO AWAY.

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:46.732
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING
TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE MUELLER

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:47.767 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATION.
