00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.823
Can I fix your napkin? Is it...

00:00:01.823 --> 00:00:03.383
You touch me
and you're in a lot of trouble.

00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:04.346
Sorry.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.100
It's so nice, believe me,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.220
having two major stars [pfft] here.

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:21.892
&gt;&gt; How long ago did we do that thing?
&gt;&gt; Twenty-two years, “Casino.”

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.711
&gt;&gt; Is it that long?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.570
You have to admit that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.460
after we put you in “Casino”
your career just shot up.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.921
&gt;&gt; It did? I wound up here.
&gt;&gt;  [LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.568
What is this thing, anyway, Don?
What is this show?

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:35.192
&gt;&gt; What is this show?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:37.970
This show is to keep your name alive.
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.188
OK. Thank you.

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:42.848
You know, my biggest treat
was the first time they told me

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:45.565
that I had to go and see him first.
Him.

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:46.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:48.947
I walked in and I said,
"Hi, Mr. De Niro.”

00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:50.957
Like a schmuck.
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:54.797
&gt;&gt; "Hi, Mr. De Niro, how are you?"
&gt;&gt; And he went, “Hoo, hoo.”

00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:57.559
&gt;&gt; He said that?
&gt;&gt; That's what I think he said.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.547
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:00.809
I had a typist in the other room.
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.925
De Niro is sitting there.
God bless you, Bob.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.025
He's got the beard on.

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.839
To know him is a treat. He’s one
of the great actors of our time.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.089
You ask him.
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:10.386
You ask him. He'll tell you.
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:13.654
&gt;&gt; By the way, how's your lovely wife?
&gt;&gt; She's good. Thanks. She sends her love.

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:17.306
&gt;&gt; This is your second marriage, right?
&gt;&gt; Well, technically, my third.

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:18.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:20.295
&gt;&gt; He married twice...
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:21.464
&gt;&gt; ...the same person.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:22.902
Ah, you did?
I didn't know that.

00:01:22.902 --> 00:01:24.614
&gt;&gt; You're married again, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:26.800
&gt;&gt; You're happy?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.213
&gt;&gt; I've been married 20 years.
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:31.405
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, I'm married to Barbara,

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:34.831
which is a mistake.
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:37.511
No, that's a joke. She’ll hear it,
she’ll say, "That's not funny.”

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:40.516
[LAUGHTER]
Fifty-one years.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:43.169
&gt;&gt; Cheers!
&gt;&gt; This is great.

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:48.121
How did we meet? We met
in the Beverly Hills Hotel or something?

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:49.787
&gt;&gt; In a bar?
&gt;&gt; Well, the big guy here.

00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:52.674
&gt;&gt; I set it up.
&gt;&gt; And I didn't realize that Billy Sherbert …

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:57.535
That you put me in the thing
to give it a little atmosphere. I don’t know.

00:01:57.535 --> 00:01:59.594
&gt;&gt; That's what they said.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you were there.

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:01.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; See, you were there.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.065
That's why I thought it'd be great
if you were there...

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:07.796
He was the man. He was
the right-hand man of Lefty.

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:09.909
&gt;&gt; Even though I argued against it,
you know, I...

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.761
&gt;&gt; He fought and fought.
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:14.904
[LAUGHTER]
OK. Now you need me.

00:02:14.904 --> 00:02:16.679
That's right.
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:22.285
Really, what we grew up on was 
the first days of television,

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:24.964
so it was really...
Sid Caesar.

00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:27.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; And those skits with Imogene Coca

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.639
and of course Carl Reiner.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.413
Of course.

00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:31.867
I liked Abbott and Costello, I liked you,

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:33.820
you were great,
Jack E. Leonard.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.000
Sometimes I get a little bit
emotional about it to myself.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.510
'Cause I say, “All those good guys!"
You know?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.604
Obviously, you must have started
doing, like, stand-up…

00:02:42.604 --> 00:02:44.306
When you did stand-up at first,
you must have done…

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:47.410
I did jokes, I did, you know, 
impressions.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.085
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then I looked down

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:53.431
and see a guy with a suit,
and I’d say: "Sir, what's your name?”

00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.727
&gt;&gt; “Louie.”
&gt;&gt; “Louie, get another suit.”

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:58.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.649
“The suit, Louie. It don't make it".

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.320
Well, I was aware like...
Johnny Carson...

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.594
Yeah, you know. Somebody
like Sinatra would come on

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:10.251
and suddenly you'd be... taking
him and wiping the floor with him.

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:11.462
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.081
It was …
Did we hear that right?

00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:16.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:17.177 --> 00:03:20.407
&gt;&gt; They all recognize you, old-timer.
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:22.782
Frank either loved you
or forget about it.

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:26.490
&gt;&gt; But with you.
&gt;&gt; And, God, for some reason

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.348
I could say... You know,
like he’d be eating, I'd say:

00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:34.923
"Frank, pass the olives.” And he'd say, “You know, I'm eating."

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:35.939
I said: “What do you want
me to do?

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.356
Drop my pants and
fire a rocket? What do I care?”

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.498
[LAUGHTER]
He'd get away with it!

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:46.871
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.745
He enjoyed it!
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:52.020
&gt;&gt; Are you still going to Vegas?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.693
You are? Yeah?

00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:54.399
When was the first time
you were in Vegas, though?

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.049
In the early ’50, mid-‘50s.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Those were good days.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.314
Yeah, I know. All the wiseguys
were great.

00:04:00.314 --> 00:04:03.476
&gt;&gt; I know, I know.
&gt;&gt; They treated us like,

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.151
all of us as actors, with class,
you know?

00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:08.555
It was really great
to know those guys.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.131
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:13.354
&gt;&gt; What is this? Dead horse?
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.500
Don, can I have...?
Just taste a piece of your thing there?

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.040
&gt;&gt;This is what he does at dinner.
&gt;&gt; Just a bite. I just wanna take a bite.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But you know, one of the reasons...

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.760
One of the things we wanted
in “Casino” was 'cause you were...

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:28.612
You kind of had the whole...
the look, the atmosphere,

00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:32.354
all the sense of Vegas
and you also knew Lefty Rosenthal,

00:04:32.354 --> 00:04:34.807
whom Bob was playing
under a different name.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:35.883
What the hell is the name
again?

00:04:35.883 --> 00:04:39.722
&gt;&gt; Ace, Ace Rothstein.
&gt;&gt; He was a big shot, you know.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.002
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I would spend time

00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.176
with him here, in L.A...
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:45.802
&gt;&gt;...and he couldn't come to Vegas
because he was in the black book.

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:48.293
Yeah. Hours and hours
of talking with him, but...

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:51.239
You were there when he actually
ran the place, Stardust, right?

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:54.242
A lot of people ask me,
they say: "Who was tougher

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:57.262
to deal with, Bob or Don?"
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:57.262 --> 00:05:00.024
&gt;&gt; And obviously...
&gt;&gt; It was him.

00:05:00.024 --> 00:05:02.233
Obviously it was him.
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:04.700
'Cause one of the main things
is that he didn't have to speak.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.774
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So you could imagine.

00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:07.922
You had to keep quiet
through a lot of the scenes

00:05:07.922 --> 00:05:09.843
and it was just the looks we had,
remember?

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:14.996
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Just making a lot of faces.
&gt;&gt; That was funny that night you had the cigarette.

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:17.453
How can I let it go on so long?

00:05:17.453 --> 00:05:20.251
&gt;&gt; I was staring at you.
&gt;&gt; Did I say something wrong?

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:23.380
You were supposed to say:
"I should have known better.”

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.448
&gt;&gt; Remember that?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:26.448 --> 00:05:28.820
For the kind of money you're making,
you need the cards?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.814
Because what happened is that
we were waiting for your line.

00:05:30.814 --> 00:05:32.127
'Cause you were waiting for him.

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:33.949
Learn the thing.
You've got a pop-up trailer.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.580
Sit in there and study!
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.880
And finally you had to admit
and say "Don, we were waiting for you."

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.676
And then that was it.
&gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.479
&gt;&gt; Oh! That was three hours
of abuse that we caught… [LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.800
With your method acting,
with the breathing and the bullshit,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:49.444
Do the lines and let’s get out of here, for Christ's sake!

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.083
That stuff you did for me
at the Apollo...

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:57.218
[LAUGHTER]
...but it was funny.

00:05:57.431 --> 00:05:59.830
When Bob De Niro and I are
on the same stage together

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.688
these days it’s usually to give
each other lifetime achievement awards.

00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:04.690
[LAUGHTER]
So we see each other mainly

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.648
at award ceremonies and memorial
services...

00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:09.406
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:12.918
...like tonight.
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:15.153
Though, if I'd be directing this,
I don't think I would have gone

00:06:15.153 --> 00:06:18.896
for the open casket.
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:22.653
Rest in peace, old friend.
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:25.318
&gt;&gt; I said, "Jesus Christ!"
&gt;&gt; We had fun doing it.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:28.294
It was good. It was hard.
I mean, the top guys were there.

00:06:28.294 --> 00:06:30.448
Jerry Seinfield, Dave Letterman.
Everybody was there.

00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:32.899
It was really pretty wild that night.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.824
No, you're a great guy, Don.
You are.

00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:37.672
Not that we give a shit.

00:06:37.672 --> 00:06:39.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:42.233
We’ve always been talking
about comedians.

00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:45.210
We did, years ago, "King of Comedy,”
we did the comic...

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.445
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The whole idea of the stand-up,

00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:48.118
and what the stand-up
has to go through.

00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:50.224
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; In one, stand there. In one...

00:06:50.224 --> 00:06:52.354
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Really...

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:54.108
&gt;&gt; It's tough.
&gt;&gt; It’s grueling and tough.

00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:56.919
I remember when you did
the monologue of “King of Comedy.”

00:06:57.274 --> 00:06:59.317
He did the first take.
He did it all in one take.

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:02.572
Three pages. And the jokes
are good but they're not great.

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:04.646
&gt;&gt; And that was the idea.
&gt;&gt; We had to stop

00:07:04.646 --> 00:07:06.673
because I didn't know it
as well as I should have.

00:07:06.673 --> 00:07:07.902
And we did it later.

00:07:07.902 --> 00:07:09.913
Then again he told me, he said, "This is the hardest thing I ever did.”

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.438
You've got to have a certain personality.

00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:15.491
There are no jokes that you do,
it’s all,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.499
it's like a jazz riff or something.
It just goes and goes...

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.480
Marty, you are the most annoying
director I ever had in my entire career.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.540
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:07:24.547 --> 00:07:26.677
When we see all the films
you did,

00:07:26.677 --> 00:07:28.055
none of them were great.

00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:29.807
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:30.942
None of them.

00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:31.495
Gentlemen.

00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:32.586
&gt;&gt; Oh!
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.195
You want to take care of this?
Or you want me to put it on the tab?

00:07:35.605 --> 00:07:37.572
&gt;&gt; Put it on his tab.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm...

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:40.418
&gt;&gt; It's always on the tab.
&gt;&gt; You don't have to pay. It's a joke.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.917
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. I know, I know.
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:45.464
It says "thank you,”
so I guess that's OK. This is good.

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:47.128
 

00:07:47.344 --> 00:07:50.437
Hey! Hold on!
Quiet, quiet. Don's gonna speak!

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.564
I just want to say something, really.

00:07:52.564 --> 00:07:55.712
There are many people
I have talked about,

00:07:55.712 --> 00:08:01.209
people that I praise and so forth.
And sitting with Mr. Scorsese

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:04.832
and Mr. De Niro, really...
I am blessed and...

00:08:04.832 --> 00:08:08.474
So nice of you to sit here
and do this for me. I appreciate it.

00:08:08.474 --> 00:08:09.799
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; That's all you have to say?

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:13.609
&gt;&gt; That's it?
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.506 --> 00:08:17.690
&gt;&gt; That's all, that's all.
&gt;&gt; Oh, God!

00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:19.835
Well, I remember when I would see him,

00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:23.005
you know, on television.
I'd turn and change the channel.

00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:26.772
&gt;&gt; Yes. He was always...
&gt;&gt; But, you know, when I had to work with him

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:30.087
all these years later, I’d say, "OK, Don, you’re
great, I love you, blah, blah, blah." So...

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:31.971
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:33.532
Carson had Don on a lot.

00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:36.022
I would see Don on that show
and he would get away

00:08:36.022 --> 00:08:38.630
with outrageous things
that had a ring of truth,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.906
yet a lot of affection to it.

00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:43.037
I want him to be around
for a long time.

00:08:43.037 --> 00:08:43.780
Yeah.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.076
They always joke going "Mr. Warmth,"
but he is.

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:48.481
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:50.581
It's good what you’re doing here,
because it's like an oral history

00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:55.224
of time, of entertainment
and show business in our culture

00:08:55.224 --> 00:08:58.899
that, of course, is waning now.
It's really, really important

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:01.640
that you get this recording.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.265
Being part of “Casino”
was a great treat.

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:05.595
Wherever your wonderful
mother is,

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:08.676
who I loved and adored
as certainly you did in your family,

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:10.774
she's watching and smiling at you.

00:09:10.774 --> 00:09:14.573
God give you the great strength
and courage to continue your great work.

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:18.266
You are special.
Never forget that. You are special.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.836
God bless you, and I love you.

00:09:19.836 --> 00:09:23.967
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:53.406
What it do?
It's your boy, big Snoop Dogg.

00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:56.617
And I need y'all to go subscribe

What did he say?
[LAUGHTER]
