00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.227
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:07.629
"ANGLE" ."

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.465
WELL, THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.567
THE DEMOCRATS' NEWEST AT GIRL OF

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:14.035
INCOME REDISTRIBUTION,

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.336
KAMALA HARRIS, IS ALREADY

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:16.471
TAKING BIG HEAT FROM LIBERAL

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:16.804
BIGWIGS.

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:19.140
WE'LL PLAY IT IN A MOMENT.

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:25.480
WHY ON EARTH WITH A PICK ON

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.080
SOMEONE AS BRILLIANT AND

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:26.814
ACCOMPLISHED AT SENATOR HARRIS?

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:27.448
WELL, PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.516
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND BASIC

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:28.883
ECONOMICS.

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:29.717
&gt;&gt; YOU SUPPORT THE MEDICARE FOR

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:30.818
ALL BILL.

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:32.520
I THINK INITIALLY, I BELIEVE IT

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.956
WILL TOTALLY ELIMINATE PRIVATE

00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:36.024
INSURANCE.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.458
SO FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO LIKE

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:38.660
THEIR INSURANCE, THEY DON'T GET

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:40.428
TO KEEP IT?

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:41.429
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE IDEA IS THAT

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.431
EVERYBODY GETS ACCESS TO MEDICAL

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:44.632
CARE.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.401
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:47.101
PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH AN

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:48.469
INSURANCE COMPANY, HAVING THEM

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.239
GIVE YOU APPROVAL, GOING THROUGH

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.540
THE PAPERWORK, ALL OF THE DELAY,

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:55.176
THEY REQUIRE -- TWO OF THOSE HAS

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:56.277
NOT HAD THAT SITUATION, WE HAVE

00:00:56.278 --> 00:00:57.645
TO WAIT FOR THE APPROVAL AND THE

00:00:57.646 --> 00:00:58.446
DOCTOR SAYS, I DON'T KNOW IF

00:00:58.447 --> 00:00:59.814
YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY WILL

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:02.083
COVER THIS, LET'S ELIMINATE ALL

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:03.251
THAT.

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:04.919
&gt;&gt; Laura: WILL IT SOUND SO

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.253
SIMPLE.

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:05.687
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:07.822
WASN'T THAT MICHELLE OBAMA?

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:09.057
ANYWAY, THE COFFEE GUY IS NOW

00:01:09.058 --> 00:01:11.459
SAYING, NOT SO FAST.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.061
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT CORRECT.

00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:14.062
THAT'S NOT AMERICAN.

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:15.163
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:19.467
WHAT IMAGERY INDUSTRY WILL WE AO

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:19.500
WHAT IMAGERY INDUSTRY WILL WE AI

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:19.867
WHAT IMAGERY INDUSTRY WILL WE AH

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:20.268
NEXT?

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:21.936
THAT ALONE WOULD WIPE OUT

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:22.870
MILLIONS OF DROPS OF AMERICANS

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:24.038
ARE MEANT AS A KIND OF EXTREME

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.341
POLICY THAT IS NOT A POLICY THAT

00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:27.442
I AGREE WITH.

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:28.576
IF YOU TAKE IMMIGRATION, YOU

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:31.212
TAKE HEALTH CARE, WHAT WE HAVE

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:34.415
HIS EXTREMES ON BOTH SIDES, NOT

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:35.183
REPRESENTING THE LARGE MAJORITY

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.452
OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T HAVE A

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:38.419
VOICE.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.621
&gt;&gt; Laura: NOW HE'S A

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:41.656
BUSINESSMAN AND HE CERTAINLY IS

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:42.223
NOT CONSERVATIVE.

00:01:42.224 --> 00:01:44.092
BUT HE SEES THE WRITING OF THE

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:45.059
WALL HERE.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.560
HE KNOWS THAT THE

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.262
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS MOVING SO

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:48.463
FAR LEFT THAT IT'S LEAVING

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:51.366
AMERICA.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.301
DEMOCRATS LIKE KAMALA HARRIS ARE

00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:54.269
PROPOSING DISASTROUS SOCIALIST

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.471
SOLUTIONS TO THINGS LIKE HEALTH

00:01:56.472 --> 00:02:06.614
INEQUALITY OR WEALTH INEQUALITY.

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:07.348
THOSE ARE KINDS OF CONCEPTS THAT

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:08.016
WERE ONCE LEFT TO LATE-NIGHT

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:08.549
SEMINARS IN COLLEGE.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.284
FORGET THE $32 TRILLION COST FOR

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:09.984
THE 500,000 INSURANCE COMPANY

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:11.819
JOBS THAT WOULD BE LOST IN THE

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.592
SANDERS-HERON     WARREN-HARRISP

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:17.625
SANDERS-HERON     WARREN-HARRISA

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:18.660
SANDERS-HERON     WARREN-HARRIS.

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.994
FASTEST WAY TO SYNC MEDICARE IS

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:21.996
TO GIVE IT TO EVERYONE, NOT JUST

00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:22.463
THE ELDERLY.

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:25.033
IT WILL SYNC MUCH FASTER, NOT

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:25.500
EVEN FIVE YEARS.

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:26.634
EVEN IF YOU TAX THE RICH TO

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:28.636
DEATH, YOU CAN'T PAY FOR

00:02:28.637 --> 00:02:29.704
MEDICARE FOR ALL.

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:30.471
DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS WOULD BASE

00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:30.838
PAY CUTS.

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.707
THEY ARE ALREADY FACING THEM

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:33.007
TODAY.

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.043
THAT MEANS MORE HOSPITALS

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:36.277
CLOSING, MORE DOCTORS RETIRING

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:37.578
ARE NOT GOING INTO THE

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.814
PROFESSION AT ALL, LONGER WAITS

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:41.582
FOR MORE SERIOUS PROCEDURES.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:43.351
ULTIMATELY, THIS WILL LEAD, MY

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:45.019
FRIENDS, TO RATION CARE,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.256
ACCORDING TO AGE, WEIGHT, AND,

00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:50.024
YES, OTHER PRE-EXISTING HEALTH

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:50.391
PROBLEMS.

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:50.892
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:52.827
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WAIT IN LINE

00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:53.761
FOR THE PROCEDURE, AT LEAST

00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:54.662
YOU'LL BE COMFORTED TO KNOW THAT

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:57.799
THE GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.534
KAMALA'S GREEN ENERGY FANTASY.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:01.202
&gt;&gt; I SUPPORT A GREEN NEW DEAL.

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:04.305
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:06.207
CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN EXISTENTIAL

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:08.209
THREAT TO US AND WE HAVE TO DEAL

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.610
WITH THE REALITY OF IT.

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.012
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY

00:03:11.013 --> 00:03:12.447
OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:13.715
PEOPLE TRYING TO PEDDLE SOME

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:16.017
IDEA THAT WE SHOULD DENY IT AND

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:16.651
THEY ARE PEDDLING SCIENCE

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:18.586
FICTION INSTEAD OF WHAT WE

00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:19.287
SHOULD DO, WHICH IS RELY ON

00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:21.656
SCIENCE FACT.

00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:22.724
&gt;&gt; Laura: SO WHAT DOES THE

00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:24.826
GREEN NEW DEAL MEAN FOR YOU AND

00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:25.660
YOUR FAMILY?

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:27.328
WELL, IT MEANS THE GOVERNMENT

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.630
WOULD REACH IN AND CONTROL,

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:30.631
MONITOR, AND TAX EVEN MORE

00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:31.666
ASPECTS OF YOUR DAILY LIFE THAN

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:32.467
IT DOES NOW.

00:03:32.468 --> 00:03:34.635
YOU LOVE YOUR CAR IS MUCH AS I

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:35.069
DO?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.104
MINUS 19 YEARS OLD, I STILL LOVE

00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:36.938
IT, TOO BAD.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.074
THE GREEN PARTY'S GREEN NEW DEAL

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:41.542
CALLS FOR REPLACING NONESSENTIAL

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:43.077
INDIVIDUAL MEANS OF TRANSPORT

00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:46.013
WITH HIGH QUALITY AND MODERN

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:46.948
MASS TRANSIT.

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.484
A GEEKY WAY OF INSTITUTING A BAN

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:50.017
ON CARS.

00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:51.652
BUT WHO DECIDES WHETHER YOUR CAR

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:52.620
IS A NONESSENTIAL INDIVIDUAL

00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:55.857
MEANS OF TRANSPORT?

00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:56.991
MAY BE KAMALA AND CREW WILL

00:03:56.992 --> 00:03:59.827
BRING BACK OBAMA'S GREEN JOBS.

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:00.628
WHY NOT?

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.764
TO ACHIEVE THE GREEN TRANSPORT

00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:04.665
UTOPIA, "IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.902
ELECTRIFY EVERYTHING ELSE,

00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:08.803
INCLUDING TRANSPORT."

00:04:08.804 --> 00:04:11.038
IF YOU LOVE YOUR SUV, YOUR

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.808
SUDAN, HECK, YOUR HATCHBACK, TOO

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:14.075
BAD.

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:15.042
ONLY ELECTRIC.

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:15.843
AND IF YOU ARE DEEMED WORTHY OF

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:19.046
OWNING A CAR AT ALL, WELL,

00:04:19.047 --> 00:04:20.848
REMEMBER, IN KAMALA'S GAS-FREE

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.483
WORLD, THE GOVERNMENT GAS BAGS

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:25.019
HAVE ALL THE POWER.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.854
AND EVEN BIG GULP BANNING, BIKE

00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:31.926
LANE MANDATING MIKE BLOOMBERG IS

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:33.194
BULKING AT HARRIS' GREEN FOLLY.

00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:34.862
&gt;&gt; I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO

00:04:34.863 --> 00:04:35.863
THINGS THAT ARE PIE-IN-THE-SKY,

00:04:35.864 --> 00:04:37.398
THAT WE WILL NEVER PASS, NEVER

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.499
AFFORD.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.902
I THINK IT IS JUST DISINGENUOUS

00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:42.437
TO PROMOTE THOSE THINGS.

00:04:42.438 --> 00:04:43.871
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING THAT

00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:44.639
IS PRACTICAL.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.474
&gt;&gt; Laura: NOW, THAT MEANS

00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:47.608
BANNING ALL COAL, BANNING ALL

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:49.911
CARS, BANNING ALL NUCLEAR POWER,

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.712
TAXING MILES DRIVEN, TAXING

00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:55.016
KILOWATTS USED, TAXING WATER US

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:55.283
USE.

00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:57.685
IT WOULD BE ALL ON THE TABLE TO

00:04:57.686 --> 00:04:59.220
FORCE AMERICANS TO BEND TO THE

00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:01.189
FADDISH TRENDS OF THE SOCIALIST

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
LEFT.

00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:04.826
NOW MORE POWER FOR THEM, LESS

00:05:04.827 --> 00:05:05.560
POWER, FREEDOM, AND PROSPERITY

00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:07.028
FOR YOU.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.397
IT'S ALWAYS HOW IT WORKS IN A

00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:12.300
FULLY CENTRALIZED ECONOMY.

00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:15.036
AND THIS IS WHAT IS LIGHTING THE

00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:17.238
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ON FIRE TODAY?

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.206
REALLY?

00:05:18.207 --> 00:05:20.007
INSTEAD OF KIBITZING WITH THE

00:05:20.008 --> 00:05:22.009
NRDC, KAMALA SHOULD HAVE

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.211
CONSULTED FIRST WITH, I DON'T

00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:25.480
KNOW, KERMIT.

♪ ♪

00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:32.086

&gt;&gt; Laura: IT'S NOT BECAUSE AS

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:35.223
THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION

00:05:35.224 --> 00:05:36.824
FOUND RECENTLY, SUPPORT FOR

MEDICARE FOR ALL DROPPED LIKE A

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.260
ROCK WHEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT

00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:40.261
IS GOING TO COST.

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:42.163
SAME DEAL WITH THE GREEN AGENDA,

00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:43.264
WOULD PEOPLE FIGURE HOW MUCH IT

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:43.831
COSTS.

00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:46.834
GUESS THIS, 50% OF SURVEY

00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:48.069
RESPONDENTS INITIALLY SAID THEY

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.303
FAVORED MEDICARE FOR ALL, THE

00:05:49.304 --> 00:05:49.871
WHOLE PLAN.

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:51.272
BUT WHEN THEY'RE FACED WITH THE

00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:52.874
PROSPECTS OF PAYING HIGHER TAXES

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:54.509
TO FUND THEIR SYSTEM, AND, BY

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.477
THE WAY, THE ELIMINATION OF

00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:58.112
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE

00:05:58.113 --> 00:06:00.681
COMPANIES, SUPPORT FALLS TO ONLY

00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:00.948
37%.

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.084
AND WHEN PULLED THE NEW PLAN

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:04.819
COULD THREATEN THE CURRENT

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.520
MEDICARE PROGRAM, ONLY 32%

00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:08.422
REMAINED IN FAVOR.

00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:10.391
MY FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY IS    IT

00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:10.424
MY FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY IS    II

00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:11.025
MY FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY IS    IS

00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:11.425
MY FRIENDS, THIS IS WHY IS    IO

00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:12.426
CRITICAL FOR THE TRUMP

00:06:12.427 --> 00:06:14.195
ADMINISTRATION, THE ENTIRE

00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:14.862
CABINET, AND THE REPUBLICAN

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:15.930
PARTY TO HAVE A FULL-COURT PRESS

00:06:15.931 --> 00:06:19.233
OF THE FACTS THERE TO EDUCATE

00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:21.502
VULNERABLE VOTERS ON THE GREEN

00:06:21.503 --> 00:06:22.270
ECONOMY ISSUES, ON MEDICARE FOR

00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:25.406
ALL, ALL OF IT.

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:27.508
HISTORY SHOWS US THAT SOCIALIST

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:33.180
IDEAS ARE ALWAYS EASY TO SELL TO

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:33.915
UNINFORMED, INDOCTRINATED, AND

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.016
SOMETIMES DESPERATE VOTERS.

00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:35.950
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY

00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:36.250
FUND.

00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:39.220
IT NEVER WORKS.

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:40.922
IT'S A FALSE PROMISE OF FREE

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:42.423
STUFF FOREVER.

00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:43.457
BUT AS ALWAYS, YOU EVENTUALLY

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:46.794
RUN OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.

00:06:46.795 --> 00:06:47.461
KAMALA HARRIS, I DON'T KNOW,

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:49.030
WOULD DO BETTER PURSUING MAYBE A

00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.033
CAREER AS A DJ.

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:53.668
&gt;&gt; A SONG THAT HAS TO BE PLAYED

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.539
LOUD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HEAR

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.776
THE BASS, "THE SUN IS SHINING"

00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:02.944

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:07.515
&gt;&gt; Laura: OR MAY BE A BACKUP

00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:07.848
SINGER.

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.717
&gt;&gt; ONE NATION UNDER A GROOVE,

00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:10.451
GETTING DOWN JUST FOR THE LOVE

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:12.720
OF IT.

00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:15.289
CAN I GET IT?

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.457
&gt;&gt; Laura: OR, I DON'T KNOW, A

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:18.359
VOICE-OVER ARTIST.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.029
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.134
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:28.636
[LAUGHS]

00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:29.136
&gt;&gt; Laura: [LAUGHS]

00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:30.705
IF YOU BUY WHAT SHE IS SELLING,

00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:34.676
SHE MAY HAVE THE LAST LAUGH, BUT
