00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.779
My honor to introduce derek halpern to the stage

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.710
And we first came across derek halpern during a meeting with milker where he was teaching us the fine arts of reducing discounts

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.780
He pops up a video and pulled up YouTube and there was Derek telling us about

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.469
how to reduce discounts and it was great fantastic we said who is this guy

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.319
So when we were looking at speakers and things that we could do that were innovative and innovative types of people

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.499
Derek was the first on the list so

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.520
Derek is all about helping sales people make more sales

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.840
Forbes has named him as an expert on consumer psychology and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.829
Inc has named him one to follow in 2015

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.090
So if you've ever done a youtube search on sales advice he would show up and many of you have probably already seen him

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.879
He's reached over five million

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.870
viewers and

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.109
I've got like 200 Facebook friends so in comparison. That's a big difference so

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.569
It's my privilege to introduce Derek Halpern to the stage there

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780
What's up

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.179
It's kind of a tough spot to be standing between you and dinner

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.720
learning about an exotic trip and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.760
A Great Gatsby party because I don't know about you. I'd rather save her champagne bottles than listen to another person speak after four days

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.160
And

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.509
What I think makes this even tougher is I suspect some of you aren't that friendly?

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.290
Yesterday I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.760
Got to LA walked in the hotel saw April

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.050
April said oh you're here. Just in time. We're having lunch. Why don't you go out get some food and meet some of the reps?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.440
Sure

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.300
so I walk outside I walk up to the first table that I see I see four empty chairs and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.909
I asked this this nice man to my right. It's the DJ. I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.389
Asked him hey is anyone sitting here. Do you mind if I sit here? He kind of looks up slowly?

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.090
huh

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.419
All right, maybe it's gnar like that it was more like

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.149
Huh, I guess he didn't want me to sit next to him so I walked away

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.839
It turned out he didn't know I was speaking today, and I really don't blame him I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.369
was wearing a black t-shirt and black sweatpants and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.249
I didn't have a badge around my neck for all he knew I was trying to scam a free lunch

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.339
so I understand why he did that and

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.489
as salespeople

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.048
We kind of all understand this type of reaction I mean

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.260
Have you ever walked into a dental office?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.329
Introduce yourself and the office managers snarled at you say yes

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.980
Yes

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.239
That's probably where he learned how to do that snarl actually

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.580
So I understand why he did that?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300
But as salespeople

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.540
We need to push through that first reaction

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.290
We need to turn someone who is being a little bit difficult

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.879
Into someone who will eventually give us some money for something

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.100
We need to turn a difficult prospect into a raving

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.610
Customer and that's what we're gonna talk about today

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.699
The side liners how to turn difficult prospects into raving customers

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.370
So let's get started

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600
Imagine that this is a book about

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.769
dental implants now imagine on your next sales call

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.410
You walk into the dentist's office

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.350
prepared for a one on one

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.630
But you get stifled by the gatekeeper so you leave the booklet behind has this happened yes, yes

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.720
but now

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.029
Let's imagine that a few hours later

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.730
You get a phone call it's the surgeon on the line and she

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.530
wants the place of

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.530
$50,000 order

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.570
The first question is is what's in that booklet? How did this turn this difficult prospect?

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.570
into a raving customer and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.950
How did it happen without ever talking to that person?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.340
Without doing anything other than just leaving the booklet

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.589
This sounds like a weird scenario has this ever happened to you. No, right

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.120
almost never

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.500
But this is exactly how I learned how to sell and it's how I sell the stuff that I sell today

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.679
Just to walk you through it quickly

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.040
Here's a little bit of insight into my business

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.260
People will go to my website, and I will ask them to sign up to a newsletter

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.529
And I'll try to give them something like a free ebook in

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.140
exchange for signing up to my newsletter

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.179
I'll then send them valuable content like a blog post or video

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.269
There similar to the video that they used to find me in the first place

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.679
And I'll maybe send them some more videos, and then eventually

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.970
After a few weeks, I'll ask them to buy something

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:55.090
Now how do I ask them to buy something? I'm not calling them up. I'm sending them to a page that

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.449
It's about 30 pages long

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.020
So I'll get you on my mailing list

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.380
I'll send you free videos and content, then eventually I'm going to ask you to read a 30-page long page

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.979
That's how all my sales get generated a lot of people think

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.689
Well who reads that much and I always tell them

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.689
Only the buyers the people who want to buy this the people who you're talking to but

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.460
still

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.400
While it works really well you have to be very strategic about it and don't get me wrong

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.989
It works really well every single day of the week this happens people opt into a newsletter

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.810
They get free content over the course of a few weeks

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.479
And I ask them to buy something and this is like an example

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:49.629
This is from a week ago when I was putting this slide together. Just a random day of sales of twelve thousand dollars came in

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.190
Automatically just by sending these people to these long pages

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.870
Using this like magic booklet to convert a difficult prospect into a customer

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.989
Now you're probably wondering well first. You don't sell things on the Internet, so what does this have to do with you?

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.169
Well the same process I use

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.049
to sell stuff online

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.539
can also be used to make each and every one of you a better salesperson and

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.829
Maybe you'll even create that dental booklet one day that closes the sale for you, so you don't have to

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.709
Now I want to share more about that in a second first. I want to introduce myself a little bit. I'm Derek Halpern

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:38.829
I'm the founder of social triggers, and I started this company about three years ago when I grew it to a multi-million dollar company

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.419
I'm not sharing this to brag

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:46.029
I'm just showing you that I know how to sell and that's what I've been doing for the last by eight years of my life

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:52.040
And how do I do this I leverage the proven sales principles? I'm going to share today

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.650
Plus I also create a bunch of YouTube videos. This is how I get people's attention

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:04.339
It's how I got April's attention, and I think it was melting who found my first video and shared it around with everyone

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.830
There's a video about why I think discounting is for idiots

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.939
And this is the video that they shared then that's why I'm here speaking today

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.510
Just to give you some numbers

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.990
about

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:23.299
175,000 people subscribe to my newsletter and even though, and I've reached over 5 million people and my original bio is 2.5 million

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.359
But I checked this morning. It was more than 5 million and

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.099
Here's what I've discovered. I can tell you one thing for certain. I've got

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.960
63 thousand fans on Facebook which is 10,000 more than Nobel biocare?

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.080
No one I can tell you this is does not correlate to how much money you make

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.410
Cuz if I was making no Abell money

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.059
I would have a gold chain with the golden statue out of myself hanging from my neck right now

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.059
But the bottom line is I'm sales guy, and I live and die by my ability to persuade people to give me money now

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.410
When you sell you probably hear things like

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:10.460
why should I buy this from you when I could find the same thing for cheaper have you heard this before say yes or

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.920
Maybe I don't need this right now

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.090
I already use something similar, and it works yes, yes

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.489
How do I know I can trust you and your company if you heard this before?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.050
yes, I

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.250
Heard something bad about your products, and I'll never use them

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.990
Whether or not. It's true

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.260
There's always someone that's gonna try and rain on your product parade right

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.960
What are some other examples does anyone else have any other examples of things they've heard or?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.900
Reasons why people don't buy shoot your hand up

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.700
That guy in the back

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.309
Right there in the yellow. I think or on my blinds

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.250
No I

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.310
Mean we've all got it the list goes on whether its price we're too expensive

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.019
Yeah, or just like what you said. There's you know that we wouldn't get the same thing for cheaper

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.829
Uh-huh or it's you know I'm upset about a past experience of course there's another one that

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.799
Way I don't like you I hear that all the time we're gonna get some closer a minute I

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.070
Don't want to switch right now retiring soon anyway

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:37.709
So sorry I didn't hear you. I'm retiring soon anyway. I'm retiring soon anyway

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:44.279
It's like it's an excuse to not learn how to do your job better almost very interesting

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.420
now

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.370
While some we can make fun of these comments. We can laugh about them and

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:53.399
We know they're not true

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.949
Just because they say them doesn't mean it's true and just because they believe them doesn't mean it's true

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:03.299
And it's our job to try and convince these people otherwise

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.869
But in what I do, I almost never hear that

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:15.869
All I get is something like 700 people visit my website and seven people bought six hundred and ninety three people didn't

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:20.039
They have an objection. I don't hear it if they have any questions

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:28.379
They'll just answer it themselves and X out my website, and they'll never come back. I don't get to have that interaction

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:33.479
So now how can my experience with selling which is

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.810
almost seemingly totally different from yours

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:39.809
How can this help you be a better salesperson?

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.500
Well, this is the system that I use

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.380
but before I build this I

00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:50.669
take the time to research my customer and

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:55.349
My goal is to know him better than he knows himself

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:03.599
my goal is if I ever sat down with one of my prospects and they're considering to purchase one of my products I

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.750
Literally want to be able to talk to that person and know all their answers that they're gonna say

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.660
before they even start to say it and

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.610
In what I do, it's essential that I do this because I don't get to have that conversation

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.520
I can't answer anything on the fly I

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.749
have to know what they're wondering before it happens I

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.440
Have to know their hopes their dreams their fears, and what their objections are

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:37.589
If I don't do this, I'm never gonna make any sales and today. I want to show you

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.250
What I discovered about why people buy and?

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:48.149
What I discovered about why people don't buy and as you'll soon see it applies to everyone?

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.900
Now there are three types of people who you will encounter when you're selling and

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.070
To really bring this to life, I want to show you some examples

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.659
Here's one type of person you will encounter so reply to an email

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.539
someone saw me speak at a conference and they were like oh you're just as bitey in real life if I ask this person to

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.310
Buy something I'm going to get them to buy it this can be very easy that person is a buyer

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.349
The second type of person you'll encounter are people like this

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.600
I spoke at this event called social media marketing world that person loved my presentation

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.559
This person was also in the audience and she decided to give me some feedback

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:35.399
After hearing him speak. I thought he was arrogant and an elitist basically, and I'm sad to see his true colors

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.610
She hates me if I ever ask this person to buy anything. There's no way I can convince them to give me money ever

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:50.130
so there's two people the buyers the non buyers, and there's a third type of person a person that I call a

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.300
Side liner as you can see here's what they said I hate to admit it

00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:00.930
But I was a little skeptical of you when I first started following your blog. I almost removed myself from your list

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.730
It's a side liner

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:11.670
But I gave you a shot and now I realize that I actually like you. I turned a side liner into a buyer

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.920
now

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.190
This is an interesting idea because the side liners are the difficult prospects

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.869
But if you know how to talk to them the right way

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.750
You can turn them into one of your best customers

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.059
They're the difficult prospects that you could turn into your best customers

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.789
There are some people you will never win with and you all know better to just stop talking to that person maybe

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.770
You'll contact him every few months

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.509
Just in case they had to change a heart or maybe you're hoping that they had a bad experience with another company

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.560
But you know deep down that person is never gonna deal with you, and you try not to waste your time

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.160
That's the instant non buyer

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.989
Then there's the people who already know you already like you all their friends

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.010
Already like you and you know that person is gonna be very easy to persuade to buy

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.449
But you're gonna find that most people you encounter are gonna. Be these side liners

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.310
the people who

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.310
Need a little push

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.350
Before they're ready to give you money

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.889
Now as I said?

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:23.960
There's the three type of people the instant non buyers, and I always view all sales on a chart that I call the yes line

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.250
The closer you are to the yes line the more likely you are to buy

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.820
The further you are from the yes line the less like you are to buy

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:39.110
The instant bought nine buyers are obviously way below the yes line the instant buyers are very close to it the side liners are right

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:47.090
In the middle these are the people you can convert if you put your mind to it so meet mister doctor nice hair

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:55.580
He currently places a hundred implants each year, and he stops his inventory with a low-priced competitor

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:03.289
Now obviously, it's gonna take some work for you to convince him to spend more money on your implants

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:10.700
But you know that this type of competitive conversion could happen if you talk to him to the right way you start

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.400
Explaining the difference we like I think it's chair time

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.129
And how that could lead to more chair time on lower quality stuff or whatnot you know you can get if you persist

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.390
Here's another example doctor a little bit of hair

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.440
He places 75 implants each year

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:33.710
But after talking to him you realize his smallest one is a 3.4. And you have a 3.0

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.699
So you might offer him that point-o as a way to get your foot in the door?

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:46.039
But here's someone else that you know that you could potentially turn him from the sidelines to a buyer with some work which

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.209
wits with some follow up with some more information and

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:52.649
the third type of person

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:58.219
Will be dr. Lots of hair she places no implants each year, but she wants to start

00:16:59.549 --> 00:17:04.879
Again, she might not know the difference between a low-cost provider and a high-cost provider

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.679
But these are the people that you might be encountering when you start selling

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.500
Now the goal is is to make sure that

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.359
When you're prospecting and when you're trying to make these sales

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:25.038
The goal is to make sure you're spending all of your time on

00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:27.649
people who are

00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:28.980
legitimately

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:36.260
Side liners not Pete you don't want to chase down someone who's never gonna buy I always hear that expression you really

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:42.020
He's so good at selling. He can sell ice to an Eskimo you heard that before yes

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:45.589
Why would you want to do that? I want to sell him heat?

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:52.339
He's a lot easier to sell that guy heat than ice or like I want to sell someone who's drowning some oxygen

00:17:52.649 --> 00:17:54.979
That's the guy I want to sell to it's just a lot easier

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.549
So you want to make sure in your prospecting you're focusing on selling people what they already want

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.610
Now they may not realize they want it yet, but you definitely don't want to trick them into wanting something

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.399
They don't want because then they're gonna be unhappy with you

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:15.409
They're gonna talk bad about you, and I guess when I did some pre-work before this conference

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:17.778
I spoke to some territory reps and managers I

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.069
Guess all surgeons talk, so you don't want them talking badly about you

00:18:22.889 --> 00:18:25.639
Before you even get your foot in the door

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.939
Now this is why you do want to focus on these side liners the people who will buy

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:38.689
Because the instant buyers will buy the instant non buyers will never buy the side liners are the people who could buy should buy

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.820
But haven't bought yet

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.329
Now let's go a little bit deeper

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:48.509
What stop these side liners from buying from you?

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.689
Now we kind of went through some of the objections that people have to your products price

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.850
Cheaper competitive they're already using someone else and it's working just fine. Why should I fix what's not broken?

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:05.939
we already went through these ideas of what stops people from buying from you, but I

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.090
wasn't happy

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.970
With those as the only reasons

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:19.290
And the reason why I wasn't happy is because we all know that when someone says something like it's price

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.410
There might be something else going on

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:25.049
Maybe they're scared of change

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.280
Have you seen this before people were scared of change like the people who?

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.910
Don't you know I'm retiring in a few years. Why should I learn something new?

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:37.769
We know there's some deep-seated psychological fears here

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.479
and it's not as simple as what they're telling us that face value and

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:45.059
as sales reps

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.669
It's up to you to figure out what that is?

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.059
Do you all do this yes? Yes?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.259
now after analyzing 17 industries I

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.419
discovered that there are four Universal reasons why people don't buy and

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.329
I call these reasons the side liners the first one is the indifference

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:15.240
The second is the skeptic the third is the warrior and the fourth is the procrastinator these are the universal reasons?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.020
Why people are trying to not give you money? If you think they should?

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.650
Let's go into a little bit more detail on

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:31.080
How these people come to these decisions and then provide you with the tools you need to overcome them

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.979
What's artheon different have you ever been on a sales call thinking it would be a perfect fit you

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.369
Know they can benefit from what you're offering them

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:48.389
But they're just not seeing it the way you're seeing it has this happened say yes, yes

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.480
the indifferent side liners

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:58.260
Aren't buying because they're thinking do I really need this

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.989
Or do I even have a problem right now?

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.030
Why fix what isn't broken or does this really matter to me?

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.160
They might even say something like nobody's ever asked me for an implant before why should I start offering them?

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.249
The indifferent doesn't have to remain indifferent

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:29.229
So here's what you have to do if you want to find someone who is indifferent about your products

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.930
You want to find something they do care about and then show them how?

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.329
What you sell can help them with what they already care about?

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.920
It sounds simple, but let me

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.510
Give you an example in this hundred-year-old book by Robert Collier

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:55.989
He's a direct mail advertiser if you're ever wanting to learn how to sell studying those dudes from a hundred years ago that?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:03.669
Got their chops selling by sending people spam mail is a good place to start so if they can convince people to buy you know

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.670
Anyone can convince anyone to buy anything?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.790
he talked about this book called the book of etiquette and

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.630
When this book was first released in the early 1900's it?

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:20.380
Never sold, no one bought it. No one was going to the store and buying the book of etiquette

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.469
Then one day this guy Nelson doubleday bought the rights to the book of etiquette

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.860
And he was able to sell a million copies of it

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:39.099
How did he do that how did he take a book that never sold ever it was a dud it was so bad that

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.760
The publisher wanted to sell the rights to Nelson immediately

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.920
And then as soon as Nelson got his hands on this book she sold a million copies of it

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.090
What do you think he did does anyone have any ideas?

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.829
Change the cover copy you said or cover

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.450
Change the cover

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.450
That could be one thing as well

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.150
Change the name

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:10.660
These are all things if you change the cover change the name that it could help impact sales because

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:16.569
People buy things based on first impression, just like I got judged at the lunch table because of my sweatpants

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.209
People judge books based on book covers. It makes sense, but let me tell you what he did

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.809
Instead of telling people here's how to learn the book of etiquette. He told a story in

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:34.959
Direct Mail advertisements that said things like why I cried after the ceremony or

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.189
Why they all laughed at me or why she blushed with shame?

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:43.569
The same book how to be proper

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.850
He sold by appeal by appealing to people's

00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:51.230
deep-seated need

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.380
To be liked by their peer groups

00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.819
The same book went from not selling to selling a million copies and all he did was

00:24:01.639 --> 00:24:05.649
Appeal to people's desire to avoid embarrassment

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:13.689
It's kind of interesting how you can turn some a product, that's not selling it all

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.510
into one of the best-selling books of that

00:24:17.929 --> 00:24:22.629
Time just by changing how you present this book to people?

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.700
And the bottom line is

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.700
No one wakes up and thinks

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:37.109
Look. I never woke up in the morning and was like hey. I need to get some etiquette in my life

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.409
Like I can't remember the last time I ever thought of that ever

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:48.840
But people do worry about being made fun of when you appeal to that innate desire

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.469
You can get people to buy and

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:59.549
That's what Doubleday did he made the indifferent who previously didn't care about a book

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:05.069
He made that indifferent person care by changing how he spoke about the book

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:13.769
Let's take it back to dr. Nice hair he uses low-cost implants. He cares about money obviously

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:18.269
Talking science and innovation with him is

00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:20.909
Hopeless you can give him

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:29.130
3500 research studies showing how great your product is this guy does not care his haircuts are expensive?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.569
You got to talk money with him to win him over

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:43.169
Now a lot of people and it's not just newer reps that do this I even make this mistake, too

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.350
Sometimes we think just because we care about it. They should care about it too and

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.849
If you've ever been in an argument with your significant other I know

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.850
You've been through this exact same situation

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.669
Just because you care in the room doesn't mean the person you're talking to cares

00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:07.499
And you want to make sure you're talking to what they care about he likes money talk money

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:14.459
Doctor a little bit of hair has never placed a 3.0. You have a 3.0. He likes money

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:21.120
Well 3.0 is a new income stream. He likes quality of care 3.0. Solves a problem. He currently can't solve

00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:26.069
there's different ways to present the products you have to people and

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.229
Make sure you're appealing not to here's how great our product is

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:38.010
Here's how great the titanium alloy is for our implants, but instead you're appealing to what he cares about I?

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.169
Interviewed about six territory reps before I came here and about a week ago

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:51.119
And I was talking to a Scott Lynch, and I'll have this up later in the presentation, but I was talking to Scott Lynch

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.099
And I asked him how did she convince people who would be?

00:26:56.679 --> 00:26:58.798
Indifferent or people who don't want to buy ass

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:04.918
and how he would convince them to buy or how would he convinced him to switch from a low-cost implant to a high-cost implant and

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:08.249
he gave a very interesting quote to me and

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.100
he said I

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.510
Want to find out what he cares about if he has a daughter as an example

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.829
I would say you wouldn't send your daughter to college and a beater car

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.230
Would you what if she got broken down on the side of the road?

00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:24.929
you wouldn't be able to sleep at night and

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:32.549
He said he likes to use these unrelated metaphors as a way to get these people

00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:35.279
Thinking about treating their patients better

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.789
This is something that you should be doing as well

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.130
Now let's go with dr. Lots of hair the same applies

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:50.189
Never talk about what you sell don't talk about all the research and innovation or anything like that

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.319
Unless they ask for it if they ask you

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.960
Well, how do I know that?

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:03.870
This is a proven implant. That's when you can pull out the riche research and provide it to them

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.970
But you don't want to lead with it

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.120
And if I were you I would never even take it out of your bag

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.669
Unless they specifically asked for it because have you ever tried to read a research paper before

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.669
This is what I do for a living. It's boring

00:28:18.429 --> 00:28:20.429
It's like the worst thing in the world

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Let's keep going

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.370
When you find what people care about?

00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:34.019
You have to use this knowledge as a way to get people to want to buy and I want to share this experiment with you

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.179
Three researchers ran an experiment. They asked mock hotel owners

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:42.569
to create an advertisement for their hotel

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.240
and

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.679
They let these mock hotel owners know that they have a five-star pool and a three-star restaurant, and they asked them

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.340
What would you like to feature in this ad Heisman?

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.230
Does anyone have any ideas?

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.299
What would you put in this ad raise your hand if you want to try and take a guess?

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.259
Would you put the hope would you put the pool the restaurant would you put both of them?

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:15.269
Say again models in the pool

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:25.289
Good that's perfect, but you'd feature the pool and the food you feature both turns out in this research. They asked hundreds of people

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:30.269
72% of people chose the feature both the hotel and the pool in the ad

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.690
But here's where things got very interesting

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.709
They asked mock customers how much they would pay for a night stay at this hotel

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.500
When they saw an ad just for a five star pool they offered twenty six percent more money

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.380
Wait a second they see an ad for a hotel

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:56.490
One ad has a five star pool in a three star restaurant the other ad has just a five star pool

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.509
They're willing to pay more to just stay at a place that has a five star pool

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:10.529
That doesn't make any sense I mean a five star pool two three-star restaurants better

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.290
I mean you don't want to go to someplace as a pool with no food

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.159
But it turns out people are willing to pay

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:23.009
More for a hotel that only features a five star pool in a three-star restaurant

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.279
Why is that why does that happen?

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:33.329
Well when people see a five star pool in an advertisement, they make assumptions about the rest of the hotel

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:40.200
One of the assumptions, they assume is if it's a five star pool. It's probably got good food, too

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:47.429
But when you feature both of the five star pool and the three-star restaurant they start to average out

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.410
How good the hotel is and say well?

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:54.120
Maybe it's not as good as I thought because the food's not that good and they're willing to pay less

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.690
Now how does this apply to what you guys are selling?

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.780
most salespeople

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.840
when they walk into the room they try to

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:11.279
Show off all the great features and benefits of their product, and how this product is going to change people's lives

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.779
They want to talk about everything they want to say I want to give them everything

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.199
They can so there's no reason why they could say no

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:24.238
but it turns out if you offer too many things and

00:31:25.539 --> 00:31:29.908
Especially if you've offered too many things that the person you're talking to doesn't already care about

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:38.009
They're going to discount the importance of the thing you're offering them that they do care about

00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:44.909
So once you find that thing that people care about what do you find what makes the indifferent care?

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.219
Don't overwhelm him with features and benefits and all these different things

00:31:50.499 --> 00:31:56.939
You want to find the one thing he cares about and then you want to focus on that completely nothing else

00:31:58.809 --> 00:32:01.949
Until he asks for more information you

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:05.939
want to drill down in that hot button and

00:32:06.729 --> 00:32:09.659
Make him care about what you believe you can deliver to him

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.189
The second side liner is known as the skeptic now

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.799
This I believe is probably one of the more common side liners it being different

00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:28.349
If I was in your shoes I would imagine the general practitioners that don't place any implants

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:32.189
Those are the indifferent people right now, and they're the small accounts

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.149
They're the people that you don't want to necessarily

00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:39.628
Go after too much because it might piss off a surgeon or something like that, but you want to go after them

00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:43.468
But they might be more indifferent if you're talking to the surgeons are the periodontists

00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:46.949
They might be a little bit more skeptical and what is it skeptic?

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:54.118
How are they different from being different the skeptic doesn't ask so what or why does this matter?

00:32:54.969 --> 00:33:00.299
The reason skeptics don't buy is because they're putting a magnifying glass on you

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:06.988
Your business and your products they want to know more about what you're offering them, and they're there

00:33:07.749 --> 00:33:13.468
to act as if that what you're offering them is not as good as what you're presenting it as

00:33:14.469 --> 00:33:19.019
Have you dealt with skeptics surgeons skeptics yes, yes

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.009
They'll say. Who are you? Why should I trust you?

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.779
And I believe what you're telling me. How do I know this research is real? You'll tell them

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.650
It's peer-reviewed

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.840
And they'll say well isn't there a board of people that you can buy, and I'll just go back and forth between all this stuff

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:41.940
Now I talk about psychology research a lot in what I do, and I encounter skeptics a lot

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.149
People always ask me. Well. Do you have a PhD in psychology?

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.420
And the answer is no I don't

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:54.630
Don't have a PhD in psychology. I actually majored in Shakespeare, which is completely unrelated to psychology

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:59.640
And I tell them that right off the bat. I don't have a PhD in psychology, but here's a deal

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:05.640
I leave the rigorous psychological research to people with masters and PhDs instead I

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.610
Specialize in figuring out how this research?

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:14.969
applies to business owners in the real world they can they conduct the stuff in a lab I

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.120
conducted on real business and

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:24.630
This usually a lays the skeptics fears or problems with you immediately

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.350
Now do you see what I did here

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.130
Even though it might seem like common sense

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.670
What's really happening is when you know something is is going to be skeptical

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.659
You don't want to try and argue with them about it

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:48.300
Because that's just gonna make them more skeptical if they say hey, I don't believe you said oh

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.880
You should believe me you're gonna be back and forth and you're gonna get nowhere

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.489
However if you come up and just say you're right. I don't have a PhD or you're right

00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:00.180
I don't know how they picked the board on that Reese or that peer review board or whatnot?

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.320
It makes them fall into

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:10.080
This idea that they're talking to someone who might be similar to them

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.579
You're not an adversary because you're agreeing with them

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.860
Now let's talk about dr. Nice hair

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:27.090
He uses low-cost implants to persuade him you need to figure out why he's using those implants

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.330
Is he skeptical that?

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.410
high-cost implants

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:39.019
Aren't really better quality have you ever encountered that with your due with a low-cost implant user and they'll be like well

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.190
I've looked at both the low-cost ones in the high cost ones. I just don't see the difference yes

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.810
Yeah

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:53.390
Well if that's the case I wouldn't argue with him about the quality of your implants

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.480
Don't try to tell him look you're you're wrong right don't say he's wrong

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.839
Because he's not gonna listen to anything else you say after that

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.660
He's gonna get defensive

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.550
Instead you reframe. It first you might want to start with a story and

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.960
This is a story again that one of the territory reps shared with me

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.050
Well doctor a little bit of hair started using noble bio care. He went with a low-cost provider and

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.220
1.5 years later people had complaints about screws loosening

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:29.899
I'm not sure what happened there, but I also heard the same thing happened with dr. Lots of hair

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.930
How long have you used your provider?

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:40.789
If you notice what's happening you're not saying that your implants are low quality because he's not going to admit to that

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.079
Instead you're just saying hey. I have someone else who used this they had a problem

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.080
I know someone else who used it. They had a problem

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:55.819
How long have you been doing this for and it seems like you're not trying to argue with him you're just trying to help

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.680
You're trying to figure out. Why is he different than the people you already know?

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.580
Now I know a lot of you have these stories of these people

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.110
When you bring these stories up to a skeptic

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:15.859
It's always very important to try and name the doctor if you're allowed to do so

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.919
Because if you put a real name attached to it

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.749
They're more likely to think it's a real story if you just go in there and say oh well

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.750
I know all these other people that are having problems

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.980
that sounds like you're full of it if

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:34.099
You say this doctor had this problem and this doctor had this problem and this doctor had this problem

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.950
You're not how I got to know why what are you doing different?

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:43.669
And you can go in there act curious to try and figure out what's happening, and he's gonna at that point

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.720
try and

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:53.339
Understand what's different as well or come to the conclusion that maybe these implants aren't as good as what he thought they were

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.000
Now

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.210
if this isn't working and

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.030
You're still not getting through to him

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.910
Don't belabor the point

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:11.219
Don't try to argue with him don't try to show him more stories if it's not working

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.060
And it doesn't work after one story or one comment or one thing

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:22.710
Maybe give it two minutes if it's not working you need to switch gears immediately and find something else to talk about

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.549
Now I'm not saying you ever agree with him and say alright

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.420
maybe your implants are the same quality, but you need to switch gears because

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.629
Arguing kills the sale and don't do it

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.410
Now when I first started got when I first started selling

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:45.810
You know as loves sales people are type a people we tend to think we know it all this is comes with the job and

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:52.919
I would think that I can just argue people into submission and let me tell you it just never works

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.370
It never works

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.840
Because arguing kills sales don't do it anymore

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:09.959
Let's keep going we talked about being different we talked about the skeptic the third side liner is the warrior

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:15.750
Now the Warriors a little bit different than the skeptic, but what is that difference?

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.029
Well while the skeptic questions you the warrior questions themselves?

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:28.319
They often lack the confidence in themselves, and you need to provide that confidence

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.690
And

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:38.579
You might hear these warriors say things along the lines of well that works for them, but it won't work for me or

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:45.509
Maybe they say I'm not sure if I can pull this off. I don't know if I have enough time left

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:52.799
I've been doing it this way for so many years. I'm not sure I can learn something new at this point in my career

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.370
Will I feel stupid after I buy this?

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.409
I've asked myself that question before pretty much every purchase of that made

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.339
Tony Robbins has a really good quote, and I really like this quote

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.770
The only thing keeping you from getting what you want are the stories you're telling

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:18.639
Yourself about why you can't have it and the Warriors are experts at telling themselves these stories

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.020
Now when you start to hear these stories

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:31.959
You can then we pull back a little bit and realize you're not dealing with an indifferent person anymore they already care about it

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:39.489
You're not dealing with a skeptic person anymore. They already kind of trust the situation now you're dealing with a confidence issue

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:43.359
Now have you ever dealt with anyone?

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.060
Who was a little bit shy?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.280
or someone who lacks confidence

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.629
Have you ever walked up to them saying? Hey just be confident man does that ever work?

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.139
No, or just put yourself out there

00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:59.828
This doesn't work, so you can't tell a warrior. Don't worry

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.010
That's never gonna make them not worry

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:10.329
instead you need to focus on the specific thing that is stressing them out and

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.189
You need to show them why they shouldn't be stressed about it

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.970
Let's take it to dr. Lots of hair

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:25.720
There's no way I could start placing implants. I'm too inexperienced, and I've never done it before you

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:34.660
Could say something along the lines of well doctor nice hair thought that what's interesting is that he didn't start placing?

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:40.329
Implants instead he created abutments and crowns. He dipped his toes in and now it's 30% of his business

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:47.919
Also, did you know that we have training classes that we offer we have one coming up. Why don't you come as my guest?

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:55.599
To just see what it's like no commitment just come check it out. If you feel like you're still concerned about doing this

00:41:56.119 --> 00:41:57.220
No problem

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.819
Come as my guest

00:41:58.819 --> 00:42:00.819
See what it's like

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:05.828
What's happening here when you're dealing with the warrior your goal is to

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.399
Encourage them to dip their toes into the water

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:17.419
Forget the sale if someone is worrying about the product and worrying about their confidence to deliver what you're saying they can deliver

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.330
Stop asking them for money

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:28.249
Instead you want to get them to say yes to something else and preferably something smaller like a class I

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.930
Was doing with a friend that had a

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.180
They're a little bit. Shy

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.220
Dead problems meeting new people

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:41.300
Dead problems talking to strangers if they met someone new they would stutter a little bit

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:46.429
And I was trying to help them break through this shyness or this confidence issue

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.750
So one of the things I remember doing and it worked like a charm

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.610
we were

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:58.189
we where we had some store something like fast food plays like a juice place or something we walk up and

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.850
we're like at the we're at the register, and I was like hey just

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.430
He's mentioning the girl was cute. It's like hey

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:10.100
just tell her how come it's not free today and say it like as loud as obnoxious as you can and

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:15.110
He's like oh, no. I'm never gonna do that she's you know they're gonna get insulted, so I went up

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:19.849
I said well, how come it's not free today, and you just make a dumb face almost everyone laughs

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:24.289
I've never said that to someone that I was supposed to pay and have them not laugh

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:27.500
He saw that happen she laughed we went to another place

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:35.330
He did it and that was the first step for him for talking to random people and now he talks to people all the time

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:38.569
But the goal was he was worried about looking like an idiot

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.429
So the goal is to say something look like an idiot and eventually you're not gonna worry anymore

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:49.189
Especially if there's no stakes on the whole thing so it works for selling it works for coffins works for everything

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.180
Let's keep going to the next type of side liner

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:01.700
Did the indifferent the skeptic the warrior the

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.450
Next side liner, and I'm sure you're all familiar with this side liner is the procrastinator

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.210
the people who keep telling you oh

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:16.250
I'm gonna get this one day, and then just keep keep you on the line and like deep down

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.660
I don't know about you

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.250
I kind of hate procrastinators because I feel like I'm wasting my time and then six months go by

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:26.240
Nine months go by you know at this point this guy is never gonna buy anything

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.509
But he keeps telling you he's gonna buy next month, and you keep doing

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.829
Because you don't want to lose the sale you want to be a good salesperson or whatnot

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.240
Here's the issue with the procrastinator

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:45.080
There's a reason why they're not pulling the trigger and they're gonna keep telling you they're gonna do it. They're never gonna do it

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:53.630
You have to first find out what that reason is even though. They're gonna say things like do I need this now or

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.920
Can I?

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.979
wait and see if something better comes along or will I feel stupid later for buying this the

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.519
Procrastinator actually has a little bit of every sideline or within them

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.499
They're procrastinating for a reason because if they 100% trusted you 100% trusted themselves

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:11.640
100% believed

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.650
That what they were buying was going to impact their business helped them sell more

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.980
implants or whatnot help boost their bottle if they believe this

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.840
There's no logical reason why they should say no

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.269
There's an emotional reason though, and you need to find out what that reason is

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:38.570
You need to figure out the fear that's holding them back, and then you need to allay that fear

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:46.910
Maybe you're talking to a general practitioner, and I was talking to again about six reps

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.619
And they said that general practitioners tend to be a lot more price sensitive than oral surgeons

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.110
So if

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.269
You know this to be true, and you present the cost

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.589
What did you do after you present the class now. I don't know if you guys offer

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.600
Money-back guarantees or trial runs or payment plans or whatnot?

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:14.660
But if you know cost is the issue and it's not that they're cheap because they don't want to give you money

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.649
But maybe they just don't have the money to give you right now if you know that's the issue

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.170
you need to stop what you're doing and

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.400
figure out how to show them that this makes sense and

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.759
provide them with options and reasons why

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:36.529
The cost is a non-issue. I sell downloadable training products and downloadable software products

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.650
This is what I do for my business

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:47.119
Right after I announce the price of my thing and they're not cheap some of these courses are two thousand three thousand dollars

00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:51.979
But right after I announced that I always then quickly show them right off the bat. I've got a rock-solid

00:46:52.530 --> 00:47:00.169
30-day guarantee you can try the product for 30 days risk-free if you feel like you don't get 10x the value from the training

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:04.520
Email the support team before the 31st day, and you'll get a full refund

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:10.219
It's really that simple, I'm just encouraging them not to buy it

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:16.159
But instead to try it and I use try on purpose

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.070
There's another research study where some conversion tests were done online because even though we can't

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:28.700
Hear what people saying they don't give us reasons why they're not buying we can do cool things like showing

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:36.590
500 people one page and showing a different 500 people a different page and we can start changing micro changing words

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:44.240
To see what's actually making people pull the trigger and they found that when you're asking people to give you money that

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:52.189
Hurts people want to spend money, so we don't ask them to buy anything instead we say try on purpose

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.470
Why don't you try this out I?

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.439
have a friend and I'm I

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.290
Think he's crazy for doing this

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:06.379
but he does it he sells an expensive piece of software to small businesses and

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.000
He says you could try it today, and if you don't fall in love with it in 90 days

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
We'll give you twice your money back

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.570
That's

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:18.199
Listen the risk-averse person to me thinks he's nuts

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:23.119
Because I just think that people are gonna buy it and then just get 100% return on their money in three months he

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.339
Sold thousands and thousands of copies of this software to

00:48:30.089 --> 00:48:35.149
Date he's had only five people take him up on this double your money back

00:48:36.599 --> 00:48:38.599
But what's interesting is she?

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:41.310
Tried it out it

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:48.889
Helped move that procrastinator who's worried about price and risk into buying and he's made significantly more sales because of it

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:53.629
Now I'm not saying you guys need to do something like this or something this crazy

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:59.420
But it might be something worth testing it might be something worth

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:05.480
Saying if you don't have something like this you can say I want to try this out for the next 30 customers

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.759
and then only offer it to 30 people and that's it so you can limit your risk and

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.730
then see what happens after 90 days if

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:20.720
You notice that nobody takes you up on it. Maybe this is something worth pursuing and scaling up to 60 people

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.069
These are the things you have to think about things that don't make sense or think we're seeing crazy

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.799
Actually rarely bite you in the in the ass I

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.600
Have one friend that offers a one year guarantee

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:47.870
This to me is also ridiculous because we found something who's very interesting about one-year guarantees and this is why I'll never offer them

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.109
Every year about a week and a half before Christmas

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.610
everyone refunds

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:02.029
there's a spike in refunds literally a week and a half before Christmas all the time and

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.960
That's because people are trying to buy Christmas gifts, and they're like

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:12.049
oh, they're viewing you as a bank and some people take advantage, but again you can run these tests you can see if it's

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:17.629
Generating more sales than you're losing and you can keep going

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:24.169
Another way to get a procrastinator to buy if you don't want to go the cost route is

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:29.960
To give them a small win give them a taste of what they're gonna achieve

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.019
when they stop procrastinating I

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.130
had a tooth that was a little wonky and at one appointment my

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.499
Dentist said we can fix that and make it look perfect

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.980
And I went through the whole

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.609
Stages of skepticism do I really need this can he really?

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.759
Deliver this what if it doesn't what if I don't like the way it were looks

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.350
What if I start stuttering all this weird stuff and he was like well I could just show you

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:56.960
how to how this tooth is going to look and he like applied this like magic putty to my tooth and

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.660
Showed me what the tooth is gonna look like and took a picture and I was like oh, I guess great

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.660
We scheduled that we scheduled that uh

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.909
That tooth procedure cuz he showed me he gave me a small

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.360
He showed me what the tooth was gonna look like after I did it and sold me right on the spot

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.839
cuz small wins convert

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.860
Now how does the information?

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.510
That I just shared with you

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.320
Help me create this booklet

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:29.489
When most people sell products they focus on their product they focus on the research they focus on the history of their company

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:36.720
Actually, you probably all have booklets, and if you open these booklets up. It's probably talking about how great your products are right?

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:42.269
I'll just go through the features. Here's this feature here's this feature goes through the product product product product product

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:47.849
when I sell products I don't even introduce the product I

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:52.470
Introduce the product later in those booklets I

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:59.850
Want to address all of the side liners first before I ask people to buy

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:05.759
So when I'm writing this sales copy. I'm not saying hey. Here's my new thing buy it

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:10.349
I'm not even saying. There is a new thing. I'm trying to connect first, and I want to give you an example

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:13.979
This is from one of my software products called zippy courses

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.620
Just to give you just a quick example it starts off with hey

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.950
I'm Derek Halpern the founder of social triggers and one of the biggest problems

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:21.160
I had in my business was this

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:27.420
How can I create my course and then deliver it to my students without headaches that come with setting up software and technology?

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:32.220
Now in my business one of the main reasons why people wouldn't buy was because they're worried about technology

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:38.939
And I addressed that in the firt in the first sentence. I then keep going in short. I had a course

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:43.079
I just wanted a piece of software that would allow me to sell and protect it without messing with

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:46.799
Software without messing with PHP without headaches, I just wanted to create

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:52.200
My course sell it and then start working with my students sound familiar at this point

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.079
I'm getting their attention by speaking to

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.460
Their innate side liners that are preventing them from wanting to buy

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:04.440
These people are entrepreneurs or teachers and many of them have online training courses

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.680
they want to sell and

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.930
I've done my research in advance about these side liners about these people and

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:15.960
I figured out what their hopes their dreams their fears are and I'm addressing those in my copy first

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.229
Before I even mention the fact that I'm selling anything

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.190
And it just keeps going it turns out

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:28.739
Me you and everyone else has these same fears and problems and the existing software in the market was either a too

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:33.569
Expensive or be too hard to use and that's why I parted with a world-class developer and it goes on

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:39.809
now I want to show you one thing I did here because I think this is something that you can start doing I

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:46.170
Immediately disqualified all my competitors by saying they're either more expensive or too hard to use

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.070
Its kind of true

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.819
but maybe it's a little bit more on the gray line I

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:59.850
Believe my software is easier to use which is why I created it, but I'm sitting there. I'm addressing these concerns

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:07.319
I'm making them realize that they might not have any other options available to them and this is the only option that they have and

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.900
This page goes on for 15 pages

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:16.350
15 pages I'm getting I'm asking people to read before I finally say hey by the way

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:20.460
introducing zippy courses you can buy this software I

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.830
Start by talking to people's emotions first, then I ask them to buy

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:30.450
now many of you do this by default when you're doing that one-on-one and

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:35.850
You're trying to find their hot buttons and you're trying to press those hot buns so you can make sure they're gonna get the sale

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.130
but

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:41.910
It just goes to show you that you can do it on paper, too

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:46.410
If you do the research first and one of the things I was hoping that

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:52.020
You would all take away from this presentation today is to know that no matter what sales

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.020
Call you're going on

00:54:55.810 --> 00:55:01.860
the person you're talking to is going to be just like everybody else you've already talked to if

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:07.079
You go in there knowing that there are indifferent people. You know they're warriors. You know they're skeptics

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.920
You know they're procrastinators when you spot that into conversation

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:16.080
you need to address or change the way you're talking to that person as

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.840
So you start speaking their language?

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.800
So you start appealing to the things that they want most?

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:25.530
and

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:33.960
When you do do this when you know why people don't buy it actually gives you the opportunity to

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.569
Bring up a question that they might ask

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.840
before they ask it and

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.339
This is really important to do because if they ask the question

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.260
They're on the you know

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:50.100
They're being the aggressor and there you have to prove yourself to them

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.980
But if you raise the question before they even ask it they start to view you as someone that they can trust

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:59.489
Because they see that you're being honest with them

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:05.130
They see that you truly understand them as a customer

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.980
they don't view you as a salesperson at that point they start viewing you as a friends and

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.220
That's what most of us try to do when we're selling

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.210
We don't want to go in there and have people feel like we're just trying to get money from them

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:23.249
You want them to trust us if you start raising these questions before they have them

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:28.739
And you spot which sidelines you're talking to before they raise the questions, it's gonna be great

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.360
That's how you can walk out of the office with the sale now

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.960
I told you I spoke with Scott Lynch

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.699
Rep for Noble when I asked him how he deals with people who use low quality implants

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:44.399
I told you what he said he uses that metaphor where he talks about the girl going to college. I like this example

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.089
There's a great example of turning an indifferent into someone who cares I?

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:50.970
spoke with another rep John

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:55.049
Costantini I'm sorry if I mispronounced that and he was a territory rep as well

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:57.840
and he said he gets his foot in the door by offering a

00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:59.760
three-part lunch-and-learn

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:06.840
This is really interesting to me because he went through this three-part lunch-and-learn with me what he did he leads his with his first

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.120
Presentation about communication and branding has nothing to do with

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.319
Noble bio care products whatsoever it's just about communication and branding he leads with value first

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:24.210
It gives him a chance to build that trust or credibility

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:29.579
These were valid first Denny follows over the presentation about implants and advanced options

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:34.079
This is very similar to what I do actually online. I give people a free ebook

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.080
I give them valuable content another video more content

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.269
And then I asked him to buy something

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:46.170
After I had the chance to build trust a lot of people who were in the sales world ask for the sale too soon

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:47.850
And if you ask for the sale too soon

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:52.950
You're never gonna get that sale a lot of other sales trains will tell you to ask

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.690
Questions and make sure you're trying to prescribe their problems, or we're not in double prescribed

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:02.639
well diagnose their problems and then prescribe the solution to the problem, but

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:09.450
Sometimes you don't even have that if you build that trust and likability first you're in a relationship business if you can build the relationship

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:15.629
Before you actually need them to buy something from you. It's gonna make your life a whole lot easier

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:22.199
Now you're gonna get a booklet that rehashes some of the big concepts that I covered in this presentation

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.350
And we're gonna have time for questions, but first I wanna say

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:29.009
Thank you to Scott Lynch, John Constantini Tim trap

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:36.989
Justin Behrens April Lee Katrina Haines Mike Van Daan coke Joe Day Tom Olsen for all making time for me before this meeting

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.130
to speak with me about

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:44.400
Orwell to answer some of the dumbest questions about a dental implant sales probably that they've ever heard

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.289
But I really appreciate the time they made so thank you. Thank you, and thank you everyone else

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.110
I appreciate it now if you want to learn more about what I do

I have a website called social triggers calm and my youtube channel, which is how April and?

00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:01.349
Malkin's found me to begin with and you'll see me yelling on the camera

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:06.029
And I guess you might have no time for questions or time for questions. What do you think?

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:11.759
We good perfect, thank you
