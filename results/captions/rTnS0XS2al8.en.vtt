00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Welcome back! T-34-85 Part 2: Turret and Interior!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.700
Now the turret, of course, big difference between it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.600
and the earlier model to accommodate the larger gun,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.500
also meant you had a three man crew.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.600
This is great, the TC could spend his time commanding the tank

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.200
and not performing multiple duty.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.300
Now initially T-35-85 turrets had about 75mm of armour on the front

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
and about 52 on the sides and rear.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.600
However, later models, by the end of 1944,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.100
you are starting to look at 90mm at the front

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.020
and 75  on the sides and rear.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.750
The Turret was of cast construction,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.100
although the roof was a simple sheet of metal

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.700
which got welded in place.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.000
TC of course has his own cupola now.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400
It’s a fixed cupola, the vision ports are fixed,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.800
you can’t rotate them around.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.400
However, he can rotate the roof with the hatch.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.400
So by lifting up the lever here, it’s on rollers,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.400
it rotates fairly simply.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.250
Now the hatch itself, after I lock this back into place.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.000
Very simple, one piece, it’s locked in place by a simple locking latch

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.550
and there is a torsion bar spring to help lift it open.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.850
That’s the outside, let’s go in.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Now the Commander’s seat, is not really the most comfortable

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.700
that I’ve ever been in,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.100
it’s actually a good incentive to fight with your head out.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.000
Now for reasons which elude me it seems the TC has a choice

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.150
of two different foot pedals.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.200
The first one is below the gunner’s seat.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.500
In order to get to fold down,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.500
you have to lift up the gunner’s seat to give it room

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
and then let the gunner’s seat fold down.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.100
Now with this set of food pedals he’s aiming pretty much

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.600
his legs in a forward direction,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.900
so he’s quite comfortable.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.800
The downside though is that with his knees lower down,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.800
he’s more of a risk of hitting the gunner in the back.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The other set of foot rests,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.500
which is part of the gunner’s seat itself,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.250
the advantage is now my knees have been lifted up not quite

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.250
as intruding into the gunner’s space.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.950
The downside though is that now my knees are angled over at forty degrees,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.100
and so I’m fighting with my body twisted

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.150
and it doesn’t strike me as being particularly comfortable

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.150
for any length or duration.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.700
To see out, TC isn’t doing too badly.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800
He’s got five of these individual vision points around here,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.400
which, if it looks like you’re taking fire,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.000
you can actually pull down and it will protect the port.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.100
To his front here he has a binocular or unity sight,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.320
which is adjustable in elevation,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.500
and, in theory, traverse, although this one is a little bit stiff.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.250
He doesn’t have any other controls.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.150
He’s along for the ride.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.150
No TC’s override, he’s got some stowage facilities

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.150
around him so it looks like a little bit sparse

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.050
but otherwise his job is, quite simply, command the tank.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.900
Probably a nice relief for T-34 Commanders

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.280
who used to have to do multiple duty

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.280
in earlier versions of the tank.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.800
Other than that, the only thing I can really say is that if I’ve got no gunner,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.050
I can stretch my legs out

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.100
and I can still control the turret and get her around.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.900
Not really a three man crew because you’ve got no sight

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.500
but it’s comfortable.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.600
The better way to control the gun, of course,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.250
is from the gunner’s seat, so that’s where I’ll go next.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.700
That was easy.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.300
So this is an example of elegance in operation:

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.300
it’s a crude tank but it can also be elegant.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.400
So you sit and here and you go

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.900
‘Well, where is the control for the powered traverse’

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.550
because, obviously you’ve got manual traverse,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
you have manual elevation.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.400
Where is powered traverse?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.650
Because, ordinarily, there would be another set of controls.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.600
Well, no, not in this -

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.650
they saved space.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.850
All you do is move the manual control to the top left,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.000
pull out the handle and now you’re in a powered traverse mode.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.800
It’s not precise, but it’s a lot faster than cranking.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.900
So, if I try spinning to the right…

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.350
POWER!

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.750
Alright, so similarly, going back,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.700
again note how there’s momentum in the turret,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.700
it continues to spin even after I go back to the zero position.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.250
So this is a case of traversing quickly to get roughly on target.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.500
More or less straight, then you go back to manual mode,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.200
and that’s how you conduct your final lay and service the target that way.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.700
And again, you saw how fast this thing spins, being a loader,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.450
holding that big 85mm shell, while the turret spins,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.450
unpredictably,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.500
because you don’t control it, you want to pay attention.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.600
To engage the target the gunner is supposed to have a TSh-15 sight.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.000
As you can see, it’s somewhat missing.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.700
It did have an electric light bulb so you could have an illuminated reticle

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.750
for firing at night

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.750
and by January of 1945 it came with a heater to prevent it from fogging.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.600
This primary toy is the S-53 85mm cannon.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.800
54.6 calibres in length and it has 56 rounds to play with.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.400
Maximum service range: 5,200 metres.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.100
The gun has two ways of firing, electrical or manual.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.900
The electrical trigger is located on the elevation handle.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.250
The manual trigger is located next to the solenoid here.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.850
It would be a string that you pull and it would release the firing pin.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.250
Just behind the solenoid and manual firing trigger is an elevation quadrant.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.500
You can use this to engage targets at night

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.650
if you are firing from a range card for example,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.120
so you can’t actually see the target,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.450
you know what the range is.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.300
Or alternatively perhaps, for indirect fire,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.300
although without an azimuth indicator,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.250
at least not a precise one,

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.250
I’m not entirely sure how that would be performed.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.800
There is a basic azimuth indicator on the left hand side.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.050
It’s a simple pointer.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.900
There is a graduated scale on the inside of the turret ring and

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.750
that will give you an approximate way of telling

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.750
which way you are facing compared to the hull.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.300
To his front he has selectors for the main gun and the coaxial machine gun.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.550
Curiously, you can have them both on or both off at the same time.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.550
I’m not entirely sure that’s how it’s supposed to work,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.750
so we’ll have main on, and coax off.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.850
The coaxial is a 7.62mm DT

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.900
and he has over 1800 rounds of ammunition to play with in drums.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.650
To his left he has a pistol port,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.700
there is another one on the other side of the turret.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.900
You unscrew it, bring it down,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.500
you can then push out the port plug

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.000
and engage targets with what was usually a revolver.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.150
It was preferred by the tankers over the semi-auto apparently.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.700
And you just put it back in, lock into place, and off you go.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.250
Last thing on the right hand side.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.500
This is a recoil guard with a travelling position.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.300
So, the release latch would be here, unfortunately,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.500
its locked into place, so I can’t release it to demonstrate going up and down.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.350
However, sufficed to say, it can theoretically be done.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Last thing to say for the gunner,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.750
he doesn’t have a foot rest of his own

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.000
but because he is in control of when the turret traverses,

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.000
it’s probably less critical.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.200
That’s the gunner’s side.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.800
Loader next.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.250
Now, we’re over on the loader’s side

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.250
and this is where things start getting a little bit nasty.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.950
For starters, of course, there is no turret baskets

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.750
so I’m standing on ammunition boxes which are on the hull floor,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.500
so I've got to be careful as I’m wandering around inside the tank.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.100
I’ve seen the turret on this thing move under electrical power.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.800
It is actually very fast,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.000
which means you have a tripping and leg-cutting-off hazard for the loader.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.900
Now it is possible for the Loader to have a Loader’s seat,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.000
however, I’ve never ever seen a loader sit in a loader’s seat

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.620
when performing the loading operation.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.250
It’s usually more for road marches or long distance travelling.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.450
So perhaps this is why it isn’t in this particular tank,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.650
perhaps the loader just got sick of it being in the way.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.250
He has enough problems of his own to deal with.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.000
As you can see, I’m…

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.050
Let me stand up and I can show you how little room I have to stand.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.800
So that shows you where the floor is,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.800
and what kind of angle my legs are on right now.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.950
So, yes, I know I’m taller than most people,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.050
a foot isn’t a difference though,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.450
it takes more than a foot and a difference to do this.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.650
You would have to be particularly short to work on this.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.650
The Ammunition, as you can see, is not particularly short.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.550
85mm of course, much stronger than the earlier one.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.250
So once I insert the round in,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.200
it’s not going to go in all the way because the breech has been welded up.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.600
But you can see how the back of the round rests on this spring-loaded deflector.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.650
It’s is actually a relatively neat little thing here.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.800
What it will do is it will take some of the weight off of the long round

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.850
and make it easier for the loader with his left hand,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.150
his weak hand usually, to throw the round in

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.700
without also having to support its weight.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.300
Of course it springs up out of the way

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.400
to let the empty shell casing fall to the floor,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.800
where the loader can then trip over it.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.600
The loader does have another periscope of his own.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.400
It’s of course adjustable in elevation and rotation.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.600
Forward of that is a dome light on the turret roof

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.950
mounted over the machine gun -

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.650
which I have to say is rather convenient -

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.700
if he wants to change ammo belts in the dark.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.250
The loader has sixteen rounds of ready ammunition available to him.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.250
Four are on the turret wall behind him,

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.050
and the other twelve are located in the bustle.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.450
The rest of the sixty rounds of 85mm, in the hull.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.000
Now unlike an American Tank which have removable panels

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.450
which basically make a false floor,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.850
the T-34-85’s ammunition boxes are stowed in the open,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.700
giving an uneven footing for the loader

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.950
as he’s attempting to navigate his way around inside. 

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.500
So the astute of you will realise this segment is filmed

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.850
in a different tank on a different day.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.100
We had a small incident involving a memory card and the turret monster.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.650
However, this is the bow gunner’s position on the T-34,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.650
and I have to say this is rather miserable,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.700
not because it’s uncomfortable,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.850
which is my normal complaint about such things,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.150
in fairness, the seat is actually very nice,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.750
and you can see my leg is actually absolutely straight.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.700
I can put both legs absolutely straight into the bow of the tank.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.350
No, what really concerns me more is the fact that he can’t see a damn thing.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.350
Your only view of the outside world, except maybe the driver’s hatch,

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.100
is from this small little hole through

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.100
which you shoot your DT machine gun.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.200
Outside of that, you can imagine the noise of battle

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.550
and you have no idea what’s coming at you.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.900
You just have this small little hole.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.650
Oh, by the way, what happens when you get hit?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.250
Well, there is actually, at my feet a very small escape hatch.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.350
Very small. Still, slightly bigger than the Matilda’s I guess.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.300
For his machine gun he’s got 22 drums scattered around

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.600
in double depth here,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.800
single here and then there is a vertical row

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.100
and of course you got one on the gun itself.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.550
Held in place by a very simple travel lock,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.400
just unscrew it a little bit and there you go.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.200
It’s very solidly in place.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.150
You almost don’t need to put your shoulder up onto it.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.800
You certainly have no need for the shoulder guard here.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.800
Radios if mounted in the hull,

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.700
would be in the front right corner here.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:56.000
However, this particular tank has moved the radio to the bustle.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.400
Outside of that, all he has to worry about is

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.300
not getting in the way of the driver and the gear stick. 

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.650
Now the other thing to point out in here firstly is

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.250
the interior space is largely taken up,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.250
rather heavily, by the suspension units you can see here and here.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.600
Now this is the downside with the Christie Design.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.600
In order to get that large range of travel,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.200
the large springs eat up a lot of your internal volume.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.750
So the interior space here is a lot narrower

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.300
than it would be on any other tank.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.200
Now it’s not entirely wasted though,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.100
if you have a look behind, there are fuel tanks

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.100
in between the suspension units,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.550
and oil tanks further back.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.950
So, not totally wasted, but still narrower than you would like.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.250
The last thing in here, if you look at the far corner you can see

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.150
one of the locking systems for the idler-wheel.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.350
So again, if you’re going to tension the track,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.450
unlock it from inside here, adjust the tension on the outside,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.450
and then you lock it back into place.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.300
Outside of that, the only thing blocking

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.400
his legs is the axel for the front road wheel,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.300
and the next stop is the driver’s hole!

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.800
Alright, so moving into the driver’s position, definitely,

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.850
you can see my knees are up.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.000
This is more for the shorter people in the crew.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.250
To see out he has two prisms to his direct front

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.300
and course the hatch will simply move up out of the way.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.750
It’s lifted by a large cylindrical spring here.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.250
So you undo the two locking levers, push forward,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.100
it springs up and it’s held in place by use of a screw here.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.200
Make sure you do it tightly enough.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.250
There we go.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.350
Nice and secure and we have a little bit more light.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.700
So, quick tour of the driver’s station.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.900
My foot is now on the clutch.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.500
That’s as far down as it goes.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.000
There is a service brake in the middle, and an accelerator on the right.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.850
Steering of course, controlled by the two tillers.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.900
These are also brakes.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.750
Now, this is a two stage steering system.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.750
You pull back to the first stage,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.100
all that happens is that the clutch disengages.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.100
You have power going to one track only.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.100
You pull back to the second stage,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.000
and this now applies brakes on the inside.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.600
Now the disadvantage with this,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.300
and this is why you see it’s so jerky when a T-34 is turning,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.650
is that it’s not very efficient on the power.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.400
The tank will slow down as you’re going around the curve.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.500
Advantage?

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:43.250
It’s very simple to build. It’s also a little bit tiring for the driver.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.300
So starting around on the left hand side,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.500
this is the control valve for the high pressure engine start system.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.500
Now there are two ways of starting this thing.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.150
You got the standard electrical starter motor,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.600
or if for some reason that doesn’t work there is a compressed air system.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.800
Now the bottles for that are in the very bow of the tank.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.900
Release the level and a blast of high pressure air will come down,

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.050
cycle the engine -

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.500
it’s a compression system so no electrics required.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.800
Engine roars to life and hopefully your alternator will then take over

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.550
and you will have electrical power for the tank.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.500
The high pressure air is only filled by mechanics

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.150
it’s not re-pressurised by the system,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.200
and that’s why it’s not the primary means of starting. 

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.350
So the last thing I’ll mention in here is

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.250
that I can’t help but notice I’m behind the turret ring,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.750
pretty much down to my midriff,

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.350
which means that the driver has probably got to be leaning forward at all times,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.700
otherwise he’s going to have a serious issue of the turret traversing around

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.900
and various large, heavy metal components interfacing

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
with his head with a lack of clearance.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.200
I don’t know, how much of a problem that this was in practice.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.800
I guess after the first couple of knocks you learned a couple of lessons,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.350
however, I just pointed it out as something

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.600
that strikes me as being a bit unfortunate.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.350
So that’s it for this little sequence.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.000
Through the wizardry of editing we are now going to go back

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.300
to our original location.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.100
Alright, we’re going to have a crack at moving this thing.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.000
The starter process of course, warm engine,

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.250
because the mechanic has been helping us a little bit,

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.550
and frankly, we’ve been practicing.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.550
So the gear lever is in neutral,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.820
foot brake must be applied,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.150
and there’s a reason for that we’ll come back to, I just learned!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.250
Press down on the clutch.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:38.400
Hand Brake, correction, hand accelerator about half way up.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.000
Then it’s pump, horn, let everyone know you’re starting, and starter.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.850
So if all is well, let’s see what happens!

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.250
Okay, we seem to be idling.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.000
Now to get her into first, you’ve got to put her in reverse.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.500
Hopefully, I’ve done that.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.800
Take off the brake -

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.800
just push down and release -

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.000
and let’s see what happens!

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.100
Little bit of clanking.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.250
Not bad.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.500
Barely touching the speedometer

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.000
and we’ll come to a halt here.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.300
To go back into neutral,

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.300
I’ve got to put it in reverse again.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.950
Okay, so my gear stick says I’m in neutral.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:09.900
I let go of the clutch...I’m in neutral.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.650
Now I’ve got to go backwards again,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.250
all the way forwards with the gear stick.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:21.700
Don’t ask. I’ll try both hands.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.600
Ow! That’s a heavy clutch as well by the way.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.550
Okay, reverse works.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.500
Okay I’m now stopped.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.400
I put it back into neutral.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:03.600
Not quite neutral.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.300
You’ve actually got to put it back into first in order to totally disengage the gear.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:40.800
So now, in theory, if I let go… let's try it again…

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.000
okay I’ve disengaged the gear.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.500
Cut the hand throttle and then set the parking brake.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.800
So what happened there was,

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.100
when I pulled back into first gear to disengage from reverse,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.300
I went a bit too far.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.450
I engaged first and took my foot off the clutch, the tank crept forward.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.350
So to disengage from first, back into neutral,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.750
back, just touching the reverse gear,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.350
should disengage first, came back into neutral again,

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.250
let go of the clutch, and that was the end of that!

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.450
And that is why the foot brake has to be set

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.750
before you start the engine,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.850
because you don’t know if the last gear was properly disengaged.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.550
The fact that you can move or turn the gear levers

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.150
side to side has no bearing as to

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.650
whether you are in gear or not, which is a little bit disconcerting.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.000
And the other thing which is a bit disconcerting if you didn’t notice,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.000
was just how much force it was taking me to push or pull into gear.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.750
Not very relaxing!

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.200
Still an interesting educational experience.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.700
Alright, so with what little strength I have left in my left leg

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.250
after holding down the clutch for so much,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.550
it’s not a light clutch,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.100
I’m going to attempt to egress in the traditional manner out the driver’s hole.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.300
I am told head first, chest up is the preferred technique.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.450
Not having my foot stuck is probably a good start.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.300
Oh to hell with the preferred technique!

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.450
Okay, who put the steering lever in the way?!

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.000
Half way there...

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.400
As I almost fall off the front slope.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Fortunately, the spare track links almost broke my fall.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.300
You know, if the tank’s on fire, I’m going to get out the turret.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.100
Now the Russians are going to hate me.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.100
I don’t like this tank very much.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.850
Now don’t get me wrong, I respect it immensely.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.250
As a strategic war-winning vehicle, this thing served the Red Army supremely.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.300
However, as a tanker,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.800
it strikes me very much that it was designed purely

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:42.800
with the needs of the state in mind

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.100
and the needs of the crew really didn’t get much of a look in.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.650
Perhaps it is simply a cultural thing but as a western tanker,

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.650
that concept doesn’t sit well with me.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.450
Still 35,000 of the things were made,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.750
and if you add to that,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.650
the production run of the earlier T-34s, this brings you nearly to 80,000,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.250
that alone cements the T-34’s place into the annals of Tank History.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.700
By the close of the war, the Tank was starting to show its age a little bit,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.350
and indeed about ninety percent of anti-tank gun hits

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.400
on the T-34 would penetrate the vehicle.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.900
However, the fact that it was still a perfectly serviceable vehicle

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.900
at the end of the war is a testament

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.800
to how good of a fundamental design T-34 was back

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.000
in 1940, at the beginning of the war.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.550
It was, however, a bit of an evolutionary dead end.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.650
A lot of the features that made the T-34 so awesome at the beginning of the war,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.000
such as the Christie Suspension, the strange drive system,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.000
the all-around sloping armour.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.150
They were dispensed with in later Soviet Tanks as well.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.900
It would continue on to see service throughout the world,

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.350
it was widely exported, for many, many years.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.800
Now it got to the point that anybody with basic mechanical skills

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:55.800
could keep this operating.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.800
There was a case in Hungary about ten years ago.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.400
Some protesters found a T-34 that was used as a monument,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.550
they fired it up and used it to attack the police,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.100
unfortunately, they forgot about some basic fundamentals of tank warfare -

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.450
they left their supporting infantry behind.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.500
The police walked up to the tank and they lobbed tear gas

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.850
down the hatches, which they also forgot to close.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.500
So there is an example as to why it is important

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.700
that crew training is just as much of a factor as the tank itself.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.000
That was the T-34.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.550
I hope you found it somewhat amusing and informative.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.550
I’ll see you on the next one.
