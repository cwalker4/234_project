00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Standing at the border between Guatemala
and Mexico.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.400
Up there on the bridge,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.969
there's a normal border crossing with
migration; people stamping passports, but

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.720
you go down these wobbly stairs, you
notice that right under the bridge these

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.300
guys are trafficking people across the
border, technically illegally.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.380
You can't tell that there's been an immigration
crackdown here, but there has.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.480
And it was the U.S. that paid for it.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.440
These guys are doing it under the noses of immigration

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.780
officials who clearly don't care that
much.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.329
You only start to feel this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
crackdown when you start moving north,
where you run into a new network of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.560
military infrastructure and checkpoints
meant to stop migrants.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.800
But this crackdown was never meant to keep
Central Americans out of Mexico, it was

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.600
meant to keep them out of Texas.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.020
In 2014 the United States sent an influx of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.740
money to Mexico, helping them militarize
and fortify their southern border region.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.880
To understand why, you have to look at
this chart: the red line represents the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.420
number of Mexican migrants apprehended
while they're crossing into the United States

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.759
and the green line is for non-Mexican
migrants. Look at 2014: that's when the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.329
number of non-Mexican migrants
outnumbered Mexican migrants for the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.740
very first time. What pushed this number up
were the migrants coming from

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. And these people
fleeing from Central America aren't just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.740
looking for jobs, they're running away.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.240
So, there's a war going on in Central America

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.610
right now, it's actually not just
one war it's a ton of micro wars,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.540
"Unbelievable violence." "Nearly one homicide an hour".

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.480
"Three of the five highest homicide countries in the world:

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.900
Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador."

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.620
"Carved up the city into warring factions".

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.440
Residents of these towns are

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.280
at major risk of dying and so people are
fleeing.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.360
While riding with U.S. Border Patrol on the Texas border, I watched them apprehend a 22 year old and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.320
his son as they just made the three-week
journey up through Mexico from Honduras.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.160
These refugees walk into Mexico mostly
hoping to make it to the U.S.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.820
Many come here, to this town called Tapachula, just
north of the border where they can look

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.940
for a migrant shelter to lie low and get
support and at this vulnerable point in

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.720
their journey, many don't want to show
their face on camera. And there were

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.000
these threats just constantly came and
came and came to me and then one day I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.940
just said the hell with this I'm gone.
Mm-hmm. I burned my little Rancho and and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.360
I took off at two o'clock in the morning.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.380
The exodus out of Central America came

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.620
to a head in 2014, when the U.S. saw a huge spike in the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.880
number of Central American kids and
teens arriving to the border without a parent.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.080
"It is a huge humanitarian crisis
on the border right now".

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.540
"52,000 unaccompanied children have been caught
at the US border with Mexico: double the

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.900
number recorded last year". "Children from
Honduras traveling into Guatemala, then

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.640
Mexico, crossing the Rio Grande, and just
now arriving in Texas."

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.060
As soon as it became clear that this year's migration
to the border was different than in past

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.930
years, I directed FEMA to coordinate our
response at the border. Obama declared an

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.100
urgent humanitarian situation at the
border.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.500
He discussed it with Mexican
president Peña Nieto.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.140
Peña Nieto walked away from that meeting and
immediately implemented a policy called

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.180
"El Programa Frontera Sur", the southern
border program. "And earlier this week

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.170
Mexico announced a series of steps that
they're gonna take on their southern

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.980
border to help stem the tide".

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.760
For Peña Nieto, the plan had two main objectives:

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.900
In short, the plan was supposed to make

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.780
life better and safer for both migrants
and those living in the border region,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.240
which includes Mexico's most
impoverished state, Chiapas.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.580
This migrant protection plan for the southern border
had been in the works for years, but it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.440
was rushed into implementation
apparently in response to American pressure.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.560
Many of the long-term plans
that were meant to give migrants legal

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.830
support and protection fell away. Instead,
the implementation focused almost

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.600
entirely on enforcement and security.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.070
"What's easiest to do, I think, is enforcement because

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.300
you already have the infrastructure set up.
Like it's harder to create jobs, right,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.870
than it is to hire more immigration
agents to detain people."

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.590
Mexico's quick solution to this was to
militarize, to start raiding buses to

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.910
start putting up checkpoints, to start
cracking down on Central Americans who

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.569
are coming into their country. A perfect
symbolic representation of this are

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.759
these huge multi-agency complexes that
they built in order to house the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.980
immigration officials alongside the Army,
and the Marines, and the Federal Police.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.020
Mexico fortified its southern border
region and to help in the effort, the

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.580
U.S. sent an influx of money and
equipment, using resources from an

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.840
existing security partnership it had
with Mexico, dating back to 2007.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.120
This partnership was originally created to
combat drug trafficking and organized crime.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.199
The money was used here for things
like inspection equipment, k9 teams,

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.720
observation towers, training for
immigration enforcement officials,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.380
communication networks to support
enforcement activities, and gear to

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.380
collect biometric data like fingerprints
and photos of detained migrants.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.840
In short, the U.S. helped militarize the southern
border region of Mexico.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.080
The U.S. got what it was looking for.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.680
"In part because of strong efforts by Mexico

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.860
including at its southern border, we've
seen those numbers reduced back to much

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.180
more manageable levels."

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.199
Apprehensions on the Mexican side went up and people

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.940
arriving to Texas or other parts of the
U.S. border went down, but this was all

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.069
temporary. The number jumped back up in
2016, so the crackdown isn't actually

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.639
stopping people from getting to the
United States, but it is making their

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.260
journey much more dangerous.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.220
Behind me is the train that Central
Americans take to get from here in

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.980
southern Mexico, up to the border of the
United States. If it were 2014 this area

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.600
would be completely packed with migrants.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.870
Migration officials targeted this train.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.470
They started conducting extensive raids
and the train companies hired guards,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.700
increasing the speeds of the trains and
installing concrete posts and walls to

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.840
make it harder for people to jump aboard
and now gangs are a constant threat to

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.940
the few travelers that remain.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.460
Here are the main routes that migrants took to

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.230
get to the United States: they mainly follow
the train routes. These paths were well

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.650
supported with migrant shelters and
clinics and most importantly large

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.280
groups of other migrants, making it less
likely that people will be robbed or

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.480
assaulted. Migrants often don't know
where their next meal will come from or

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.410
where they're gonna sleep each night.
They depend on this network of usually

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.330
church-sponsored shelters as they move
north. The 2014 crackdown targeted these

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.860
routes, looking for migrants in popular
places like shelters and train stops.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.800
So migrants moving north have shifted into
unfamiliar, unsupported routes that

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.320
multiply the dangers that they are
already subject to on this journey.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.660
Pushing these refugees away from well
trodden routes and into the shadows has

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.700
made them more vulnerable to assaults by
criminals and gangs in this region.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.780
During this time the U.S. Border Patrol
started putting out public service

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.710
announcements, about how dangerous the
journey through Mexico had become.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.300
This, in spite of the fact that U.S. policy
contributed to those risks.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.000
All of the shelter directors I talked to have
noticed an uptick in crimes against

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.590
migrants since this crackdown. A study by
dozens of migration organizations in

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:37.690
Mexico found that, of the 5,824
investigations into crimes against

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.960
migrants, less than 1% had led to any
sort of sentence.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.240
And many crimes go

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.530
unreported altogether. There's not a lot
of trust in the Mexican justice system

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.420
for migrants.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.180
Most migrants are now left on their own,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.600
navigating this remote
region where both gangs and corruption-prone

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.740
police are looking for ways to
profit off vulnerable migrants.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.780
But perhaps the most egregious offence of the Mexican
state in this crackdown, comes down to

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.540
what they didn't do for these people
entering their country. When a Mexican

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.369
immigration official detains a migrant,
that officer is required to inform them

00:11:05.369 --> 00:11:09.209
that they have the right to ask for
refugee status or asylum if they're

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:13.680
fleeing for their lives. Everyone I
talked to said that isn't happening.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.240
There were 40,000 children who entered
into Mexico in 2016, and these children

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.060
aren't looking for jobs, they're not
smuggling drugs, they're looking for protection.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.760
Of the 40,000 that came here,
only 1% applied for asylum.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.520
That's a dangerously low number for a
country that has said that it protects asylum seekers.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.399
Migrants who feel a threat to their lives in their own

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:39.809
country have to fill out an application
and submit it to an agency that has the

00:11:39.809 --> 00:11:44.699
power to grant asylum or refugee status
in Mexico. This allows them to avoid

00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:48.480
being deported, to stay in the country,
but this agency that's in charge of

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.740
processing these applications only had
15 caseworkers dedicated to interviewing

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.730
these applicants and while applications
are on pace to be 12 times what they

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.920
were in 2013, this group's budget only
grew 5% during the crackdown.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.600
The year the southern border program was
implemented, Mexico detained around a

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.679
119,000 Central Americans. It granted refugee status to

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:15.420
only 460 of them, not
even a half a percent. That same year

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.709
Mexico started deporting a lot more
Central Americans, so the southern border

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:23.790
program made Mexico a lot better at
detaining and deporting people,  but it

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.360
definitely didn't make Mexico a safer
place for refugees like it said it would.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.249
Now let's get one thing straight, Mexico
has the right and the sovereignty to

00:12:32.249 --> 00:12:35.660
fortify its borders and to control who's
coming in and out.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.500
That is their right as a sovereign nation.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.730
And some will wonder why is it Mexico's

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.210
problem to deal with
you know the problems and challenges of

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.530
citizens of another country?
The problem is Mexico has signed all of

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.430
the international conventions that
promise that they will take care of

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.060
asylum seekers or refugees and give them
the legal protection so that they can feel safe.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.940
A report by the Migration Policy institute found that in 2014,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.880
The U.S. deported just 3 of every 100

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.090
unaccompanied children that it
apprehended on the border. Mexico on the

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:22.130
other hand deported 77 for every 100
kids it apprehended. And yet when

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.020
thousands of unaccompanied children
arrived at Texas' border in 2014 the U.S.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.280
turned to Mexico to handle the delicate
and difficult work of screening and

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.300
protecting these refugees fleeing for
their lives. The U.S. is paying Mexico to

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.590
do its dirty work, knowing full well that
doing this will result in a much more

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.480
dangerous situation for refugees.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.760
It drove them into the shadows, worsening their vulnerabilities.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.860
And in most cases,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.380
deporting them back to the violent places from which they came.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.820
One of the questions I know I'm gonna get a ton is:

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.160
What is the name of this waterfall?

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.060
Southern Mexico's full of a lot of very beautiful scenery,

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.260
and I got to see a lot of it as I was traipsing around the region, reporting this story.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:28.080
But this waterfall, it's called El Chiflón and it's in the state of Chiapas in Southern Mexico.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.960
It ended up being one of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.360
in all of my Borders reporting this summer.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.920
Especially once I got the drone up in the air and saw it from above.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.960
El Chiflón, in Chiapas. It's a beautiful place.
