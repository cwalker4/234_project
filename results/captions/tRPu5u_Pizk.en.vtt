00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.110
SEAN CARROLL: Picture a
world of giant reptiles,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.380
flying pterosaurs with
40-foot wingspans.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.110
While, beneath the waves,
fierce predators called

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:43.050
mosasaurs prowled the seas,
and dinosaurs roamed the land.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770
For more than 100 million
years, creatures like these

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.540
ruled the planet.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.810
And then they were gone,
lost in the shadows of time.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.390
Their extinction-- a
mystery for the ages.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.644
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:12.490
This is all we have left of
those magnificent creatures--

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.370
bones, and a lot of them.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.354
We've collected enormous
numbers of bones.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:19.270
And from them, we can
tell how these creatures

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.990
lived, what they looked
like, when they lived.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.780
But we don't know
why they disappeared.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.060
To solve that mystery
required some of the greatest

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.190
scientific detective work ever.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.800
And the trail began almost
halfway around the world

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.651
from here.

00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:36.240
[BELLS RINGING]

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.500
This is Gubbio, a
sleepy Italian town.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.840
Not a single giant
reptile in sight.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.730
Still, the past is
everywhere you look--

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.300
in the medieval palaces
and churches, the homes

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.830
and narrow streets, while an
even deeper past lies nearby.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.102
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.270
Just outside of Gubbio,
Alessandro Montanari

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.754
is looking for
that distant past.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.550
He's a time traveler
moving towards the lost

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.560
world of the dinosaurs.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.580
It's ancient history written
in these limestone cliffs.

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:30.030
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI:
Millions of years

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.860
ago, these mountains were
at the bottom of a deep sea,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.060
collecting layers of sediment
and deposited it slowly

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.440
through time, and eventually,
pushed by tectonic forces,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.530
folded and uplifted.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.310
SEAN CARROLL: So all of this
rock and all of these layers

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.110
were once at the
bottom of the ocean.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.920
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI: Exactly.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.795
SEAN CARROLL: And then
all these other forces

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:56.700
have brought this
older rock up to you.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.783
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI: Yes.

00:02:57.783 --> 00:02:59.850
The reconnection is
starting layer by layer,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.610
like pages of a book,
the history of the earth.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.035
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.030
SEAN CARROLL: Gubbio's
deep-sea limestone,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.970
now exposed by the
side of the road,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.440
became a magnet for scientists,
especially this site that may

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.680
seem ordinary, but holds one
of the strangest features

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.900
to confront a geologist--

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900
a thin layer of dark clay.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.360
In the 1970s, the clay
captured the attention

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.670
of an American geologist,
Walter Alvarez.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.280
He was trying to determine
the relative ages

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.790
of the limestone layers by
analyzing the fossils left

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.630
by tiny shelled sea creatures.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.110
Called foraminifera,
or foram for short,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.470
they're among the most
common ocean plankton.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.810
When they die, their shells
become part of the sediment.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.660
Since many different species
have evolved over the ages,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.770
they can serve as
markers of geologic time.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.730
But as Alvarez studied them,
he noticed something striking.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.660
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI:
Well, what he sees,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.700
and he was puzzled by, after the
very top of that white layer,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.450
all these very
diverse microfossils

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.480
species would disappear.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.070
SEAN CARROLL: OK.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.800
So Sandro, when Walter
Alvarez looked in these rocks,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.080
he saw all these
species of forams.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.920
They're plentiful.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.800
There are many species for
thousands and thousands

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.720
and thousands of years.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.150
But after this little
scene of clay here,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.640
all the way up through
these rock layers,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.882
those forams are missing.

00:04:44.882 --> 00:04:47.090
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI: Those
species are gone forever.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.960
SEAN CARROLL: Disappeared.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.650
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI:
Disappeared.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.780
SEAN CARROLL: And that's
a fundamental mystery.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.210
What would make these
little creatures disappear?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.980
ALESSANDRO MONTANARI: Yes.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.900
SEAN CARROLL: So
Alvarez was stumped.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.480
What did this thin
line of clay represent?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.290
It was laid down 65 million
years ago, the same time

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.270
when the dinosaurs disappeared.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.070
Was there any link?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.780
The same questions
were being asked

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.630
1,500 kilometers away in Spain.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.780
On the Atlantic Coast,
outside the town of Zumaia,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.110
Dutch geologist Jan Smit
was studying the forams

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.820
from a different ancient sea.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.190
Their fossilized shells
formed these limestone rocks,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.336
which, like Gubbio's
mountains, were once

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.460
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.110
Now exposed, they represent
over 1 million years

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.350
of a geological time period
known as the Cretaceous.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.730
Like Alvarez in
Italy, Smit had also

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.990
found a strange clay layer
formed at the same time, which

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.820
told a dramatic story.

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:07.240
Jan, what can we tell
about earth's history

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.100
from just looking
at these rocks.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.340
JAN SMIT: Well, you can see
the end of the one world

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.650
and the beginning
of the next one.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.010
You see there is a very
sharp, extremely sharp,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.512
dividing line between the two.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:20.720
SEAN CARROLL: That gray band.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.511
JAN SMIT: That's that
gray band over there.

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:26.090
At the bottom of the gray
band, you see it's razor-sharp.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.780
SEAN CARROLL: And all this
reddish-maroon rock, the oceans

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.180
are healthy and [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.880
JAN SMIT: They're healthy.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.600
They're steady.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.240
They don't change at all.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.294
And all of a sudden, we
see a dramatic change,

00:06:36.294 --> 00:06:37.585
which we call the K/T boundary.

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.170
SEAN CARROLL: The
K/T boundary, found

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.930
at the bottom of this gray
layer, marks, not only

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.660
the end of a period,
the Cretaceous,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.380
but also of the Mesozoic era,
a much longer stretch of time.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.300
The history of
animal life on earth

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.870
has been divided into
three such eras--

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:07.210
early life, or Paleozoic; the
age of dinosaurs, or Mesozoic;

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.270
and the era of
mammals, or Cenozoic.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.670
The Cretaceous
tertiary boundary lies

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.230
right in between these
two eras, marked here

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.360
by this layer of clay.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.030
What drew you to
this boundary, Jan?

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.696
JAN SMIT: Well, Sean,
we're looking here

00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:32.290
at the very top-most
rocks of the Cretaceous.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.350
These rocks are literally
packed with foraminifera.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.530
So we call this the Cretaceous,
and these rocks here

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.850
are the tertiary.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.440
And the base of the tertiary
consists of a dark gray clay

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.020
layer.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.160
And there, the life
has almost disappeared.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.480
And the K/T boundary
is just in between.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.740
I can point at it.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.580
It's right here where you see
a contrast between the purple

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.510
and the dark.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.850
It's an extremely
sharp boundary.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.970
SEAN CARROLL: And just across
that thin little boundary,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.820
there's this huge change in
what you see in the forams.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.784
And why is that so
stunning to you?

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:07.450
JAN SMIT: It's so
stunning because there

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.660
is no preceding evidence of
anything happening there.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.760
So it doesn't matter
if I take a piece here,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.900
a piece there, or
just underneath what

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.560
we call the K/T boundary.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.620
The foraminifera
will remain the same.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.020
So they don't change overnight.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.357
And then, bang, they're gone.

00:08:21.357 --> 00:08:22.940
SEAN CARROLL: So
what's that tell you?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.023
JAN SMIT: That tells me
the base of the food chain

00:08:25.023 --> 00:08:26.620
of the oceans disappeared.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.320
And everything which
is dependent on it

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.600
is totally zapped
right at the boundary.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.035
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.210
SEAN CARROLL: In Amsterdam,
change at the boundary

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.301
becomes clearer when Smit takes
a closer look at the evidence.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:54.370
In his lab, he analyzes forams
extracted from the limestone.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.650
Under the microscope,
the rich diversity

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.905
of fossilized shells from the
Cretaceous snaps into focus.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.850
Some four dozen species
appear below the boundary.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.300
But above it, there's
a different world.

00:09:14.716 --> 00:09:16.770
JAN SMIT: And these
are the foraminifera

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.316
from just below the boundary.

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:25.739
And these are from just
above the boundary.

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:27.280
SEAN CARROLL: Only
a few species have

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.967
survived into the tertiary,
and they're much smaller.

00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:34.800
JAN SMIT: As soon as
you see the extinction,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.250
and you realize,
at the same time,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.780
that the dinosaurs
are disappearing,

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.450
you know you're looking at
something very important.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.910
But you see that nobody
has witnessed it.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.340
So we're looking for silent
witnesses in the rock.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.350
And the first thing
that comes to mind

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.960
is this beautiful clay layer.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.800
SEAN CARROLL: A layer varying
in color and thickness

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.280
and found around the world.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.790
Walter Alvarez also believed
it was a silent witness

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.910
to the end of an era.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.520
The key question
was, how long did it

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.025
take to form, for
the world to change?

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.340
To find out, he sought help at
the University of California

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.840
at Berkeley from a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.515
someone he knew pretty well,
his father, Louis Alvarez.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:31.870
Louis loved a good mystery, no
matter what field it was in.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.840
And that's how physics
joined geology in the quest

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.088
to explain the K/T extinction.

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:41.790
RICHARD MULLER: Alvarez
looked at this layer,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.600
tried to figure out how you
could determine the time scale.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.480
He brought in his
knowledge of astrophysics,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.040
his knowledge of
nuclear physics,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.860
and realized that
there's an element that's

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.530
relatively rare in the
crust of the earth that

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.120
occurs in meteorites.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.070
SEAN CARROLL: The
element was iridium,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.111
which falls steadily in an
invisible rain of cosmic space

00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:04.610
dust.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.750
If the layer had taken
thousands of years to form,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.800
Alvarez thought there might be
just enough iridium to measure.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.270
But when the clay was
tested, scientists

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.710
were stunned to find it
contained 30 times more iridium

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.610
than the surrounding rock.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:31.320
Moreover, samples from other
K/T sites had similar levels--

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.700
too much to come from
ordinary space dust.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.760
What could explain so
much iridium deposited

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.620
around the world?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.080
Perhaps, a catastrophic
event in outer space.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.860
Alvarez wondered if a
supernova exploding nearby

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.739
might be responsible.

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:57.030
CHRISTOPHER MCKEE: So he
asked me if that was possible.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.230
And I concluded that there
was only 1 chance in 1 billion

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.410
that such a supernova would
occur that close in 100

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.160
million years.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.670
SEAN CARROLL: A supernova
would have also deposited

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.410
a rare isotope, plutonium 244.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.420
But testing revealed
there wasn't any.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.780
CHRISTOPHER MCKEE: Well, I
suggested, alternatively,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.420
that it could have been
an asteroid or a comet.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.120
SEAN CARROLL: There are hundreds
of asteroids whose paths cross

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.870
the earth's orbit.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.330
Their sizes range from
a few meters to hundreds

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.215
of kilometers across.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.490
RICHARD MULLER: So Louis
Alvarez had this hypothesis

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.850
that an asteroid or comet
would cause this destruction.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.360
He had the clue, the amount
of iridium at Gubbio.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.500
Under this hypothesis, it would
be spread all around the world.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.610
So now he could
calculate how much

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.464
iridium there had been laid
down over the entire earth.

00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.130
Now, he also knew how
much iridium there

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.050
is in asteroids and comets.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:06.780
So he can now calculate
the size of the object.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.560
SEAN CARROLL: The
answer was sobering.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.380
An asteroid 10
kilometers in diameter,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.670
as large as Mount Everest, and
weighing hundreds of billions

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.180
of tons.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.890
Still, how could something
that size wreak havoc

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.748
on a large planet?

00:13:26.748 --> 00:13:29.309
Because traveling through
the vacuum of space,

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.350
it would have slammed into
the Earth's atmosphere

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.700
at 80,000 kilometers per hour,
20 times faster than a bullet,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.250
heating the air to several times
the temperature of the sun.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.940
At impact, the
energy released would

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.810
be equal to about 100 million
nuclear bombs exploding

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.350
at once.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.180
A huge mass of
pulverized debris would

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.460
have been blasted
into space, some

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.770
of it orbiting the earth
before raining back down.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.570
The debris may have blocked
out the sun for months.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.980
Photosynthesis
would have stopped.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:17.520
Plants, plant-eaters and then
meat-eaters would have died.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.180
This was the asteroid
impact hypothesis

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.090
for how the Mesozoic era ended--

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.490
a big idea that was
just too big for some.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.270
When the Alvarez hypothesis
was first proposed,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.120
it was difficult for many
scientists to accept.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.150
Because, for almost 2
centuries, geologists

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.250
had crafted their worldview
around a gradual picture,

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.270
a slow but steady
change in the earth

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.610
without major catastrophes.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.500
Now, they're hearing a
proposal that something

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.840
could come from outer space and
rewritten the history of life

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.670
in almost an instant.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.130
RICHARD MULLER: Louis
Alvarez got very frustrated

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.980
when the paleontologists
didn't say, yes, sir.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.740
Thank you for
solving our problem.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.910
But many of the
paleontologists just

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.200
looked on him as someone
who didn't know their field

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.950
and was stepping into
this just because it

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.340
was such a big,
important, famous problem.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.270
SEAN CARROLL: The controversy
would continue for years.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.690
To convince the skeptics,
more evidence was needed.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.500
One criticism of
the K/T hypothesis

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.960
was the lack of a crater the
right age, type, and size.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.350
Alvarez thought it should
be 200 kilometers across--

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.080
bigger than the
state of Connecticut.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.130
How could you miss that?

00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:50.265
RICHARD MULLER: They looked.

00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:53.370
They looked for craters that
were 65 million years old

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.240
all over the earth.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.280
Many of these things
had been discovered

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.714
and had been measured--

00:15:57.714 --> 00:15:58.380
didn't find any.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.960
SEAN CARROLL: 2/3 of the
planet is covered by water.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.550
If the asteroid
landed in the ocean,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.200
the crater might never be found.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.300
Even so, there would still
be a trail of debris, ejecta,

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.490
blasted from the crater.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:23.120
So attention focused on
finding this evidence.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.210
Geologist Jan Smit
discovered glass-like beads

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.300
in K/T boundaries
called spherules

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.860
formed when vaporized rock
cools and rains back down.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.420
Another key clue was rock
that had been so shocked

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.850
by the impact, it had
criss-crossing bands

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.890
of dislocated minerals.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.030
This was shocked quartz.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.340
JAN SMIT: And we know, if
you set off a nuclear bomb,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.260
the damage done to
the surrounding rocks

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.960
will produce you
a shocked quartz.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.430
So if you put two
and two together,

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.190
we find shocked quartz
at the K/T boundary

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.773
and shocked quartz
in nuclear craters,

00:17:00.773 --> 00:17:02.770
you know it is an
explosion which

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.750
deforms your quartz crystals.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.979
And quartz is only
found on land.

00:17:06.979 --> 00:17:08.020
So that was the big clue.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.079
We have to look for a
crater somewhere on land.

00:17:14.724 --> 00:17:16.390
SEAN CARROLL: The
search for fresh clues

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.300
led here, to Texas,
along the Brazos

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.500
river, some 300 kilometers
from the Gulf of Mexico.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.860
65 million years ago,
this was the bottom

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.680
of the sea instead
of grazing land.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.200
In the early 1980s, scientists
noted unusual deposits

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.210
of sediments across
the river basin.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.580
Intrigued, Alan
Hildebrand, then,

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.510
a graduate student in
geology, came to investigate.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.010
ALAN HILDEBRAND:
It's actually easy.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.956
There's fresh tracks.

00:17:54.956 --> 00:17:57.580
SEAN CARROLL: Along the banks of
the river and its tributaries,

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.600
he examined exposures at the K/T
boundary different from those

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.130
seen elsewhere and saw something
on top of the Cretaceous mud

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.830
and rock that it once
accumulated on the seafloor.

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:15.329
So this is the typical
mud is found in this area?

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:16.370
ALAN HILDEBRAND: Exactly.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.700
All we see is this
green, Cretaceous mud.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.490
And there's 7 million
years of this mud here.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:27.030
So we're talking boring, in
other words, nothing going on.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.630
But--

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.740
SEAN CARROLL: So what's--

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.840
ALAN HILDEBRAND: You
see it right here.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.780
The sea floor has been
eroded right at this point.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.660
SEAN CARROLL: An untrained
eye might see this sediment

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.790
and never look twice at
the protruding boulders.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.260
But Hildebrand saw evidence
of a catastrophic event.

00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:48.840
ALAN HILDEBRAND: So
something happened here

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.790
that eroded the sea floor.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.390
And we started seeing these
very coarse sediments.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.060
And this first unit is
really quite extraordinary

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.790
because, you trace
round over here,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.870
you see here is a boulder in it.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.800
It's like 50 centimeters across.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.360
And you come over here,
this is another one.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.250
It was weak, so it's weathered
out, but it's even bigger.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.240
Here's another boulder.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.000
But notice this boulder is
different stuff than these.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.300
SEAN CARROLL: So you had this
really regular mud layer,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.670
and then, all of a
sudden, this area that's

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.019
just full of this whole
mixture of boulders and--

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:27.810
ALAN HILDEBRAND: And
from different places.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.880
It isn't just the rock that
was here in the sea floor.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.650
Maybe some of it got
pulled from deep water.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.120
Maybe some get
pulled from shallow.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.010
It all got jumbled
together and dumped here.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.280
SEAN CARROLL: All right.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.071
So what could have
happened here that would

00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:38.580
explain something so dramatic?

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.220
ALAN HILDEBRAND: Well, it had
to be a hugely energetic wave

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.555
in the ocean, a giant tsunami.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.810
SEAN CARROLL: If an asteroid
10 kilometers across

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.780
landed in the sea or at
the edge of a continent,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.790
it would displace incredible
amounts of rock and water,

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.250
causing tsunamis
over 100 meters high.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.320
These giant waves
would have crossed

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.115
the sea with the speed of a jet,
ripping up the seafloor, moving

00:20:06.115 --> 00:20:09.580
tons of sediment.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.170
As that debris came
to rest in what,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.450
today, is the
Brazos River basin,

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.320
it would have mixed with
ejecta falling from the sky.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.930
OK.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.964
So now we're here in Texas.

00:20:22.964 --> 00:20:25.130
Is this making you think
that you're a little closer

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.860
to the crater in Texas than you
might be in Italy, for example?

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.901
ALAN HILDEBRAND: Exactly.

00:20:28.901 --> 00:20:32.000
Because we can see the
products of the impact mixed

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.710
into this tsunami deposit.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.495
So we're getting warm.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.720
SEAN CARROLL: Hildebrand
was hot on the trail

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.800
of every new piece of evidence.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.640
Next stop-- Haiti
where he investigated

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.350
a report of volcanic rocks.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.960
As he suspected,
they were actually

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.960
ejecta full of shock
minerals and spherules.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.510
They also contained melted
rock called tektites,

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.830
another telltale sign--

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.200
more evidence that a strike
had occurred somewhere

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.000
around the Gulf of Mexico.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.120
But somewhere wasn't
precise enough.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.110
Ironically, a key clue
discovered by another geologist

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.210
had long been overlooked.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.300
Years before, Glen
Penfield had hunted for oil

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.995
on the Yucatan
Peninsula in Mexico.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.540
From the air, Penfield
saw nothing unusual.

00:21:40.034 --> 00:21:41.700
But his instruments
measured differences

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.700
in gravitational fields
and revealed the features

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.350
of a giant buried crater.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:55.930
It was Hildebrand who eventually
followed up on Penfield's work.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.300
Rock samples from the
area Penfield identified

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.550
showed all the signs of
a high-energy impact.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.860
ALAN HILDEBRAND: And it was
full of shocked quartz too.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.120
So this evidence finally
convinced everybody

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.630
that, indeed, there was a big
crater buried on the Yucatan

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.250
Peninsula.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.170
SEAN CARROLL: After
years of speculation,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.630
the crater had
finally been found.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.730
It was named the
Chicxulub Crater

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.649
after a village built
over its center.

00:22:28.649 --> 00:22:30.190
The discovery of
the Chicxulub Crater

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.190
was the ultimate evidence
of the asteroid impact.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.160
And it tied together all of the
clues that had been gathered

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.870
over the previous decade--

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.300
the shocked quartz,
the tektites,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.090
the spherules that had
fallen across the earth.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:47.170
Moreover, the crater was the
same age as the K/T boundary,

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.110
and it was the size
predicted by Louis Alvarez.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.040
We now knew, for certain, what
happened on that horrible day.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.520
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.040
The asteroid crater
had finally been found,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.080
but important
questions remained.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.810
Which species were wiped out
at the end of the Mesozoic?

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.830
Which survived, and why?

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.170
The search for those answers led
to the Badlands of the Dakotas

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.127
and Montana in the
Hell Creek Formation.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.680
It's eroding buttes hold fossils
of plants and animals, that

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.465
lived during the last million
years of the Cretaceous

00:23:48.465 --> 00:23:48.965
and beyond.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.920
When paleontologist Kirk Johnson
discovered this K/T boundary

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.580
with its telltale spherules,
he found the dividing line

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.560
between two vastly
different worlds.

00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:06.620
KIRK JOHNSON: You're
looking at a ball of glass

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.835
that used to be the bedrock
in Chicxulub, Mexico.

00:24:11.645 --> 00:24:13.020
SEAN CARROLL:
Kirk, how important

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.572
was it to find the K/T boundary
up here in North Dakota?

00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:18.030
KIRK JOHNSON: If you can't put
your finger on the boundary,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.580
like you can right
here, what that means is

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.770
you can ask the very
simple question, how

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.830
was life before the
impact different from life

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.697
after the impact?

00:24:26.697 --> 00:24:28.530
All you've got to do
is look for the fossils

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.910
below and compare them
with the fossils above.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.160
And that's what we've done
here for the last 30 years.

00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:37.510
SEAN CARROLL: This
arid landscape

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.550
was once a wet, lush forest.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.380
Crack open some
rocks, and you'll

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.570
find the leaves of
plants and trees

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.615
that flourished here over
65 million years ago.

00:24:48.615 --> 00:24:49.740
KIRK JOHNSON: Look at that.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.870
SEAN CARROLL: Just look at that.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.175
You can even tell
what insects ate them.

00:24:55.175 --> 00:24:56.367
Holy cow.

00:24:56.367 --> 00:24:57.742
KIRK JOHNSON: You
can see there's

00:24:57.742 --> 00:24:59.670
two different kinds of insect
damage on this leaf as well.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.795
There's sort of a whole
feeding that's in the leaf.

00:25:01.795 --> 00:25:04.584
And there's a margin
feeding on the edge.

00:25:04.584 --> 00:25:06.500
SEAN CARROLL: Take a
close look at the ground,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.660
and you can pick up
fossils of small animals

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.746
that thrived in lakes,
rivers, and forests.

00:25:12.746 --> 00:25:14.120
KIRK JOHNSON: So
in my hand, I've

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:22.790
got evidence of a turtle, fish,
crocodile, fish, and mammal.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.970
SEAN CARROLL: And then
there were the dinosaurs.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:31.520
The challenge-- connecting
their fate to the K/T boundary.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.680
The clues-- their
fossilized remains.

00:25:35.892 --> 00:25:37.350
KIRK JOHNSON: This
is an ankle bone

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.360
of a small,
meat-eating dinosaur.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.779
And you find these bones,
identify the animal,

00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:43.320
and pretty soon,
you start assembling

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.154
the list of dinosaurs that are
present at any given level.

00:25:46.154 --> 00:25:48.570
And the lower you are in the
formation, the older you are.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.700
And the higher you are,
the younger you are.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.737
And the closer to
the boundary you are,

00:25:52.737 --> 00:25:54.570
the more we address the
question of how long

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.611
did the dinosaur survive?

00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:58.680
So just nearby, we
found this bone,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.150
which is a bone of a much
larger, meat-eating dinosaur--

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.190
same bone--

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.510
But see the size difference?

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.880
SEAN CARROLL: Right.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.430
KIRK JOHNSON: And here's
the exact same bone.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.320
So when you find bones
of different species

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.720
in the same layer, they were
living in the same place

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.560
at the same time.

00:26:14.112 --> 00:26:15.820
SEAN CARROLL: The work
takes a great deal

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.060
of time and patience.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.630
TYLER LYSON: This is basically
how you find a dinosaur.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.020
You're walking around
looking in these gullies,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.310
and then you spot
a piece of bone.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.080
And you can see
it's very porous.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.990
You know that it
had to travel down--

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.310
force of gravity.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.720
You can see the bone trail.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.460
Here's a bone.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.730
Here's a bone.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.890
Follow the trail of bone up.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.990
And then, here you
have a shinbone

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.280
of a duck-bill dinosaur
really broken up.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.790
And then here is where it would
articulate with the knee joint.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.500
SEAN CARROLL: Scientists know
that 22 types of dinosaurs

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.820
lived in Hell Creek, including
triceratops, tyrannosaurs,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:09.720
and this duck-bill, some
9 meters or 30 feet long.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.090
The more complete the
skeleton, the easier

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.640
it is to reconstruct the past.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:22.050
But discoveries like
these are extremely rare.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.540
TYLER LYSON: You walk around
in the Badlands out here,

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.090
and you'll pick
up numerous chunks

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.640
of dinosaur, chunkasauraus--
that's what we call it.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.890
And that's about it.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:35.720
So usually, you find piles of
bones that aren't articulated.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.600
They're not in
the correct order.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.160
So having the vertebrae in
the right order like this

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.960
is very, very rare.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.300
And what makes this
specimen even more important

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.590
is it's articulated,
and it's pretty

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.741
close to the K/T boundary.

00:27:56.451 --> 00:27:58.640
KIRK JOHNSON: We now found
several specimens that

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.104
are very close to the boundary.

00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:01.520
And really, what
that's showing us

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.630
is that, even if dinosaurs are
rare, if you look long enough,

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.650
you'll find them when they
were living on the planet.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.640
What we have not found yet is
any dinosaur skeleton anywhere

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.880
in the world above the
K/T boundary layer.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:24.080
SEAN CARROLL: Scientists
now knew what lived here

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.550
and their ultimate fate.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.690
Within 1,000 kilometers of the
impact, death came quickly.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:40.010
BRIAN TOON: If you turn your
oven on broil, open the door,

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.050
put your hand
under the glow bar,

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.960
that's what the
dinosaurs felt very soon.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.700
And they were probably broiled
alive within an hour or so.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.350
SEAN CARROLL: For
dinosaurs further away,

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.690
death may have been
delayed, but not for long.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.780
Soon, vaporized ejecta and
smoke from fires filled the air.

00:29:06.232 --> 00:29:07.690
BRIAN TOON: And
there may have also

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.970
been a lot of sulfur
blown into the atmosphere

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.850
because the impact site
in the Yucatan Peninsula

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.530
had a lot of sulfur in it.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.350
And all of those things
were abundant enough

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.000
to obliterate the sun.

00:29:23.089 --> 00:29:24.630
SEAN CARROLL: Without
light, anything

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.200
dependent on photosynthesis,
on land or in the sea,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.070
was vulnerable.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.060
As food chains collapsed, giant
reptiles still alive died off.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.250
The Mesozoic era, the age
of dinosaurs, was over.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.180
And there were other
radical changes.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.290
In Kirk Johnson's
Denver lab, you

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:55.970
can see what happened
to plant life.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.290
Samples taken from
below the K/T boundary

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:08.330
show a high diversity of pollen
grains, stained here in red.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.170
But above the boundary,
this earlier diversity

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.960
disappears, reflecting
the extinction

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.760
of 60% of all plant species.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.697
SPEAKER: Fern spore,
fern spore, fern spore.

00:30:20.697 --> 00:30:22.780
SEAN CARROLL: Where flowering
plants once thrived,

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.490
ferns took over first.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.610
SPEAKER: Fern spore,
fern spore, fern spore.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.410
SEAN CARROLL: Unlike
pollen, fern spores

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.930
can germinate on
a barren landscape

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.340
devoid of living plants.

00:30:35.607 --> 00:30:37.440
KIRK JOHNSON: We have
a short period of time

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.481
where there's only ferns.

00:30:38.481 --> 00:30:39.600
That's the fern spike.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.090
But after that, there's
about 1 million years of time

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:46.002
where we had the low-diversity,
disaster-recovery flora.

00:30:46.002 --> 00:30:47.460
And after that
first million years,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.126
then things start to
pick back up again.

00:30:49.126 --> 00:30:53.000
We start to see animals coming
back into the landscape.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.670
SEAN CARROLL: In this
new, post-impact world,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.760
a niche that dinosaurs left
was waiting to be filled.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.730
BRIAN TOON: And so the
survivors of this on the land

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.730
were creatures that
lived in holes, birds,

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.120
mice-like creatures,
turtles, frogs, things

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:17.410
that lived in swamps or
rivers, or near the seashore.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.210
SEAN CARROLL: And
compared to dinosaurs,

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.280
they had the advantage of size.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.920
They were small.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.740
KIRK JOHNSON: Small animals
have large population size.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.320
Small animals higher
reproduction rates.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.810
Now, that's not saying that
small animals didn't suffer

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.099
mass death, but enough survive.

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:36.140
And that's the key point.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.070
SEAN CARROLL: In that
million years of recovery,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.870
the small inherited the earth.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.655
It was the beginning
of the age of mammals.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.950
Eventually, larger mammals
dominated the land,

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.730
just as dinosaurs
had done before.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.950
And among them were primitive
primates whose evolution

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:06.130
would lead in a very promising
direction, at least for humans.

00:32:09.195 --> 00:32:11.620
What the asteroid impact
taught us about evolution

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.230
is that it's not always about
survival of the fittest.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.140
Sometimes it's about
survival of the luckiest.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.230
And there's a profound
point there for our species.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.670
Only after the extinction
of the giant reptiles

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:26.590
did mammals flourish including
our primate ancestors.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.930
Without the asteroid,
there'd be no us.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.680
