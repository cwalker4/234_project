00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.920
Although the Clone Troopers of the Republic
were effective in repelling and even advancing

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.339
against the overwhelming forces of the Separatist
droid armies during the clone wars, their

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.579
ability to serve on the frontlines was very
time constrained due to their accelerated

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.690
aging.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.609
Most surviving clones were gradually forced
into retirement following the creation of

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.539
the Galactic Empire, with nearly all of them
slowly and quietly dying off in the background

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.469
as their age overtook them.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.180
But who were the oldest and last surviving
Jango Fett clones that we know of?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.560
First in Canon, we have 2 clones that we know
for sure lived long enough past even the events

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.250
of Return of the Jedi, which took place 23
years after the Clone Wars.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.970
First is Rex, who originally was the Captain
of the 501st Legion before he deserted following

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.920
Order 66 and his escape with former Jedi Padawan
Ahsoka Tano.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.450
At some point he met up with Greger and Wolffe,
and they together lived inside an old AT-TE

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.569
walker on the planet Seelos for about the
next 15 years.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.770
Over these years Rex’s accelerated aging
takes its toll by giving him bright white

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.020
grandpa hair and perhaps even baldness, but
nonetheless Rex was still capable enough to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.390
endure and fight on the frontlines after he
joined the Rebel Alliance’s fight against

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.450
the Empire.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.420
We know that he survived at least till the
Battle of Endor and was a commander during

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.760
the ground attack, with most likely being
the Human soldier with a similar looking beard.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.109
The other clone is actually Kix, who served
as a medic for the 501st Legion.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.860
Nearing the end of the war, Kix discovered
the Sith Plot to destroy the Jedi after privately

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.920
investigating into Tup’s actions after he
randomly executed a Jedi mid battle.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.700
Dooku caught wind of this and ended up sending
droids to capture Kix before he could tell

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.660
anyone in the Republic about his discoveries.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.860
As he was captured Kix was placed inside a
stasis pod.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.170
The Separatist transport that was carrying
him was later attacked by Republic forces

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.319
and it was forced to make a random hyperspace
jump, which caused it to crash on a remote

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.340
planet.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.420
Still inside the stasis pod upon the crash,
Kix would remain completely frozen for the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.790
next 50 or so years until he would be released
upon being uncovered by a pirate crew that

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.150
was led by Sidon Ithano.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.040
After regaining his full coherence and being
brought up to speed with galactic events of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.310
the past half decade, Kix ended up joining
the pirate crew.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.000
He is the only known Jango Fett clone to still
be alive at that point.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.450
In Legends, we also have two clones who were
known for surviving a very long time, their

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.700
names being Able and Jaing Skirata.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.480
Able was a regular Clone infantryman who served
under Shaak Ti during the war.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.010
During one of his missions, he was shot down
and was eventually left stranded on an uninhabited

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.480
planet after his comrades were killed around
him in battle.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.830
With no way of contacting the outside galaxy,
he was forced to survive on his own for the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.250
next 20 years.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.379
It wouldn’t be until after the Battle of
Yavin, that he would finally make contact

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.379
with other people.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.299
A skirmish between the Rebels and the Empire
took place on his planet near his campsite.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.209
Believing the stormtroopers to be clones in
new armor, he ran to them in his phase 1 armor.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.360
But the Imperial Officer leading the attack
believed him to be a rebel trick, so he ordered

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.599
his men to fire upon the clone.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.480
Able escaped the blaster fire from the Imperials,
but was left confused with why they would

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.549
attack him.

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.849
He eventually ran into Luke Skywalker and
another Rebel.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.190
Initially puzzled at what was happening around
him, Luke and his friend explained to the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.790
clone of what had transpired in the galaxy
in the past 20 years.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.959
They told him of the Jedi’s fall and the
rise of the Empire, whom were the very enemy

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.989
they were fighting at this very moment.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.340
Luke then showed the clone that he was a Jedi,
just like one Able fought under during the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.530
clone wars.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.260
This prompted the clone to join them and help
the rebels escape the planet from the Empire.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.830
After successfully escaping, Able decided
to join the Rebel Alliance and to work within

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.690
the Alliance Intelligence Core.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.479
He later became a SpecOps Marine for the Rebels,
and he continued to fight against the Empire

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.229
for about a few months before meeting his
end by a horde of Rakghoul when he accompanied

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.220
Luke Skywalker to an unidentified moon and
confronted the unstable ancient Jedi Celeste

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.490
Morne.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.330
Jaing Skirata on the other hand was one of
the first Jango Fett clones created, but due

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.970
to his high signs of independent thought,
he and his brothers were almost terminated

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.150
until a Mandalorian trainer by the name Kal
Skirata stepped in and saved them from death.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.370
Jaing became a Null-class Advanced Recon commando
and would ultimately desert the Clone Army

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.060
and became a mandalorian following Order 66.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.680
He and his brothers would all be adopted by
Kal Skirata as they joined his clan.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.560
He and his clan would go on to provide a safe
haven to some Jedi survivors and later discover

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.110
research that allowed them to reverse engineer
the accelerated aging process so they could

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.340
age normally.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.699
This allowed them to live normal lives and
not be worried about their bodies deteriorating

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.850
at twice the rate.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.020
Jaing Skirata was still alive 40 years after
the battle of Yavin putting him in his seventies.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.449
It’s unknown if his brothers were still
alive, but at that point Jaing didn’t seem

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.550
like he was up to much and his only noteworthy
action was helping heal Boba Fett and later

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.889
attend a Mandalorian wedding.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.919
Speaking of which, we also have Boba Fett
who also was a clone of Jango, though he didn’t

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.000
undergo any of the special modifications as
the rest of them.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.210
Although many believed he met his end after
falling into the Sarlacc Pit, he actually

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.900
was able to escape due to his Mandalorian
armor and was able to fully recover before

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.530
getting back into the bounty hunting business.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.580
Boba has had no official death date in Legends,
but was noted for still being an active Bounty

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.740
Hunter as late as 44 years after Yavin, which
would put him in his mid seventies.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.330
Before we end the video we want to give a
shoutout to Robert Shane for letting us use

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.160
his artwork for the video.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.520
Be sure to check out his deviantart page as
he creates a ton of stellar star wars artwork.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:38.650
