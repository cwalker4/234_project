🎵

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.120
👏..  Clapping  ...

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.400
Here we are again, good evening to you in beautiful gorgeous summer night in New York and here,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.500
this place is full of people who wanna talk about holograms and wao...

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.500
Yeah World Science Festival so grate, my name is john Hockenberry

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.000
first of all I am college drop out, new guy who is gonna hang out with nobel physicists tonight, perfect for this job

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.680
Oh my god... how did I get here!

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.300
But seriously,  you know we think of, this season is World Science festival, this the beginning of June

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
the weather stars to get great, you know tonight at Brooklyn Bridge Park

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.000
its supposed to be  one of best viewing nights in Newyork and there aren't  many really fabulous

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
viewing nights in Newyork, so I urge you to do that, I mean its a beautiful clear night

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.020
Every body is out there, its kind of like prom season, we think of the world science festival as the prom

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.480
for all the scientist who; may be they didn't get any dates; didn't know there was a prom and I actually

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.920
pulled our panel tonight, three clearly did not go to the prom; didn't want to talk about it and one

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.880
didn't remember at all, you may be able to figure out who is who tonight.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.560
I am actually perfect for this gig for another reason because I actually inadvertently helped to solve

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.520
one of the most serious problems in Physics, back in the 1970s. I was on a team that helped to do that,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.060
I was enrolled in University of Chicago, as an  undergraduate and I tested into the top science section

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.980
basically junior of science in my freshman year, and it was taught by a prerogative; David Triumph, one of the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.640
nobel orated university of Chicago, the late David Triumph brilliant physicist  and part of the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.400
university of Chicago program which give us Enrico Fermi and so many others and Chandra shekhar and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.640
I was in this program and very excited, I go to the first lecture and it was taught by one of these prerogative

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.540
central European fellow,  I can't remember his name now and it will become clear why; He said!

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.320
Hello everyone, its great to see all of you here, we have very serious problem in Physics, the problem is:

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.060
Simple problem but serious problem, "it is too many physicists"

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.020
So in this course if you are getting B/B- you will get F. If you are doing B+/A, you will get A.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.460
I went into the news business and thereby helped to solve the very serious problem in Physics.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.460
👏..  Clapping  ...  to many Physicists so

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.820
and a lot of the panelists tonight possibly grateful for that, so you are here to talk about and to listen to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:22.100
one of the most exciting, fascinating also difficult principals that now being kicked around in physics

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.560
and cosmology, the holographic effect and it evolves a couple of concepts that actually we have a lot of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.560
intuitive; sort of sense of and I want to present two of those tonight before we introduce the panel and get

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:44.020
started here. One is the idea of information, we think we know what information is right?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:54.540
Information is very very; like you know information right? Now that isn't the Newyork subway system right?

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.700
But it is enough information to specify; how to get from point A to point B and if you understand how to read

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:10.220
the subway map, you can get from point A to point B. The information isn't exactly the same as the subway

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.420
but if you don't have the information the subway is useless to you and some how its sort of maps directly,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.980
it is a map right? Its maps directly on to the subway and of-course now  the subway map,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.260
nobody has one of these right? its all on your smartphone, which means its stored on a tiny piece of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.500
silicon, so therefore the volume of this (hard copy) can actually be map directly to a volume, you know

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.740
one millionth the size, take for example this (book) anybody got these anymore, no? This specifies the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.840
number of synonyms, I don't know what the hell it actually is but it is the source and it actually also

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:04.080
fit in a tiny piece of code in Microsoft word. We got here just the Oxford shorter English dictionary, information

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.140
I am gonna set over here just to remind you what information is all about, now information,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.720
The dictionary isn't the English language right? the space, the universe of the English language is all you

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.220
people talking, will you talk now, just talk, just turn your neighbor and say hello, how you doing? right there see?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.020
That is the space, the universe of English language that you are hearing it is not the same as this book

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.940
but its sort of maps on to this book and there is enough information in this book to make predictions about

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.040
what it is you saying so that if you actually talk to me I know what the hell it is that you saying.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.940
Unfortunately;  I probably won't know what the hell there is most of the panelists are saying tonight so I may need

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.760
you help with that. Nevertheless there is information in what they say, the information maps on

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.760
to a space where we can make predictions, it is information that allows us to be conscious being

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.640
it is information that allows us to be living being if you think of DNA's information now the information

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.340
we are gonna talk about tonight is much more complicated but the idea of information as a map

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.100
as a specification of a much bigger space it is sort of the beginnings of we are talking about here.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.020
You know these holograms right? you know; clap if you know what a hologram is 👏..  Clapping  ... right.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.480
I just said: clap if you think, you know what a hologram is.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:47.360
Let me introduce our panel please welcome Raphael Bousso 👏..  Clapping  ... 🎵

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.720
Let me tell you few things about Raphael, Raphael Bousso is a theoretical physicists at

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.200
University of California Berkeley. He is recognized for discovering the general relation between curved

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:03.040
geometry  of space time and its information content, a key idea of the holographic principle.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:14.800
Please welcome next panelist: Herman Verlinde 👏..  Clapping  ... 🎵

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.180
Herman Verlinde is Physics professor at Princeton university, in 1998 Verlinde recieved his PhD

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.160
under the supervision of Gerard 't Hooft, Verlinde is renowned for his contribution to string theory

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.160
and its application in cosmology, blackhole Physics, some of its current work explores gravity

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.220
in context of the holographic principle.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:51.360
Our next panelist is indeed Nobel prize winner Gerard 't Hooft  👏..  Clapping  ... 🎵

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.420
Gerard 't Hooft received the 1999 Nobel prize in Physics for his doctorate work in theoretical Physics

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.980
He is professor of Physics and of his many achievements, he was the first to propose the idea

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.080
that would later become known as the Holographic principle.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:19.680
And finally our fourth panelist Leonard Susskind 👏..  Clapping  ... 🎵

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.380
Professor Susskind is Professor of theoretical Physics at Stanford University and the first to give a more precise

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.540
interpretation of the holographic principal using string theory. He is well known for his book on the topic of

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:36.400
the Holographic principle, the black hole war might battle with  Stephen Hawking to make the world safer

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.800
for quantum mechanics. Its a fantastic book. I highly recommend it.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.680
Please welcome the Panel. 👏..  Clapping  ...

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:51.980
Back in early 1970s Stephen Hawking wrote down a astonishing equation, it would include relativity

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:58.220
it would include quantum mechanics and it would include information, Hawking rather simple equation

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.020
brought us a step closer to understanding the relationship between quantum Physics and black holes

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:14.980
When an object crosses over the edge of a blackhole's event horizon, the object enters a realm basically

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.000
of empty space of darkness and continues to be dragged toward the center of blackhole,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.200
toward we call the singularity where it gets crushed out of existence.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.080
Every object in some sense contains information, because it contains a very specific arrangement

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:37.160
of particle so where is the information that describes the arrangement of those particles, where does it go?

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:46.140
Hawking's description of this process was that; the energy remains but the information disapears

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:54.500
For many years, for decades people wondered; is Hawking right? Is the information obliterates

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.260
and disappear  from the universe or is it still there and perhaps can be, in some way retrieved?

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.660
the destruction of information was counter-intuitive and didn't match the rest of the things we knew

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.940
in all part of Physics we have situation where information doesn't get destroyed so it was a bit puzzling

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.980
This debate furiously went back and forth up through the 80s and into the 90s when people

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:31.440
finally began to articulate, this new principal, this holographic principle and what it said is that

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.400
all the things that were falling inside the blackhole were somehow captured in a preserved image

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.780
at the horizon itself. So if the information is not lost  on the surface, the information is lost inside because

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.900
they are equivalent. All the information about those objects, what they were like, in their three dimensional

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.560
existence was preserved or encoded on the surface of the blackhole and that is little bit like a hologram

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:06.140
well that suggest that may be that idea, may apply more broadly to the universe as a hole, may be the three

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.140
dimensional objects, us, everything in the world around us, may be all of the information in these objects

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.940
is carried, is smeared around a distant two dimensional surface that surround us and we are just, in some sense,

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.460
holographic projection of that distant data.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:30.600
The holographic principle tells us some thing quite astonishing, it says the ideas of volume,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.120
that real world in some sense might be a kind of illusion.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:48.300
So, are we real or we just holograms. Lets begin with that but in fact lets first of all remind folks

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.500
You guys were direct participants in that argument that was described in that film which I think fairly

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:59.760
characterizes difficulty scientists have, not only in sort of grasping and fully understanding this

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.580
holographic effect principle but also explaining it.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:09.260
Leonard Susskind! what was it like to get into essentially a pretty big cosmological argument

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:17.000
with Stephen Hawking, and be careful because Hawking is one of the my wheel chair boys and we are really tied

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.800
What was it like; it was fun and it was frustrating and it was incredibly frustrating

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:39.340
Stephen has a view which was very very difficult to argue with. His idea was based on very very sensible ideas

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.040
a blackhole is a place where nothing can get out of but things can fall into it and the things can fall into it

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.820
and they can't get out, they are gone but then the blackhole evaporates. Stephen had proven that beyond

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:58.080
any body's doubts  and so things fall into the blackhole, they can't get out, the blackhole evaporates,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:06.740
puff its gone. Just exactly as Brian said. It was unassailable, there was no way for argue the case

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:15.300
and yet some of us particularly Gerard't and myself very very strongly felt that this really undermine everything

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:22.160
that we knew about Physics. Everything that we know about Physics today and even much earlier was based

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.460
on principle of Physics which is so basic that we sometime forget to mention it to our students

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:35.440
Its the idea that information never disappear, and I will tell you what it means, information means distinctions

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:43.760
distinctions between things, Hydrogen atom is not the Oxygen atom and Oxygen atom is not Hydrogen atom

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.600
there are distinctions between these things and there was a very very basic principle of Physics that

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.520
distinctions never disappear. That they may get scrambled, that they may get mixed up

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:02.460
but if you start with one configuration and you let it go or you start with a different configuration

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.640
which has different information and you let it go, they will stay different and Stephen was saying

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:13.120
exactly the opposite, no matter what you throw in the blackhole and in the end you get out exactly the same

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:19.800
thing. It was extremely difficult to see what was wrong with what he was saying, it was even harder to

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.600
make him understand that there have to be something wrong with what he was saying so it was very

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:32.800
very frustrating but at the same time it was very exhilarating to come up against this

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:41.620
basic problem of conflict of principles. And if anything can break the impasses in Physics if there are

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.740
no experiments available, its conflict of principle. When conflicts of principle arise

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.620
that's when major new paradigm can shift.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.360
And that is excitement, that's really the excitement.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:15:03.080
Gerard't explain to me why this problem with Hawking, this; you know the information can't go away as it seems

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.620
as though Hawking mathematics suggest it does? its different from, something like say, conservation of

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.700
mass and energy, where mater can neither be created nor destroyed. Its different than that right?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:22.820
Yes it was a very fundamental problem, and way I always saw it is; Hawking was using quantum mechanics

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:33.140
in particular quantized fields to derive his result. So quantum mechanics went in as starting point number 1

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.780
and than general relativity and everything else, and use of that to derive the blackholes radiate particles

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:44.320
from that it was derived that it was information and there was information disappearing.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:52.900
Well in fact information disappearance is at odds with quantum theory itself. So he used quantum theory

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.760
to derive result which basically was at odds with quantum theory, so there had to be

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:05.400
a mistake some where. I shouldn't call it "mistake" because what he did was by itself mathematically

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:15.060
correct and nobody doubts that but the final result had something in it that couldn't be true so this is what,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:22.140
in Physics we call paradox. And like my friend Leonard has been saying as soon as we encounter a situation of

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:28.220
this sort in physical world we were very happy actually. It is a paradox it means there is work for us to do

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:34.880
and we have to clear things up. And if you look at the past, you know quite well that when people start to

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.560
clear up paradoxes, new discoveries are being made.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.200
So you guys are friends?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.140
So it seems in several cases and that's why we also excited about this thing. Is something wrong?

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.640
Derivation itself seems to be flawless but there is some thing wrong anyhow with the result.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.060
You guys are friends then?

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.080
Of course we are. Yeah.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.020
Herman! Let me ask you a question just about this issue of information and then I want you to go back.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:05.140
I definitely want you to go back. Why does the universe need information. Why does it need to have

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.260
this information. why does a rock need some sort of information or image?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:16.980
what you call information, we as physicists would just write such terms in equations right.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:22.720
We think of physical world as been driven by mathematical formulas, in these formulas that have

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.440
what we call; degrees of freedom. So things can be this that or that. Oxygen or Hydrogen he given us example.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.920
All these things gone as equations and we are used, particularly in quantum mechanics to the situation that

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:44.800
If two things start up differently, they end up differently, that's a fundamental notion in quantum theory.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.320
We can't get around it. you can't have two different states adding up after a while to be the same.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:56.020
That's violates the principles of quantum mechanics. Now quantum mechanics itself is

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.980
not such a sacred theory that may be avoid violations of it, but then we want to know about this.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.460
We just don't want to say, well you know, we have to clear that mess up later. No no the mess has to

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:11.780
be cleared up right now. If there is a flaw  of this sort in a result, we want to know about it.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.580
So what Hawking was saying; two different blackhole start out differently and one of them has tea pod falling

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:24.980
into it, in other an old shoe. I saw this movie and if tea pod falls into a blackhole or a old shoe falls

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.740
into blackhole, that's different, tea pod is not the same thing as the shoe. Nevertheless after a while

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:37.420
they look exactly the same according to Hawking. You see that violates our equations that can not be true.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.640
There is something wrong, something went wrong on the way and we want to know what it is.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:48.020
Thanks to referring to that, because I can't tell you how hard it was to get the tea pod into the blackhole and then to get the shoe

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.980
I realize it.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.540
Sometime we just get the tea pod, we said get rid of shoe too, and that was really hard. Yeah Herman please

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:59.260
Ok, Let me first follow on the, sort of the, because you were asking how was it to have a debate with Hawking,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:04.940
that was kind of you question, may be tell a little anecdote about how it was, in part of it, of course

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:15.380
all about science and we are all friends, even if we disagree about the science. But Hawking is very spacial

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:23.120
person where he can think very deeply about questions but he also has handicap. He can not speak so he has to

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.200
speak by typing words and some times the debate would go like this and then even argument

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.280
would be given and then Hawking response would be one word - rubbish -

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.240
- Very hard to argue with- 
and that's very hard to argue with

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.320
and you know, when I say rubbish no body pays attention you know

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:55.940
But when Hawking says "rubbish", its silent and you lost the argument at that point. Capital R, its a big Font there

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.000
Yeah right. When Hawking says it. Alright so Hawking says rubbish to you, do you like go home

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.240
and tell your wife; Hawking said rubbish to me, what do I do or you like to the blackboard

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.300
or just sit down to computer?  what happens?
You go on with because you believe in your argument.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:17.700
The other question about information, the thing which I like sort of as a way of explaining what information is;

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:25.000
we live right now in the age of information this is the information age but the type of information

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.460
we are talking about here, you say, well its more complicated but one way of imagining what kind of

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:38.520
information we talking about is; I like the movie "The Matrix" where there is virtual reality where actually kind

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:45.920
of nightmares for myself when I was young. What if the whole world is just a thing that's been projected on my

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.200
brain or actually for all of us that are sitting here in this room, and who knows might be its just a computer

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:58.160
that makes us believe that we are real and the kind of information that we are talking about is really sort of

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:05.980
what is inside of this computer, imagine you make this hall here with all the reality of being able to do

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.240
experiments. Things fall, you collide things, things happens exactly the way we thought and think about

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:18.400
its happening in Physics. But its all just zeros and ones and a computer. And in principle you can quantify;

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.000
how many terabytes, how many gigabytes, how many, I am not sure, I forgot what comes after gigabytes

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:28.200
but there is information in that computer and that's the kind of information  we currently talking about.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.680
So when you say information, you say that physicist   believe and cosmologist believe that it is possible

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:45.200
to map every aspect of reality that we are experiencing here into some sort of stored code that specifies

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.800
preciously everything that is happening here, what people smell like, who is mad at who, who is wearing

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.960
like  dirty shoes and what they are even thinking about.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.740
You can imagine that's the way it goes.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:08.700
Now just its something scientist or imagining it or does quantum mechanics insist that there must be so?

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.720
Raphael!

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:16.800
Quantum mechanics in a way  is based on information. its a theory of information.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.980
The way that we would describe the world and if the room being full of people or no full of people

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:32.820
and electron being in this place or that place. These are different states as we call them and its; as if; you know,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.820
you put one letter on the page or you put a different letter on the page because its different, it conveys information.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:44.800
So where a particle is a way of conveying information and in fact quite literally when we right some thing on

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:51.280
a page we put particles in particular places and we thereby convey information so its not very efficient

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.520
compared to, 
Lets explore that for a moment, Victoria do you have Rapheal's slides.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.360
Put up his first slide over here because as someone who understand mathematics poorly,

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.920
The understanding that I had was that; as you go, say you are looking at the coast line of Massachusetts

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:16.900
and you are looking at it from a satellite and you see one line, but then you come closer and then you begin

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.940
to trace every little indentation and then you get even closer and you trace even any more indentation,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:28.680
try to specify down to the atomic level that the amount of information in the line that traces the coast line

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.680
is actually unbounded and infinite. What is it that you have discovered?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.680
Well that is not, its not infinite, there is a limit.
- And so how does this, how did we begin with this picture here.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.620
I think there is very important thing that maybe we need to say in order to get from blackholes to this - Sure -

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:51.860
I was actually not part of this debate with Hawking, I became his student two years later but

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.840
You look younger as a result, I think
As a result, yes

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.700
its certainly age these gentleman here - so I -

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.280
its recently the reason we are ordered this way, we came in we figured Rapheal could walk the furthest and

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:15.000
We decided, we are gonna leave you here when we -

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.940
And Hawking could be here, you see, got me so 
Yeah he was here last year

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:29.900
Anyway so these gentleman had, you know the crazy insight that when information is dropped into

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.660
a blackhole, it is not in fact lost
Even though naively you would just think ok

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:39.160
now its in this blackhole its somewhere when we can get to it. They insisted that you still have to be able to get to it.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.280
Which. you know, let me make this tell them so easy, but it wasn't that obvious. it was an incredible intuition

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:51.680
And for that to be true, that, if you throw a phone book into a blackhole that later on you can figure out

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.800
whether it was the Newyork or Chicago phonebook. Two amazing thing have to be happen.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:04.180
First of all Hawking have to be wrong about the idea that, no matter what you throw into the blackhole,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:09.880
same thing come out. very loosely of putting what he said but that's the basic way information would be lost.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:16.440
A second amazing thing had to happen, which is, you know, it takes a long time for a blackhole to fizzle away

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.860
and disappear and return potentially, return information to you, supposing Hawking is wrong. And in mean time

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:27.800
you got this big flat blackhole sitting there. And what had to be true was that, while that big flat blackhole

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:34.460
sitting there, that blackhole itself contain information while its still sitting there and hasn't fizzled away yet.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.700
Alright, so the question-
And for that to be true, there had to be a limit on

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.920
how much information there could possibly be in the region that was occupied by the blackhole.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.140
Because you can presumably always convert that region into a blackhole.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:55.000
Alright, so lets backup for a second, so Hawking suggest that the information is gone. You say that can't

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:01.160
possibly be true, Hawking says -rubbish-  and then you go about saying: we are gonna find

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.360
where that information actually is.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:13.180
Leonard! before we get to Rapheal's slide here, where did you find or where did we find that information,

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.720
that Hawking says is gone in the blackhole is actually stored?

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:25.600
Ok so, one of the things that we found is, I am sorry to say this John but turned out to be a bad question

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:34.960
Ok, That in a certain bit of information don't necessarily have locations or at least they don't necessarily have

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.080
locations which are objective and same for every body, no matter how they are moving.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.040
Ok, I am all about that questions

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.660
The notion of a bit of information is a good one, we believe it, we believe distinctions exists

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:56.940
and distinctions persists. But the notion of where that bit of information is located turned out not to be a good

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.680
what a physicist would call,  invariant question. It might depend on who was looking at it.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.600
Now let me give you an example of where it is a good idea.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:13.140
If an atom decays inside the sun, everybody will agree it happened inside the sun, it doesn't matter if you are

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:19.540
moving relative to the sun,  it doesn't matter if you are far away, if you are nearby. Everybody will agree if they do

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:26.240
the calculation, and see what comes out and agree, the atom decayed inside the sun, the thing happened inside the sun.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:33.800
Blackholes are different and what we found is the whole notion of whether something happens inside

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:40.840
the blackhole or it happens just above the surface of blackhole, surface means in the horizon, is a question

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.880
which is observer dependent. Somebody who falls into the blackhole may have all of the experiences of seeing

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:54.620
the event happen well in past the horizon. Somebody standing outside the blackhole will reconstruct

00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:01.100
out of the Hawking radiation that, that event actually happened outside of the blackhole. So the answer to

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.860
your question is; we didn't find out where the information was, we found out that it was a improper question

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.820
The bits of information don't really have locations of that sense.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.760
And how do you know that they weren't destroyed if you couldn't find them in any particular location.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.980
Well, eventually a lot of the power of string theory and other mathematics came to bear on it and confirmed

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:34.640
that there was no expectation that would be destroyed. But as; can I call you Gerard't, its so much easier.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:42.480
Ok, as my friend Gerard't here says,  I spent years learning to say Gerard't; but I never-mind.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.300
I am totally fine with Gerard't, totally fine with it.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:59.780
God I am 71 years old and I forgot what I was gonna say
You were saying that issue was where it was

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:08.240
and the in-variance of the question meant that, the variance of my question meant that you wanted

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.140
to basically change the nature of inquiry.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:19.900
yeah you asked me, how we know and, I think the answer was given by Gerard't that, so much would break

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:25.440
down in Physics the whole structure  of everything we know about Physics would breakdown and disintegrate

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:34.600
if even you open a door for tiny little bit for the idea of information to be lost. Once it can be lost, you can

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:40.340
promote that and make it worst and worst and worst and worst and eventually the whole structure of Physics,

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.700
as we know it, will breakdown. There was somethings you can't have a little bit of, You either have it

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:52.600
or you don't, you know, we all know about pregnancy,  but let me give you another example. In mathematics

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.600
can you have a theory, a theory which means of mathematical structure, arithmetic or what ever.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:04.520
Can you have a theory which is approximately consistent, its almost completely consistent,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:12.480
well you might have some structures some set of axioms and you derive, you let your computer run

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:19.680
and derive ten thousand of theorems from it and say all approximately consistent, only four of them

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.640
were inconsistent with each other. 
Well no, mathematician will come and tell you,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:31.980
once you have any inconsistency, you can use that inconsistency to promote that, anything is inconsistent

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:37.180
with everything else basically.
I think the same thing was true about information lost

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:45.420
once you have it, once you have  it in any form at all, you can imagine situation where it would undermine

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.960
basically all of Physics.
And that's what, I think, that's what Gerard't thought,

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.820
that's what I thought and that's what Stephen didn't think

00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:00.760
So we sort of battled heads against the wall for a while.
Alright, so how in my imperfect questions creating way,

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:10.620
can we get to the point of either, if not, where was the information, how did we learned conclusively that it

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:18.680
wasn't destroyed and that if, the phone book went into the singularity that there was a way to find out

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:24.040
if it was Chicago, or Amsterdam or you know, Seattle

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:30.820
When ever I encounter situation like this I try to approach  it from all possible angels

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:37.440
Particularly angels of my neighbors here will not be prepared to look at, to see what can we do,

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:45.940
we have as I said a paradox here and the resolution must come from totally different point of view then previously.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.600
Now one thing was that quantum mechanics was used to derived the result, quantum mechanics some how

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:59.640
failed to agree with, by far so there was something wrong so my attitude was start from other end,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.680
now lets assume that blackhole, as  a hole,  agrees with anything we know about quantum mechanics.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:12.080
That mean information in is equal to information out. Its that simple basically in quantum mechanical sense

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:20.700
so that ought to be true. As soon as you believe that this is true, its a  relatively simple calculation to find

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.720
how much information there is in the blackhole. And you do the calculation, you find the amount of information

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:34.600
in the blackhole is exactly equal to its surface area. Its like putting bits and bytes of the computer memory

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:41.820
on the surface, every bit, every byte of information occupies very precise amount of surface which is then

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:47.240
calculated relatively easily and that tells you big blackholes contains a lot of information,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:54.960
small ones contains a little information, still enormous amount in any absolute sense. That was very clear

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.720
conclusion; how much information there is in the blackhole.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.320
But the question; where the information is something else again.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:11.600
Alright, let me guess; just backup here, so all you got , if you got your blackhole to study, at least not to find

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:21.780
where the information is but to figure out if there is a quantity of information that could sufficient to specify;

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.020
what goes on in this blackhole. You got your surface

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.480
Not the sufficient; exact quantity itself
Exact Ok

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.100
there is a few bits hanging around aside but apart from that,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.720
the total quantity of information is very preciously calculable.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:43.700
But all you got is the surface of blackhole, so you got a test; could there be enough information on the surface

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:51.660
to specify what gone into the singularity and what is happening beyond this event horizon, that's the question right.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:57.680
Well the question was answered by this assumption that blackhole should obey quantum mechanics

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.120
once you made that assumption, you find that not only information seems to went in and out of the blackhole

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.740
but every thing in its vicinity should be mapped onto its surface in bits and bytes.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:15.120
Its like saying that surface is a hologram of the immediate surrounding spacetime.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:24.660
So a X dimensional object can specify an X+1 dimensional object.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:31.120
Are you getting in this here, is this working for you? We are cool right, alright alright good, you are all with us. Ok

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.460
So the surface is two dimensional
-Surface is two dimensional

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.520
But surround spacetime three dimensional
-Which is exactly what a hologram does

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.480
You got your two dimensional star wars movie and your three dimensional looking princess leia who by the way,

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:52.580
did have prom date, I believe, and so but is that an allusion, you know in prospective, its basically,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:59.880
you creating an allusion or is it actually one to one mapping of all the information of the reality

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.820
on to the 2D surface that gives you, your 3D reality? 
Herman!

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:10.420
Yeah, again talking about mapping; then we don't know exactly works at this point.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:17.680
But I would say that the principle that turns out to be very powerful int his context, I call it Rumsfeld principle,

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:26.180
and its basically saying well; its better to deal with known unknowns then with unknown unknowns.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.440
He was bad at all of them by the way, yeah right.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:38.860
So the unknown unknowns are stuff that you lose and you don't know that you have lost it.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:45.380
If you throw something in a blackhole for all practical purposes, you have lost it, you have lost the information

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.000
But what we are talking about exactly that, we know that we lost it, again, I don't remember what I ate for

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.460
breakfast yesterday but I knew I had breakfast, so at least I know how much information I have lost

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:06.340
by having a bad memory and so the fact that we quantify, how much information is in the blackhole and

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:14.080
that its measured by the area. That turns out to be  surprisingly, the key insight. So knowing how to quantify

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.640
if you don't know is a deep principle.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:25.980
Alright, I think, yeah that's actually starting to work for me, lets forget your slide Rapheal for the moment,

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:34.020
if you don't mind and go to Leonard slide, which really gets us from this idea of; there is a bunch of information

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.780
and its maps into something that we might think of as a three dimensional image

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.600
Victoria can you put Leonard's first slide up; Ok, what is this here?

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:54.020
That's a microscopic picture of the film of a hologram which in fact I made up myself with Microsoft paint,

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:59.520
so its a fake.  But its about what it would look like. its about what if you look through the microscope

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:06.560
at the film, not this thing that is being described by the hologram but by the piece of film itself,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:12.980
it would approximately like that.
And so then if you put light through it in some particular way

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:18.980
Lets us sort this first, Its got some information in in it. Its all scrambled. Its impossibly scrambled you can't look at

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.980
this and see what it is.
Anybody any guesses; what the image is there?

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.620
Anybody want to guess... What?
Leonard Susskind ... good

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:38.780
I think guess down here.  Ok great so
- It is a fake

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.740
Anyone see puppy, Anyone see pup, Little Horsey 
No, no horses. Ok  Alright; lets see

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:49.360
Ok, going through this next one.
-Lets go to next, here is it; stand by folks

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.880
This is another fake, I also drew that myself
Alright - alright

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.440
So if you do the right thing with hologram, namely shine light on it and so forth. It will reconstruct an image.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:06.060
So you got the flash light, may be this is obvious with flash light going through the film and somehow

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:12.800
the information in the film recreates the 3D image of the clown, smoking the segar. Right

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:19.780
But the interesting thing about it is; that the clown is three dimension,you can go behind it, you can see if there is

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.420
hairs on the back of his head, you can go underneath, under the chin and beneath.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:30.540
In fact if this hologram had been made, not with ordinary light but if its been made by NMR scan.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:37.780
You could have coded on that boundary, on that surface you could have the interiors, you could have  all your

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:44.980
guts and blood and everything else bones, the entire full three dimensional structure  would have been mapped.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.580
You used the word "map" and its a good word.
Mapped onto the boundary, on to the film and

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000
the important thing is; not that you shine light to reconstruct it but that the information about the clown

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:03.400
is equally well and in fact in some sense better described, more accurately described, more

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:10.920
preciously described by the little dots and dashes and structures that are entirely scrambled,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:19.340
totally impossible for you to just look at, but its there, its there in that film. Its there and as you say; you can add

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.820
detail to that informational film infinitely or is there an upper limit?

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:33.040
Ok, so in the world that we are talking about which is the real world, there is a limit, no more than one bit,

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:42.380
and that mean + or -, one little dot per Planck area, a Plank area is a certain unit of area that's made up out of

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:50.480
the fundamental constants of nature. Its happens to be about 10^-33 cm on a side. its far smaller than anything

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.280
that Physics studied experimentally. But no more;
Where did it go? disappeared ..

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.740
Blackholes or something like that
- Yeah it went into the blackhole

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:08.520
No more than one bit, that means a black dot or a white dot per Planck area. that's just information

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.700
Alright; lets us just backed up for a second. Just as you need a certain amount of resolution

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:22.180
on a piece of standard film or digital CCD chip to produce an image that's recognizable of your

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:30.380
lovely pets or you kids or something like that. In Physics one bit of information is a traditional bit as though;

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.460
Yes its a yes or no question
-Yes its a yes or no question, so zero one bit,

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.980
yeah zero/one
- is necessary to specify a Plank space which is

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.500
an infinitesimal but measurable little chunk of space.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.980
Beyond our ability to measure it at the present; but yes.
Alright!

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:56.460
And so what it says, I mean in essence what its says; is this entire room; every thing that's in it, can be,

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:03.120
in principle described mathematically in terms of degrees of freedom, structures on the boundaries,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.460
on the walls of the room with never needing more than one bit of information per Planck area.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:14.640
That was very radical, that was very surprising because people always associated information with volume.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.040
We have another picture but; may be one for a round.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.080
Well lets go; No; lets go to; this is the pixel. The pixels in the voxels.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.800
Ok, let do the pixels voxels, lets think two slides
- lets do Vox first

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:31.480
First the  pixels are artisan, alright, obviously a 2D
-Can we jump, can we jump to the other one first

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.600
Alright; we will see the voxels first Ok,
 - Alright!

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:40.460
There is the room, if you like,  there is the room and I am gonna describe the room, everything that's in the room,

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:47.660
like dividing it up into the little tiny cells, lets say no bigger than atom. And what can we ask about a cell?

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.000
We can ask; is their or isn't there an atom in it?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.680
Of course we can ask what type of atom but lets ignore that.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.160
Is their or isn't there an atom in it? and if we don't have to worry about type of an atom,

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.720
that would be a complete description  of everything that's in the room.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:08.520
And so there would be one decision for each Voxel, "Voxel" is a word that means a little cube there would be

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.720
one bit of information per Voxel. Its either empty or its full.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:19.860
Alright; so lets divide up this room in each Plank space.
-I was talking about atoms but yes;

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.900
Oh I forgot; well in each bigger than Plank space we decided to choose; we are asking a question,

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.980
is there an atom in their? and its Yes or No answer  to that, and we will reconstruct the entire space

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:35.060
in information terms in a cube like this.
- Right; and we got some place still around them some

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.640
place just not, I would say probably a lot of Yeses, right?

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.260
No; many more Noes than Yeses; 
-You think?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.520
Oh yeah; room is empty - Yeah its just space mostly empty

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.040
Yeah; room is almost all empty space
- Yeah its always; its noisy, you hear that always but

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:54.200
yeah, anyway Ok, so now that's the 3D, so whats the other picture?

00:42:54.380 --> 00:43:02.740
Well; what we found in essence, is that's too much information, no room can ever have as much information

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:08.140
as is implicit in this picture here. The amount of information that it takes to describe the room

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:14.800
is more like this picture here, one bit of information per surface area.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:21.480
So I like to say that world is "Pixelated" not "Voxelated" 
The world is made up or degrees of freedom

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:27.140
of the the world; most accurate description we can ever have is in terms of the number of degrees of freedom

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:32.680
which is proportional to the area not the volume.
So its actually the reverse of our intuition

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:40.620
and Gerard't, help me out here, so we like to think of gosh; you know, movie are grate but wouldn't it be

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:45.080
fabulous to have IMAX 3D, in fact what Physics says is;

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:52.200
You can get all the information in your 3D High Res reality world on a 2D surface.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:59.240
Let me just; one thing before I wanna let these guys to answer; the only thing is that the two dimensional

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:06.280
description is gonna be monstrously scrambled, very difficult to decode, very difficult to see what's its

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.480
a picture of, That's the cost of coding information in two dimension instead of three.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:23.800
As a mathematician your first reaction will be; there is much less space of a two dimensional surface

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:30.580
in any three dimensional world. So your first reaction is; that can't be right, we will be missing enormous

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.240
amounts of information if we try to put or scram everything on a surface, for that we have to remember;

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.920
this is a Planck length which is extremely small to; for all standards. 10^−33 cm is extremely tiny even

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:51.540
in units of elementary particles. So even this looks at first sight to be very little information,

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.260
actually it is enormous, its gigantic. 
But on other hand we have to realize;

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:03.020
that not only what's in this room could be mapped on a surface but entire universe can be mapped

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:11.760
on the surface, that's even more gigantically crazy because you think that the surface of universe

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.700
would be much smaller than its volume but again this Planck units are so small;

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:23.580
its still have enough information on the surface to specify everything that goes on in universe.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:29.200
Well; I mean its so counter intuitive, I mean every time I go into the hall in town hall, I wonder how all of Newyork

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:35.280
could fit in here. But in fact that's kind of what you are saying. So it is very very counter intuitive.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:43.560
So you come up with these mathematical conclusions that are very robust and sound and you can defend them,

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.580
I mean do you go back; Herman, to Hawking and does he say; sorry about saying rubbish

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.660
or I guess; I was wrong about the rubbish.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:57.920
To his credit; he has thought of changing at least his opinion and he accepts lot of these ideas.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.160
Einstein for example; had much harder time accepting quantum mechanics; I don't think he ever did.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:14.100
But Hawking; I think, he realize at the time when he was putting this paradox forward that by stating

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.700
the contradiction that was in blackhole Physics, he realize that was a way of making progress.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.140
And of course he liked annoying his colleagues which is sort of what he was doing by making

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:35.100
this particular claim. But he put us to work; so and then; by the time that answers came forward, he has;

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:41.420
so he had this bet with one his colleagues that I think it was for a year long subscription to playboy

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.160
but in the end; the colleagues decided to give him a nice book instead.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:57.420
Because the bet was settled, and then Hawking admitted that information was there; so that's it.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:06.720
Well the whole 2D/3D thing if you bring playboy into its a whole that; I know; that's a whole other information space

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.320
- I don't wanna think about it.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:15.260
As a much younger researcher Raphael! what excites you about the holographic principle in terms of;

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:24.120
and we gonna do its controversy in a moment, in terms of; what it begins to explain about other problems in Physics.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:31.160
I thinks what exciting to me is that; the only way that information could possibly not be lost when

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:38.880
a black hole forms and then evaporates; was for there to be a completely universal relation between

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.620
the information content of a region and its surface area, in other words; there was a relation between

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:52.440
surfaces in spacetime which are described by gravity theory, that's the realm of Einstein general relativity;

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:59.220
surfaces surrounding certain regions; those surfaces; their area specify how much information

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:04.200
could be in the region that was enclosed by them. That turned out to be not the quite the right way of

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.880
stating it but that was necessary; if information was not going to be lost in blackholes.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.680
In other words it led to the statement about; how much information there is in the world.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:21.640
That was completely independent of what you was using to encode the information, it didn't matter whether you

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:30.840
used letters on a page or atoms, or strings, or quarks, what ever your favorite Physical ingredient was.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:36.100
It was a statement that was completely universal, if information was preserved then we were learning

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.220
something about fundamentally how much information there is in the world.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:45.600
Even beyond that learning that fundamental
- Let me just; let me say one thing just to put an accord

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:52.300
Its actually not very difficult to understand why this is so; very roughly speaking any place like this room can be

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:59.060
converted by crashing some shells of matter into it, into a blackhole that has the same surface area, as this room,

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:04.240
and we know how much information the blackhole contains. So if information is not lost;

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.940
that's means that information in this room; no matter what was here; had to be less to start with

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:14.880
than the information of the blackhole or it most equally much and so; its completely universal.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.840
You don't have to know what we are made of, You don't have to know what the fundamental bits and pieces

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:23.980
of Physics are, you already know how much information there is. And so its is a deep relation between

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.780
the two things that we don't know how how to put together, Gravity and Quantum mechanics.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.960
Quantum mechanics is about information and gravity is about geometry and surfaces.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:41.960
But is it true or is it a distortion to say; and again for me; for a moment here; the idea of going to the blackhole

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:49.040
Seems to confuse the issue because; the blackhole is interesting; because the way Hawking described it,

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.920
information would be destroyed, that produces the controversy, which create/poses the question alright.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.520
What is the relation ship between the information and all of the universe.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:04.940
That is exactly why it was one of those questions where; you know; people were just asking incredibly interesting

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:10.500
questions and as a consequence of resolving it, stumble upon something which was much more general

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:15.980
and didn't really just holding this particular  context of the blackhole, At the end you can throw the blackhole

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.320
away just left with
Alright! because I don't think most of people in this

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.680
room; you know; encounters with blackholes  are; you know; monthly at best.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:33.520
So lets just say because of the balckhole, thought experiment, controversy, argument with Hawking;

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:43.240
we have stumbled upon or discovered or now see that;  a fundamental feature of the universe is that;

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:50.680
a two dimensional space of information specifies everything in our universe.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:55.480
something like that, it has to that.
Well; initially it was clear; how to apply this

00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:01.740
to the whole universe. Again the context in which it was discovered was a very specific one where;

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.580
you are for away; you throw some elephants into a small region, they form a blackhole and then evaporates.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.000
and you want to ask the question by looking at this Hawking radiation that came up; can I figure out

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.320
if it was elephants or zebras that made the blackhole. Now that was resolved I think by now; pretty definitely.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:24.600
We can look at this; but our universe is nothing like that, our universe is not like the black hole, our universe is

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.020
not a place where you can go far away, and study Hawking radiation coming out.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:34.100
And nevertheless it turned out to be true that; this was just a tip of the iceberg.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:40.180
There is completely universal relation between information and area of surfaces.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:46.940
At first it seems like that can't possibly be true, for example: if you don't take the view point of the person

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:52.140
who waits for the Hawking radiation to fizzle out of the blackhole and then looks carefully at the information

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:57.320
that is in it. Suppose that I fell in with the other things or with the star that was collapsing in,

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:03.160
well that star have some information in it; as its collapsing to form a blackhole.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:11.140
That information can't disappear, we know from solving the Einstein equations that the surface area of the star

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:18.560
become smaller and smaller and smaller until its zero at the very end when it hits the singularity

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:25.020
inside a blackhole. So it seems clear that the amount of information of the star; whatever it is; at some point

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:29.540
its going to become larger than this smaller and  smaller and smaller surface area of the star. It gets more

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:34.260
more compressed deep inside the blackhole. So then this mean that; this was just some fluke at it,

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.480
something that applies to particular; you know; observed who live far outside a blackhole. And there is actually

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.720
no general relation between information and surface areas.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:49.260
Well turns out No, if you state the relation in just the right way then its too even deep inside the blackhole

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:55.000
or in the regions of the universe to the very large, the way you have to state it is actually in much

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.460
more Physical way, as of saying; how much information do I have in this instant of time when my star

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.900
is really small and has very small service area, how much is still inside the star. You have to ask;

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:15.660
well;  if I took a picture of that star at this time, just before its got completely crunch into a singular place

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:24.220
in spacetime. If I took a picture of it how much of the star would I see. And it turns out that

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:30.600
You don't have enough time, the light doesn't have enough time to traversed the whole star

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:36.000
before everything gets crunched into the singularity and the game is over. You have to actually calculate this,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.800
You have to take my word for it right now, but 
- I am taking you word for so much

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:46.820
But the point is; if you ask, what can actual light ray see? How much information can they see?  - Right

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:51.660
light ray that comes out the area in question and it makes absolutely no difference what  area you pick,

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.200
anywhere in the universe, any shape, doesn't even have to be closed.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:54:02.180
What those light ray see is some piece of the star in this particular example, as by some conspiratorial miracle

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.740
its always less information in that piece o the star than the surface area you started from.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.740
Its a much bigger conspiracy of which only a sort of

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.240
tip of the iceberg was discovered in the context of blackhole.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:19.380
Well; its a little bit like uncertainty in the sense that if you try to measure you only gonna get a piece of it

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:26.560
but that doesn't effect the existence of all the information. Its all there, the fact you can't get it

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.840
or don't have big enough camera is your own personal psychological problem,

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.880
It doesn't effect the universe at all

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:38.500
Well; indeed if you wanted to ask how much information is there in the universe than again its actually very

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:44.460
useful that the information is sort of coded on region that are seen by light rays, You can just ask,

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:51.160
well; what is in our past, what is in the region from which light could have reached us up until now,

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:56.200
and that region is bounded by basically the light rays that are just barely making it to you eyes right now,

00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.320
and have been traveling for billions of years since the beginning of the universe. And those light rays;

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:06.600
well; if you follow them back, of course they come from larger and larger region as you follow them back

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:12.020
that's farther and farther away. But at some point there is surface area actually become very small again;

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.840
when you follow them all the way back to the bigbang, because every thing is small at the bigbang.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.220
Universe is basically contracting to the single point at that point.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.280
So there is a largest area which tells you how much information there is in the Universe,

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.940
some where between the bigbang and us, that is span by these light rays.

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.940
So we can see exactly what the maximum amount of information there is.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:39.120
So is it; the case on some level that the function of our senses, I mean as; you know; Galileo looked at light rays

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:47.180
and drew some conclusion about the Universe, are tiny; sort of; instances of the Universe conveying information,

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:53.180
some thing that's much bigger that we are now extrapolating to extreme states of the Universe,

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:58.500
either in terms of the very beginning to time with the bigbang or; the sort of; end of matter in a blackhole,

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.520
that they are part of same story a little bit?

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:07.420
Well, the interesting thing about the holographic principle, I think all of us probably agree on this is that

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:11.580
Its a statement that can be made in a situation where we think we understand Physics very well.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:20.240
The area that describe how much information there is in the Universe that we see, is not an area that lives

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.860
somewhere very close to bigbang where we might not trust our equations. The area that tells us

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.320
how much information there is inside of a blackhole is not an area that's somehow close to the singularity

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.760
inside the blackhole, which we don't understand as well as we would like to.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:38.080
These are areas in region of space time that are arbitrarily well understood. They are completely

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:42.800
harmless. there; you know; Einstien theory implies 
harmless is good -  harmless is always good

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:48.420
I mean; I still wouldn't jump into the blackhole but they are very; you know; well understood.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:54.320
The whole statement takes place in a regime of Physics that we completely understand.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:00.660
But what we don't understand ultimately is why it is true, It seems like a conspiracy. Every time you check

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:08.540
it works out. And I think that by itself; I think; was a huge piece of support for the idea that information isn't lost.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:12.940
All these miracles happen for information not to get lost. It would be funny, if it was at the end

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.440
But you have me do the case
- Funny yeah -  HAHAHA  --  HAHA    -funny -

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:23.080
-Your sense of humor is not useful to find
- Oh I know, yeah Alright, well I love to talk lapses like the next guy but

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:31.360
So Herman! what is the counter argument here, I mean; I got two questions; one is: what is the counter argument

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:39.300
Who persists with the idea that this holographic principle may be fun to talk about but in fact doesn't really help us

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.200
or there is another explanation
I would necessary say that it might be that people have

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:51.940
counter argument but right now you can state it as a principle because we have indications that its there

00:57:52.720 --> 00:58:00.000
but again; its basically still from intuitive point of view its absurd that this would be true

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.200
Because again; if we wanna describe what's going on for sure we going to tell Ok, well some thing is happening

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:11.140
Here at a given time or something is happening there, so essentially the information that you use

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:18.680
to describe things, for sure grows with the volume.
And indeed the equations we are using to describe

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:27.800
physics and it have all those properties.
So right now we don't have a real way of understanding;

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.900
how this is really true, so we know, we have hints that its true

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:38.340
-There is no evidence. No we don't have a mathematical theory that  preciously describe; how it is.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:46.140
We have strong evidence that its true, and I think; sort of early time say; early 90s; where, if you would;

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:52.700
and I think; it was conference in the early 90s where there was a vote, Ok, how many people  were believe in

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:57.900
that the information was lost , and then more than half of the hands went up, and it was very small group of

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:03.840
people that saying; well we don't believe that information is lost and there was only a couple of people

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.140
-and couple of "rubbish" group
And there was yeah the "rubbish" group and then

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:11.800
there was the "OK" group
Right! and now the "rubbish" group is bigger, its almost

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.000
the whole room
- yeah if you call us the "rubbish" group

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.580
-Well, you were then, you were then
Yeah we were called "rubbish" yeah its correct

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.480
and proudly so
-and how; I wanna go back to this information and I

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.740
actually want you to go through those slides that I have seen before, which I think are fascinating but

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:41.380
Gerard't! let me ask you, is information a particle in the sense that its like matter, its information a kin to being

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:49.200
like a electrons, protons, quarks, antimatter. Is it some sort of parallel phenomenon that's goes along with

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.420
reality or just something fundamentally different?

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:58.940
No actually I think its about time that we try to disagree with each other, and

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.200
-No
And so I want to; no you don't

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.620
-Starting to get good
Because I want to bring in a notion which hasn't been

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:13.480
put forward yet.
The question of dynamics; you know when I first saw

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:20.920
people windsurfing, I love to also to go windsurfing, so on one day I thought I am theoretical physicist,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:29.040
I can work out how to stand on the board, how to hold saill without falling over and I worked it all out,

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:35.560
and stood on the board, I could have the sail,  and i didn't fall over and I went any direction I want,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.500
except I only solved the static problem, I didn't solved for what happens if a big wave comes.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:48.320
And what you have to do is you want to make a sudden turn, this I never solved so when ever that happened,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.240
I fell over.
Now here the problem is same, so far we have been

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.220
discussing this static question, what is information, where is it, and so on. You can discuss it at length,

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:07.500
but there is something else in physics, the dynamical question; how things evolve in time and how we phrase

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.540
laws of nature. And new we encountered a deep and fundamental problem.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:20.700
Which is; the world look to us three dimensional, if I make a disturbance here like saying something or

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:28.840
I am shining a light, the disturbance moves with speed of light or slower to its environment and it never goes

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.840
faster than speed of light from here to a point far away in Universe. That is a fundamental three dimensional

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:41.960
property of the world as we know. And it is been tested very very accurately in all branches of Physics

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:48.740
Very fundamental principle, not only that disturbances move with certain maximum speed also causality.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:55.660
That is; when ever you cause some disturbance somewhere it effect never goes faster than

01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:01.660
speed of light and certainly doesn't go back in time
Now this principle we would like to keep

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:07.020
and now holography is standing in our way, its not doing the thing we want.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:14.460
If my friend then here, is right; and information on the two dimensional surface is completely scrambled,

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:20.080
how did you explain; if you made a disturbance here, the disturbance doesn't spread faster than speed of light.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:28.900
How would Leia, when she moves arms in the hologram, how come that these disturbances don't moves faster

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:34.740
than a given speed in her hologram. There's still something basically wrong with the idea.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:39.540
And that be  -Why would they have to move faster than the speed of light to work?

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:46.880
That's relativity theory and relativity theory works extremely well, we don't want to give that up too easily

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:54.780
as a fundamental principle, after all relativity was also a principle that went-ed to Stephen Hawking's derivations

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.240
If you throw it away, you are trowing away blackholes as well.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:06.660
So life isn't that easy, there's a problem here.
So how do we address that and then

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:13.100
I am coming back to quantum mechanics, say well; we use quantum mechanics from the beginning until

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:19.160
the end. There's something not quite right about the quantum mechanics, and I am been thinking a lot

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:27.200
last decades basically about; there must be something underneath quantum mechanics, some more basic

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:34.000
mechanical system that explains why the world that we encounter today looks like quantum mechanical.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:40.380
That could solve this problem.
Because it could be that in a pre-quantum world,

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:45.400
the world is three dimensional.
Information gets lost all the time

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:54.220
In fact a suspicion I have; might practically only one in Universe today that has a suspicion that there's

01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:02.440
underline theory in which information gets lost, to such an extent that if you have a bulk of material somewhere,

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.700
so much information gets lost, that the only thing you can retain is what sits on the surface.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:14.580
And that's the reason why; information wise; you have such a thing as holographic principle.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:20.220
The only amount of information that you can keep; if you have a bucket of water; is what sits on the edge

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.360
of the bucket of water.
Whats happens to be inside will eventually get lost.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:30.420
Not according to quantum theory because we just realized all quantum theory preserves the information

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.280
But it may be a pre-quantum theory in which this information gets lost.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.760
-Now this is it, let me to say
This pre-quantum theory it could be three dimensional

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.820
and then we might possibly find a resolution of this problem.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:51.020
So is pre-quantum theory, something that happened before the bigbang or its pre-quantum theory;

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.340
something that happens before you learned like
 - I mean pre-quantum in a logical sense

01:04:54.380 --> 01:05:01.380
It is that some thing, that some fundamental principle lying underneath, the principle of quantum mechanics

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.800
-I see
Say we have molecules, we have atoms, we have things

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:11.340
smaller than atoms but smaller than that are things which might not be quantum mechanical.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:20.320
That is my premature explanation as how to reconcile the idea that the three dimensional world

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:27.000
seems to be two dimensional by holographic principle, yet there is causality in the three dimensional sense.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.640
This is a problem that has not yet been properly addressed

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:36.160
and I think something should be done about this.
If we dont, we will never

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.120
-Yeah get to work,

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.280
If we dont, right, if  we will never get useful theory 
- forget homelessness guys come on

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.220
powerful enough for the small distances.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:54.060
Well lets; put that to Leonard! is there a possibility of a pre; you know; a more axiomatic kind of pre-quantum

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.720
Its a question of axiomatic
Alright, but then in some sort of more basic state than quantum mechanics

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:04.460
The answer is that; I don't know
What you're seeing here is an interesting thing

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:12.760
First of all I would say that it should be clear that this whole holographic story is the most radical thing

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:20.300
that has happened to our understanding of spacetime, matter. Since the invention of quantum mechanics and relativity

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:28.100
It is really some thing very very different. Where is it going? what it is going to explain? How do we explain it.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:38.820
Well incidentally we all agree largly on what we said up till now and you'll find that Physics in general,

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:44.500
probably in science in general; at any given time there are those things which have been made into established

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:52.640
science, that people agree on and that subset they will tend to agree on unless there's screwballs and outside

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:59.920
the mainstream of the community but then once you go past that, once you go even just a little bit past

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.740
What we really know, you will start finding it becoming a very very human subject, subject with

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:13.540
Lets put it this way, good physicists are as variable as snowflake. Every single one of them is different,

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:22.680
every single one of them has a different prospective and once you go past that point where we have confirmation,

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:28.740
where we do agree. you are going to find that just about everybody has a different view of where its gonna go

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:33.320
Sure, that I can understand but lets focus on the radicalism; for a moment; because I think people can

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.940
understand how relativity radically changed the Newtonian view of reality in the sense that; the

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:46.220
straight lines in the Newtonian world are actually curved in certain spaces and that curvature relates to the force

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:52.240
of gravity in some way and so around stars space actually bends, that's a radical notion.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.700
Its probably only the last thirty years that, that's been internalized to be something that kind of everybody

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:02.000
understand. You can't really appreciate the Matrix, movies like the Matrix, unless you sort of understand

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:09.980
the sort of relativistic world.
How does this notion produce a radical change;

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:16.400
in the way; that we might see relativity
I think it still work in progress and we don't know.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:24.540
Gerard't has his view, I have my view, Herman has his view, whats his name over there, has his view

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:36.660
And but I tell you if you go out it'll come to you.
You go two blocks outside of this room, there's a lot of

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:39.360
people who have no view
 a lot of people who have no view

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:45.160
-Yeah absolutely no view
My own view is not all that different than my colleague

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.740
over here 
Its not that I think this is going to be the some

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.020
deterministic theory that gonna underline quantum mechanics

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:58.360
I think its going to inform how we think about quantum mechanics very deeply and its gonna change

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.080
in an enormously big way that we think about quantum mechanics.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:09.460
That I am sure of, whether it will be the way that, Raphael and I have proposed over the last couple

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.360
of weeks, on the way, that Hooft has proposed for years. Herman has his ideas

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.640
I think that remains to be seen and its a work in progress. I think there'll be progress on it, I think

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.660
when we come back here; may be not next year but five years from now, there'll be more knowledge.

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:34.280
But its very clear; we are on the cutting edge of an and on the cusp of,

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.040
I think a major Paradigm shift; in the way; the world looks

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:43.520
Alright! that's great now, how are we doing, we feeling pretty good about holographic principle and projection

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.700
right? right and we are feeling pretty good about how information is a much more complicated thing than

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.360
may be the concepts from our intuition right?
Ok good, Here's a question that's put you on the spot,

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:02.100
but its relates to your issue of; each of you think differently; the physicist are as different as snowflakes

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:11.920
and hopefully they stick around longer than snowflakes.
If I were  to put a holographic principle T-shirt

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:19.260
on each one of you that specified how each one of you represents a particular sense of whats gonna happen,

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:24.860
what we are gonna discover, what aspects that represent your position. What would your T-shirt say

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.140
I believe in holographic principle and its going to look like blank.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:36.500
I dont know I would like to have something like; I ❤ HP, or something. but that's gonna be on the back.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.380
The front is gonna have to more
To your ticket to quantum gravity on the back,

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.540
-Quantum so
Your ticket to quantum gravity, but why do we

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:49.200
call it a principle.
Like you know; I think the positive spin, the most

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.920
positive spin I can try to put on this and I am being optimistic when I say: this is; compare this to the

01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:00.100
equivalence principle, the equivalence principle  is something that; Einstein recognized; you know; a huge

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:05.860
conspiracy in nature, why do all objects fall at the same rate, you know different particles with different charges

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:11.440
do not get attracted to each other at the same rate but with gravity  for some reason everything

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.240
gets attracted in exactly the same way. Amazing current conspiracy from the point of view of Newtonian theory,

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.740
you just have to put it in by hand, doesn't to redact anything but its just crazy, it needs an explanation

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:28.300
See, elevates this observation to Universal principle, you have to find a theory that makes this obvious to start

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.780
with and that would have to be the quantum gravity because whats involved here is both quantum theory

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:38.520
and general relativity, it would have to be the theory that knows about both so its clearly is a signpost,

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:46.280
may be we need more signposts to find the right answer.
But for You, holographic principle is a first step towards

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:50.960
a theory of quantum gravity that begins to explain what's so frustrating about gravity.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:58.760
Well indeed, what Gerard't just said; tells us why its been so hard, you have to explain, where this holographic

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:04.660
bound on information comes from, while not destroying; what we know about locality.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.940
The fact that I get  to know is this part of the room, something independently

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:13.060
there or I get to move particles around independently seems like you don't have to know whats over there,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:18.320
to do something here. There seems to be a conflict here between holography and

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.560
the way that Physics has worked up until right now.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:26.440
On you T-shirt Herman, what would it say?
I mentioned the movie the Matrix, probably something;

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:40.640
some image like these letters and there's Neo, whats his name; the guy who; he goes and he starts flying with

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:47.460
anti gravity. I think that's pretty good. So let me explain why the Matrix, we talked about sort of things;

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:52.460
not being able to move faster than the speed of light. I think the people that came up with the name of

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.720
the Matrix actually had something pretty good at mind there. Because what is a Matrix; its essentially;

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.880
something that relates something that's here with something that's completely somewhere else;

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:10.080
and so I think indeed; that's sort of the future; at least this development; will be that we start actually with

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:16.260
information. So information is going to be our starting point and space-time is not something we start with.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:24.020
We forget about what space is and what time. And then somehow the information by thinking about; how much

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:30.740
information is; what information is doing then the space-time; what we call be emergent, it will come out of

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:38.220
just a bunch of zeroes and ones. And here is one idea that I think; actually I can put here; just since

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.680
no one is listening and I can just say; what I want
-They're listening; I guarantee you

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:48.640
-There's no non-disclosure thing; so
So we talked about information and I wanna know

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.240
things; by the way; the information tends to do again, it gets lost all the time; actually that's called the second

01:13:54.380 --> 01:14:01.380
law of thermodynamics. The lost information we call it entropy. entropy always increases, chaos  increases

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:08.440
and that's a fact that's true in our Universe and its effect, that's true in other Universes as well.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:14.280
So its very fundamental fact of how things work.
And whats also probably also true that; in other

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.080
Universes is that; things indeed fall if you drop them they'll go down.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:26.560
And it seems those two facts are very closely related. The fact that information gets lost all the time

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:34.320
And the fact that things fall, so I think that's
-lost is different from destroyed?

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:40.060
Lost; when I say lost; indeed its going to be the "known unknown"   -Alright got it

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:50.580
known unknown; the increase in known unknowns; that's responsible for space-time, for curvature of space-time,

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:55.760
for gravity. the facts that things fall.
I mean; what are you suggesting is that; you know; when

01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:03.180
I forgot something, I am instead of just having a kind of pre-senility moment. I am actually participating in a

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.660
grand march of our understanding of the Universe.
Right that's correct

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:15.540
Yeah that's I am loving, I am glad, I came tonight
Gerard't! what would be on you T-shirt or sign that would

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:26.640
suggest where you fall on, and I guess probably the pre-quantum theory, the proto quantum theory that might be

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.600
on you t-shirt. That might be the direction that you would be headed.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:39.060
I will continue to ask nasty questions and say well; you know; you can have this fancy beautiful idea

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:46.160
but remember that fundamental principles on which the original idea was based that you are losing out of sight

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:57.000
and so this was why; I mention causality, the fact of the order of cause and events. That is to me a very primary

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:06.200
law or rule of nature. That every thing that happens here has its origin in the past; that's what we call causality.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:13.380
there's a cause of every thing happening in this world. That's how laws of nature are being formulated.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:20.820
If you don't have that; you can; for instant; go backward in time and you have circular situations in time;

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:26.640
that you can go and kill you grand father if you could move back in time. That's clearly nonsense and then you

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:33.340
get circular argument and you get chaos in laws of  nature themselves. Nature can't solve its own equations

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:38.240
that can not be right we must have the principle of causality

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:46.800
Now this is somewhat at odds with this holographic principle. I don't say to die at odds but add some tangent

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.880
here. And what we want the whole reason why we are doing this, while we making this; all these considerations;

01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.620
is that we want to have a better model, a better theory of what happens in the Physical world

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:08.120
We want to explain why the particles; that you have today; behave as we have seen and studied them

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.300
today and there are many things you understand and many things you don't understand

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:20.000
We have the standard model of elementary particles; its a beautiful rigid scheme of all particles known today

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.460
and it is marvelously precise described by this standard model but there are mysteries in it, which we want to

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:32.380
understand and solve as well. we are very ambitious we've made marvelous theory of nature; its not good

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:40.840
enough. We still know that blanks spot in this theory we want to fill in and this is why we doing this we want to

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.260
find new basic principles to improve our understanding of nature, that's what all of this is about.

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:53.580
But the only way to understand or to improve our understanding of nature is what; asking all sort of nasty questions

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.800
Questions our colleagues rather not ask because they're so confusing.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:06.180
Well, lets ask confusing questions anyway; and see if we can come close to answering them.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:13.700
Any question that has an unexpected answer; might bring us, help us; go forward and make an

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:19.060
improved theory of the world that we live in.
Thats what the real reason is; for this exercise

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:26.520
And I love this idea that possibly one way of thinking about causally and forward branch of time is as a

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:38.700
information state, as a sort of a; an understanding of the march of time, as a set of information that; you know;

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.240
one event leads to another event. 
Its a vision that the Universe is very much like

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:52.220
information processing machine, just like your laptop or another computer. I like to view the nature as a

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:58.840
gigantically big computer that has information going into it and information come out processed.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:05.940
The processors; there are laws of nature.
laws of nature is; say that something happens, some

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.480
particular configuration goes in. Its being rearranged in other combinations of data goes out.

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:20.780
That's how in Physics; traditionally we consider the process of particles touching and scattering at each other.

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:28.740
Two paths come like this; they hit each other and they go of the reaction. That's we call scattering process

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:34.500
is an important way of describing the laws of nature.
What happens when two particles meet, how do they

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:39.660
separate, do they break each other up, do new particles forms, and so on so forth.

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:46.500
So that's a fundamental way of phrasing laws of nature, and that's what we want to understand.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:52.440
-Can I ask you a question on this. so again; if we talk about pre-quantum mechanics, in quantum mechanics;

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.980
we know; that at least one of the foundation of Physics; quantum mechanics has thrown it out of the window.

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:02.560
Because on of the foundations of Physics; was the; if you know what's happening at a certain moment,

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:08.260
what the situation is a certain time, than one step later you would know; what happens next.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:16.620
But in quantum mechanics you have completely identical situation that's a second later would give you

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.520
two different outcomes
-That is right

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:25.840
Is that a principle that you accept or its your pre- quantum mechanics going to be of the type

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.840
where you can connect. 
The principle I accept entirely; within the language of

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:37.400
quantum mechanics, but my suspicion is; its only a suspicion; is if quantum mechanics can not be the entire

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:44.660
story. There's something else happening and you are exactly asking the right question; which is how come;

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:51.500
the two particles reach each other; and in the beginning they were identically same; and then suddenly they must

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:58.780
do either this or it might be that or other particles might come out and all that is described by Matrix. In fact;

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:04.800
in quantum mechanical sense and; but nobody knows how to predict what; which or the possibilities

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:11.920
is actually being realized.That I think is a weak spot in our present understanding of quantum mechanics

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:18.560
Why is it impossible to predict in advance; what will happen and there are numerous examples of this

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:26.160
Which are typical for quantum mechanics and physicist today have learned to ignore the problem. to say;

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:33.340
We solve everything except we cannot always predict exactly what happens. What we can say is that you need

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:39.660
all the possibilities to compute what happens after that, so that's a mysterious feature of quantum mechanics.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:46.600
-And you want to embrace the mystery rather than ignore. Exactly, Ok, they've learned to do that because

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:54.540
it is so successful, it works tremendously well in understanding nature. But it cannot; to my taste;

01:21:54.540 --> 01:22:03.040
it cannot be the entire story. There's something else happening but at a different level of nature and my belief

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:12.160
is the plank scale different from the scale of elementary particles that; that could well be the level at which things

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.960
are fundamentally different. There you have; if two things scatter, they have only one choice to make

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:26.660
not very much. That's the idea of determinism, which people laugh at; when I mention this idea; people just

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:32.280
manage to keep their smile away from their faces but otherwise; you know; as soon as I am away; I am sure

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.920
they are laughing about this idea of determinism.
Well; we can check some of the comments on the

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.440
website later; 
I think it looks crazier dear, but well, its an old idea

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:49.980
its an old idea, and its proven wrong about a million time and; but always they prove wrong; because they're

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.180
making very conservative assumptions and I don't believe those assumptions, so I still think as a way

01:22:55.180 --> 01:23:00.140
-Oh nasty question 
That's very very difficult and its a dispute going on for

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:07.020
years and years, starting all the way back with Einstein and Niels Bohr. All historians of science say Einstein

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:13.420
was wrong Bohr was right, and I believe its not true.
Oh nasty nasty questions fits on a t-shirt of course

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:17.540
Nasty question does fit on a t-shirt, that's good
Leonard! yours?

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:26.500
Well; just to respect to what Gerard't says; I would't bet against what he says, on the other hand; I just can't see;

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:35.360
how it will work, but its those kind of conflicts which get us where we want to go. But my t-shirt; well; if you can't

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.400
say Brooklyn Bouguer Dodgers  I guess I would like at this

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:48.360
The UVIR connection, now the reason I bring that; I say that; is to give me an opportunity to explain something else

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:55.020
To give me 5 more minutes to explain something else which we will probably; all agree about, but which is

01:23:55.020 --> 01:24:00.940
a very bizarre property of; what the nature; at least if the ideas we are talking about are correct.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:08.440
Its not totally surprising that as you try to get more and more and more accurate description of nature;

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.520
its looks more and more scrambled.
To get the best description of nature you have to

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:19.840
account for all the degrees of freedom, and some times it just too much of a good thing; I mean you know;

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:25.860
we know of what happens when you try to have too much information, too much information can lead

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.180
to situation where you're just completely confused because you just live with it,

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:35.600
-would it be like you take or mount a camera over the city of Newyork to put a light on everybody's head

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.080
and over time you specify; where they go. It looks great for about 10 minutes and then its mush

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:49.100
Even taking a sharp snapshot at an instant, too much information will flood you, you know we know; the CIA

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:53.700
gets so much information and them it doesn't know what to do with it and it just get too much.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:25:02.320
Its not too surprising; you know; you'd learn much much less about a body of water with a surface and so forth;

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:09.760
if I gave you a description with a table which just gave you the position and the velocity of every single

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:16.040
molecule. That would be an impossible thing to deal with, so its not totally surprising.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:21.420
Windsurf on that information, yeah
Its not totally surprising that the better you try to do in a

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:24.820
better description, the more scramble that's going to look.

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:30.300
Whats also new here is something very different than the other situations.

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:36.220
In the other situations getting more and more information usually means more and more detail

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:42.140
about smaller and smaller distances.
What I think we now know; is that; at some point that's

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:48.620
going to reverse itself and whats going to happen is when you look in more and more detail, things will start

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:55.760
to look fuzzed out over bigger and bigger distances.
And so in the end, the most perfect the most accurate

01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:02.660
description and the most scrambled description of something is going to be stretched out over the whole

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:11.000
boundary of space. That's called the UVIR connection and what means; UV stands for ultraviolet, it really just

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.320
means small distances.
IR stands for infrared and it means very big distances

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:22.960
and we are getting a little bit; I don't say "confused" I am not sure its confused.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:29.460
But something is happening where as you start to look at a system with more and more and more precision

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:36.600
What you might have thought that you gonna see; more and more tiny short distance small  distance precision,

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:43.980
its going to start getting fuzzed out and fuzzed out and fuzzed out until its stretched across the whole

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:50.180
And that's not simply a feature of the camera you are using or resolution that is a fundamental feature.

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:56.580
That's a fundamental aspect of Physics, that better you try to look, and the more detail to try to see with

01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:01.080
the more its gonna be stretched out and fuzzed out over bigger and bigger distances.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:06.540
Yeah, I wanna follow up on that; so at least one of the reason why we are now more and more convinced that

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:12.820
holographic principle in really something that works is constantly from string theory; which is my field;

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:18.560
and what happens there is preciously if you go through this step of looking more and more details of what

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:24.560
happens in shorter and shorter distances, you might be interested in; say; what happens inside of our nucleus,

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.840
inside of our atoms, and there is nucleus and there are quarks and there are smaller and smaller particles

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:38.860
and suppose again, for a moment; you would wanna forget about gravity, but you start looking more carefully

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:46.900
at what we are made of and then because of this idea that; when you start looking at smaller and smaller scale,

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:52.900
so at least; smaller and smaller distances, suddenly discover that there's actually something new happening

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:58.960
And that something new, at least in terms of your equation; you will recognize it as gravity

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:04.000
So the amazing thing is that what are you actually interested in doing; just looking at the smallest

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:12.180
constituent of matter without pulling gravity in; gravity comes out as something that sort of inevitable.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:20.280
And to me that's enormously deep lesson there, that; gravity is something that you can not do without.

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:26.060
Clearly we can not do it without it, we would not be sitting here, we would be floating in this, but

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:31.440
Although gravity for me and Stephen Hawking is kind of a pain in the ass sometimes, but; which is why we love

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:37.720
to  forget about it but gravity is inevitable but its also a door to this something else.

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.300
Its a door to something else but you can get it out of something where you don't put it in.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.960
So its not the starting point, its the output of something.
Alright! we're gonna have to ramp this up, lets just

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.820
pull the audience; how many of you clap if you think that we are just a projection

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:04.120
Clap if you think if you think we are actually real

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.020
and clap if you don't care,

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.380
I would have though, that would have gotten the biggest clap of all; this far downtown

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:25.800
First of all; I wanna thank our panel, you have certainly taken us on a great journey tonight

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:31.540
There is obviously so much to think about, I would encourage if you're interested in these ideas;

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:36.240
tomorrow we are actually doing a; rebooting the universe; another exploration of the universe as an

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:42.980
information space; at a panel here. I also encourage you on Sunday; in the Kimmel space upstairs.

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:50.800
Mary Simon and Keystone dancers are going to be doing a fabulous; sort of mapping of dance; on to the

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:59.140
messier catalog and objects in the Universe to this idea of one information space mapping on to another as a

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.840
theme here at the world science festival.
I encourage to explore all of it.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.560
Thank you so much for coming and thanks to the panel
