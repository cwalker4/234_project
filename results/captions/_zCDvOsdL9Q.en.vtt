00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.109
Thanks for coming Mr. Zuckerberg.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.639
How are you?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.660
Just a sec.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.160
Mom?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.240
Could you get me my Frodo ring?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.620
I want it here

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.280
Okay, now that we got the ring sorted out

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.069
we can move on to the topic at hand, which
is the concerns that have been raised--

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.480
You need water, okay...

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.300
Now as I was saying, there's been a lot of
concern about peoples' private information

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930
and how--

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.140
Okay, how 'bout you just chug the water?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.620
I want you to cut it off

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.640
Are you blowing bubbles?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.180
I"m gonna have to spank you

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.280
Okay now, are you good?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.200
I swear, it's like he's got a mask on

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.900
Listen kid, blink if you're not a lamp

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.920
We'd like you to make a little smile just

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.250
to show that you can

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.640
Oh, good heavens, that's just horrible.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.289
Stop that son!

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.560
For the rest of the day, will you not do that
please?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.280
Umm, so, I have to admit that all of this
is just boring as beans

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.509
And I'm - what are we talking about?

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.649
And what am I gonna ask?

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.960
It was about... oh yeah
So, when I have the Facebook then do I also

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.650
have the internet?

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.520
Umm, yeah, you do
Mmm-hhhh

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.100
I'd just like everyone to know that my van
is for sale

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.060
Great
I mean, I don't know how you feel about that

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.639
But if you got to kinda like drive it and
stuff, then

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.580
You know I'm pretty sure you'd want to buy
it

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.109
Nope
Wait, cuz this van, I mean, it's special

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.120
Nope
No, hey, I'll send you a picture and you'll

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.360
say "I want this in my driveway"

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.260
No, please don't send anything

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.700
Okay, well I guess you're stupid

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.100
It's just a van

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.360
I told you it's a special van!

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.740
Do you think that I might need to shave my
head for a Frenchman?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.160
Because some people have said to me "you should
shave your head"

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.280
What do you think?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.520
Just say "No, I will not do that?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.620
Okay

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.840
Mr. Zuckerman

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.760
World War I was awful, do you agree?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.160
Uh, yes

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.680
Well, why are we even here then? Senator Graham?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.760
[singing] "Judy you were meant to be only

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.320
with me"
"La da da da - Judy you were born in moonlight"

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.980
Senator Graham?

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.800
Huh?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.040
Do you got any questions for me, or...?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.420
Shoot, see, what happened there is you guys
caught me singing "Judy Moonlight"

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.330
Because I really like it.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.000
It's a really great song.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.400
Because of, Judy Moonlight is the one the
song is about

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.680
Hey, ask me something

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.940
Do you like your heart rate?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.340
I'll get back to you about that

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.060
My turn!

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.070
Can we be friends later?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.940
No, I mean, we probably shouldn't

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.240
Would you say that if I lived in a treehouse? I doubt it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.580
Have you ever smelled a girl's feet?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.520
Cuz I imagine you and me could be doing that
at some point

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.760
No

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.460
WHat's the problem, little friend?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.720
Don't try to get in my Porsche again

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.580
But I really like yoU!

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.660
MISTER FACEBOOK MAN
Lift your hand out like this, boy, swing it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.680
out like this
You think it's hard?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.210
Believe me, I could hold a hand in the air
all DAY

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.880
You see it?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.140
I see it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.260
It's tradition where I'm from to stare at

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.240
the outstretched hand!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.380
That's for having your hair like that

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.960
Hey, I'll go bro

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.130
Do you worry about those little weenies you
get from Barb from downstairs?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.040
I do not want that to be a thing

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.320
Hey really, man, I think people will find

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.960
you more fun if you open your mind about the
little weenies

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.520
I doubt that

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.040
Over here

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.860
Sorry kid, I forget your name

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.140
Uh, Bojang Bugami

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.340
Bugami, that's weird!

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.580
Say, what is that?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.360
Flemish, or French, or Japanese, or Anglo?
Yep

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.720
Okay

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.740
Good hang, buddy

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.880
Cool hang

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.660
You have a bean head

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.860
Wow, really?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.980
That's great

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.560
That kind of reminds me of how I knew Einstein

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.160
back when I was just a kid
And I would go to his apartment and dude had

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.880
a green bean bag

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.540
I wish that was right

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.790
And he had this deal where you could also
make all the chocolate milk you liked

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.580
You know, I can tell you what Einstein would
have said about Facebook: HORSE MANURE PILE

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.320
Umm, that's cool

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.320
Turd satchel -- remember, those are Einstein's words

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.380
Hey Mark

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.190
Do you have a painful scrote?

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.500
Uh, no I do not

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.260
Well you will in time

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.480
Judy you were meant to be only with me, la
da da da

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.620
Judy you were born in moonlight

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.020
Judy you were meant to be only with me, la da da da

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.660
Judy you were born in moonlight
