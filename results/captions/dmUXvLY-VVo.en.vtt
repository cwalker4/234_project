00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:01.643
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; We're back with Alison Sweeney and

00:00:01.643 --> 00:00:02.919
we're gonna play 5 Second Rule.

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.389
Twitch is here to host,
and I will go first.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.189
&gt;&gt; Okay, Ellen name three
ways to die on a soap opera.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.680
&gt;&gt; Your evil twin kills you,
you fall off a tower,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.360
or you're pushed off a bridge
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

00:00:15.363 --> 00:00:16.446
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:18.383
&gt;&gt; Sure,
there are a lot of bridges in [CROSSTALK].

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:18.964
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, sure.

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:19.581
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:20.330
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.791
&gt;&gt; Okay Allison, name three reasons
to slap someone on a soap opera.

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.435
&gt;&gt; They curse at you, they steal your
boyfriend and they kill your mother

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:26.168
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:26.884
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:27.638
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].

00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:28.635
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:29.416
&gt;&gt; Curse at you?

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:30.222
I'll take it.

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:32.110
&gt;&gt; So they kill your mother and
you slap them?

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.513
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:35.249
&gt;&gt; It happens.

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:36.256
&gt;&gt; How dare you kill my mother?

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:37.808
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:38.749
&gt;&gt; But-
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:39.276
&gt;&gt; But it did!

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:39.862
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:41.716
&gt;&gt; It's true!
&gt;&gt; That's not really punishment, but okay.

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:42.707
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:42.707 --> 00:00:44.650
&gt;&gt; Okay Ellen,
name three things you shave.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.697
&gt;&gt; Your legs, your armpits, and
if you're unlucky, your face.

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:55.975
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:58.756
&gt;&gt; I don't know, what three things with.

00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:02.203
&gt;&gt; Okay, besides a hair, name three things
you wouldn't want to find in your mouth.

00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:08.138
&gt;&gt; A bug, someone else's hair, and a worm.

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:08.696
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:09.295
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:11.075
&gt;&gt; Bug is different from a worm!

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:11.824
Two different-
&gt;&gt; No,

00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:15.656
a bug and worm would fall into the same-
&gt;&gt; Come on!

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:16.586
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:17.333
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.036
&gt;&gt; I'm not a zoologist.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.248
&gt;&gt; I'll allow it.

00:01:19.248 --> 00:01:19.892
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.785
&gt;&gt; But-
&gt;&gt; Close, I won't let it happen again.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.455
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Now we're even with our cheating.

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:24.514
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:25.127
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:27.548
&gt;&gt; Okay, Ellen,
name three things you love about Portia.

00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:29.222
&gt;&gt; She's very intelligent.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.271
She's very funny.

00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.304
And she's easy on the eyes.

00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:32.045
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:33.283
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:34.443
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].

00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:35.589
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:36.260
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.800
&gt;&gt; That's too easy.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.895
&gt;&gt; That was easy.

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:40.863
&gt;&gt; Okay Allison,
name three things you love about Portia.

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:42.573
&gt;&gt; I love that she's a talented writer.

00:01:42.573 --> 00:01:43.935
She's very friendly.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.171
And funny.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.051
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:46.973
&gt;&gt; I stole your thing.
Friendly.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.078
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Friendly.

00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:50.269
&gt;&gt; I panicked on the friendly
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.770
Hey y'all.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.565
&gt;&gt; I was thinking generous.

00:01:51.565 --> 00:01:52.422
&gt;&gt; She's very friendly.

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:54.450
&gt;&gt; I'm sure she is very-
&gt;&gt; She could be a greeter at Walmart.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.165
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Walmart.

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.974
&gt;&gt; Friendly, my God, Portia I'm sorry.

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:01.302
&gt;&gt; Okay Ellen, name three brands of soap.

00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:05.206
&gt;&gt; Dove, Irish Spring, and Dial.

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:07.430
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.329
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I came up with three soaps.

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.642
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:15.873
&gt;&gt; That's hard.

00:02:15.873 --> 00:02:17.424
&gt;&gt; Name three things you can slip on.

00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:18.907
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Slippers.

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:23.303
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; A shirt, and flip-flops.

00:02:23.303 --> 00:02:24.816
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:25.552
&gt;&gt; Slippers?

00:02:25.552 --> 00:02:29.111
&gt;&gt; No, banana peel or-

00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:29.706
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:30.829
&gt;&gt; That was clever though.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.555
I mean, you can slip on slippers.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:34.333
You can slip them on.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.169
It was like two meanings.

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.494
Wow.

00:02:37.494 --> 00:02:41.064
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:45.195
&gt;&gt; Things you can slip on, like a dress

00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:50.898
or, all right Andy, I am ending this show.
&gt;&gt; Why is Andy so

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:53.491
mean to us?
&gt;&gt; Andy is so mean.

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:54.384
&gt;&gt; Andy!

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:55.312
&gt;&gt; All right, I want to thank Alison Sweeney,

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:56.236
Ty Burrell,

00:02:56.898 --> 00:03:00.890
and don't forget to go to Fandango and
get your Finding Dory tickets right now.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.577
I'll see you tomorrow,
be kind to one another, bye!
