00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.860
Tom: Everybody, welcome to Impact Theory.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.460
You’re here because you believe as I do
that human potential is nearly limitless.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.260
You know that having potential is not the
same thing as actually doing something with

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.260
it.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.520
Our goal with this show and company is to
introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.300
are going to help you actually execute on
your dreams.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
All right.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.100
Today’s guest is a hacker turned neuroscientist.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.700
He is a fascinating blend of a wide variety
of disciplines and this diversity has led

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.820
him to explore some promising albeit nontraditional
ways of investigating the brain, namely cracking

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
open the skull and peering inside whilst the
person is still living.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.600
What he’s found is so interesting it makes
my eyes bleed and has made him a much sought-after

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.170
speaker and leading thinker who is influencing
academia and business in equal measure.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.750
His education is a wondrous grab bag of joy
and includes a PhD in neuroscience from Caltech

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.970
and both an MA and Philosophy and a BSC in
Physics from Tel Aviv University.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.860
He is a visiting faculty member at MIT’s
Media Lab and his work has been published

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.010
in such prestigious scholarly journals as
Nature, the highest ranking journal in world,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.150
as well as widely-distributed publications
such as Scientific American Mind, Wired and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.860
New Scientist.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.870
He was named one of the 40 leading professors
under 40 and his ground-breaking work has

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.350
brought him acclaim and attention from all
over the globe including Hollywood where he’s

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.060
been tapped as a consultant and contributor
on such hit shows as Mr. Robot, my favorite,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.480
Limitless, Bull, Falling Water, and Ancient
Aliens.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.110
He’s also the Alfred P. Sloan professor
at the American Film Institute where he teaches

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.720
a screenwriting course on science and film.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.000
He holds multiple patents and is a multi-time
national storytelling champion whose talks

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.500
have garnered him millions of views.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.620
Please help me in welcoming the professor
of neuroscience and business at the Kellogg’s

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.140
School of Management and the neuroscience
program at Northwestern University, the neurosurgeon

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.180
who has actually walked into a bank and robbed
it, Dr. Moran Cerf.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.310
Moran: Thank you.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.580
Tom: Thank you so much for joining us.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.280
I think the only reasonable place to start
with you is to ask how does it feel to rob

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280
a bank?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.739
Moran: It feels remarkable.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.640
I think … I’m trying to go back to the
memory of doing it the first time.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.980
It’s something that you [crosstalk 00:02:40]
before and after your life is ...

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.530
Tom: How many times have you robbed a bank?

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.129
Moran: I robbed a bank the way you mean as
in went into one and stole the cash, four

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.249
times and stole money virtually dozens of
times.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.599
Tom: The stealing money virtually was your
job.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.609
Moran: Right.

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.219
Tom: Walk us through how you end up walking
into a bank and actually robbing it.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.510
Moran: There are a number of people right
now whose job is to actually break into banks

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.599
and steal the money online.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.480
This is a job that’s called pen tester.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.959
You’re hired by the bank’s board to try
and find ways to online steal the money.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.549
This is common.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.269
There are some banks who would let you also
try to test the physical security which would

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.239
mean to actually go there and see if the cameras
are pointing to the right place, if someone

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.780
left a Post-It note with the password on the
computer, and also to actually go and say,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.780
"Hey, give me your money."

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.920
It’s not that popular among hackers because
they’re really good at that normally, but

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.980
every now and then, you’ll hear about a
group of hackers who’ll try that we were

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.639
among those who went instead.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.959
Let’s see if we can rob the bank the way
westerners did it.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.609
Tom: How do you then end up becoming a neuroscientist?

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.950
Your job was pretty sexy.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.609
It’s not like it was drooling boring.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.700
You were robbing banks and hacking computers.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.319
Moran: The story involved a lot of characters
who influenced it, but I would say that the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.010
one person who influenced me the most is Francis
Crick who is at the time maybe the most influential

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.379
neuroscientist studying consciousness in San
Diego that I happen to meet when I was a hacker,

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.489
so totally something doing else in my life,
and had an evening with him.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.519
In this evening, he learned about my career
and said that your job is to basically look

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.350
at the black box, see what comes in, what
goes out, and learn how it works.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.350
This is what hackers do.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.480
He said, “Think about using that in something
that’s going to be much more valuable to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.691
the world which is looking at the brain.”

00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.490
The brain is this black box.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.420
Instead of trying to figure out the code,
try to see how people behave, understand what

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.300
they do and learn how their brains work to
make it happen.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.890
This took me two years to actually apply the
advice but …

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.810
Tom: [Inaudible 00:04:45] You’re talking
about Francis Crick from Crick and Watson,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.020
the people who discovered the double helix
of DNA which is pretty interesting.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.440
Honestly, tell us about researching.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.660
I didn’t realize how recently he was active.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.760
It felt a little more decent to me.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.870
You’ve called him your idol.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.800
What was it about him in particular that made
him your idol?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.320
Moran: First of all, he tackled interesting
questions, right, because a lot of scientist,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.530
they try to do the same thing many, many times
just to accumulate more knowledge on the same

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.530
problem.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.530
He was not that kind of guy.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.920
He really tried to look at all the things
that I was told as a kid, the interesting

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.920
things in science but you should not ever
study them until you have a Nobel Prize.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.200
Studying dreams, consciousness, whether there’s
aliens out there, free will, all the cool

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.470
things that we think about when we were kids
but are told as we enter academia don’t

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.900
ever touch this thing at least until you get
a Nobel Prize.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.310
He was looking into all of those things and
really diving into them, so I felt that this

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.310
was what’s interesting.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.610
Tom: You actually made a list, right, when
you first started your … Was it your PhD?

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.960
You made the list of like here are the important
questions I think I want to explore?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.720
Moran: Day one on my fridge, I had this Post-It
note with all the things that I wanted to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.260
do if I ever get a PhD.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.910
Among those things were the things I mentioned.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.910
Tom: All right.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.570
Let’s take them piece by piece.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:07.510
I’m really fascinated by Free Will certainly,
and I’m assuming that you followed Sam Harris

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.380
in terms of his talk about free will and all
the stuff that he has done on that.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.940
What is it that draws you to Free Will?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.940
Why are you interested?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.090
Moran: I think that in a way, there’s an
application to free will, right.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.280
We live life thinking we make decisions all
the time and responsible for our decisions

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.000
and also determined and defined by those.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.500
If I ask you what do you want to have for
lunch and I offer you five different things

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.560
and you make a choice, then your choice is
somehow your identity.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.900
This is like what you care about.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.140
If I told you right now that I could predict
what you’re going to choose an hour before

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.150
you made a choice, a day, 20 years before,
it takes away some of our identity in a way

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.430
but also gives us meaning because it says,
okay, there’s actually a narrative that

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.600
we carry with us throughout life.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.290
Now, the choice has become really something
that defines who we are, not just the moment

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.280
of but as a person in the world.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.100
I always care about like free will, understanding
it, predicting it, and also using it to change

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100
things.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.479
If you think that, okay, [inaudible 00:07:06]
determine do I have any meaning to my life

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:10.479
… I’m sorry.

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.510
They are not determined, we do have control
over them and that’s what makes us human.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.500
Tom: You believe that we do have free will
or you believe that it’s totally different

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.650
on how we’re thinking of them.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.240
We have to totally re-imagine it.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.890
Morgan: There’s like two kind of moments
that need to be addressed.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.180
One is whether we do actually have this moment
of spark that happens when the choice is totally

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.200
arbitrary and we have like a choice.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.180
I do believe that we have that free will,
a toss of a coin where something gets determined.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.530
What’s interesting is the moment when we
become aware of the free will choice, as in

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.040
I ask you … [inaudible 00:07:41] ask you
do you want the fish or the steak at this

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.630
moment like you have two options.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.740
Now, you’re about to make a choice.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.740
What do you want?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.740
Tom: Steak for sure.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.590
Morgan: You had a second now where you had
to look at all the options, I gave you only

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.340
two, and make a decision.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.531
Now, at some point if I ask you when did you
make the choice, you would say, "Well, maybe

00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:00.860
as soon as I finished the sentence."

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.250
Maybe you would say a fraction of a second
afterwards.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:09.060
The question is, A, how far before did we
know the answer to that.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.230
Also, was there anything I could have said
differently that would have make you say the

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.630
fish.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.772
Most importantly, what’s the gap between
the moment you would tell me that’s the

00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.120
moment that you chose and the moment that
you actually chose.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.480
Apparently, there is a gap and this gap is
what we call the illusion of free will.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.060
The moment where you say that’s the moment,
[inaudible 00:08:25], this is when it happened.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.350
I can look at your brain and say, “You know
what?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.620
Actually here, your dinner that you’re going
to choose.”

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.200
Or even like if you want to take it one step
further, we can actually stimulate your brain

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.200
and make you choose this thing.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200
I would tell you and I’d say, "Who made
the choice?"

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.870
You say, "I have to make the choice myself.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.870
This was my decision."

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.699
I’d say, “Well, you know what, here’s
me zapping your brain performance making you

00:08:41.699 --> 00:08:42.699
say fish.”

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.839
[crosstalk 00:08:43]
Tom: What are you [inaudible 00:08:44] with?

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:45.939
Transcranial magnetic stimulation?

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:46.939
Morgan: Yes.

00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:47.939
This is not to me but there are people who
…

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:49.220
Tom: Yeah, so what would you do?

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.360
Can you really do the steak-fish one?

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.319
Morgan: The only demo that I saw was one person
basically having a little box and they have

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:59.740
buttons and they have to choose whether they
want to press the left or the right.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.430
People sit there and they pressed left, right,
right, left, left, left for like 10 minutes.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.560
Then someone asked them what is your choice
which button to press at any point?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.600
They’d say of course and then you zoom out
and you see a person sitting with a PMS like

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.839
this machine that looks at the brain.

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.360
They’re basically playing like a [puppeteer
00:09:13]; left, right, right, left.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.959
Tom: Get the fuck out of here.

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:16.959
That’s real?

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:17.959
Morgan: That’s real.

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:18.959
What’s interesting isn’t that you can
do that.

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:19.959
This is not surprising.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.750
We know that we can actually zap your brain
and make you move your head.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.470
What’s surprising is that you would tell
me it was my choice like you would believe

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.470
that it was your decision.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.420
You wouldn’t question the fact that what
you did was your decision.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.240
This to me was an interesting part that we
can have this way with our brain to always

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240
defend it.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240
In other words, whatever I did I wanted to
do.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.839
If I do this thing, it was my choice.

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.649
Now we know that it wasn’t necessarily your
choice.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:45.600
That things affected you, that things made
you do what you did, and you will always claim

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.810
that it was your decision so we can actually
show you that you’re not really fully …

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.670
Tom: How do people respond when you show them?

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.670
Morgan: Funny.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.550
They mostly try to defend free will so they
try to argue with me.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.970
I showed them the video of me telling things.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.970
They say, no, no, no.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.990
We have this experiment that we bring them
to the lab and we just tell them things.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.160
We say, "Okay, what do you want to eat after
the experiment?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.089
Where do you want to sit, here or there?"

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:07.920
We ask them to make decisions and we don’t
really tell them anything.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.299
Just say take decisions, like sit here or
there?

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:11.399
Do you want this pen or that pen?

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.149
Do you want the light on or off?

00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:16.399
Then we ask them after the experiments how
many choices did you made?

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.759
The people who experienced us toying with
their free will think that they made hundreds

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.759
of choices.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:25.449
They made about 14 but they really feel that,
okay, I had to make choices, I control everything,

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:29.189
this was my decision, they cannot try to grasp
into the ideal free will and say, "I had a

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:30.660
lot of decisions to my life and I made them."

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.100
They become a little more religious.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.600
They become a little bit more ethical.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.130
A lot of things happen to you when you feel
that what’s in question is your identity.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.910
Tom: That is so interesting.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.450
I’ve heard a lot of these studies and I’ve
not heard where you’re literally playing

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.850
conga drums and whether they did the right
and left.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:52.420
I’ve seen one where you know they’re about
to do it before they do and so you turn the

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.620
buttons on essentially to buzz them and tell
them not to press which is hilarious, but

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.110
I didn’t know about that one.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.110
It’s so interesting.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.720
Okay, so you’re a guy with deep background
in narrative.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.610
You teach a screenwriting course, for God’s
sake.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:14.129
Help me understand how you know that you can
manipulate the brain and yet you still believe

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:15.129
in free will.

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:18.339
It sounds like you believe in free will and
the way that it’s tied to your own self

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:19.379
narrative.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.220
Moran: Here’s the idea.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.410
I feel that there’s a lot of things that
affect our decision.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.829
The temperature in the room, the height of
the chair, the weight of the book we’re

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:31.829
holding; a lot of things.

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:35.509
This is studied by a lot of people in many,
many ways that show time and again that you

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:37.759
can actually change a person’s behavior.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:42.600
We can list those things so someone can take
them and now have list of things that they

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.209
can apply if they want to have better interactions
with people, what temperature should the room

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:48.499
be, what they should do.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:49.499
We know that.

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:50.499
We know that thing.

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:55.320
At the same time, we still live life as if
it’s our decisions entirely.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.569
We know that I can trick you by making the
price of the food 6.99 rather than 7 and you

00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:04.009
would think it’s 6, not 7, just like the
simplest one in the book.

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.089
All of us know it and it still works.

00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:11.510
Take that to a larger scale, we know that
there’s hundreds of thousands of biases

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.029
that affect our brain and even if I tell you
what they are, you would still work the same

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:17.029
way.

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:22.649
Free will is becoming interesting to me when
we learn all of those things and we say, "Okay.

00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:24.220
Then who am I?"

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.889
Who’s in charge?

00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:29.089
Who’s the puppeteer in this example?

00:12:29.089 --> 00:12:34.899
The reality is that … what we learn is that
there are more than one puppeteer in our brain.

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:36.260
There’s many, many.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.430
Every day, one other guy wakes up, and so
one day with this guy, one day with this guy,

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.610
and they’re vying for dominance.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.360
They fight and they compete.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.480
They make a decision together, they vote,
and ultimately we protect the person who spoke

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.550
last and we say this is who I am.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.569
To me, the most interesting is that we can
now actually all their characters.

00:12:54.569 --> 00:12:55.750
We can show them fighting.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.310
We can tell you that there’s more people
in your brain.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.509
In doing so, we can actually allow you to
really manifest different sides of yours so

00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:05.800
you know maybe that you’re making better
choices in the morning and I make that choices

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800
in the evening.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.910
You might know that you’re making better
decisions when you’re hungry and I am when

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.460
I’m full; when you’re talking to friends,
when you’re alone.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.949
We can now profile your brain.

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:15.990
Tom: If somebody is watching us right now
and they’re thinking, “Okay, wait.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.399
Do I make better decisions when I’m hungry
or full, night, day?”

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.129
What are you looking for and what can they
look for at home?

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:26.809
Morgan: I would say what we do with a lot
of people who are in senior positions in companies

00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:31.130
that want to actually make decisions better,
we have a protocol that’s a little bit tedious.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.069
It’s not easy to do it but I’ll tell you
what it is, and then you can think of ways

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:35.430
to maybe try it yourself.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:41.500
We have them basically walk for a week with
a diary and make choices and just write them

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.500
down.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.230
Tell us like I had this fish or the steak
for lunch and I chose this and this is how

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.230
I’ve chosen.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.779
They also write whether they were happy or
not with the choice.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:53.579
Now, this is done the way they wouldn’t
normally but we also add one more thing.

00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:56.129
We put EEG cap on their head …
Tom: All day?

00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:57.689
Morgan: … for more than 24 hours.

00:13:57.689 --> 00:13:59.980
They walk with something that measures their
brain activity.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.980
There’s moments where they have to replace
the battery.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.910
There’s a little like gaps there.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.329
Altogether, we have them walk through life
with both living life the way they do and

00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:12.019
reflect on their choices but also have us
look at their brain.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:16.430
What we do at the end of the three days, one
week, as long as they would do that … It’s

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.360
uncomfortable and embarrassing sometimes.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.820
We ask them to look at all the choices and
tell us which ones were good, which ones were

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.820
bad.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.589
Then we look at their brains and we see what
words their brain looking like.

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:30.360
What did it look like when they made choices
that they were happy with?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.829
We sometimes see that there are things in
their brain that are repeated so maybe they

00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:37.290
made choices more using this part of the brain.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.639
I’m only trying to simplify it by looking
at the part of the brain that are more emotional

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:43.230
rather than rational.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.589
We see that they activate more part of the
brain that are buried deep inside that has

00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:49.189
to do with reflection rather than like thinking.

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.610
We tell them, “Here’s what we learned
about you.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.119
You are better in this and that state.”

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:55.119
That’s one thing.

00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:58.290
It’s not easy to apply because you still
have to have this thing on your head.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.629
Not everyone can do that.

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:03.389
At least people in senior positions who feel
that [inaudible 00:015:02] critical come to

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:04.389
us and say, “Okay, help me.

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:05.740
I want to know who I am better.”

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.209
Tom: Now, what about those study you did where
you’ve got the cyclist on the bike, they’re

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:14.089
going hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, and you
watch for certain brain states where you know,

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:15.970
“Okay, they’re going to quit.”

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.949
Then you use that information overtime to
get them to delay quitting farther and farther.

00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:21.949
How does that work?

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:26.760
Morgan: Behind that lies the idea that the
brain is kind of like a muscle, and specifically,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.660
there’s part of the brain that we really
care about.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.699
It’s the part that’s doing self control.

00:15:30.699 --> 00:15:34.939
If you think about it in simple way [inaudible
00:015:33] is that you start running.

00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:36.489
You go running.

00:15:36.489 --> 00:15:40.889
The first mile, your legs say let’s run,
and the brain controls them so let’s run,

00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:42.949
and there another part of the brain that says
no problem at all.

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:46.619
After one mile, your legs say it’s a little
bit painful but the part of the other brain

00:15:46.619 --> 00:15:48.249
that controls them say keep going.

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:51.980
After 10 miles, the legs say I want to quit,
and the other part say, no, keep going.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.790
It’s like there’s a battle there and at
some point you're going to break.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.360
Now when you’re going to break depends on
a lot of things, your muscles, but it also

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:05.269
depends on this control coming from the front
of your brain that overrides your experience,

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:07.319
your pain.

00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:12.749
If we can see this moment where you break,
the moment where you stop despite the fact

00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:15.800
that you can do a little more, we can come
back to you tomorrow and say, “Let’s do

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800
the same thing you did yesterday.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.800
Have you run?

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.449
Only this time when you get to the moment
when we see that you’re about to break,

00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:21.449
we’re going to play a sound.

00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:24.929
We’re going to tell you that we can see
that you’re about to break and we ask you

00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:28.989
to just continue for one more minute at this
moment that is beyond what you did yesterday.”

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.550
Tom: What, in that moment, how do you appeal
to them?

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.689
Is it like, come on, mother fucker, like you
got this or …

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:34.689
Moran: That’s basically it.

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:38.230
There’s a question in sport for a while,
why is it that people do better when they

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.200
play home game versus outside game?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.999
What is it about your mom being in the audience
that makes you win the game?

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:46.819
In theory, they doesn’t matter like throwing
the basketball should be the same.

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:52.069
Somehow, we know that if your friends are
there, if you’re feeling better, we know

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:53.069
that people do better when they’re, "Oh.

00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:54.069
They're kind of winning."

00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:55.559
There’s a lot of things that affect our
brain.

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:57.689
What we try to understand right now is where
is it in their brain.

00:16:57.689 --> 00:17:04.730
What is this part of the brain that gets better
when your emotions are highlighted or heightened?

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.000
Now we're seeing it.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.319
Tom: This is life like what you’re talking
about right now.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:16.240
Boys and girls at home, I’m telling you
there’s a banality to being an entrepreneur.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.079
There is a willingness to suffer to being
an entrepreneur, to being a great mom.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:25.089
Whatever it is that you’re trying to do,
suffering is involved.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:32.799
It literally like being able to extend your
breakpoint is what it’s about.

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:35.860
When I read-
Moran: What I’m going to say is that we

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.700
all face those moments when the alarm buzzes
at 6 a.m.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.970
We set the alarm at 10 p.m. and suddenly in
the morning we’re different people like

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.780
we’re not the person who wants to wake up
anymore.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.590
It’s the same brain that sets the alarm
at 10 p.m. but now suddenly it’s 6 a.m.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.590
We’re not the same guy.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.950
This is the moment like that.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.460
We have to make a choice when we’re going
running, when we’re about to eat a cake.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.720
There’s like a tasty cake and we’re on
a diet.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.049
We say, oh, I shouldn’t eat the cake but
there’s a conflict.

00:17:59.049 --> 00:18:02.450
Now is the moment where those two parts of
the brain come to life.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.980
The more you know about yourself, the more
you’re aware of those situations, the better

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.690
you can do in controlling them.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.299
The more you know about yourself, you can
do better in all of those tasks.

00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:11.360
That’s the ultimate thing.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.640
That’s why we’re here.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.350
We're giving you the knowledge.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.540
Once you know it, it doesn’t work anymore.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.470
Once you know that 6.99 isn’t 7, it’s
harder for it to work.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.480
Just knowing is enough for people to do better.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.490
Know that it’s in your capacity to change.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.080
That’s what we want.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.970
Tom: Like how does somebody become more self-aware?

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.220
How do they begin to identify those things
that are particular to them so that they can

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.380
extend their breaking point or so that they
can disprove whatever?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.950
Moran: All they need to do is they need to
communicate science in tangible way so people

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.390
would know all the option.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.049
I said there’s hundreds and thousands of
options but there’re actually a couple of

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:49.590
hundreds of biases that, we, humans have.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.700
I can give you examples in a second.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.539
Once you know them, they don’t work anymore.

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:57.390
The job of scientist is to just translate
the knowledge of the brain into words that

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:02.050
it can be then spoken to an audience who then
lives by then, and that’s it.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.570
All they need to do is just do this.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.149
Speak to people and list their biases.

00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:08.149
Then it doesn’t work anymore.

00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:10.510
At least when it happens you become a little
bit better in controlling that.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.510
That’s all we need.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.510
It’s pretty simple.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.929
Once you know it, it doesn’t work.

00:19:13.929 --> 00:19:17.200
Tom: Let’s use an example from your life.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.500
I love this story, by the way.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.690
You’re about to be published in Nature.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.970
It’s your first big break in science, and
this is really going to set up your career.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.630
Then someone wakes you up from a nap and you
basically say, “Yeah, recording dreams is

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.630
possible.”

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.630
You can’t take it back.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.370
You’re like “Wait, wait, that’s not
what I meant.”

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.789
It goes crazy.

00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:40.769
The part that I love is Christopher Nolan
calls you up and says, “Hey, I just did

00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:41.970
this movie, Inception.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.280
You’re now the dream recording guy.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.440
I want you to come with me and do a worldwide
tour,” which would be a huge break for you

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.700
and just be … I’m sure money and certainly
notoriety and you had to think about it.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:01.250
Even though you knew going means essentially
reinforcing this opinion that I actually don’t

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:05.650
agree with, but turning it down means that
I had passed up that opportunity.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.580
What did you go through in the 24 hours before
you gave the answer?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.220
Moran: To give you the full story, I’m finishing
my PhD.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.659
I haven’t decided what I’d do next.

00:20:14.659 --> 00:20:15.980
Am I continuing in science?

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.830
Do I go like back to being a hacker?

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.130
This is like a moment of [inaudible 00:20:21]
in my life and suddenly there comes this moment

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:29.300
where the end of my five-year PhD is getting
a lot of attention but all wrong; my career

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.300
hindrance of this thing.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:36.830
Then I have suddenly an option to actually
own this thing and become this dream expert

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:42.559
even though it’s based on a lie.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:46.370
I was fortunate enough to have enough checks
and balances that I didn’t really have to

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.420
go far with that so here’s the interesting
reflection that I have right now.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.220
I knew it was impossible to look at people’s
dreams and [inaudible 00:20:52] I said it

00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:02.500
in sleepy state and created this like amazing
story for people that scientists are now recording

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.520
dreams.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.809
The mistake was to leave this.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:12.639
To say it’s not possible, I’m not going
to own this thing even though the world cares

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:13.639
about it.

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:17.850
If anything can be learned from this thing
is that the world really wanted to have people

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.610
record dreams because that’s why it’s
such a big thing because people care about

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.610
it.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.610
Dreams are interesting.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.240
I went and I said it's impossible and I want
to kill the story.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.380
This was a mistake.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.940
Three years later, I’m sitting at home,
now 2013, and I got a call from BBC again.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.200
BBC were the first ones to let the story go
away.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.500
They called me again and they say, “Professor
Cerf, we wanted you to comment on dream recording

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.750
and the possibility of doing that.”

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.350
I said, “Guys, are you kidding me?

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.460
I’m done with that.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.280
This is not too ... Like let’s not even
begin going there.”

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.480
They said, “No, no.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.400
We know that you’re going to do that.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.120
We want you to comment on the work of Professor
Kamitani from Japan who is doing it right

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120
now.”

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.940
Someone in Japan didn’t know that it was
impossible.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.899
He just didn’t hear me going anywhere public
and saying it’s impossible so he just did

00:22:06.899 --> 00:22:08.350
it.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.490
Three years after I said it was impossible,
someone did it, and two years after that,

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.490
I joined.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.790
Now half the thing I do in life is actually
looking at people’s dreams.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.549
The mistake I made, it wasn’t just saying
something is possible when it was not.

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:23.100
It was to say that something was impossible
before I knew it because I think that science

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.080
is all about going to those dark places and
trying to find what’s impossible.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.750
My mistake was to say it was impossible before
I was sure about it.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.289
I should have said we don’t know yet, we
didn’t do it yet, but we should investigate.

00:22:34.289 --> 00:22:39.200
I was quick to say “I didn’t do it, it’s
impossible,” so I delayed things by three

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200
years.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.610
Five years after, I’m doing it right now.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.769
Tom: Dude, can I shake your hand?

00:22:43.769 --> 00:22:50.440
I fucking love that so much like most people
cannot look at something like that and say

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.620
the mistake that I made was actually in the
opposite direction and I should’ve been

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.620
bolder.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.120
I should’ve made a wiser proclamation.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.020
Then to actually join the team, that’s so
cool.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.520
Moran: Dreams is something that I was told
not to study.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.419
Now that’s what I do in my life every day.

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:07.230
Now I’m never saying something is possible
before I’m certain that it’s impossible.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.230
Tom: I love that.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.279
I love it even more if you would go so far
as to say nothing is truly impossible.

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:14.639
Then you’d really have me.

00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:15.639
Moran: I’ll go with you.

00:23:15.639 --> 00:23:19.960
You mentioned that I teach screenwriting and
I work with TV.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.559
The reason I do that is because I feel that
the best ideas for my research come from those

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:31.909
hours with the kids who write plays, with
the fellows at the American Film Institute

00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:37.570
who writes science fiction, from movies that
inspired me like The Matrix.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.309
You mentioned that like this has inspired
us.

00:23:39.309 --> 00:23:41.080
We are kids of 1999.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.409
What happened then affected us.

00:23:43.409 --> 00:23:45.450
Star Trek affected my dad’s generation.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.740
The best paper that I had ever written has
a thousand of citation.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:56.500
The episode of Limitless that I worked on
last week and came out has five million people

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.500
watching it.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.029
Those are the kids who are going to be me
in 20 years.

00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:04.180
If they think, oh, this is maybe possible,
they’re going to do that.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.760
You’re asking me how to change their behavior.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.760
This is how.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.039
To know what the possibilities are.

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:13.120
Tom: I love that so much.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.100
Here’s the people watching the show, they
know my story very, very well, and I now run

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.490
it into the ground because it’s so important.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.580
I am not an example of what happens when innate
talent meets hard work.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.880
I’m an example of what happens with a human
being anytime hard work is applied because

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.630
I didn’t show early signs of promise.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.500
I got a 990 on my SATs.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.710
I was taking it twice.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.040
I don’t qualify for men’s or anything
like that.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.230
I have an average IQ.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:46.380
It’s like none of my raw materials are very
impressive but I work hard.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.340
I work hard over a very long period of time.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.309
In doing so, I’ve completely transformed
my life and I’ve transformed my mind to

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:56.790
the point where now people just assume I’m
smart.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.399
The same people, right, that were looking
at me 20 years ago did not assume I was smart

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:02.950
but they do now.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.041
The reason this conversation is so important
to be having with a neuroscientist is it all

00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:11.690
comes down to me to the narrative that you
tell yourself, when I was undereducated and

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:17.480
lost and bordering on depress and all of that,
it was because the narrative that I told myself

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.700
was that I was a victim of something.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.340
Once I gave up the victim mentality and I
realized I can do anything that I set my mind

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.309
to, so now it’s a spiritual question, right?

00:25:25.309 --> 00:25:29.070
If you really believe you can do anything
you set your mind to, then how you spend your

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.600
time is a spiritual question.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.140
Once I said, “Okay, what I’m going to
spend my time on is self-improvement.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.450
I’m going to see how much can I manipulate
my own brain.”

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.280
I began researching the brain to understand
what’s malleable and what’s not; learning

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280
about myelin.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.480
If you don’t even know what myelin is to
like think that you’ve already maxed yourself

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.870
out is fucking crazy.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.549
Researching the brain, finding out the anatomical
mechanisms that are at play, and the coming

00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:55.030
to, okay, this comes down to self-narrative.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.880
If I’m telling myself dreams can be recorded,
then they really can’t because I will stop

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.159
shy of that.

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:05.100
When you’re talking about never saying that
something is impossible when you’re not

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.440
really sure, what I start thinking is thinking
big like thinking really big and watching

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:15.350
The Matrix and saying, "Okay, either that
level of VR is actually possible or stopping

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.809
bullets is actually possible," like whatever
the thing is that you take away from it.

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:26.000
Time travel was one of the things on your
list.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.429
The promise I make to people watching the
show is from watching the show, you will accomplish

00:26:31.429 --> 00:26:34.140
more than you would have if you didn’t watch
the show.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:41.170
One of the key reasons for that is you’ll
finally understand that if you fail to think

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.039
big, that’s on you.

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:46.299
The only reason you’re not thinking big
is because you’re scared, because there’s

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:51.049
nothing in the machinations of the brain,
there’s nothing in what has come before

00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:54.789
you in science, nothing that would lead you
to believe the thing you currently think is

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:56.050
impossible actually is.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.640
Moran: Let me say this in neuroscience words.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.460
I love it so here’s how I’m going to say
it.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.620
Your brain goes with you and it carries all
of the history in the form of memories.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.169
All of you have from what happened before
you is stored in the form of memories and

00:27:11.169 --> 00:27:13.259
they’re not accurate and they’re compressed.

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:15.470
That’s only about the past.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.120
You have no idea in the future even though
your brain tries to predict it all the time.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120
This is what dreams are for.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.260
This is what decisions are for.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.740
You try to simulate the future and make predictions.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.740
You don’t know what’s going on.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.419
All you have is this sliver of reality which
is the present which is all you have, and

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:31.169
you control everything that happens there.

00:27:31.169 --> 00:27:35.389
The nice thing about the present is that actually
it interacts with everything in your brain

00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:36.480
and you can change things.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.110
What we learned in the last five years is
that memories are different in how they work.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:46.350
If I have to summarize it to one sentence,
they change every time you use them.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.700
If you have a memory stored here or what you
had for lunch yesterday and I ask you what

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.259
did you had for lunch, you basically open
them.

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:55.630
Right now you tell me a story, but whatever
happens right now goes into the story and

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.879
you say it differently.

00:27:56.879 --> 00:28:00.509
If I ask you tomorrow what you had for lunch,
you’ll open the modified version.

00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:04.139
Every time I ask you the same question, you
open a different version which means you can

00:28:04.139 --> 00:28:05.610
actually change the past.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.919
You can actually change your experience of
things.

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:08.919
This is why therapy works.

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:12.559
Your girlfriend breaks up with you, you go
to a therapist, she asks you what happened.

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:15.500
You tell the story, she intervenes, you say
it differently.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.260
A week after, what happened, you tell a different
story.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.110
After five meetings, you have a different
version of the reality.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.190
That is powerful because it means that we
control the narrative that we have.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.649
We don’t really have to be confounded to
the story that we experienced.

00:28:28.649 --> 00:28:29.679
We can actually change it.

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:34.940
That’s what the brain is for, to simulate
and change and adjust and synthesize better

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.299
version of life.

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:37.659
We can make ourselves happy.

00:28:37.659 --> 00:28:40.370
We can make bad things look better.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:46.309
We can control things and it’s all by virtue
of just telling a story, looking it differently,

00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:47.350
and saving it again.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.350
It’s as simple as that.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.399
We have the ability to actually change a story
all the time.

00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:55.090
Learning is one way to do that.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.120
Thinking and reflecting about ourselves is
another way to do that.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.809
Having more experiences allows us to do that.

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:00.370
We know all of these now.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:05.049
Suddenly, there’s essence to this self-help
book that we read when we were kids and we

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:07.100
know how to implement that.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.570
I become a preacher but …
Tom: No, but I love it, I love it, and I hope

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:17.429
people are listening to your sermon because
like that is the most important thing anybody

00:29:17.429 --> 00:29:23.150
struggling to have success should know is
the narrative that you tell yourself about

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:27.220
yourself is the most important thing you have.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:34.759
If you tell yourself a story of struggle,
inadequacy, not being good enough, failure,

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:39.450
like all of that, then that’s going to reinforce
because that literally becomes your identity.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.450
Going back to what you’re saying at the
very beginning, you’ve got people and they’re

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.279
justifying why they made some choice, right.

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:49.610
When you said do you want the fish or the
steak, dude, inside I was like my narrative

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:53.010
as a human being is I’m the guy who chooses
the steak, right.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.740
I know that isn’t even difficult.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.380
It would’ve been easier if you said steak
or cake because I’m really the guy that

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.750
chooses steak over cake.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.779
It’s like that’s pure narrative.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:06.049
That’s what I want to tell myself.

00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:10.440
The big breakthrough in my life, the big breakthrough
on a map of my timeline if you were going

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.340
to put a demarcation point, it is the day
I stopped thinking of myself as smart because

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.539
I wasn’t, and I started thinking of myself
as a learner.

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:21.809
That changed everything because now the narrative
that I was reinforcing, the memories I was

00:30:21.809 --> 00:30:27.200
pulling out changing just a little bit and
then putting back all revolved around reimagining

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.370
myself as somebody who learns faster than
other people, is willing to learn, will put

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.090
in the time and the effort to learn.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:39.340
It became this identity which was anti-fragile,
right, because now you could tell me I was

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.340
stupid and it didn’t matter.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.340
It didn’t hurt me.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.340
It just compelled me to learn more.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.590
The reason I shook your hand earlier is I
really am moved when you say I was wrong about

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.590
that.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.590
I should’ve done this.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:54.240
Any time people can say that, can just own
a mistake and see a better solution, that’s

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.379
somebody who’s polishing a self-image in
a way that’s anti-fragile that the more

00:30:58.379 --> 00:31:03.289
they look at that failure, the harder they
go in an even better direction.

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:04.289
It’s really incredible.

00:31:04.289 --> 00:31:05.289
All right.

00:31:05.289 --> 00:31:10.639
I want to ask you all the questions that I
get asked to which I have no answer and I’m

00:31:10.639 --> 00:31:13.419
hoping … because I get asked these questions
a lot.

00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:14.460
All right.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.030
Number one, how can I get more motivation?

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.740
It’s the one thing because I’ve never
lacked motivation.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.500
I don’t know how to help people.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.090
Moran: Tough.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.320
Here’s how I would think about it.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.390
Motivation is a word, right.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:39.169
It’s a label that we put, set of events
in our brain.

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:41.409
What you actually want is the outcome of that.

00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:44.389
You want to do things when it’s held.

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:48.240
I think there a few things that we know work.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.700
One is evidence of past successes.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:57.240
If I say to you and go back to your memories
and I reframe them as successes, suddenly

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.759
the current event that’s the same is a success.

00:31:59.759 --> 00:32:03.940
I think one thing is having success stories
and identification [inaudible 00:32:02].

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.381
There’s a lot of people out there.

00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:10.150
There was a person that is like you that had
similar experience and chose the thing that

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.509
you want to choose.

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:14.300
Find this person or this people and it’s
going to rub into you.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:20.260
I get asked by my students often how do I
become funnier, how do I become smarter like

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.260
by [inaudible 00:32:21].

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.190
What I give them all the time is surround
yourself with people that you want to be like.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.190
You want to be funny?

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.519
Just sleep next to comedians.

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:30.770
Just go within the same room they are and
just sit with them.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.600
Its’ going to rub onto you by osmosis because
it’s the environment that surrounds us that

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.429
really changes everything.

00:32:37.429 --> 00:32:41.039
Other people said that before but I’ll tell
you what the neuroscience behind it.

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:48.029
We know now that brains interact with each
other through language in a way that synchronizes

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:49.179
the brains.

00:32:49.179 --> 00:32:53.440
When I talk to you right now, if you’re
engaged with what I say, it means that if

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.980
we scan our brain right now, our brains are
going to look alike, more than yours and someone

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.470
on the street that isn't here.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:05.940
Two people in the same room, as soon as they
interact, their brains literally start to,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.919
if you want, pulsing in the same way.

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:11.340
Part of their brain light up in the same way,
parts shut down.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.390
This is how we affect each other.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.700
This is how communication made humans who
they are.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.889
This is the one thing that makes us better
than all the other animals because we are

00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:22.200
able to communicate using language, affect
each other’s brain and create narrative

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.260
that only exist together.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.620
We both believe in things that we’ve never
seen before like God or ideas that’s like

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.330
democracy or money, like those things we invented,
we can communicate them and create this image

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.870
in people’s brains, and they all share this
thing.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.789
In the same way, if you surround yourself
by people that you want to be like, you hear

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:43.929
them communicate, they change your brain,
and it’s going to rub onto you.

00:33:43.929 --> 00:33:47.480
You’re going to actually become funnier
if you sit and listen to funny people next

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480
to you.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.440
You’ll actually become more motivated if
you’re next to people that are motivated.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.860
The next version of that, if you cannot find
them, if you're sitting right now in the rural

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.110
part of Alaska and you can’t just find yourself
in Los Angeles with the people you want to

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.770
be with, is to actually just look at them
on videos, on books.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.900
That’s the way our brain basically gets
content and change.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.300
Changing brains happens in many, many ways
but the easiest one that anyone can try is

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.929
to say what kind of world I want to be in
and bring this world to you in the form of

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:17.579
movies, stories, TV shows, all people.

00:34:17.579 --> 00:34:22.450
That’s the ways to get things that you want
next to you.

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:27.679
Tom: Do you think when you’re doing that
that you’re getting into a repetitive brain-firing

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.780
pattern that ultimately wires?

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.149
Moran: You actually change your brain.

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:35.179
We didn’t mention that the science behind
it match like in terms of what we do.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:39.290
We put electrodes in people’s brains and
we look at their brains while things happen

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.290
to them.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.350
We actually see it in action.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.720
We see how the brain changes when people communicate.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.609
We see how the brain looks.

00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:50.079
When you watch a movie, we see how your brain
aligns with the movie.

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:53.220
When you tell someone else the story about
the movie, their brain aligns with your brain

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.130
but aligns also with the brain of the director
of the movie.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:35:01.310
Communication is this mechanism by which information
flows between brains and changes the brain.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:06.320
Actually, if you want to take it one step
above, this is also how we change ourselves

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.820
because we [inaudible 00:35:06] all the time.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.270
You drive your car or you walk to work and
you’re just alone with yourself and you

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.900
communicate, you also change your brain.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.430
You solidify the things that you want to be
more like and you suppress the ones you don’t

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.430
want.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.430
We always talk.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.930
Those voices, those are basically the other
characters in our brain that talk to each

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.930
other.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.079
You can choose which ones to give more weight
to so this is how you become the better person

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:31.079
you want to be.

00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:35.650
We actually now play with things that change
behavior during the night when you’re sleeping

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.410
in the following way.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.010
[crosstalk 00:35:37]
This is another new thing from the last 10

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:50.730
years in neuroscience that was finally discovered
which is you can learn change and transfer

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.730
overnight.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.940
If you look at the night if you go to sleep
for eight-hour sleep, it’s not a uniformed

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.940
experience.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.400
It’s not really just to fall asleep and
you spend eight hours in the same state.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400
You actually have phases.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.819
We call them stages and cycles.

00:36:03.819 --> 00:36:07.440
There have different things that’s happening
in them and one of them is the stage where

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.440
you’re dreaming.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:13.220
That’s when our brain basically simulate
future options and shows us a movie of things

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.630
that could happen and allow us to live through
them, thinking the realities, the ultimate

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:18.630
VR.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.540
We actually live life thinking that we’re
there, thinking how it would be to live with

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.609
her in Alaska or to quit the job and move
to Vancouver.

00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:29.349
Really that experience filled it to our emotions
and then wake up with the answer what to do.

00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:30.349
This is one stage.

00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:33.390
There’s another thing stage that’s really
interesting, Stage 3 and 4 of the sleep.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.390
We call it slow-wave sleep.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:38.450
It’s a stage of the night where your brain
essentially takes all the experiences from

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:44.450
the day before and waits them, and chooses
which ones to keep and which ones to take

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.450
out.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:49.480
If you think about life when you go through
your day, there are many, many moments you

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480
call the present.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.500
About every one-and-a-half second you have
a different present, and then it goes in the

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.500
past.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.500
It becomes a memory.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.380
You go to the next moment and you live it
and then you store it in the memory.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:04.110
Then when you go to sleep, your brain looks
at all those 50,000 moments that you had.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.200
It says, okay.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.369
When I walk from home to the bank, I had 20
of those moments.

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:09.369
They’re not really important.

00:37:09.369 --> 00:37:10.609
I should compress them into one.

00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:11.609
Keep just one.

00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:12.750
Remove the others.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.691
When I kissed her, it was a moment that I
want to remember every fraction of so I want

00:37:16.691 --> 00:37:21.300
to keep all of them individually like one
big stock of experiences.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.619
Your brain does it.

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:23.990
You’re in slow-wave sleep during this mode.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.140
You choose out of all of them and picks the
ones that’s important.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.190
What we learned in the last five years, 10
years, is that it can actually do things to

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.700
you at this stage.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.210
When you’re sleeping, it will make you change
the pointer.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:40.470
We can choose for you to focus on the walk
to the bank rather than the kiss, and in doing

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.240
so, we’re going to basically make you strengthen
those memories at the expense of others.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.480
We do that by using smells or sounds that
we play to your ears.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.480
In the right moment, the smell of the …
Tom: You judge that right moment because you’re

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.630
actually watching like [inaudible 00:37:55]
[crosstalk 00:37:54]

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.630
Moran: It has to be done.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.200
The important thing is you can’t do that
at home.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.390
You can’t just spray the smell and do it
all the time.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.780
You have to do it in the right moment because
if you just spray in the room, it’s going

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.780
to wash out.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.550
You have to target the brain at the right
moment, but then the brain is going to say

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.359
I smell this thing.

00:38:08.359 --> 00:38:12.550
This means that I want to focus on this moment
and strengthen that.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.470
What the experiments that we are doing and
others are doing right now show is that you

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.109
can actually make a person learn things when
they’re sleeping.

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:20.380
You can actually change their behavior.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.480
You can make them choose to focus on different
behaviors that they want to change and wake

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.829
up not doing these things.

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:27.000
You can actually do things.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.910
The classic experiment that was really popular
in the last three years since 2015 was people

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.430
come to lab and they’re smokers and they
want to sleep.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.300
They go to sleep for two hours.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.720
The experiment just wait for the moment when
they’re brain is in this state when it’s

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.079
listening to the outside world and reassessing
life.

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:49.570
They spray the smell of nicotine into their
nose making their brain think, okay, out of

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.530
all the memories I have, let’s focus on
those that have to do with smoking.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.970
Then immediately after, they blast the brain
with a smell of rotten eggs which basically

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:02.930
makes the brain rewire and take nicotine and
wire it with like bad experiences.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.020
You do that a few times.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.010
When they’re sleeping, they wake up, they
have no idea what happened.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.520
Then suddenly, they say, "I don’t really
want to smoke anymore."

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.359
For a few days they actually changed their
behavior.

00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:12.480
They don’t want to smoke, not knowing what
happened.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.890
They just came, took a nap, wake up, and they
don’t want to smoke.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.700
This is change in behavior neuroscience.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.640
You find the moment, you hit the brain with
it, you change the wiring, and the person

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.020
wakes up a different person.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.020
Tom: That is amazing.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.790
Do people freak out about that like good or
bad?

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.230
Moran: The answer is they do but they shouldn’t.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:33.420
I have an analogy that’s going to be the
way I look at it.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.319
Go back 406 years ago, 1610.

00:39:37.319 --> 00:39:41.990
Galileo Galilee points his telescope to the
moons of Jupiter and he looks at the orbit

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.930
and he expected it to go in one way but it
doesn’t.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.580
It goes in a different way.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.950
He tries to understand what’s going on there.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:54.099
The only way to solve the equation is to realign
the planets of our Milky Way galaxy and specifically

00:39:54.099 --> 00:39:58.819
the solar system by putting the sun in the
center and put earth as the number three planet

00:39:58.819 --> 00:40:02.410
in the system which to him is the [inaudible
00:40:03] of humankind.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.410
What does it mean?

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.030
That we’re just one more planet out of many?

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.110
We’re not the center.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.760
It feels horrible to him.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760
It changes everything.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.910
The equations require that so he does it.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.579
In doing so, he basically allows us to now
see the wide [inaudible 00:40:15] universe.

00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:19.910
Suddenly we see that the universe is much
bigger than we imagined and we can explore

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:20.910
it.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:24.880
In the next 400 years, we saw more of the
universe and we learned a lot about what is

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880
out there.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.520
Now in the same way, in the last five years,
we’re beginning to understand that in our

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.220
own brain, there are many, many voices and
we are not the most important one.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.510
We’re not even the center.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.290
We’re just one more voice out of many in
our head and we’re the one who think that

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.290
they’re the most important.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.809
Actually, the quiet ones that don’t really
talk to us are the center of our universe.

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.980
Now, this to us, again, feels like a [inaudible
00:40:48] of humankind.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.619
What does it mean that I’m not the center
of my own universe?

00:40:49.619 --> 00:40:53.130
The reality is that this will allow us to
understand the most important and interesting

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.020
thing in the universe which is us.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.250
That’s I think a profound understanding.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:02.651
Yes, it’s scary that we’re not responsible
for our choices that happen to us, that we

00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:06.400
are creating a narrative based on things that
we’re not really full in control.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.150
That’s the beauty of us because now we can
actually explore more things in our brain

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:15.349
and learn how things happen, and maybe we’ll
understand how to become better people.

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:16.900
Tom: It’s really interesting.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.550
Moran: I somehow ended up being a preacher
tonight.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.460
I have no idea how it happened but I’m going
to take it.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.460
Tom: Yes, please.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:31.810
Preach now about the self-deception, how essentially
it feels like the layer that we view is also

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:37.430
the voice … to use your vernacular, the
voice that we view as us is trying to cobble

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:42.910
together this narrative based on these decisions
that are made by the quiet voices.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:50.330
How can we leverage that to either just tell
ourselves a more empowering story or to actually

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:57.940
get the quiet voices to do what we want them
to do that’s more in line with our goals.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:07.460
Very specifically with self-deception, how
can that become a tool that we’re using

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.559
in a self-aware way to push us forward.

00:42:09.559 --> 00:42:15.730
Moran: It is tool that we're deceiving ourselves
but we have to change the valance of the statement

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.329
to a positive one.

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:19.170
Set of deception sounds like a bad thing.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.880
This is our brain’s way of saving us.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.119
This is our brain’s … it’s [inaudible
00:42:22].

00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:25.830
It’s still not living to reality the way
it is.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:30.099
This is actually mechanisms that our brain
created to optimize the world.

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:35.819
We know that our eyes offer us only a small
fraction of all the things that the world

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.619
has but we call this reality.

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:42.079
We know that our nose smells only what’s
right here, and our noses [inaudible 00:42:42]

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:43.079
to where the smells are.

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:44.780
The smells are down here and our noses are
up here.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.740
We don’t even smell … We don’t have
it in place.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.220
All of those things may not … Our brain
deceives us.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.730
It always offers us a reality that isn’t
true.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.430
That’s great.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:00.520
This allows us to have a different view of
the universe that we get to create ourselves.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.569
On one hand, we want to know what’s out
there.

00:43:03.569 --> 00:43:09.200
That’s why we have x-ray sensors and ultraviolet
sensors because we want to actually know what

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.730
are all the rays of light that are out there
that our eyes cannot see.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:19.069
That’s why we developed all those smart
tools to hear things that are beyond the frequencies

00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:20.460
that our ear can get.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:24.750
We want to know what’s out there, but our
brain through years of illusion created this

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:28.020
set of deception that we call reality in a
way that’s perfect for us.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.730
It allows us to live life in a comfortable
way.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:35.000
Tom: One of the things you talked about along
the lines of self-deception is people are

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.150
really bad at understanding what they want
and whether they’re intentionally deceiving

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.359
themselves, intentionally deceiving you as
a researcher.

00:43:42.359 --> 00:43:47.880
One thing I get asked a lot is somebody wants
to be fulfilled.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.690
They want to find a career that they love.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.089
They want to start a company but they don’t
know what.

00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:56.369
How can people get good at understanding what
they want?

00:43:56.369 --> 00:44:00.070
Moran: I would say that the best way is to
be aware.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:03.990
Be aware meaning like [crosstalk 00:44:01]
take a note.

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:09.329
What you see actually when you look at the
brains of people, we see how few repetitions

00:44:09.329 --> 00:44:15.099
of a message does it take for your brain to
rewire and now have it solidified.

00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:17.130
We can show you eight times.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:18.450
Tom: Eight?

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:23.680
Moran: It varies but that’s the area.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:30.810
We show you eight times this person next to
this item, and first when you see this person,

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.150
this cell lights up in your brain.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.040
The cell, it codes Tiger Woods, lights up
when you see Tiger Woods.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.970
They show you Gillette, another cell lights
up.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:41.260
We start showing you the two of them together,
after eight repetitions of seeing them together,

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.250
suddenly the cell for Tiger Woods also codes
Gillette and the cell for Gillette code Tiger

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:46.250
Woods.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.370
Suddenly, the cell [crosstalk 00:44:46] and
that’s it.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.821
Eight repetitions is very little.

00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:52.910
This is the amount of time that commercials
need to be shown on TV before you say, "Okay,

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:56.230
now I know that this is the [inaudible 00:44:55].

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:02.150
That means that it’s very easy to place
in our brain things that we’re going to

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.150
change it.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:07.849
Now that we also learned that these numbers
are pretty small, we can also look at what

00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:08.849
times of the day.

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:11.160
We know that there’s times of the day where
it’s even three times.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.461
Tom: Why do you think it has to do with this?

00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:14.180
Is that like a circadian rhythm thing?

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:20.010
Is that a level of alertness tied to food
like … I’m surprised by that.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.690
Moran: All of the above.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.890
Our brain has a lot of clocks in it, if you
want.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:29.849
There’s clocks and there's environment.

00:45:29.849 --> 00:45:31.099
In a way, it’s simple.

00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:35.160
The neuroscience proves what we can do behaviorally
very easily.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:42.200
Just pay attention, learn, surround ourselves
with people that we care about, and decide

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.200
when we want to be fooled and when we don’t
want to be fooled.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.599
I think that this historian I really like
said that hundred years ago the biggest threat

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:51.569
to humanity were famine, plague and war.

00:45:51.569 --> 00:45:52.790
Basically, it’s over.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.180
Those are no longer a threat for us.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.890
If someone is hungry right now, it’s because
politically we want them to be hungry.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.890
There shouldn’t be any hunger in the world
but there is because of reasons that’s beyond

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:04.890
us.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.829
Basically, we conquered the things that we
should be … right now, it’s a lot more

00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:09.829
scary.

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:12.420
You’re a lot more likely to die from overeating
than under-eating, right.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.750
Diabetes is a lot bigger threat to us than
malnourishment.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.200
In that sense, I think we conquered a lot
of things.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.640
Now, we’re at the level we start playing
God.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.280
We’re starting to think what can we do to
the body that’s going to make it better.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.490
We have privileges.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.490
We are focusing out on happiness and what
would make us happy.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:32.069
We are extending life to its limit and now
we’re realizing that the one thing that

00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:37.050
we don’t know how to deal with is not the
extension of life but the quality of life.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:41.140
A lot of us are going to get to age 150, you
and I, but we might spend the last 50 years

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.569
not being there.

00:46:43.569 --> 00:46:49.920
Our bodies are going to be there but our brain
is going to be basically not able to do the

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.920
thinking.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:55.299
A bunch of neuroscientists, and I’m helping
a little bit, but it’s a project that is

00:46:55.299 --> 00:46:58.120
beyond me are trying to fix that.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.160
This is really the science fiction aspect.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.829
The way to fix it is not by actually fixing
the brain using drugs but by placing components

00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:06.829
of it.

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:09.850
What we’re doing right now …
Tom: With synthetic biology or …

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.890
Moran: Yes, with the chips like you basically
take a chip and you … There are positive

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:19.359
brain almost like a bridge so things come
from the in and get processed through and

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:21.480
go out.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.130
A lot of things could come in, a lot of things
could come out, but it’s finite sense.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:27.809
There is a table of millions of things that
could come in, and for them there’s a clear

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:29.010
what comes out.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:33.470
The idea is that when you’re starting to
decay, when your Alzheimer emerges, we’re

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.890
going to put electrodes in your brain and
learn how the in-looks and the outlooks and

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:39.890
learn that while you’re decaying and when
you get to the state where you’re really

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.801
no longer out there, we’re going to take
out the part of the brain that’s biological

00:47:42.801 --> 00:47:43.801
that failed.

00:47:43.801 --> 00:47:46.060
We’re going to put a chip instead.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.410
That chip is going to now take the input from
here.

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:55.710
Now you can open it to questions like is it
still me, if any of those chips bypass …

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.760
Tom: That’s being worked on right now?

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.910
Moran: It’s already working with rats.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:03.359
With rats, you can actually induce Alzheimer
and then replace the faulty parts with chips

00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:04.359
that do the mapping.

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:07.750
It's done here in Los Angeles [inaudible 00:48:07]
by guys at USC.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.819
Tom: Man, you’re really getting … It’s,
A, exciting.

00:48:11.819 --> 00:48:16.430
B, you’re opening Pandora’s Box like this
is insane.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.430
I love this show.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.790
Moran: Yeah, we should talk about ethics in
the end.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.200
Whatever you tell me [inaudible 00:48:19]
…

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.330
Tom: Let’s talk about ethics.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.430
Moran: … because there is an interesting
part.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:27.990
I’m spending my time, half my days, in a
business school.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:35.370
This could be seen like a really selling your
soul to the devil by helping people sell [inaudible

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:40.530
00:48:37] and crunch overnight to a person
who’s in phase three of their night.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.540
You can bombard their brain with [inaudible
00:48:42] crunch and they’re going to wake

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.710
up and they want [inaudible 00:48:44] and
crunch instead of less.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.150
Tom: Can we switch that to crossbars?

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.350
Moran: Please.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:53.650
The idea is that there’s like a war right
now where neuroscientists are splitting up

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.829
and they’re finding things.

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:56.849
They’re finding how to change behavior over
the night.

00:48:56.849 --> 00:49:02.700
We’re learning how we can change your biome
and make you a different person by playing

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.770
with your gut bacteria that makes you different.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.280
We know how smell affects your behavior.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.690
We can make you like this woman, not that
woman by playing different smells.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:17.210
A lot of things happening and no one is in
control of that because policymakers are slow.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:19.540
It takes them a while to create the policies.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.710
The people who are really fast are businessmen
and marketing departments.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:23.710
They are really fast.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.430
They hear about it and they say, okay, let’s
apply that.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:31.200
My students, the MBA students, are the ones
to say, "Hmm, it’s interesting."

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.290
My job … and that’s why I feel it’s
important to say it here, is to remind those

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:40.079
students how bad they felt when they saw the
6.99.

00:49:40.079 --> 00:49:41.349
They say, "Oh, come on.

00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:42.680
I feel like I’m being schooled.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.550
Someone tells me that it’s 6.99 to fool
me but I want it to be just the fair price

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.550
of $7.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:48.550
I would know.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.910
Why do they play with my …"
In 20 years, you’re going to be the guy

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:56.140
who sets the price of an item and you’re
going to have the option as well to go for

00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:00.700
6.99 and make a person buy or you can say
I’m going to be the better person.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:06.289
I’m going to not try to play on all those
biases and kind of change things.

00:50:06.289 --> 00:50:09.559
I think this is the reality we have to have
right now because scientists are going to

00:50:09.559 --> 00:50:16.309
offer you a lot of tools to do good or bad
and we have to choose as society how we play

00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:17.309
with them.

00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:19.359
Tom: Can I give you what I think is the right
answer now?

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:25.299
I’m talking to the school of management
guy and the neuroscientist here.

00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:32.200
As an entrepreneur, as somebody who’s built
a food company in particular, the answer that

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.660
I came to because I’m very much trying to
convince you to buy, and what I realized is

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:43.520
we’re living in an era where companies have
an obligation, a moral obligation in my opinion,

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.059
a moral obligation to make products worthy
of being used.

00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:52.070
If you’re making a product that actually
delivers value, and that’s so important,

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.720
and yes I get it, who determines the value.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.530
I honestly think that the companies have to
be able to look themselves in the eye and

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.619
say I believe this product is good for you.

00:51:01.619 --> 00:51:02.819
Moran: Hundred percent.

00:51:02.819 --> 00:51:07.740
Tom: If you believe that it’s good for the
person that you’re selling it to, then using

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.770
the tools and techniques to get people to
buy it that makes sense to me.

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:14.720
It all comes down to what you’re pushing
and promoting because if you’re … Think

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.430
about policymakers trying to get adoption
on even just policies like getting STD test

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:25.030
or whatever the case may be that things that
are good, not just for that person but for

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.539
society as a whole.

00:51:26.539 --> 00:51:27.539
You have to sell it.

00:51:27.539 --> 00:51:30.900
You have to get people to believe in that
thing.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:35.360
As long as that thing is good for you, I think
getting people to believe in it is all right.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.839
Moran: I think the thing that as scientist
we have to explore the world.

00:51:38.839 --> 00:51:44.160
This is why we’re here to all the options
and including the ones that will be good for

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.670
you and the ones that are going to be bad
for you, and then have you really understand

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.369
how to make a choice better yourself.

00:51:49.369 --> 00:51:50.869
Tom: That’s good.

00:51:50.869 --> 00:51:51.880
One last question for you.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.869
What’s the impact that you want to have
on the world?

00:51:53.869 --> 00:51:59.140
Moran: The one thing that I’m really good
[inaudible 00:51:55] do is find ways to take

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:03.750
complex ideas and make them into something
that is tangible for everyone.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:04.750
This is the impact that I want to be.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:13.990
I want to find ways, movies, conversations,
products, students to have everyone have the

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.990
option.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:19.210
I want everyone in the world to know enough
so they can make a decision by themselves.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.589
Tom: I love it.

00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:22.680
Moran, thank you so much…
Moran: Thank you so much.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.150
Tom: … for coming on the show, man.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.150
That was incredible.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.650
Guys, I think we all are thinking the same
thing right now.

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.930
Where can we find you online?

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:36.020
Moran: I have a website that I built in the
last couple of weeks that’s pretty good

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.020
I think.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:43.859
It has my name, morancerf.com, but, then again,
I have so many stories I told and students

00:52:43.859 --> 00:52:46.069
that take the message there.

00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:49.840
If you just look for ideas, you’ll find
me somewhere buried in them.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.840
Tom: Nice.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.589
Well, I can tell you from experience if you
drop his name in the YouTube, you’re going

00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:56.109
to get a treasure trove of amazing talks.

00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:57.109
Watch them all.

00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:58.349
They’re incredible.

00:52:58.349 --> 00:53:01.789
I hope you guys had as much fun with this
man as I have.

00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:05.200
I promise you I will be working to get him
back for round two.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.770
It is rare that I say that on the spot, but
I’m telling you I could go for round two.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.770
That will be amazing.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:15.060
I had so much fun picking this man’s brain,
the diverse way that he approaches.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.480
Everything he does is incredible.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.270
You’re going to see that as you dive into
his world.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:22.030
Watch the talks and hear him go from one subject
to another.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:27.530
He can go deep business and really like nuts
and bolts business, marketing, and then switch

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:32.561
it over and show you photos of an actual brain
with electrodes in it and what they’re learning

00:53:32.561 --> 00:53:33.561
from that.

00:53:33.561 --> 00:53:34.561
It is utterly astonishing.

00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:40.160
I have rarely seen a human being who can so
rapidly and beautifully traverse the line

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.829
between academia and business.

00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:46.359
For anybody out there that wants to be at
the cutting edge of what’s happening in

00:53:46.359 --> 00:53:48.079
marketing, you’re going to want to look
him up.

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.430
It is absolutely phenomenal.

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:55.420
From one narrator to another, as somebody
who believes in the power of story, my friend,

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.559
you have a unique ability to do it.

00:53:57.559 --> 00:53:59.500
It’s absolutely incredible.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.650
Watch him on the Moth Storytelling.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:05.069
See the stories that allowed him to win the
awards.

00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:06.400
They’re amazing.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.400
All right, guys.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.400
This is a weekly show.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.320

Hit it up.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.590
We’re doing really cool stuff on my socials.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:19.920
If you’re not already following Impact Theory,
get on it.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.940
It’s @impacttheory.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.599
Thank you so much.

00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:34.650
What a pleasure man.

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:35.650
Hey, everybody.
