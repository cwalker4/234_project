00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:02.155
THIS AMONG AND WE BEGIN THIS

00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:05.692
HALF ALEXANDRIA CORTEZ BLASTING

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:08.428
CAPITALISM THIS WEEKEND AND

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.397
CONGRESSWOMAN ON SOUTHWEST IN

00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:12.399
SOUTHWEST IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.368
&gt;&gt; CAPITALISM ISN'T TO ME IS AN

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.237
IDEOLOGY OF CAPITAL IT MEANS

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:20.207
THAT WE SEEK AND PRIORITIZE

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.909
PRORT AND ACCUMULATION OF MONEY

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.879
ABOVE ALL ELSE AND WE SEEK IT AT

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.581
ANY HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTALS

00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:30.083
COST AND TO ME THAT IDEOLOGY IS

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:31.885
NOT SUSTAINABLE AND CANNOT BE

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:33.420
REDEEMED.

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.724
&gt;&gt; AOC ALSO SAID THAT FDR NEW

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.994
DEAL RACIST IS MODERATE IS NOT A

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:44.965
STANCE, JOINING US IS JASON

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.266
NICHOLS THANKS SO MUCH FOR

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:47.368
JOINING US EXCUSE ME DO YOU

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:48.469
AGREE WITH ALC?

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.071
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:51.105
COMPLICATED THAN THE WAY SHE

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:51.605
STATED IT.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:53.908
I THINK THAT CAPITALISM AND

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.609
ELEMENT OF SOCIALISM CAN

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.544
ACTUALLY COEXIST AND I THINK

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:58.112
THAT'SES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:00:58.113 --> 00:00:58.879
PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.449
WE HAVE ALMOSTS OF SOCIALISM IN

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.017
OUR SOCIETY RIGHT NOW FROM

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:04.852
SOCIAL SECURITY TO MEDICARE, AND

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:06.287
THESE ARE SOCIALIST PROGRAMS

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:07.988
THAT EXIST WITHIN A CAPITALIST

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:09.557
FRAMEWORK SO PING --

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:17.932
THAT HER --

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.367
STATEMENT ABOUT FDR AS WELL

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:21.402
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NEW DEALS

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:22.903
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL HE

00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:24.071
ESTABLISHED WHAT WAS CALLED

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:26.507
BLACK CABINET THAT HAD MARY

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:26.874
McCLOUD --

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.609
WHO WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.810
FIGURE IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN

00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:31.479
HISTORY SO I THINK --

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.681
SHE NEEDS TO ACTUALLY DO A

00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:35.583
LITTLE BIT OF STUDY, A LITTLE

00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:37.184
BIT AND TAMPER IT DOWN JUST A

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:37.685
BIT.

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:38.953
SM YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THIS

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:40.187
IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES FOR

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:42.123
THE 2020 ELECTION.

00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:45.259
SOCIALISM ISSUES VERSUS

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.961
CAPITALISM AND YOU CAN'T REALLY

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:49.530
TIPTOE AROUND WHAT SHE'S SAYING

00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:51.632
SHE'S SAYING IT CAN'T BE

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.100
REDEEMED SO SHE MIGHT BE

00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.604
CONFUSING CERTAINS BUT BLASTING

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:58.072
CAPITALISM AND WE HAVE A

00:01:58.073 --> 00:01:59.073
CAPITALIST SOCIETY NOT A

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:00.208
SOCIALIST SOCIETY SO --

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.810
I MEAN YOU SAY SHE NEEDS TO

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.313
STUDY UP BUT WHAT ARE HER

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:07.448
COLLEAGUES GOING TO DO WHO HAVE

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:09.851
ALSO ENDORSED MANY OF HER

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:10.451
PLANS --

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:13.287
GOING INTO 2020 UP AGAINST

00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:14.822
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO WAS,

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:15.823
OBVIOUSLY, A CAPITALIST?

00:02:15.824 --> 00:02:16.658
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.127
I MEAN, I THINK THAT SOME OF

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:21.362
HERREN PLAYS ARE NOT HE ISLY BAD

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:22.397
THERE'S SOME THAT HAD,

00:02:22.398 --> 00:02:24.866
OBVIOUSLY, NEEDS SOME WORK I

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:25.934
THINK SHE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:27.202
I THINK THE GREEN NEW DEAL FOR

00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:27.969
EXAMPLE WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.237
PUT OUT THERE.

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:30.939
BUT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A WHOLE LOT

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.606
OF TWEAKING.

00:02:31.607 --> 00:02:40.582
I DO THINK AGAIN, THAT NORDIC

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:44.419
MODEL IS SOCIAL DEMOCRACY THAT'S

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.854
DIFFERENT THAN DEMOCRATIC

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.122
SOCIALISM THAT'S WHAT THEY DON'T

00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:48.890
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:50.258
TERM THEY'RE USING BUT AGAIN

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.060
HAVING MEDICARE, HAVING HEALTH

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:53.962
CARE FOR PEOPLE HAVE A CLEAN

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:56.231
ENVIRONMENT, THOSE CAN EXIST

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:58.467
WITHIN A CAPITALIST FRAMEWORK

00:02:58.468 --> 00:03:01.203
AND WE DOAPGHT HAVE TO SCARED OF

00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:01.837
SOCIALISM.

00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:05.273
&gt;&gt; SPES SHE HAS SPECIFIC PLANS

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:08.911
THIS IS FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL AND

00:03:08.912 --> 00:03:10.078
INSURANCE INDUSTRY GREEN DEAL,

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.447
YOU KNOW   4 TRILLION DOLLARS

00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.116
THIS IS A SPECIFIC PLAN NOT JUST

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:15.284
OH WE CAN HAVE SOME PARTS OF

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:15.851
THIS.

00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:22.391
YOU KNOW, SO ALL SOCIALIST

00:03:22.392 --> 00:03:23.225
PROGRAMS LEE CARTER.

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:24.793
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:28.964
THINGS THAT IS INTERESTING TO ME

00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:31.099
ABOUT OCASIO-CORTEZ PEOPLE ARE

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.334
DISMISSIVE SAYING SHE NEEDS TO

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:33.502
READ UP XEPGHT UNDERBENEATH ALL

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:34.736
OF THIS THERE'S A MOVEMENT RIGHT

00:03:34.737 --> 00:03:39.341
AND WE'RE SEEING --

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:40.576
POLLING BERNIE SANDERS IS UP

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:42.444
THERE WITH POLLING AND A UP

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:44.313
THERE WITH CORTEZ HER POLICIES

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:45.914
ARE CAPTURING THE HEARTS AND

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.283
MINDS OF A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE A

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:48.818
LOT OF VOTERS OUT THERE.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.985
AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN

00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:52.121
JUST BE DISMISSIVE OF THEM SAY

00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:54.523
SHE HAS TO READ UP OR THEY'RE

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:56.125
INCORRECT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:58.093
HAVE ALTERNATIVE AND STRATEGIES.

00:03:58.094 --> 00:03:59.962
ALTERNATIVE IS TO BASICALLY

00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:01.063
ENCORDIAL POSES IS FUEL

00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:02.064
PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY OF

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:03.632
NATURALS GAS, AND GASOLINE

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.335
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS

00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:07.736
INEXPENSIVE THAT HELPS POOREST

00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:09.605
OF THE POOR BY KEEPING COSTS LOW

00:04:09.606 --> 00:04:11.173
AND CREATES LITERALLY MILLIONS

00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:12.742
OF JOB MISS THIS COUNTRY AND

00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:15.311
WITH NATURAL GAS IT IS REDUCED

00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:16.445
EMISSIONS OUT OF POWER PLANTS IN

00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:17.046
THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:19.248
SO THAT'S WHY WE FOCUS ON THIS

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.152
SPECIFIC --

00:04:23.153 --> 00:04:24.553
WELL I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN --

00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:28.224
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T JUST SAY THIS BROAD

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:29.525
STROKE AND YOU KNOW SHE HAS THE

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:31.227
RIGHT IDEA AND WE HAVE SOCIALISM

00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:32.094
ALREADY.

00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:35.231
THIS IS SPECIFIC PLANS THAT MAKE

00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:36.465
NO SENSE.

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:38.334
BUT WHAT REALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:39.869
LOOKING AT IS BUMPER STICKER

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.537
POLITICS BY THE WAY THAT'S HOW A

00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:42.905
LOT OF CANDIDATES WIN AND SO IF

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:44.740
YOU COME UP WITH TERM OF SOUND

00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:46.175
GOOD MEDICARE FOR ALL THAT'S

00:04:46.176 --> 00:04:48.211
LIKE ME I'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE

00:04:48.212 --> 00:04:49.312
SAME INSURANCE THAT ANY

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:50.046
GRANDMOTHER HAS EVERYTHING IS

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:53.816
PAID FOR THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC

00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:55.151
WITHOUT IMPLICATION.

00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:57.086
ALL YOU SAY IS MEDICARE FOR ALL

00:04:57.087 --> 00:04:59.956
IS ABOLISHMENT OF ALL PRIVATE

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:01.224
INSURANCE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT'S

00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:02.658
ALL OF THE PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.493
WHO WERE GOING OUT TO VOTE.

00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:05.628
MAYBE SOME OTHER CANDIDATE COMES

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:06.862
UP WITH A PLAN BUT BERNIE

00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:08.631
SANDERS AND A THE PLAN THAT MOST

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:09.365
OF THESE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:11.868
HAVE SIGNED ON TO IT DOES

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:12.735
ABOLISH PRIVATE INSURANCE IN

00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:13.603
THIS COUNTRY ANDS THAT'S NOT

00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:15.037
WHAT A MEDICARE IS.

00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:16.005
NO IT'S NOT.

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:16.606
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT --

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:18.040
IT IS NOT.

00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.876
IT DOESN'T POLL THAT WAY IT

00:05:19.877 --> 00:05:21.611
POLLS 20 PERCENTAGE POINTS

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:24.580
ALMOST 20 PERCENTAGE POINTS LESS

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.115
WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE IT GETS RID

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:26.683
OF PRIVATE INSURANCE.

00:05:26.684 --> 00:05:28.985
&gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T GET RID OF PRIVATE

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:31.254
INSURANCE IT DOESN'T --

00:05:31.255 --> 00:05:32.789
IT DOESN'T GET RID OF PRIVATE

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.691
INSURANCE MEDICARE FOR ALL CAN

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:35.925
COEXIST WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:39.196
LOOK IF YOU WANT A NOSE JOB OR

00:05:39.197 --> 00:05:40.764
COSMETIC --

00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:43.033
THING, YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.167
USE YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE PAY

00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:45.335
YOUR PRIVATE INSURANCE TO GET

00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:46.736
KINDS OF THINGS DONE.

00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:49.306
MEDICARE FOR ALL AND PRIVATE

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.707
INSURANCE CAN COEXIST THIS KIND

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:52.275
OF DEAL SOMETHING THAT SHE'S

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:52.709
TALKING ABOUT.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.311
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:54.611
RIGHT.

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:55.712
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:55.713 --> 00:05:57.547
BUT I'VE READ THE BERNIE SLAM.

00:05:57.548 --> 00:05:58.949
THIS IS A JOKE MAYBE THAT

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.116
SOMEBODY ELSE COMES ALONG WITH

00:06:00.117 --> 00:06:01.384
ANOTHER PLAN.

00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:04.654
BUT THE BERNIE SANDERS BILL THAT

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:08.158
KAMALA HARRIS ELIZABETH WARREN,

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.627
CORY BOOKER SIGNED ON TO IT DOES

00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:11.795
MAKE PRIVATE INSURANCE ILLEGAL

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:13.029
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.898
IF IT COMPETES WITH THE

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:16.633
GOVERNMENT PLAN IT SHALL AND

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.468
THAT IS CHAPTER AND VERSE, SO

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:20.270
THAT'S THE WAY IT STANDS NOW AND

00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.172
BY THE WAY NO INSURANCE PAYS FOR

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.306
PLASTIC SURGERY TRUST ME ON THAT

00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:24.407
YOU HAVE TO PAY OUT OF YOUR

00:06:24.408 --> 00:06:24.741
POCKET.

00:06:24.742 --> 00:06:25.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:29.546
&gt;&gt; JASON, I WANT TO ASK WHICH

00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:31.548
WAY ARE DEMOCRATS GOING IN 2020

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:32.682
PRIMARIES ARE THEY GOING TO END

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.518
UP WITH SOMEONE VERY MUCH ON THE

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.953
LEFT OR ARE THEY GOING TO END UP

00:06:36.954 --> 00:06:39.823
WITH A MODERATE LIKE JOE BIDEN

00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:40.657
THAT'S YOUR PREDICTION?

00:06:40.658 --> 00:06:42.626
