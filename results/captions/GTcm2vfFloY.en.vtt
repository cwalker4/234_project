00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.319
Top 10 Most Famous Thought Experiments

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.860
10.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.009
The Trolley Problem

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.980
One of the most well known thought experiments
in the field of ethics is the “Trolley Problem,”

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.110
which goes something like this: a madman has
tied five innocent people to a trolley track.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.270
An out of control trolley car is careening
toward them, and is moments away from running

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.270
them over.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.040
Luckily, you can pull a lever and divert the
trolley to another track.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.720
The only problem is that the madman has also
tied a single person to that track.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.320
Considering the circumstances, should you
pull the lever?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.440
What it Means:
The trolley problem was first proposed by

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.330
the philosopher Philippa Foot as a means of
critiquing the major theories in ethical philosophy,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.690
in particular utilitarianism, the system which
proposes that the most moral decision is always

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.540
the one that provides “the greatest good
for the greatest number.”

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.240
From a utilitarian point of view, the obvious
choice is to pull the lever, saving five and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.240
only killing one.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.920
But critics of this theory would state that
in pulling the lever you become complicit

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.920
in what is clearly an immoral act—you are
now partially responsible for the death of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920
the lone person on the other track.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.079
Others, meanwhile, argue that your mere presence
in the situation demands that you act, and

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.200
that to do nothing would be equally immoral.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.329
In short, there is no wholly moral action,
and this is the point.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.110
Many philosophers have used the trolley problem
as an example of the ways that real world

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.709
situations often force individuals to compromise
their own moral codes, and that there are

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.109
times when there is no totally moral course
of action.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.109
9.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.679
The Cow in the Field

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.610
One of the major thought experiments in epistemology
(the field of philosophy that deals with knowledge)

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.119
is what is known as “The Cow in the Field.”

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.700
It concerns a farmer who is worried his prize
cow has wandered off.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.929
When the milkman comes to the farm, he tells
the farmer not to worry, because he’s seen

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.770
that the cow is in a nearby field.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.240
Though he’s nearly sure the man is right,
the farmer takes a look for himself, sees

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.859
the familiar black and white shape of his
cow, and is satisfied that he knows the cow

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:56.859
is there.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.619
Later on, the milkman drops by the field to
double-check.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.609
The cow is indeed there, but it’s hidden
in a grove of trees.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.840
There is also a large sheet of black and white
paper caught in a tree, and it is obvious

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.250
that the farmer mistook it for his cow.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.159
The question, then: even though the cow was
in the field, was the farmer correct when

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.879
he said he knew it was there?

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.090
What it Means:

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
The Cow in the Field was first used by Edmund
Gettier as a criticism of the popular definition

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.879
of knowledge as “justified true belief”—that
is, that something becomes knowledge when

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.930
a person believes it; it is factually true;
and they have a verifiable justification for

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.930
their belief.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.629
In the experiment, the farmer’s belief that
the cow was there was justified by the testimony

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.099
of the milkman and his own verification of
a black and white object sitting in the field.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.960
It also happened to be true, as the milkman
later confirmed.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.330
But despite all this, the farmer did not truly
know the cow was there, because his reasoning

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.519
for believing it turned out to be based on
false premises.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.480
Gettier used this experiment, along with a
few other examples, as proof of his argument

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.739
that the definition of knowledge as justified
true belief needed to be amended.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.739
8.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.209
The Ticking Time Bomb

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.160
If you’ve paid any attention to political
discourse over the past few years—or ever

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.969
seen an action movie, for that matter—then
you are no doubt familiar with the “ticking

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.640
time bomb” thought experiment.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.969
It asks you to imagine that a bomb or other
weapon of mass destruction is hidden in your

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.439
city, and the timer on it will soon strike
zero.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.519
You have in your custody a man with knowledge
of where the device is planted.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.950
Do you resort to torture in order to get him
to give up the information?

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.500
What it Means:

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.090
Like the trolley problem, the ticking time
bomb scenario is an ethical problem that forces

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.549
one to choose between two morally questionable
acts.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.060
It is most often employed as a counter argument
to those who say the use of torture is inexcusable

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.380
under any circumstances.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.940
It’s also used as an example of the way
laws—like those the U.S. has against torturing

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.939
prisoners—will always be set aside given
extreme circumstances.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.140
Thanks to its fictionalized use in television
shows like 24, along with its constant position

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.299
in political debates, the ticking time bomb
scenario has become one of the most frequently

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.819
repeated thought experiments.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.860
An even more extreme take on the problem was
presented in a British news article earlier

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.860
this year.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.670
That version proposes that the terrorist in
question won’t respond to torture, and asks

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.970
if one would be willing to resort to torturing
the man’s wife and children as a means of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.139
extracting the information from him.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.139
7.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.269
Einstein’s Light Beam

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.850
It’s a little known fact that Albert Einstein’s
famous work on special relativity was spurred

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.690
by a thought experiment he conducted when
he was only 16 years old.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.410
In his book Autobiographical Notes, Einstein
recalls how he once daydreamed about chasing

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.740
a beam of light as it traveled through space.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.440
He reasoned that if he were able to move next
to it at the speed of light, he should be

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.720
able to observe the light frozen in space
as “an electromagnetic field at rest though

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.420
spatially oscillating.”

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.570
For Einstein, this thought experiment proved
that for his imaginary observer “everything

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.480
would have to happen according to the same
laws as for an observer who, relative to the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.920
Earth, was at rest.”

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920
What it Means:

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.350
In truth, no one really knows for sure.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.950
Scientists have long debated how this deceivingly
simple thought experiment helped Einstein

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.840
make the massive theoretical leap required
to arrive at special relativity theory.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.070
At the time, the ideas in the experiment contradicted
the now-debunked belief in the “aether,”

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.900
an invisible field through which light was
believed to travel.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.170
It would be years before he could prove he
was right, but this thought experiment was

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.360
somehow the “germ,” as he called it, for
Einstein’s theory of special relativity,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.240
one of the ideas that first established him
as a towering figure in theoretical physics.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.240
6.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.480
The Ship of Theseus

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.620
One of the oldest of all thought experiments
is the paradox known as the Ship of Theseus,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.090
which originated in the writings of Plutarch.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.120
It describes a ship that remained seaworthy
for hundreds of years thanks to constant repairs

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.500
and replacement parts.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.150
As soon as one plank became old and rotted,
it would be replaced, and so on until every

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
working part of the ship was no longer original
to it.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.960
The question is whether this end product is
still the same Ship of Theseus, or something

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.350
completely new and different.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.140
If it’s not, at what point did it stop being
the same ship?

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.550
The Philosopher Thomas Hobbes would later
take the problem even further: if one were

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.750
to take all the old parts removed from the
Ship of Theseus and build a new ship from

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.710
them, then which of the two vessels is the
real Ship of Theseus?

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.710
What it Means:

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.400
For philosophers, the story of the Ship of
Theseus is used as a means of exploring the

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.540
nature of identity, specifically the question
of whether objects are more than just the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.540
sum of their parts.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.460
A more modern example would be a band that
had evolved over the years to the point that

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.530
few or no original members remained in the
lineup.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.570
This notion is also applicable to everything
from businesses, which might retain the same

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.730
name despite mergers and changes in leadership,
to the human body, which is constantly regenerating

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.950
and rebuilding itself.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.380
At its heart, the experiment forces one to
question the commonly held idea that identity

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.770
is solely contained in physical objects and
phenomena.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.770
5.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.820
Galileo’s Gravity Experiment

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.960
One of the earliest thought experiments originated
with the physicist and astronomer Galileo.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.810
In order to refute Aristotle’s claim that
the speed of a falling object is dictated

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.630
by its mass, Galileo devised a simple mental
example: According to Aristotelian logic,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.410
if a light object and a heavy object were
tied together and dropped off a tower, then

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.230
the heavier object would fall faster, and
the rope between the two would become taut.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.510
This would allow the lighter object to create
drag and slow the heavy one down.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.770
But Galileo reasoned that once this occurs,
the weight of the two objects together should

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.960
be heavier than the weight of either one by
itself, therefore making the system as a whole

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.010
fall faster.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.820
That this is a contradiction proved that Aristotle’s
hypothesis was wrong.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.830
What it Means:

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.540
One of the most famous stories about Galileo
is that he once dropped two metal balls off

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.290
the Leaning Tower of Pisa to prove that heavier
objects do not fall faster than lighter ones.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.270
In actuality, this story is probably just
a legend; instead, it was this elegant thought

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.680
experiment that helped prove a very important
theory about gravity: no matter their mass,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.420
all objects fall at the same rate of speed.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.420
4.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.900
Monkeys and Typewriters

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.510
Another thought experiment that gets a lot
of play in popular culture is what is known

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.630
as the “infinite monkey theorem.”

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.940
Also known as the “monkeys and typewriters”
experiment, the theorem states that if an

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.920
infinite number of monkeys were allowed to
randomly hit keys on an infinite number of

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.880
typewriters for an infinite amount of time,
then at some point they would “almost surely”

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.960
produce the complete works of Shakespeare.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.670
The monkeys and typewriters idea was popularized
in the early 20th century by the French mathematician

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.870
Emile Borel, but its basic idea—that infinite
agents and infinite time will randomly produce

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.840
anything and everything—dates back to Aristotle.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.960
What it Means:

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.500
Simply put, the “monkeys and typewriters”
theorem is one of the best ways to illustrate

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.770
the nature of infinity.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.370
The human mind has a difficult time imagining
a universe with no end or time that will never

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.460
cease, and the infinite monkeys help to illustrate
the sheer breadth of possibilities these concepts

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.460
create.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.330
The idea that a monkey could write Hamlet
by accident seems counterintuitive, but in

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.940
fact it is mathematically provable when one
considers the probabilities.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.840
The theorem itself is impossible to recreate
in the real world, but that hasn’t stopped

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.990
some from trying: In 2003, science students
at a zoo in the U.K. “tested” the infinite

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.900
monkey theorem when they put a computer and
a keyboard in a primate enclosure.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.920
Unfortunately, the monkeys never got around
to composing any sonnets.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.580
According to researchers, all they managed
to produce was five pages consisting almost

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.050
entirely of the letter “s.”

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.050
3.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.670
The Chinese Room

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.830
The Chinese Room is a famous thought experiment
first proposed in the early 1980s by John

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.300
Searle, a prominent American philosopher.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.860
The experiment asks you to imagine that an
English speaking man has been placed in a

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.310
room that is entirely sealed, save for a small
mail slot in the chamber door.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.560
He has with him a hard copy in English of
a computer program that translates the Chinese

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.560
language.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.330
He also has plenty of spare scratch paper,
pencils, and file cabinets.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.830
Pieces of paper containing Chinese characters
are then slipped through the slot in the door.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.070
According to Searle, the man should be able
to use his book to translate them and then

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.700
send back his own response in Chinese.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.110
Although he doesn’t speak a word of the
language, Searle argues that through this

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.270
process the man in the room could convince
anyone on the outside that he was a fluent

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.110
speaker of Chinese.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.270
What it Means:

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.090
Searle conceived the Chinese Room thought
experiment in order to refute the argument

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.790
that computers and other artificial intelligences
could actually think and understand.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.631
The man in the room does not speak Chinese;
he can’t think in the language.

00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:12.800
But because he has certain tools at his disposal,
he would be able convince even a native speaker

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.570
that he was fluent in it.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.440
According to Searle, computers do the same
thing.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.060
They don’t ever truly understand the information
they’re given, but they can run a program,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.790
access information, and give a clear impression
of human intelligence.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.790
2.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.020
Schrodinger’s Cat

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.890
Schrödinger’s Cat is a paradox relating
to quantum mechanics that was first proposed

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.170
by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.700
It concerns a cat that is sealed inside a
box for one hour along with a radioactive

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.320
element and a vial of deadly poison.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.510
There is a 50/50 chance that the radioactive
element will decay over the course of the

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.510
hour.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.650
If it does, then a hammer connected to a Geiger
counter will trigger, break the vial, release

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.750
the poison, and kill the cat.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.750
Since there is an equal chance that this will
or will not happen, Schrödinger argued that

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.930
before the box is opened the cat is simultaneously
both alive and dead.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.960
What it Means:

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.620
In short, the point of the experiment is that
because there is no one around to1 witness

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.820
what had occurred, the cat existed in all
of its possible states (in this case either

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.320
alive or dead) simultaneously.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.490
This notion is similar to the old “if a
tree falls in the woods and there’s no one

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.440
there to hear it, does it make a sound?”

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440
riddle.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.640
Schrödinger originally conceived of his theoretical
cat in response to an article that discussed

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.670
the nature of quantum superpositions, a theory
that defines all the possible states in which

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.600
an object can exist.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.460
Schrödinger’s Cat also helped to illustrate
just how weird the rules of quantum mechanics

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.710
really were.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.490
The thought experiment is notorious for its
complexity, which has encouraged a wide variety

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.560
of interpretations.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.190
One of the most bizarre is the “many worlds”
hypothesis, which states that the cat is both

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.800
alive and dead, and that both cats exist in
different universes that will never overlap

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.320
with one another.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320
1.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320
Brain in a Vat

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.900
There has been no more influential thought
experiment than the so-called “brain in

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.370
a vat” hypothesis, which has permeated everything
from cognitive science and philosophy to popular

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.410
culture.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:10.080
The experiment asks you to imagine a mad scientist
has taken your brain from your body and placed

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.910
it in a vat of some kind of life sustaining
fluid.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.350
Electrodes have been connected to your brain,
and these are connected to a computer that

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.840
generates images and sensations.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.820
Since all your information about the world
is filtered through the brain, this computer

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.350
would have the ability to simulate your everyday
experience.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.430
If this were indeed possible, how could you
ever truly prove that the world around you

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.650
was real, and not just a simulation generated
by a computer?

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.740
What it Means:

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.060
If you’re thinking this all sounds a bit
like The Matrix, you’re right.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.590
That film, along with several other sci-fi
stories and movies, was heavily influenced

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.010
by the brain in a vat thought experiment.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.670
At its heart, the exercise asks you to question
the nature of experience, and to consider

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.020
what it really means to be human.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.150
The idea for the experiment, which was popularized
by Hilary Putnam, dates all the way back to

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.990
the 17th century philosopher Rene Descartes.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.440
In his Meditations on the First Philosophy,
Descartes questioned whether he could ever

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.860
truly prove that all his sensations were really
his own, and not just an illusion caused by

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.300
an “evil daemon.”

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.200
Descartes accounted for this problem with
his classic maxim “cogito ergo sum” (“I

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.760
think therefore I am”).

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.230
Unfortunately, the brain in a vat experiment
complicates this argument, too, since a brain

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.600
connected to electrodes could still think.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.950
The brain in a vat experiment has been widely
discussed among philosophers, and many objections

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:31.170
have been raised over its premise, but there
is still no good rebuttal to its central question:

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:44.089
how do you ever truly know what 

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:47.230
is real?
