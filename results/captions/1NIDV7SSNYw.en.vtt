00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
good evening everybody this is the long

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.770
awaited update to my win roulette nearly

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.960
every time video series we're going to

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.940
condense it clean it up we actually have

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.929
a real roulette table and a real cheap

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.770
mini roulette wheel we have my lovely

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.720
assistant Shao lei shall be our dealer

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.689
tonight this is her first time being a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.359
dealer so her round of applause there

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
and basically it is going to be my take

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.040
on the martingale system video one here

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.770
will be a strait original plain

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
martingale system video two will be a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.010
little bit more of a complicated version

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.110
of it that basically lets you win three

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.539
times as much and a single sitting

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.750
however version two the more complicated

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.940
version I only recommend playing if you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.800
pretty much have the entire roulette

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.260
table to yourself so go out a less busy

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.379
time because you do not want to get

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.879
distracted during the process now for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.949
this you will have to lose seven

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.670
straight hands in a row so first round

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.590
here will be doing it based on a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.990
thousand-dollar bankroll with a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.850
thousand-dollar bankroll you would have

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.909
to lose one two three four five six

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.600
seven spins in a row to actually lose

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.909
all your money as long as you win one

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
time within seven rolls you will walk

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.049
out ahead or at least at the very least

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.159
even so shall we begin

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.729
okay play yeah bad all right now with

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.310
the martingale system it's basically

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.009
doubling up your existing bet now the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.030
only basically the only bets you can

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.520
place that you can double up your bet

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.009
and get an even payout is red or black

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.840
even our odd one through twelve Oh

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.200
scratch that not one through twelve but

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.670
basically yet just that's it red or

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.220
black or even or not sorry the layout of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.509
this table is just a little bit

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.739
different throwing me a little off

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.890
mentally off tonight

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.000
so I'm going to plus start with a bed of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.880
black and of course I have just in case

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.400
you forget red is five worth five

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.620
dollars green is worth twenty five and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.110
blue is worth 100 unfortunately I do not

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.270
have black chips but I do have blue

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.230
chips so tonight blue will be 100 so go

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.900
my bets placed let's proceed whenever

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.530
you're ready

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:46.709
okay Oh 18 right 18 red so I lost okay

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.820
which is good because I need to show you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.709
right away so I lost my $10 bet I am now

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.420
going to be placing a $20 bet

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.640
oh five right five red

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.260
yeah I lost again okay now my take on

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.420
the martingale system the martingale

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.349
system would say double up so instead of

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.439
me next you would be putting 40 however

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.689
if you modify the system just a little

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.390
bit you will only be putting 30 why

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.659
would I do 30 instead of 40 well we lost

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.299
ten if we would have won in the twenty

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.239
we would have not only won back the 10

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.180
or the 20 that we just bet we would also

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.239
win 10 extra for the original profit so

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.040
we actually get back everything we lost

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.459
plus 10 by doing 30 from this point on

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.579
you're maximizing in getting one extra

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.010
spin out of the wheel in order to win

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.799
back your losses basically if you lose

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.930
the first two now you're just in

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.450
recovery mode so while you won't win an

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.329
extra ten once all said and done you

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.129
will at least break even and get them

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.079
one extra chance if you're on a bad

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.220
streak so I'm going to doing 30 okay now

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.810
if you did the actual martingale system

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.050
you would only get six pins for out of

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:33.710
thousand-dollar bankroll o-18 ride 18

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.900
red yeah now I lost again so an

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:48.280
excellent is going to be 60 okay okay

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.669
all 24 black 24 black I win so around 60

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:20.380
yep so now I win 60 can I exchange this

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.500
please for right all red please okay

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.970
for the lower denominations it's easier

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:38.590
to keep track of if you do red there's

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.919
my sixty winnings so 10 20 30

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.900
so you replenish the $30 bet 10 20 you

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.340
replenish the $20 bet and 10 we

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.990
replenish our very original bet of $10

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.020
so we are now completely even let's

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.740
carry on all right and I recommend don't

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.139
flip-flop back and forth when you sit

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.750
down at the table choose red or black or

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.699
even or odd and stick with it

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.560
don't flip flop halfway through that

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.330
actually throws off the system you want

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.460
to stick with the same thing throughout

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.069
the whole game I'm all set

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.449
okay do it

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.150
Wow right okay so we lost again put my

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.570
$20 that up I'm ready yeah okay I'm

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.420

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.670
dealing okay let's go again

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:10.040
Oh 24 like 24 black

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.110
so can you pay you $30

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.360
thirty dollars

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.130
so three there replenish the 20 and the

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.310
tens still back on black I'm all set

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.090
Percy okay

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.700
26 black okay so now now we're finally

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.230
ahead of the game we have the $10

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.190
original net

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.020
so that's replenished but we're going to

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.360
put that in the bank over here just so

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.150
you guys can see the winnings begin to

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.040
add up all right I would like to keep my

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.380
bet on black pen and let's instead red

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.500
and black and exact them say make odd

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:13.220
and even Oh 20 like 20 black yeah I won

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.230
again so I still have my original bet

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.390
$10 bet plus 20 so we're now up $20 for

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.850
profiting $20 if we left right now we

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.600
have a nice steak dinner all right go

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:26.960
again

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.470
yep okay or enough power enough money to

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.810
buy like to the press for a month Oh

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.210
eleven lie oh there we go again

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:45.260
yeah okay profit again can you push the

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.940
roulette wheel just in a little bit I'm

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.370
not cheating I promise just aiming it

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.080
under the camera again keep my bet on

00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:02.720
black okay again okay oh my god 24:29 or

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.490
black we're still winning here win again

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:14.930
oh let her ride keep her going so we're

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:22.040
now up $40 all start a straight lie

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.630
Oh win again so now we're up $50 because

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.390
we will have to keep this dealer letter

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:37.120
ride why I was gonna try $30 place that

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.480
just to put $10 right $10 why you don't

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.720
try more money I don't try more money

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.769
because you get greedy if we lose so

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:52.230
once again the idea behind this is if

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.240
you lose then you push down your 20 so

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.980
then you win back what you lost you

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.990
break even on the BET and you win back

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.329
what you lost if you lose the 10 and the

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:10.200
20 now you lost 30 then you bet 30 if

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.550
you lose a 10 the 20 and the 30 then you

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.110
bet 60 so now if I were to win the 60

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.649
like I did earlier you win the 60 foot

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:25.019
town so you double that so that means

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:28.019
you won back the 60 array lost but say I

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:34.290
lost that 60 so now I just lost 120

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.529
dollars so what do you do you bet 120

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:38.010
dollars

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.160
I bet this 120 dollars if I win that one

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.029
I keep the 20/20 I just put down and

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:48.000
then I also get back all this money that

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.970
I lost if I lose the 120 it's an ongoing

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:57.709
process if I lose the 120 then I buy bet

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.209
240 dollars why because there's 240

00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:06.450
dollars that I had just lost so if I win

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.880
the 240 I keep my 240 plus I get back

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.470
everything if I lose the 240 this is bet

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.200
number 7 this is the make-or-break one

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.320
and while it is very possible and I've

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.529
seen it happen it is extremely unlikely

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:27.540
that you're going to win her looks use

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.870
me lose the previous six and then also

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.170
lose number seven that's the whole idea

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.410
is you're banking on within seven rolls

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.410
you're going to hit black or whatever

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.079
whatever black or red odd or even that

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:44.610
you're betting on

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.390
and the chances of losing all seven well

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.110
it's possible

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.880
it does happen on a daily basis at the

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.660
casinos the chances are you are not

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.760
going to lose seven in a row so if you

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.920
win on the 480 you keep your 480 plus

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.769
you get back everything that you've

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:15.120
already lost following me

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.110
good now here's where I was talking

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:27.230
about earlier okay this is actually a

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.079
906 this is $960 right here at the

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:32.610
beginning I said we walk in with a

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.540
thousand-dollar bankroll 960 dollars

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.410
gets you seven chances to hit your color

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.800
or honor even and still walk out with

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.709
what you at least walked in with and or

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:50.339
the extra that you that you picked up as

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:53.520
you were playing so if I were to call it

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.010
quits right now I'm after winning that

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.930
last one in getting back what I lost I

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.149
get to go home with my original bankroll

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:07.110
plus an extra 10 20 30 40 50 dollars so

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.079
what this video so far has been going

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:12.870
for 13 minutes 25 seconds so in 13

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:18.600
minutes I just profited $50 not bad

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.890
won't you say shall we yes good yes now

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.440
at the beginning I said you could do

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.880
eight rolls here's the big one right

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.480
here we'll have some blue chips in there

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.790
right this is the part where if you

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.170
decide to go this extra bit you're

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.649
sweating bullets why because instead of

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:43.110
just losing nine hundred and sixty

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.459
dollars you might end up losing one

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.070
thousand nine hundred and twenty dollars

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.630
if number eight does not pay out if you

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.640
do not win number

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.730
that's it you just lost almost $2,000

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.610
that's why I usually recommend don't

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.990
even bother going for eight the few

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.339
times that I did lose all this that's

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:17.370
when you just stop for the night go home

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.760
relax let your nerves calm come back the

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.820
next day and start all from scratch from

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.870
fret scratch there because it does not

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.900
take long to make $1,000 using the

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.060
martingale system especially ah de fide

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.380
in my end this manner

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.170
now if we would have we're going to

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.450
reset the board here now if we would

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.040
have done the actual martingale system

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:49.950
instead of going 10 20 30 60 120 240 and

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.890
480 for seven spins it would have been

00:14:52.890 --> 00:15:02.339
instead 10 20 40 80 163 24 sit back

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:06.660
Susan six forty now you would need more

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.209
than a thousand dollar bankroll if you

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.380
want to come in with a little more than

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.900
a thousand dollars that's fine but to do

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.430
the seven spins you would then need to

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:20.430
walk in with 1280 so just by doing a

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.339
full double up you have the potential of

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:25.230
losing an additional two hundred and

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.440
eighty dollars which is an extra two

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.820
hundred and eighty dollars I would

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.980
personally rather go for the 960 and

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.420
then that $280 can go to the kitty

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.490
basically for your bankroll for your

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:46.470
next visit making sense so far I sure

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.170
hope so so that is it for round one of

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:56.000
when roulette almost every time
