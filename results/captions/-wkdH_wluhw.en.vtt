00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:22.410
We start with a simple question:

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.587
"Does my pet really love me,
or does she just want a treat?"

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:27.957
(Laughter)

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:31.562
Obviously, she really loves us.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.412
Obviously, right?

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:34.753
(Laughter)

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:39.981
How do we know what's really going on
in those furry little heads?

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:41.801
Something is going on.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:45.541
Why is the question always 
"Do they love me?"

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.718
Why is it always about us?
Why are we such narcissists?

00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:50.718
(Laughter)

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:53.134
I have a different question.

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:57.502
Who are you?

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.421
That's a better question
for animals, I think.

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:05.491
We have things going on in our minds
that we tend to assume

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:08.850
are the exclusive abilities of humans.

00:01:09.654 --> 00:01:13.108
But there are other brains out there.

00:01:13.108 --> 00:01:14.903
Some of them are very big.

00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:17.263
What are they doing with those big brains?

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.892
Can they think? Can they feel?

00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:25.818
How can we possibly find a way
into that question?

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.743
Well, there are ways in.

00:01:27.743 --> 00:01:30.593
We can look at the brain,
we can look at evolution,

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:32.686
and we can look at behaviors.

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:38.440
First thing we have to realize
is that our mind is inherited.

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:41.552
Our brain comes from somewhere else.

00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:44.176
Jellyfish had the first nerves.

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:48.134
The first nerves gave us
the first spinal cords.

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:50.984
The first spinal cords
became the first vertebrates.

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:55.106
Vertebrates came out of the ocean
and started creating all kinds of trouble.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:02:01.483
It's still true that nerves of a fish, 
or a dog, or a person,

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:04.103
all are basically the same.

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:05.876
It's their organization that matters.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:09.507
But if the nerves are the same,
what does it have to say

00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:12.910
about the possibility
of mental experiences?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.624
Something like a crayfish, for instance.

00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:20.677
It turns out that you can give
a crayfish anxiety disorder

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:22.627
by giving it little electric shocks

00:02:22.627 --> 00:02:25.218
every time it tries
to come out of its burrow.

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:32.074
But if you give it the same drug that is
used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:37.307
the crayfish relaxes, mellows out,
and comes out, and starts exploring.

00:02:37.308 --> 00:02:40.221
The same thing with dogs
with obsessive compulsive disorder:

00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.188
you give them the same drugs
used to treat OCD in humans,

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:44.861
it works for them too.

00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:49.608
What does it have to say about
the parallel functionings of our brains?

00:02:49.608 --> 00:02:52.809
Do we celebrate the anxiety of crayfish?

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.679
No, mostly we just boil them.

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.448
(Laughter)

00:02:56.448 --> 00:03:01.026
Octopuses use tools,
as well as do most apes.

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:04.377
They recognize human faces.

00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:08.079
Do we celebrate
the ape-like minds of octopi?

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.383
Mostly we boil them.

00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:16.627
When grouper fish chase a prey fish
into a crevice in the coral,

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.502
they will go to where they know
a moray eel is sleeping,

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:23.749
and they will signal
to the moray, "Follow me!"

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:27.158
The moray goes. The moray
will slither into the crevice.

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:29.367
Sometimes the moray will get the fish.

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:33.165
Sometimes the fish bolts,
and the grouper gets it.

00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:34.645
It's a partnership.

00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:39.200
How do we celebrate the partnership
between groupers and moray eels?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.427
Mostly fried.

00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:43.150
(Laughter)

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.266
Sea otters use stone tools,
and sea otters take time away

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:55.757
from their own doings
to teach baby sea otters what to do.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:04:01.122
Chimpanzees use tools,
but chimpanzees don't take time to teach.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:06.250
Killer whales teach, and they share food.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.127
When we look at human brains,

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:14.050
we see that the human brain
is an elaboration on earlier brains,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.390
an elaboration that comes
through the long sweep of evolution.

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:21.755
If you look at the human brain
and a chimpanzee brain,

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:27.082
you see that the human brain
is basically a very big chimpanzee brain.

00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:31.175
It's big at least, so we can retain
a certain insecure sense

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:32.954
of our own superiority,

00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:35.464
which is the main thing 
that matters to us.

00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:40.800
But, uh-oh, there is a dolphin brain -
bigger, more convolutions.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.414
What is it doing with that brain?

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:48.470
We can see brains, but cannot see minds.

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:54.654
Yet, we can see the workings of minds
in the logic of behaviors.

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.247
These elephants 
in this family of elephants

00:05:00.247 --> 00:05:04.177
have found a shady patch under the palms.

00:05:04.177 --> 00:05:07.577
That's a good place 
to let the babies go to sleep.

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:10.116
The adults are resting too,
but they are just dozing,

00:05:10.116 --> 00:05:12.975
and they are staying
a little bit vigilant all the time.

00:05:13.454 --> 00:05:19.148
We make sense of that, because they 
make sense of the world in similar ways.

00:05:19.148 --> 00:05:21.615
They look relaxed 
because they are relaxed.

00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:22.857
They've chosen the shade

00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:26.188
for the same reason
we would choose the shade.

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:29.249
These elephants don't look relaxed.

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.541
No one would make that mistake
looking at them.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:34.746
They seem alarmed. They are alarmed.

00:05:34.746 --> 00:05:36.838
There are dangers.

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:39.096
There are people who hurt them.

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:43.164
It turns out that, if you record
the conversations of tourists

00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:46.707
and you record
the conversations of herders,

00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:48.987
who sometimes hurt elephants,

00:05:48.987 --> 00:05:51.319
and then you play it
through a hidden speaker,

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.927
the elephants ignore the tourists,

00:05:53.927 --> 00:05:59.964
but they bunch up and flee in fear
from the conversations of herders.

00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:03.750
They put different kinds of humans
in different categories.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.730
They know what's going on.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.176
They know who their friends are;
they know who their enemies are;

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:11.304
they know who their family members are;

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:14.774
they have the same
imperatives that we have.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:19.813
Whether on land or in the sea,
it's the same: stay alive,

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:23.193
keep your babies alive, let life continue.

00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:28.868
We see and understand helping.
We see curiosity in the young.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:33.183
We see the bonds of family members.

00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:38.563
We recognize affection for what it is.

00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:43.466
Courtship is courtship.

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:49.638
People sometimes still ask:
"But are they conscious?"

00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:53.658
Well, when you get general anesthesia,
you become unconscious.

00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:57.176
It means that all of your
sensory input is stopped.

00:06:57.176 --> 00:07:00.186
You have no sensation
of the world around you.

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.278
That's unconscious.

00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:03.550
When you have sensation
of the world around you,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.658
you are conscious.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.237
Consciousness is very widespread.

00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:12.127
Some people think
that empathy is a very special thing

00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:14.206
that only humans have.

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:19.159
But empathy is simply the mind's ability
to match the mood of your companions.

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.520
It's very useful, and it's very important.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.647
You have to know
what's going on around you,

00:07:23.647 --> 00:07:25.288
what everybody is doing.

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:29.170
The oldest kind of empathy
is called contagious fear.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.780
If you are with a bunch of companions,
and they suddenly all startle and leave,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.990
it's not very good for you
to be staying there,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.571
saying, "Hey, I wonder
why everybody has just left?"

00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.151
(Laughter)

00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:44.968
Through evolution, empathy has been
embellished as well.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.630
I think there are sort of
three stages of empathy.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.782
There is feeling with another:
I see you happy, it makes me happy;

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:54.958
I see you sad, it makes me sad.

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:59.117
Then there is sympathy:
I'm sorry your grandmother died.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.507
I don't feel the same way
that you do, but I sympathize.

00:08:03.888 --> 00:08:05.958
And then, there is what I call compassion,

00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.438
meaning "acting on your
feeling for another."

00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:12.948
[Human Empathy: Far From Perfect]

00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:15.959
Far from being a special thing
that only humans have,

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:18.727
human empathy is far from perfect.

00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:24.244
We round up empathic animals;
we kill them, and we eat them.

00:08:24.244 --> 00:08:26.528
And you might say,
"Well, that's just predation.

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:28.212
That is a different species."

00:08:28.212 --> 00:08:30.762
Humans are predators,

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:35.167
but we're not so great to our own
species either a lot of the time.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:40.851
I've noticed that people who know only one
thing about animal behavior know this word

00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:46.193
and that "you must never project human
feelings and emotions on other animals."

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.181
[Anthropomorphism]

00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:51.072
But I'm here to tell you
that I think projecting human emotions

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.113
and human thoughts on other animals

00:08:53.113 --> 00:08:57.839
is the best first guess
about what they are doing and why.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.813
After all, it's not terribly scientific

00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:04.013
to say they are hungry,
when they are eating,

00:09:04.013 --> 00:09:07.035
and they are tired,
when their tongues are hanging out,

00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:10.405
and then, when they are playing
and seem joyful,

00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:14.633
say, "We have no way of knowing
what's going on in their minds."

00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:16.346
Now, recently,

00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:19.536
I sort of had a conversation
with a reporter, and the reporter said,

00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:23.531
"OK, that's kind of convincing, 
but, really, how do you really know

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:26.725
that other animals think and feel?"

00:09:26.725 --> 00:09:31.067
And I thought of the hundreds
of scientific references that I read

00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:32.731
when I was writing my book.

00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:36.746
But then I realized that the answer
was right in the room with me:

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:40.974
that when my pup comes off the rug
and comes over to me,

00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:44.499
rolls over on her back
and exposes her belly,

00:09:44.499 --> 00:09:47.972
she's had the thought,
"I would like my belly rubbed."

00:09:47.972 --> 00:09:53.255
And she knows that she
can come to me, not the sofa,

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:59.495
that I will understand her request, 
and that I can get the job done,

00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:03.746
and she anticipates the pleasure
of having her belly rubbed.

00:10:03.746 --> 00:10:06.417
She can think, and she can feel.

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:09.097
And it is not much more
complicated than that.

00:10:09.097 --> 00:10:12.523
Usually, when we see animals, we say,
"Oh, look! There are elephants,"

00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:15.134
or "There are killer whales!"
or whatever it is we see.

00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:17.836
But to them, they know
exactly who they are.

00:10:17.836 --> 00:10:20.325
This is not just killer whales.

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:23.195
That one with the tall fin,
that male there,

00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:26.205
he is 36-year-old L41.

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:28.898
Right to his left is his sister.

00:10:28.898 --> 00:10:32.518
She is 42-year-old L44.

00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:37.468
They have been together for decades.
They know exactly who they are.

00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:39.579
This is Philo the elephant.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.328
This is Philo the elephant
four days later.

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:49.047
Humans not only feel grief,
humans create grief.

00:10:50.446 --> 00:10:54.696
We want to carve their teeth.
Why don't we wait for them to die?

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.394
Elephants used to live from the shores
of the Mediterranean

00:10:58.394 --> 00:11:00.668
to the Cape of Good Hope in Africa.

00:11:00.668 --> 00:11:05.079
By 1980 they still had vast strongholds
in Central and East Africa.

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:08.853
Their ranges are being fractured
and fragmented.

00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:12.278
This is the geography
of a magnificent creature

00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:15.260
that we are driving to extinction.

00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:21.200
We do much better in our own
national parks here in the United States.

00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:25.342
We simply killed 
every single wolf in Yellowstone.

00:11:25.563 --> 00:11:26.988
Then, sixty years later,

00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:30.921
we brought them back
because the elk had gotten out of control.

00:11:33.488 --> 00:11:36.130
Many thousands of people
spent many million of dollars

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.331
coming to the park to watch
the world's most famous wolves.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.267
These are the alpha trio
of a very stable pack.

00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:49.201
That one on the right there
is the breeding male.

00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:52.411
The one on the left is his mate.

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:54.370
The other one is his brother.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.872
Then, suddenly, wolves came off 
the Endangered Species Act.

00:11:57.872 --> 00:11:59.927
Congress took wolves off.

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:02.192
The wolves went to the edge of the park.

00:12:03.052 --> 00:12:04.652
Those two were shot.

00:12:04.652 --> 00:12:11.052
The entire pack, which had been so stable,
disintegrated into fighting and division.

00:12:12.722 --> 00:12:15.920
The alpha male of the most famous,
most stable pack in Yellowstone

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.121
lost his companions, his hunting territory
and his whole family.

00:12:20.121 --> 00:12:22.460
We bring them a lot of harm.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.543
One of the mysteries is:
why don't they harm us very much at all?

00:12:26.543 --> 00:12:30.025
No free-living killer whale
has ever hurt a human being.

00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:32.862
This one had just finished eating
part of a gray whale

00:12:32.862 --> 00:12:34.514
that he and his family had killed,

00:12:34.514 --> 00:12:37.443
but those people in the boat
had absolutely nothing to fear.

00:12:37.443 --> 00:12:42.075
This one had just eaten a seal that weight
as much as those people in the boat,

00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:44.624
but they had absolutely nothing to fear.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.332
They eat seals.

00:12:47.822 --> 00:12:49.972
Why don't they ever eat us?

00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:53.705
How is it we can trust them
around our toddlers?

00:12:55.015 --> 00:12:59.714
Why is it that, on more than one occasion,
killer whales have returned to researchers

00:12:59.714 --> 00:13:03.893
who got lost in the fog
and guided them miles to home?

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:08.294
In the Bahamas,

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:11.814
dolphins who were very familiar
with Denise Herzing,

00:13:11.814 --> 00:13:14.716
a researcher there,
and very interactive with her,

00:13:14.716 --> 00:13:17.009
suddenly got entirely skittish.

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:18.495
What in the world was going on?

00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:22.515
Suddenly somebody on the boat realized
that a person in the boat had died

00:13:22.515 --> 00:13:24.426
during a nap in their bunk.

00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:28.885
How could the dolphins have detected
that one of the human hearts had stopped?

00:13:28.885 --> 00:13:31.039
And why would it spook them?

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:33.916
These are the mysteries of other minds.

00:13:35.488 --> 00:13:38.884
In an aquarium in South Africa,
there was a baby bottlenose dolphin.

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.327
Her name was Dolly.

00:13:40.327 --> 00:13:43.496
One of the keepers
was on a break having a smoke

00:13:43.496 --> 00:13:46.066
outside the window to the tank.

00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:50.368
Dolly was watching him smoke.
She went over to her mother.

00:13:50.368 --> 00:13:53.826
She nursed for a couple of moments,
she came back to the window,

00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:56.874
and she released a cloud of milk
that enveloped her head

00:13:56.874 --> 00:13:58.842
like a cloud of smoke.

00:13:58.842 --> 00:14:00.387
(Laughter)

00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:06.707
Somehow, she had the idea
of using milk to represent smoke.

00:14:06.707 --> 00:14:11.688
And when we use one thing
to represent another, we call it art.

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:14.168
(Laughter)

00:14:14.168 --> 00:14:17.736
The things that make us human
are not what we think.

00:14:17.736 --> 00:14:21.938
What makes us human
is that we are the most extreme.

00:14:21.938 --> 00:14:25.772
We are the most compassionate;
we are the most violent.

00:14:25.772 --> 00:14:30.161
We are the most creative,
and we are the most destructive animals

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:33.248
ever to appear on this planet.

00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:38.228
But we are not the only animals
that love one another.

00:14:38.228 --> 00:14:44.351
We are not the only ones who care
for our mates or for our children.

00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:48.400
Albatrosses routinely fly
six to ten thousand miles

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.244
to bring back one meal for their chick.

00:14:52.244 --> 00:14:54.679
They live on the most
remote islands in the world,

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:58.461
and those islands are covered
with plastic trash.

00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:03.466
Into the sacred chain of being that gives
life from one generation to the next

00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:05.340
is our garbage.

00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:09.809
Here is an albatross chick,
who was about six months old.

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:12.719
It was about to start flying. It died.

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:15.969
It was packed with red cigarette lighters.

00:15:15.969 --> 00:15:19.763
This is not the relationship we are
supposed to have with the world,

00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:25.722
but we, with our big,
celebrated brains, don't use them.

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:30.263
Yet, when we welcome
new life into the world,

00:15:30.673 --> 00:15:33.273
we welcome them with pictures of animals.

00:15:33.273 --> 00:15:37.685
We don't paint cell phones
and work cubicles on nursery walls.

00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:39.011
(Laughter)

00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:42.333
We want to say,
"Look who is here with us!"

00:15:42.703 --> 00:15:44.811
And yet, every one of those,

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:49.361
every one deemed worthy
of being saved on Noah's Arc,

00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:53.961
is in mortal danger now,
and the flood is us.

00:15:56.204 --> 00:16:00.582
We started with a question:
"Do they love us?"

00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:05.765
We need to get outside ourselves
a little bit and ask:

00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:09.970
"Do we have what it takes

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.615
to simply let life on Earth continue?"

00:16:20.074 --> 00:16:21.212
Thank you.

00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:22.795
(Applause)
