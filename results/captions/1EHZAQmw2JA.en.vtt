00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:13.948
Good afternoon.

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:17.044
We humans are in trouble.

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:22.157
I've been a medical doctor for 17 years,

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:26.028
and I've researched
the science of human motivation.

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:30.939
I've worked with thousands of people
from all walks of life,

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.479
and I believe that we humans
are in trouble.

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:38.868
Now, why would I say such a thing?

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:42.790
When I look at the lifestyle
of my patients, of myself,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.379
or even your lifestyles,

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:48.763
we are in a state of bizarre paradox,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.020
a place of negative evolution.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.640
We have made sleep deprivation
a symbol of ambition,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.571
and rested a symbol of laziness.

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:07.532
We have made being too busy
a symbol of importance.

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:09.992
And never before in human history

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:14.002
have we had such conveniences
and such knowledge,

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:18.612
yet never before have our lives
been so stressed and unhealthy.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:22.182
So, yes, I do believe
that we humans are in trouble.

00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:24.414
But at the same time,

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:30.573
I have seen a group of humans
who are better than ever,

00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:35.955
individuals who have passion and purpose

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:39.610
and meaning and joy in their lives.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:41.575
And I've wondered:

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:45.154
what is the difference
between these two groups?

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:50.484
What does one group have
that the other doesn't?

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.525
So what do you think?

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:55.809
Is it passion?

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:58.015
Passion is a good one,

00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:01.615
but we all know passionate artists
and entrepreneurs

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:05.496
who are stuck in a rut,
unable to move forward.

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:10.907
Could it be, if we add hard work,
and now we have grit, is that it?

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:14.646
Well, grit is great but we all know,

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:21.342
all of us know hard-working gritty people
who have no joy or meaning in their lives.

00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:24.666
And when I became
a psychiatrist, I thought

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.688
it must be how you grow up.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:32.148
But increasingly, I'm seeing
people from good childhood

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:35.957
with serious anxiety,
depression, and addiction.

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:38.527
So what is it? What is this one thing?

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:42.889
It wasn't until I was in my most
challenging role,

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.169
when I became a mother
of three beautiful kids,

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.919
who are out there somewhere,

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.727
that I went and found out.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.402
You see, when I became a parent,
this is what happened to me.

00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:58.402
(Laughter)

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.291
I became overwhelmed -

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:07.732
overwhelmed with everything
I had to teach my kids and do

00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:09.544
or was told I should do.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:15.571
And I couldn't understand
how I, a Harvard-trained expert,

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:19.881
a medical director of child and youth
mental health for a whole city,

00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:24.482
was having such a hard time
raising my three kids,

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:28.322
when my mother who grew up in a village

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:31.982
and never had a chance
to go to school, not even grade one,

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:34.554
successfully raised five.

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:36.833
And I turned out OK.

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:39.153
So what was it?

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:41.093
What is that one thing?

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:42.596
I searched,

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:46.073
and I knew there was something
more natural and simpler

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:48.854
and more powerful than what I was doing.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:54.713
And I searched through the neuroscience,
the biology, the psychology,

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:56.894
and the reality of success.

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:02.385
And when I say "success",
I don't mean money or status.

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:06.464
I mean success
in all aspects of that word:

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:11.615
health, passion, purpose,
security, meaning, and joy.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:15.246
That's what I wanted
for my kids and myself.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:17.907
And I found it.

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:22.735
I found the one thing,
time and time again,

00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:27.936
that has been proven
to lead to an awesome life.

00:04:28.397 --> 00:04:35.085
And my discovery was earth-shattering
but so obvious at the same time.

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:41.551
The one thing that has been shown
to lead to an awesome life is:

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:44.008
adaptability.

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:46.338
Adaptability.

00:04:47.068 --> 00:04:49.138
Adaptability. That was it!

00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:51.579
I was so glad it wasn't the piano.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.149
(Laughter)

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.310
Adaptability, it made perfect sense.

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.000
Survival of the fittest
isn't the fastest or the strongest;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.133
survival of the fittest

00:05:04.427 --> 00:05:08.720
is the one that is the best fit
with their environment.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.019
And wherever you look,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.839
if you look at bacteria,
or plants, or animals, and humans;

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.661
and small businesses and large businesses;

00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.991
in corporations,
in governments or empires;

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.292
it is adaptability

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:30.092
that made the difference
between flourishing and extinction.

00:05:30.172 --> 00:05:34.212
Right now, humans
are being beat by bacteria

00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:38.581
because they are adapting 
to our most powerful antibiotics.

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:42.372
So adaptability is it,
and we see it everywhere.

00:05:42.372 --> 00:05:44.652
The company Netflix we all know,

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:48.703
that company used to mail
videos to people's homes,

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:51.293
and they adapted to online streaming.

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:54.073
And another company -
some of us have heard -

00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:55.323
is Blockbuster.

00:05:55.323 --> 00:06:00.304
And Blockbuster, despite its advantages
as an industry giant, didn't adapt;

00:06:00.314 --> 00:06:02.154
they refused to adapt,

00:06:02.164 --> 00:06:05.694
and they are fighting extinction
while Netflix is flourishing.

00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:08.734
Some of you may remember
the "Kodak moment,"

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:13.605
but that really was just a moment in time
because Kodak didn't adapt.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.974
And this is true for humans.

00:06:17.355 --> 00:06:21.879
The longest study
of human development to date,

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.686
the Grant Study, which spanned 70 years,

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:27.776
they looked at everything:
looks, IQ, wealth,

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:29.876
they found and I quote:

00:06:29.876 --> 00:06:32.686
"The key ingredient for well-being

00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:37.493
is the ability to make
lemonade out of lemons."

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.477
So think of your life.

00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:42.907
Think about times you were successful
and times that you failed.

00:06:42.907 --> 00:06:44.367
How did you adapt?

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:48.994
How did you adapt to a new school
or a new relationship, to a new boss,

00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:51.208
or a new computer system
in your workplace?

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:55.275
How did you adapt to the changing nature
of your life, your relationships

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:57.321
or even our own aging?

00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.348
So it was adaptability.

00:06:59.538 --> 00:07:01.568
But then I had to figure out how.

00:07:01.568 --> 00:07:05.528
How do we adapt? Why do we adapt?
When do we adapt?

00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:07.612
So, my journey wasn't over.

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:13.099
And thankfully, it was my research
in motivation that gave me the answer.

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.110
If you hang in here,
I'm going to walk you

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.275
through some very eye-opening
neuroscience of how our brain works.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.032
So, when we humans do something
that will help us adapt, like sleep,

00:07:27.482 --> 00:07:31.509
because we can't think let alone adapt,
if we're sleep deprived,

00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:33.971
we are rewarded;

00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:38.071
our brain's motivation centers are lit up

00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:40.952
with the powerful release
of neurochemicals.

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:44.182
And that is our reward;

00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:48.822
we experience a feeling
of well-being and joy.

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:53.154
And that is our signal
to go do that again,

00:07:53.164 --> 00:07:55.450
do that activity again.

00:07:55.993 --> 00:07:59.633
And if we oversleep,
we feel lethargic and guilty,

00:07:59.633 --> 00:08:03.570
or we under-sleep,
we feel tired and irritable,

00:08:03.623 --> 00:08:07.343
and those are signals not to do that again

00:08:07.343 --> 00:08:09.134
and to go get our reward.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:14.685
Now, some of you may be saying,
"Well, I like to shop, and I like to win."

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:16.671
So is that what I need to do?

00:08:16.854 --> 00:08:23.641
Yes, we are rewarded to shop
and gather, win and compete,

00:08:24.106 --> 00:08:28.715
but we are over-gathering
and over-competing.

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.805
How much stuff do we need?

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:34.937
And perfectionism
in keeping up is ruining us.

00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:40.737
That at the expense of other
very powerful adaptation tools.

00:08:41.102 --> 00:08:46.697
In fact, I believe that we humans
are so off-balance

00:08:46.697 --> 00:08:50.508
that we have forgotten
what it means to be human.

00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:55.117
In my practice, I created a metaphor

00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:59.260
to help remind myself and my patients
of what it means to be human.

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:02.218
I used to hear - I'm sure
you've all said it -

00:09:02.218 --> 00:09:04.590
that you're too busy to eat or sleep.

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:10.890
And I felt we really need to look
outside ourselves to see ourselves.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:15.806
And I picked an animal that is a mammal
that lives its life fully underwater:

00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:17.149
the dolphin.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.934
You see, the dolphin has or seems to have
what every human seems to want.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.459
They are highly
intelligent with a high IQ,

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:28.559
and they do no tutoring.

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:34.120
They, dolphins, have svelte, fit bodies,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.930
and they wear no spanx, and no fad diets.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.091
(Laughter)

00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:41.841
Dolphins have great social lives,
and they drink no alcohol.

00:09:42.611 --> 00:09:45.881
And they show compassion,
and they don't even do yoga.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.742
So how do these animals,
these creatures, do all this

00:09:49.773 --> 00:09:51.962
in their very competitive environment

00:09:51.962 --> 00:09:54.933
where they have to hunt for food
and worry about sharks?

00:09:54.933 --> 00:09:58.030
Well, they never compromise
the basics of life.

00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:01.004
My kids told me a great fact.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.703
They told me that dolphins sleep

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:08.223
by alternating their brain areas
and keeping one eye open,

00:10:08.503 --> 00:10:11.723
so they don't drown
or be eaten by a shark.

00:10:12.273 --> 00:10:18.259
Now, dolphins don't compromise the basics
because basics is how we adapt and thrive.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.785
So right now in this world,
and what I've seen,

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:24.814
there are three things
that humans are not doing

00:10:24.814 --> 00:10:26.795
that has thrown us off-balance.

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:29.046
And these can be remembered in the word

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:31.745
that is the centerpiece
of the dolphin culture.

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.445
That word is "POD."

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:36.205
So let me walk you through it.

00:10:36.205 --> 00:10:40.006
The "P." The P stands for "play."

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.346
Dolphins play every day,

00:10:43.346 --> 00:10:48.527
but humans have forgotten
that play is a basic of life.

00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:52.807
And when I say "play,"
I mean the "play" of my childhood,

00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:56.908
not the "play" I was seeing happening
with my kids and around me.

00:10:56.908 --> 00:10:59.628
Lego is a great example of that.

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:01.617
Lego of my times,

00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:05.504
I was the fifth child,
and I used to inherit broken Lego.

00:11:06.384 --> 00:11:10.089
It was simple, and it was unstructured.

00:11:10.358 --> 00:11:13.374
There were no rules,
and it was imaginative,

00:11:13.898 --> 00:11:17.207
and it was limitless
in what I could create.

00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:19.098
That's "play."

00:11:19.528 --> 00:11:24.040
The Lego of today
is like today's childhood.

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:31.085
It is constructed and complicated
and full of rules and directions.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.151
And we know the final product,
and it makes kids fragile,

00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:37.601
and it is fragile.

00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:42.860
And we get rigid and stuck and anxious
when we don't play freely.

00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:46.435
We are in trouble if we don't play.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:49.981
But if we do play, we are rewarded.

00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:54.381
Play - free play activates
that frontal part of our brain,

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.093
the very human part,

00:11:56.093 --> 00:12:00.462
and it stimulates all kinds
of pathways for abstract thinking,

00:12:00.462 --> 00:12:04.837
emotional regulation
for problem-solving, for strategy.

00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:07.763
Play makes us comfortable
with uncertainty;

00:12:07.763 --> 00:12:11.173
it makes us take risks
and learn from trial and error.

00:12:11.173 --> 00:12:14.244
Play is how we adapt.

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:17.593
So what about the "O"?

00:12:17.993 --> 00:12:19.513
The O is "others."

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:22.503
And others is why we adapt.

00:12:23.114 --> 00:12:25.233
Dolphins are exquisitely connected

00:12:25.566 --> 00:12:29.054
to their families, their groups,
and their communities.

00:12:29.304 --> 00:12:32.124
But humans have forgotten

00:12:32.124 --> 00:12:35.486
that social connection
is the basic of life.

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:41.030
When we are socially isolated,
it corrodes our bodies.

00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:43.125
We get sick.

00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:48.566
Being lonely is as much
of a risk factor for death as smoking.

00:12:49.025 --> 00:12:53.247
Tumors in cancer patients
who are lonely spread faster.

00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:55.186
And if you don't believe me,

00:12:55.186 --> 00:12:59.326
think of the worst form
of human punishment,

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:01.607
a torture that has been well-documented

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:06.547
to lead to a complete breakdown
and self-mutilation.

00:13:07.277 --> 00:13:10.788
That's solitary confinement.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.948
When we don't honor the basics,
we are in trouble.

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:20.223
But when we do, we are rewarded.

00:13:20.818 --> 00:13:25.389
Social connection, contribution,
meaningful relationships,

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:29.209
not socializing superficially
or social status

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:34.909
but meaningful social bonding
brights up our brains; it feels great.

00:13:34.909 --> 00:13:38.099
And we are rewarded,
and that is why we adapt.

00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:42.890
If you've ever wanted to give up,
and you were tired and exhausted,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.980
your connection to something
beyond yourself

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.558
is why you changed, why you adapted.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.510
So when, when do we adapt?

00:13:54.141 --> 00:13:57.131
That's the "D", that's the "downtime."

00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:00.311
So, dolphins relax once in a while.

00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:03.011
And humans have forgotten

00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:09.428
that rest and relaxation
is a basic of life.

00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:12.979
In fact, we are so on the go

00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:19.442
that stress has become the number one
health epidemic of the 21st century.

00:14:20.172 --> 00:14:21.832
We are stressed,

00:14:21.832 --> 00:14:24.562
and our bodies are releasing
stress hormones,

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:28.231
it's wreaking havoc
on our brains and our minds.

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:30.983
When we don't honor the basics,

00:14:30.983 --> 00:14:35.073
we are in trouble, and we do things
like texting, and driving,

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.979
and yelling at your kids to calm down.

00:14:38.323 --> 00:14:40.043
Sorry kids, I know I have done that.

00:14:40.043 --> 00:14:41.843
(Laughter)

00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:46.602
When we honor our biology,
and when we rest,

00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:51.840
and we give ourselves downtime,
we are rewarded.

00:14:52.648 --> 00:14:57.952
The research on mindfulness slowing down,
paying attention is outstanding.

00:14:58.185 --> 00:15:02.716
It improves our focus,
our memory, our concentration,

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:06.086
our relationships, our life satisfaction.

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:07.945
Downtime.

00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:11.335
The most progressive
companies in the world

00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:16.067
are bringing in yoga classes,
meditation rooms, and beds

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:21.157
because they know that breaks
are the moment of breakthroughs,

00:15:21.427 --> 00:15:26.757
that looking inward gives us
innovation and inspiration.

00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:29.926
So there it was - it was POD.

00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:35.588
And POD is how we adapt,
and adapt is how we thrive.

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:38.842
And once this all settled in,

00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:46.702
I was struck by the simplicity
and the beauty of it all.

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:54.054
I was struck by how kind
and generous nature is to us.

00:15:55.239 --> 00:16:00.968
And I was struck by how I had forgotten
what it means to be a human.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.283
I had made being busy
a symbol of importance

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.131
and I had been over-gathering
and over-competing.

00:16:11.131 --> 00:16:15.331
And I had thrown my life
and my kids' life off balance.

00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:21.582
And then I changed, and I adapted.

00:16:21.852 --> 00:16:27.332
It wasn't easy, but I brought POD
back into my life.

00:16:27.892 --> 00:16:31.174
And something magical happened.

00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:35.042
When I played, I found new passion.

00:16:35.622 --> 00:16:38.833
And when I connected,
I found a new purpose.

00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:43.223
And when I rested, I found my balance.

00:16:43.553 --> 00:16:45.964
And amazing things started to occur,

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.784
things I didn't think
I had the time or energy for.

00:16:48.784 --> 00:16:53.394
I began to write blogs and articles,
and people read them.

00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:57.455
And I wrote a book on POD and adaptation,

00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:00.665
and I called it: "The Dolphin Way."

00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:07.473
So my mom, she can't read very well,
and she hasn't read my book.

00:17:07.473 --> 00:17:09.046
But she asked me:

00:17:09.046 --> 00:17:12.046
why I was putting
so much science and research

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:15.556
into a book that she saw
as being common sense.

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:18.547
She was actually worried
that no one was going to read it.

00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:22.697
And the book became
a number one bestseller,

00:17:22.697 --> 00:17:25.891
and it's been translated
into multiple languages

00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:28.377
and released around in the world.

00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:34.117
My mom hadn't realized that we humans
are in the place of paradox,

00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:38.748
that we do need science
as permission for common sense.

00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:45.748
But we humans don't need to be in trouble.

00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:49.429
We can choose balance.

00:17:49.649 --> 00:17:51.838
In my office, I give prescriptions

00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:55.169
for medications, 
antidepressants, and blood work.

00:17:55.169 --> 00:18:01.530
And now, I give every single one
of my patients a prescription

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.790
for a daily dose of a POD.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.666
I have been witness to the power
of play, others, and downtime.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.151
Give yourselves that prescription.

00:18:14.151 --> 00:18:16.330
This is your prescription.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.211
Give it to yourself.

00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:21.211
Give it to your friends and neighbors.

00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:24.479
Bring balance back into your lives.

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:30.222
Bring play, connection,
and downtime back into your lives.

00:18:30.512 --> 00:18:34.302
Give it to your students
and give it to your colleagues

00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:39.266
and most of all, give it to your children.

00:18:39.963 --> 00:18:46.704
You see, we humans, we are perfect
instruments of adaptation.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:52.734
We humans are built and meant to thrive.

00:18:53.504 --> 00:18:54.944
And we humans,

00:18:55.344 --> 00:19:01.124
every single one of you
can have an awesome life.

00:19:01.864 --> 00:19:03.094
Thank you.

00:19:03.094 --> 00:19:06.054
(Applause)
