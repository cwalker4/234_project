- I made fun of them for--women
 weren't allowed to drive

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.340
to drive in Saudi Arabia,
and I was going in on it.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.041
I'm like, "Well, maybe you
should let the women drive,

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.576
'cause you guys drive like
shit," you know,

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.845
"And that"--so I was like, "Oh,
my God.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.680
"This is payback.
I'm gonna lose my head,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.082
and they're gonna blame fucking
ISIS or some shit," right?

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.437
- I've been doing stand-up
for 27 years,

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.407
so when you're doing it
this long and you start

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.977
to progress,
things in your life change.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.914
Like, my situation changed from
being this broke brown kid

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:26.519
in Canada to a doing-okay kid
in L.A. now, right?

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:30.023
Or old-ass man,
but whatever.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.290
And I get to go around
the world.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.126
That's the beauty of
what I do for a living

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.928
is I get to go around the world,
and I go to places

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:39.599
that the American media
tells you not to go to

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.101
because they want you
to be scared

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.170
and keep your moustache
like that.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.204
[laughter]

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:48.040
So recently I was in
the Middle East.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.812
I can't say which country
because I signed an NDA, but...

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.380
[laughter]

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.618
But I was there. I did a show in
this place in the Middle East.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.953
Well, I can say this.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:03.956
I was in Saudi Arabia, and--
and it was very different.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:06.058
I'd never been to Saudi Arabia
before,

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.994
because I was always scared to
go to Saudi Arabia.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.295
Everybody was like, "Saudi
Arabia."

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.897
I'm like, "Fuck you."

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.399
And that's based on watching the
news in America, and I'm like,

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.833
"Well, you better not go
to Saudi Arabia

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.569
"or they'll tie you
to two different camels

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.837
and they'll make them run away,"
you know what I mean?

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:22.141
That's all you ever hear about
Saudi Arabia is that torture

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.976
and beheadings
and they'll kill you

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.879
and watch what you say.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.979
That's all true.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.347
[laughter]

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.583
But--but you don't see it.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.151
In the Middle East,
it's very quiet.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.419
It's like, "No, don't tell
anyone what we do.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.054
Just..."

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.257
so anyway, I do the show there,
great--had a great time.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.394
There's 10,000 princes is Saudi
Arabia,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.531
so there's a lot of fucking
royalty just running around

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.532
Saudi Arabia.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:46.932
So I do a show.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.602
I'm tripped out because
when I get onstage,

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.571
the audience is segregated.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.905
Not--not like this.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.575
Not like hipsters on one side
and, you know, like--

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.545
but it's, like, it's women on
one side and men on the other.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.081
And--because they're not allowed
to be together.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.616
And I was like, "Why can't
the women be together

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.683
with the men?"

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:07.253
And this is the honest
answer I got.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.121
I thought it was
fucking hilarious.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.457
I go, "Hey, why can't the women
and the men be together?"

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.093
"'Cause they'll go crazy,
want to fuck everybody."

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.529
I'm like--
[laughs]

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.231
You're--it's not the men that
are gonna go crazy,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:20.599
just so you're aware of this.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.602
These women are lunatics
apparently,

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:28.207
and they're just
gonna fuck everybody, right?

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:29.542
So I go, "All right.
Good plan."

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.543
Right?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.546
And so we do the show,

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.914
and then one of the other
princes

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.249
who was a little more
higher up, I guess,

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.253
in the prince hierarchy,
hears about the show

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.288
and tells the other prince--
I guess,

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:44.891
who's his cousin--and he goes,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.227
"I want a private show with
Russell."

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.597
And then he comes to me at
the--they have this little

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.833
after-party for me, and you
would think, like--

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.067
you're like,
"All right."

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.402
You know, 'cause it's
Saudi Arabia,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.603
you're gonna be like,
"There's mad bitches.

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.505
They got the doors closed."

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.574
Fucking two chicks
in the whole room,

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.508
and they're, like, sisters of
somebody in there, right?

00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:05.011
You're like, "Ah, come on, guy."

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.446
And then there's guys--
guys are dancing with guys.

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:09.948
It's not--it's weird.

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:11.683
It's not, like--
but it's not like here.

00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:14.286
You know, 'cause over--here in
America, we've lost the idea

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.988
of what dancing is, you know?

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.090
White people have won
the dancing war.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.491
I mean, let's be honest.

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.961
Like, when you go to, like,
an EDM thing,

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.996
everybody's just jumping up
and down,

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:25.097
and nobody's dancing anymore.

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:26.632
That means white people won.

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:28.534
[laughter]

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.436
And it's either that
or you're just fucking

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.471
ass fucking everybody all night,
know what I mean?

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.140
[laughter]

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.141
So when I say the guys are
dancing on each other,

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:37.510
they're not like,
"Hey, bro, do it."

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.312
You know, like,
they're just--

00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:41.481
I'm not exaggerating.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.482
There was a dude doing
a dance--

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:44.784
[laughs]

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.319
It looked like a camel.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.487
That's what--that's what his
dance--his dance was this.

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:54.359
[laughter]

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:56.629
He was fucking--I was like,
"Is that how you pick up chicks

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.630
over here?"

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.131
"One hump or two?"
You know?

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.000
And then--
[laughter]

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.302
So anyway the other prince calls
this prince and he's like,

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.472
"Private show tomorrow,"
and then my brother,

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.507
who's my manager, is like,
"All right, well,

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.540
"let me talk to him,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.175
and then we can sort the details
out."

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:13.012
And I go--I go, "I'm scared
about this, 'cause we're already

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.481
here, and, you know, we already
don't know enough about these

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.650
people, but..." and then he
comes over, and he talks to

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.720
him, and he's like, "Oh, shit.
That's a lot of money."

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.488
[laughter]

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.658
So I go, "Uh, yeah, we'll do
that show, right?"

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.093
And then my brother goes, "Okay,
well, we're gonna need lights.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.196
"We're gonna need the cameraman.
We're gonna need the DJs.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:31.397
We're gonna need
the opening act."

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:35.267
And he's like, "No.
Just Russell."

00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:37.436
And I'm like, "Oh, fuck.
All right."

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:39.405
And he goes,
"Has to be private event."

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:40.706
And I go, "All right.

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.341
Well, can you give me
any information?"

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:44.110
"No information."

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.511
I'm like,
"Well, how many people?"

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:49.081
He goes, "It's a very small
party for the prince."

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:50.116
And I'm like, "Okay."

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:51.584
And I'm thinking small,
all right?

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.118
Private thing.

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:55.388
Maybe 50 to 100 people, right?

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.622
I've done worse.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.524
27 years of stand-up,
I've done shows

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.126
where there's two people
in the audience.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.794
I literally put the mic down
and just sat with them.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.429
I was like,
"All right, listen.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.299
"It's--it's fucking stupid
for me to try and--

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.633
uh, what do you do?"

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:10.803
You know, so...

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.638
so...

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:13.972
So I go, "How many people?"

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:16.375
And they go, "Maybe 10 to 12."

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.477
I'm like, "Oh, come on, guy,"
right?

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:19.979
"This is ridiculous."

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.747
And then my brother goes,
"Doo-doo-doo," and I go,

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:23.216
"That's a lot of money.
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.883
Let's--let's do it."

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:27.553
So I go to the palace the next
day, right?

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:30.789
And I get there, and they put us
in, like, a waiting room,

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.793
and then this guy comes in,
he goes, "Mr. Peters, please."

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:36.729
And my brother and I--'cause,
you know, obviously he's got

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.464
the same last name--we both get
up, and he goes, "No, no.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:41.733
You stay.
Just him."

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.903
And--and I'm thinking, "Great,
I'm gonna get beheaded

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.271
or some shit," right?

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:48.841
'Cause I talked mad shit the
night before, right?

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.143
I mad fun of them for--women
weren't allowed to drive

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:52.945
in Saudi--it's illegal for women
to drive in Saudi Arabia,

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.413
and I was going in on it.

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.115
I'm like, "Well, maybe you
should let the women drive,

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:57.649
'cause you guys drive like
shit," you know,

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:59.918
"And that"--so I was like, "Oh,
my God.

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:02.421
"This is payback.
I'm gonna lose my head,

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.924
and they're gonna blame fucking
ISIS or some shit," right?

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:09.762
So--so I go into this room,
and it's a little-ass room

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.197
with a 110-inch TV,
and I walk in,

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:14.867
and I figure 'cause the TV--
say this is the TV behind me--

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.336
I walk in the room and I'm like,
"All right, I guess

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:21.207
"I'll just stand in front of
this TV and do my little jokes

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.509
for these 11 people
that are here."

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:26.979
And I walk in, and then the
prince is sitting in the middle

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.615
of the room, and he gets up, and
he goes,

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.317
"Hey, thanks for coming."

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.386
He doesn't sound like how you're
thinking.

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:35.855
He's not like, "Please, please,
entertain my friends," you know.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.223
He's like, "Hey, thanks for
coming," and I'm like,

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:39.992
"What the fuck is happening
right now?"

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.193
[laughter]

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:42.527
Like, Ashton Kutcher's gonna
come out.

00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:43.862
Ha-ha!
You've been punked!

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:47.366
You know.
And then--

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:52.538
so he goes--he goes, "Sit down.
Russell, please sit down."

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.673
So I sit down, and I just start
making fun

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:56.809
of everybody in the room.

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.544
Literally, like, I'm like, "You,
bam, you, bam,"

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:01.547
and then--and then the prince
is, like, feeding my lines.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.081
"That guy owns camels."

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:07.553
And I'm like--and I'm like,
"You, fucking camel guy," and...

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:10.255
"How's it going?"
And then--

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:12.357
I don't know if that's the
greeting or the dance, right?

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:14.360
So...

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.929
you know, the prince,
I'm making fun of him.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.664
I start making fun
of the prince.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:22.001
I got a little fucking
carried away.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.702
And I knew when I was getting
carried away 'cause everybody

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:25.337
went, "Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm."

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:26.572
[laughter]

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:29.909
"Mm-mm. Everybody else,
no problem, but him? Mm-mm."

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:33.279
And there's--then the prince
says to me--there's a guy

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.448
sitting beside me, and he goes,
"Hey, Russell, that guy has one

00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:38.417
of the only brown diamonds
in the world."

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.285
And I go, "What the fuck
is a brown diamond?"

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:41.621
He goes, "Show him, show him."

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.722
The guy takes off his ring
and he's got this little

00:08:43.722 --> 00:08:46.725
tiny-ass brown diamond
on a ring, right?

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:49.461
And I go, "Oh, cool," and I go
to put it on my hand,

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:51.697
and it wouldn't go past
my pinkie nail.

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.366
And I'm like, how
small are your hands?

00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:55.735
[laughter]

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:56.869
And I look at the prince
and I go,

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.538
"This guy's got
child-like hands."

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:02.908
And the prince starts laughing,
and then as a joke,

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:04.943
I grab the guy's wrist, right?

00:09:04.943 --> 00:09:07.713
And I have friends that are
magicians, and they taught me

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.716
how to take a watch off
somebody's wrist, so I grab his

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:13.552
wrist, and I unlock his watch,
and I pull it off, and I go,

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:14.820
"How small are your wrists?"

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.789
And then I go, "Oh, wow.
Nice watch."

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:19.424
I go, "What is that, a Richard
Mille?"

00:09:19.424 --> 00:09:21.127
He goes, "No, it's Hublot."

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.161
And I go, "Oh, nice.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.162
I go, "Here."

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.763
He goes, "Oh, keep it."

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:28.800
And I'm like, "Okay, buddy," so
I put--I put the watch on,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.803
and I'm doing--I start talking
again, and about ten minutes

00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:34.273
later, I go,
"Hey, man, here's your watch."

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:36.342
He goes, "No, no.
I give to you."

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.676
And I'm like,
"What the fuck?"

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:40.512
[laughter]

00:09:40.512 --> 00:09:42.314
So I start getting comfortable,
right?

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:44.416
'Cause now I feel like
I've done my job.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:47.086
Everybody's laughed in this
room, and then the prince goes,

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.187
"Come on, let's eat."

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.688
And I go, "All right,
let's eat."

00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:53.024
So we go to this other room to
eat, and I'm sitting there,

00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:55.794
and I go, "Hey, man, where's the
guy that gave me the watch?"

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:57.162
He goes, "Oh, he left."

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:59.598
And I go, "But I've got his
watch."

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.600
And he goes, "He gave it to
you."

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.103
And I go, "All right."

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.538
And he goes, "That's how it is
in Saudi Arabia.

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:09.274
"If you like something we have,
and you say, 'I like that,'

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:10.977
We have to give it to you."

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.712
And I go, "Wow."

00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:16.649
[laughter]

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.057
"This it the best palace I've
ever been in."

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.860
Didn't work. Doesn't work on
real estate apparently.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.795
I should've complimented
the Rolls-Royce they sent

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:30.795
to pick me up in though.

00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:31.797
- Whoo!
- God damn it,

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.131
I fucked that one up, right?

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:36.468
So--so I start, you know,
the prince is really cool,

00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:37.736
so I start talking to him.

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:41.740
I'm like, "Yo, did you know
Osama bin Laden?"

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.042
'Cause he was from Saudi Arabia.

00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:45.811
And I go, "Hey, did you know
Osama bin Laden?"

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.148
He goes, "Well, I didn't know
him, but I know is family."

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.849
I go, "Really?"
He goes, "Yeah."

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:52.351
I mean, he was much older
than I am.

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:54.486
I go, "Oh, yeah, I guess
that makes sense."

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.721
He goes, "Yeah, but his family
is a very prominent family here

00:10:56.721 --> 00:10:57.823
in Saudi Arabia."

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:01.060
They're--they built
Saudi Arabia.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.061
They were the construction
company that built it.

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.563
He goes, "He went crazy.

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:07.399
"He went that way
and the family was this way,

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.868
"and he was mad at Saudi Arabia
and he was mad at his family,

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:11.403
so he went a little
fucking cuckoo."

00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:12.871
And then I was like,
"That's amazing,"

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:15.508
'cause he's very--if you think
about the breakdown

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.010
of Osama bin Laden,
he's very similar

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.411
to Donald Trump.

00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:21.113
[laughter]

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:23.848
He's--he's the spoiled brat

00:11:23.848 --> 00:11:27.719
billionaire son of a developer

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:29.955
who's fucking mad at everybody,
you know what I mean?

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:32.424
- Oh, my God.

00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:33.425
[laughter]

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:36.362
[cheers and applause]

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:40.866
So I go--I go--he goes,

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.902
"Yeah, his family's very nice,
actually."

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:44.103
And I go, "Really?"

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:46.639
He goes, "Do you want to meet
his brother?"

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.108
And I'm like, "Fuck yeah,
I do!"

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:52.878
I was like, "I so want to meet
his brother!"

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:56.815
So... so goes, "Okay," and he
says to some guy...

00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:58.217
[speaking gibberish]

00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.585
Random, like, "Oh, I don't know
what he's saying,

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:00.886
but okay, sure," right?

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:05.423
And then--so the next day I get
this call at my hotel

00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:08.560
and they send the car--
the prince sends a car for me,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.095
and I go, "What's this for?"

00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:13.064
He goes, "Oh, you said you
wanted to go see Saudi Arabia,

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:16.068
so he sent a car so you can go
around and see everything."

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.569
And he walks out with me,
and he's on his phone,

00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:19.771
and he's like, "Uh-huh, uh-huh."

00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:22.241
And he goes, "Hey, Russell,

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.477
do you still want to meet
Osama's brother?"

00:12:25.477 --> 00:12:27.579
[laughter]

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:31.150
And I'm like, "Fuck yeah, I do!"

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.585
And he goes, "Okay.
One second.

00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:35.521
Here."
And I go, "What's this?"

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.190
And I won't say what--the guy's
first name, 'cause, you know,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.961
that'll give it away, but--but
it says blank "bin Laden"

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.929
on the phone, right?

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.631
And I'm like--I go,
"What's this?"

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.832
He goes,
"It's Osama's brother."

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.534
And I go, "Holy shit."

00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:51.036
So I go, "Uh, hello?"

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:52.871
And he goes--
this is exactly--

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.206
here's what you're expecting,
right?

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:56.007
Osama bin Laden's brother to get
on the phone, be like...

00:12:56.007 --> 00:12:57.776
[in deep voice] "Russell, what
are you doing, infidel?"

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:58.777
Right?
So--

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.946
[laughter]

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:02.014
I go, "Hello?"

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:03.615
And this is what I hear
on the other end.

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:05.284
"Hey, Russell."
I go...

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.019
[laughter]

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:09.321
"What the fuck is going on
here?"

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.889
[laughter]

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:13.958
He goes, "Yeah, it's--yeah, I'm
blah, blah, blah bin Laden."

00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.127
I go, "Yeah, and I see that
on the phone."

00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:18.163
He goes,
"First of all, let me tell you,

00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:22.067
a big fan of your stuff,"
and I'm like, "What the--

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:24.403
what the good fuck is going
on over here?"

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:25.738
Right?

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:28.807
And he's like, "How long are you
in town for?"

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:29.874
I go, "I'm leaving today."

00:13:29.874 --> 00:13:31.209
He goes,
"Yeah, I'm flying back tonight.

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:33.245
"Oh, man, I'm gonna miss you.

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:34.580
"Hey, stay in touch with me.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.814
Take my number."

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:39.651
And I'm like, "What?"

00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:40.752
"Yeah, take my number."

00:13:40.752 --> 00:13:43.889
And I go, "All right."

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.825
And I go, "Just so you know,
your name's going in

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.194
as Dave Smith on my phone."

00:13:49.194 --> 00:13:52.064
[laughter and applause]

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:53.665
Thank you, guys.
You were great.

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:56.668
