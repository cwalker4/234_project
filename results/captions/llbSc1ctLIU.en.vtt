00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.660
Welcome to the DietDoctor podcast,
I'm your host Dr. Bret Scher.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.619
Today I'm joined by Dr. Michael Arata
and Stephanie Kennedy.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.460
Dr. Mike has an amazing story
as many physicians do

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.859
who transition to being more of a lifestyle
and nutrition based physician.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.460
He's an intervention radiologist
and specializes in limb salvage,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.739
which means he's sort of the last resort
before someone has an amputation

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.899
to try and save somebody's limb.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.060
It's very high-pressure intense work.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.259
But like a lot of physicians he realized
he wasn't really affecting the problem

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:41.100
in a good enough way to prevent it
and that's when he transitioned.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.460
Plus with some of his own health challenges
which we'll talk about.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
And what they've developed
is a functional medicine lifestyle practice

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.219
and as part of that they focus
on a low-carb ketogenic diet.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.579
But they focus on it from a plant basis,
so primarily a vegan ketogenic diet,

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.500
but here's the key - with cycling.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.420
And that's something that's going
to keep coming up over and over again,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.700
because the more we learn about it
the more we realize how important cycling is.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.780
And that means cycling with intermittent
fasting and cycling with meat.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.579
And we're going to talk about that.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.579
We're going to get
into some of the controversies

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.500
about plants versus carnivore diet
versus a balance of all that,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.700
talk about their philosophy
of how they approach their patients

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
and some of the concerns with a vegan diet,
what you need to be careful monitoring for,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.459
and of course talk about their book
that's coming out, Keto With Plants.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.260
So I really enjoyed this interview,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.180
I like their perspective a lot
and their approach to the patient

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.140
and their sort of balanced way
of approaching people

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.900
to help them not only understand
the science,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.659
but understand how to implement it
and how to make the changes last.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.819
So I hope you enjoy this interview
as much as I did.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.780

Thanks a lot and enjoy the interview
with Dr. Michael Arata and Stephanie Kennedy.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.340
Dr. Michael Arata and Stephanie Kennedy,

00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:09.867
thank you so much for joining me
on the DietDoctor podcast.

00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.595
-Sure.
-Pleasure to be here.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.822
-It's actually Dr. Mike, right? -Yes.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.259
You've had quite an interesting journey
so let's start with you.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.259
It always fascinates me how people
find their way in medicine

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.939
to focusing more on lifestyle
and treating the whole patient.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.379
And I remember when we met yesterday
at lunch, we were talking about it

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.539
and I said,
"You must have an internal medicine

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.020
or family practice background
to get to this point",

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.340
and you said, "No, interventional radiology"
and that is not what I expected.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.502
So you're an interventional radiologist,

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:44.219
you spend like all day 
in a cath lab like suite

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.699
sticking catheters and needles in people
and draining things and opening arteries

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.334
and yet you transitioned to wanting people
to work on their lifestyle.

00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:57.298
So give us a little bit of background
on how you got to that point.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.979
I think as an interventional radiologist

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:05.939
I was drawn to the technological aspects
of the specialty, the innovative nature.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.419
I mean interventional radiologists have created
all kinds of different treatments

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.819
and taken different devices
and modified them

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.668
and, you know, it's very much
a gadget type of field.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.379
-He loves his gadgets.
-I do, no question.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.939
So that's what really drew me to it
and then, as I got into my practice

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.300
I really enjoyed some of the things
you could do

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.860
that were alternatives to big surgeries

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.900
that could produce outcomes in patients
that couldn't even tolerate the surgeries.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.979
So they were too sick to have a surgery and
you could step in and intervene

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.900
and make a difference in someone
that maybe had no options at all.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.419
So that was very satisfying
but as I got more into limb salvage

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.259
most of the patients typically would be
either diabetics or renal failure or both,

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.379
and those patients you could get
a good result in the short-term,

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.860
but unfortunately most of those patients...
it's not a long-term solution.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.900
You could spend three, four hours on a case

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.580
basically vascularizing someone from their
abdominal  area all the way down to their toes

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.900
and actually get blood flow back to their
feet, that could heal their ulcer,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.139
but three months later they're back.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.100
And, you know, when you are doing
one of these cases

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.100
wearing 30 to 40 pounds of led
and you know it gets really hot in it

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.420
and really it's actually quite fatiguing
in those long cases,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.060
so at the end of it you're gratified
by the fact you've helped the person,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.220
but then you're really disappointed
when they come back.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.220
And it just got me thinking,
"There's got to be something better.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.500
How can we allow this to happen?"
is really what I would start to question.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500
And I didn't have the knowledge base,
the experience, the exposure

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.860
to understand what got people to that point
to the degree I needed.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.500
Fortunately I started working
with other patients

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.019
who had naturopaths 
as part of their care team.

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.100
And my interactions with them

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.180
really started to basically plant the seed
that there is something different.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.100
And I think a key part of this for my story
is I was a biochemistry major as an undergrad.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.259
So when I started discussing things
with naturopaths,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.459
they often talked
about the biochemical aspect of it.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:20.779
That really resonated with me.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.860
And fortunately one of the naturopaths
I worked with

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.420
suggested I should go
to a functional medicine conference.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.259
When I went, my life changed,
it literally just flipped a switch.

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.660
And I was just like,
"Oh my gosh, this is it."

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.980
And it really is a biochemical based aspect,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.899
you know, there's a lot
of different overlapping specialties,

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.620
integrative medicine,
functional medicine,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.379
and these things are not that different,
I mean there's a lot of overlap,

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.579
but one of the key things
about functional medicine

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:54.379
is it's more systems biology
and biochemistry based.

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.819
So I think I needed that.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.540
I don't think I would have made this transition
without that science core to it.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.060
Well, with this knowledge I was learning
I experimented on me.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.139
And being someone that was working
90 to 100 hours a week,

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.579
I was a typical American.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:15.740
I had all the conditions
that you see in middle-aged,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.540
now actually younger adults.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.180
So I was not sleeping, I had sleep apnea,
I weighed 230 pounds,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.500
I had gastroesophageal reflux,
I had skin conditions,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.045
you know, eczema would flare up
all the time.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.236
Too busy taking care of everybody else
to take care of yourself.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.180
Yes, all of these things
that just slowly drag you down

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.420
and eventually lead
to more serious conditions.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.261
Well, those things started clearing up,
I started losing weight.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.030
And what did you do?
What was your intervention to--?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.939
Well, the first thing was food

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.624
and interesting enough, the first diet
that I tried was a ketogenic diet.

00:06:50.704 --> 00:06:53.072
That was the very first one.
You got lucky.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.220
And I felt great

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.259
and the one thing I noticed
was the energy level, the clarity of thought,

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.860
I mean those were the things
that really stood out to me,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.019
because I was so fatigued,
I was just living on sugar and coffee.

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:13.980
And I literally had one
of those big 22 ounce cokes or whatever...

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.459
I constantly had one of those
in my hand all day.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:23.020
So I was basically, you know, mainlining
caffeine and sugar to survive and function.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.259
Which is not that unusual.

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.620
I mean we react to it
like it's the worst thing in the world,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.574
but it's  actually not that unusual.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.939
You look around
and you see it everywhere.

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:35.620
So that was the big switch
and I started sleeping better.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.899
When I lost weight
the sleep apnea went away on its own.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:41.500
I also had very bad hypertension.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.220
I first was diagnosed with high blood pressure
in college in my 20s

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.860
and I got to the point
where I was on four medications

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.500
and still had a pressure of 160/100,
so I was really bad.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.100
That started getting better
and I actually was getting off medication.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.579
So it was an incredible experience
just seeing what happened to myself

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:08.299
when I did something that was not what
I've been basically brought up in the system.

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:10.100
And that's what's so amazing

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.779
that so many doctors have the transformation
by having their own transformation

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:17.420
and then they transform their practice,
because we weren't taught this.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.220
So we have to be able to go
outside of what we were told

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.852
as the way to do things.

00:08:21.853 --> 00:08:23.980
So an incredible journey

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.019
and then you opened up a practice
where now you're treating people holistically,

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:33.220
you're treating not just one problem
in the IR suite,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.500
but trying to treat them in the whole person

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.067
focusing on nutrition and ketosis
as a cornerstone of that treatment.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.580
Yeah, I think I obviously had to go
through a lot of educational processes.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.659
Maybe I did too much but I just felt
like I really needed to know this.

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:52.940
And so it was an evolution

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.059
and we've gotten to the point now
where I do incorporate ketosis.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:01.019
I think it's important to understand
where I'm coming from,

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:05.860
I'm not really someone that advocates
or uses therapeutic ketosis.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.740
I mean I think it has its place
but not with the patients that I'm seeing.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.100
So we're focusing on nutritional ketosis

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:19.860
and while I did obviously jump right into
the ketogenic diet for my first go-round,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.059
I also found that plants
really make me feel well.

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:29.419
And it was kind of a revelation for us both
because we did it together.

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:33.220
The first time we did
wasn't quite a vegetarian diet,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.139
but it was very plant heavy
and we both felt tremendous.

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:41.460
And Stephanie had been vegetarian before,
so she had more experience with--

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.617
I was a carnivore, I would go and have
a big steak and just leave the plants.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.104
So Stephanie, it was your influence then
to get him to try the plants?

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:55.340
It was part of my training,
it's a functional medicine dietary new plan,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.139
so it's really plant heavy
and it's dairy and grain free,

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:03.820
so it wasn't quite keto but it was
just very plant and clean meats heavy.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.139
And even with a few clients
it's a challenging meal plan,

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:12.259
because it's a lot of more intricate recipes
than I prefer to recommend

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:14.539
because it does take a lot of work.

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:17.379
But the few clients I've gotten to do it,
have said the same thing.

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:20.379
Them and their husbands were like,
"Oh, my gosh, I feel so amazing!"

00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:24.940
And I felt like euphoric,
just like this clean energy buzzing through.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.257
It was pretty amazing
but yeah, it's a lot of work.

00:10:28.353 --> 00:10:31.460
That's what's so interesting
about a ketogenic diet

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.139
is there are so many
different ways to do it.

00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:37.340
It sounds like it's a one thing
but it really isn't.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.460
And some people are on one end
of the spectrum and they're carnivores.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.220
And some people are on the other end
of the spectrum and they're vegan keto.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.259
And they both can be in ketosis,
they both can get benefits of ketosis

00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:50.419
and they both can feel great.

00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:54.419
And one of the hard questions is,
"Is there one that's better?

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:57.019
Or if you're feeling great
it doesn't matter?"

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:59.700
I know you've had some experience
with a little bit of all of this.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.500
So tell us about not just your own personal
transition to a vegetarian based keto,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.620
but with your clients.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.409
Why you have felt
that's the better way to go?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.500
I have to step back from trying 
to understand why we come to this conclusion,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.980
to get to a really core principle

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.820
and that principle is that life is cycles.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.620
You can look at everything in life,
you can look at night and day,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.179
you can look at the seasons, you know,
your birth and your death.

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:33.659
So the idea that we are static and we are
going do the same thing over and over,

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:37.860
it just isn't compatible with every aspect
of life, no matter where you look.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.340
And so I think that is true with how we eat.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.740
And the other aspect of it

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:51.059
is that when we look at how the body
repairs itself and heals and grows,

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:55.220
it's response to a stimulus,
so the stimulus is a change.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.820
So I think that's an important element
to eating.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.605
So I guess what I would say is
there is no perfect diet.

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:01.824
Right.

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:05.139
What is perfect is to change,
to have cycles.

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:10.299
And if you look at the standard American
more than just diet, let's say a lifestyle,

00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:13.139
which we actually prefer over diet,

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:18.820
the typical way 
that Americans live is static,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.340
constant stress, not moving,

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:28.460
eating continuously throughout the day
and generally high carbs,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.700
so there's really not a change
anywhere in there.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.059
It's a continuous exposure to something
and our bodies are not meant for that,

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.259
that's not how we're built.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:41.779
So I think that that's where
we came to the idea,

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:45.700
let's combine ketosis with plants

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.379
and make it in a way
that we actually incorporate cycling.

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:55.740
And so I think in order to make that work
and be practical, you have to fast.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.654
I don't think you can do this
without fasting.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.737
So what length in fast do you think
works best in certain situations?

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.059
We try to incorporate both,
so we really like time restricted feeding,

00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:09.460
because I do think
it's important to eat breakfast.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.659
Again, that cycle, the circadian rhythm,
key element in my opinion.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:17.659
So we like time restricted feeding
at least a couple of days a week

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:24.059
and then we also like to incorporate
a more prolonged fast, typically five days.

00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:30.181
And one of the great products it's out there
that really facilitates this is the ProLon diet.

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.476
-We love it.
-It is fantastic.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.620
It makes fasting so easy to do.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.630
And let's be realistic, if it's not practical,
people are not going to do it.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.259
And that's what's interesting
about the ketogenic diet

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:46.580
is that I find people can fast much easier
when they are already in ketosis.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:52.539
So you can say fasting five days is hard
and for the average person it probably is.

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:56.404
For the average person in ketosis
I'm not sure how hard it is.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.259
It's not.

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:00.659
At least from my experience.

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:05.059
So with this in mind, we started to see
how can we help patients

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:07.820
and I started working
with my own patients

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.980
and my patient population
is largely cognitive patients,

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.299
so typically elderly patients.

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:17.100
Again it has to be simple,
it has to be practical.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.259
If you're dealing
with elderly people in general

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:23.139
or more importantly
cognitively impaired patients,

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:25.761
if it's not simple, it's not going to work.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.978
So fasting in elderly people
can get a little tricky.

00:14:29.059 --> 00:14:34.259
Well, the easy part for the fasting
element with elderly patients

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:36.539
is intermittent fasting.

00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:39.460
A lot of them do it on their own
and they don't even realize it.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.659
It's only a 12 hour maybe,
but they are actually doing it regularly.

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:48.460
So getting them to extend it to 15
and 16 hours is not that big a stretch.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.220
It can get a little bit trickier
when you start doing a more extended fast,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.340
but that's why I think ProLon is fantastic.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.259
And I'm regularly having patients
well into their 70s using ProLon

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:02.299
and finding it quite doable.

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:06.980
And that again kind of fits in
because it's plant-based,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.220
so it's just a nice fit for what we're trying
to do with the patients.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.100
And then the population
that's on the other end of the spectrum

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.745
is I see young patients
with dysautonomia and POTS.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.987
Postural Orthostatic
Tachycardia Syndrome.

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:22.543
Thank you.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.419
Where you stand up and your heart rate
shoots through the roof

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:27.852
and you feel lightheaded and awful.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.299
Exactly, so for that group

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:37.700
the proportion that are related
to autoimmunity it's estimated to be a 50%,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.860
I think it's actually higher.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:46.259
I think that we're not identifying antibodies
that could be 80% of that population.

00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:50.379
So I think it's a strongly
autoimmune driven condition

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:53.860
and obviously the mitochondria
are very much involved in it.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.860
And then of course the gut
with the microbiome.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:03.139
So for that population this approach,
this lifestyle actually helps them too,

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:06.220
which is really fascinating,
it has actually surprised me.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.340
Because you have patients

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.220
that wouldn't think that fasting would help
and it really does.

00:16:11.281 --> 00:16:14.980
In the cardiology world people with POTS
it's frustrating,

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.379
because there's not a whole lot
we have to offer them.

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:20.019
You increase your hydration,
you increase your salt,

00:16:20.019 --> 00:16:23.340
you can try and wear compression stockings
but it's fairly un-rewarding,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.700
because the they tend
to not get better very quickly,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.659
but if a nutritional intervention
like this can help them,

00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:33.513
I've got to start trying that with them,
I haven't thought of that before.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.419
The first positive response I got
that really blew my mind

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:41.100
is a 22-year-old young lady
and very debilitated,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.820
just basically could not function

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.899
and within two days of fasting
she started to tell me, "I'm feeling better".

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:53.299
And she continued it
and she's feeling great.

00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:57.779
So it was really kind of, "This is incredible!"
and so I started using it more.

00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:01.299
And so again it's kind of two ends
of the spectrum.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:06.579
I personally wouldn't feel comfortable
with a child taking this approach and fasting,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:10.765
but I think a young adult absolutely,
it's very well-tolerated.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:16.779
So, Stephanie, you are the day-to-day coach
with a lot of the clients you see

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:21.859
and the knock against a vegan keto diet
is that it's hard

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.859
and you have to really prepare
and spend a lot of time thinking about it

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:29.940
to make sure you're getting
adequate levels of fat and protein

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.420
and preparing all your food.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.660
So what are some of the tricks or the tips
that you think are the top ones

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.472
to help people who want to follow
a more plant-based ketogenic diet?

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:48.445
Well, yeah colors, I would say
I do eat the rainbow as I say, not Skittles.

00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:50.292
Well, our system.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.819
Yeah, we have a system
where we're organizing our foods

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:57.220
into like I had Siebel at one point
and I saw this list,

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.700
it was like red, green, you know,
you like the stoplights

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.140
of foods you couldn't eat
and it really helped me

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.220
because I'd be like at a restaurant,
would put down my list,

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.500
it was like a 14 page list or whatever,
it was really fun.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.700
So we're organizing our foods
into columns like that,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.859
so you could just, "I can eat all these foods
in the green list, all these foods",

00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:16.940
so that's kind of easy,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.380
but then if you don't cook or whatever
it's just a list of ingredients too,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:26.619
so I have written a lot of recipes and
I hate cooking and I am busy and lazy.

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:29.579
I hate to say lazy, but I am, I admit it.

00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:32.579
So I'm trying to cook with that in mind
because I hate doing it.

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.859
So it has to be something that can be
like prepared in 10 minutes,

00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:38.500
I don't like all these gadgets
in the strainer

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.980
and then then you end up with a huge pile
of dishes at the end of the night.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.700
So they are simple
and they are really tasty.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.180
I would say the key is we treat our food
as a vehicle, with olive oil and MCT oils.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:56.700
So just anything... I make 
really good dressings and sauces and spices

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.619
to try to get that in there

00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:01.900
and then I like to start the day
with a smoothie.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.220
This would be the first thing
I'd help people add actually,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.819
rather than say,
"Okay we got to cut this and cut that".

00:19:06.819 --> 00:19:10.420
I say, "Let's add to what you're already
eating a green smoothie in the morning."

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.539
So a couple of strawberries,
a bunch of spinach,

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:15.579
some hemp and avocado
and MCT of course,

00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:18.420
so it's really fat full and veggie full.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.819
And it sort of feels a lot of voids...

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:23.940
You know, you could eat like a ton of pizza

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.099
but you can't sit down and eat
like buckets full of kale salad,

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.700
because all the nutrients that your body
wants have been met

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.019
and it's like, "Ah, I'm good",
and it shuts it off.

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:35.660
But with pizza it's still like,
"I still don't have it, I still don't have it."

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.660
So you could just gorge.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.819
So starting your day off or a lunch
whatever you prefer for the green smoothie

00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:46.740
sort of ripples out and it kind of naturally
has them cut back on other things,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.660
so it's just a nicer start to, "We'll meet
and add something to your diet

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.819
instead of take it out."

00:19:52.819 --> 00:19:56.140
So I try to do little twists like that
to make these changes a little easier

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.859
and we try to incorporate it
a little bit more slowly rather than...

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:03.259
He can just turn on a dime
and transform everything,

00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:05.900
but most of us can't do that.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.380
So I tried to be like, "Let's prioritize
the changes, let's do them slowly

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.259
and incorporate them

00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:14.460
and once it's like working in your life
then we'll look and add the next one."

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.512
And so I kind of slow everybody down
and keep it very realistic.

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:21.859
And that's a great approach
for people to hear

00:20:21.859 --> 00:20:25.099
because we talk about so much information
and we give so many tips

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.940
and people think they can just run out
and do it right away.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.740
And yeah like you said, most people
don't work that way, it's a process.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.259
And so it's great to have someone like you
who can coach people along

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:39.299
and really help them prioritize the process
to understand what needs to change first

00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:41.579
and then what can follow after that.

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:44.660
So people need to keep that in mind when
they're trying to make lifestyle changes,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.859
because if you try and do too much at once

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:49.709
you can end up frustrated
that it's not all working.

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:52.019
You could maybe inoculate it
for a short time

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:54.460
and then be like, "Oh, it didn't work!"

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.933
Then you're like, "Oh, another one
that failed that was just too much."

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:01.660
Now, when you were talking
about cycling,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.940
and we talked about this a little bit at lunch
the other day,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.700
you also mentioned
about cycling with meat.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.660
So it's not that
you're 100% all plants, no meat,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.019
but it seemed like you felt,
if I can put words in your mouth,

00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:17.625
that cycling with meat was also important,
so talk to me a little bit about that.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.180
Sure, I think if you separate out vegans,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.779
because there's a lot of people
that choose a vegan lifestyle,

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:25.740
it's more than the food.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.299
There are other issues that led them
to that way of living.

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:37.859
And I think that for our style it's possible
to maintain a vegan ketogenic style of eating,

00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:39.940
but it's difficult.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.660
We will be the first to tell you,
it's difficult.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.619
If you're more of a vegetarian plant-based
it's certainly much easier to do,

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:51.859
but the way we eat
is actually to have some meat.

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:54.019
And the way we do that

00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:57.740
is we try to eat meat in a 24-hour period
roughly once a week.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.740
Now we don't always stick to that.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.460
Certainly things like conferences
and traveling,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.700
it gets a little bit more challenging and
so we're flexible and pragmatic about it,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:12.339
but ideally we would say, "Go through your
weekly cycle", which we do a five-day plan

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:14.779
and we try to encourage people

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:18.220
to do three days of time restricted feeding
in that five days

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.900
and then have a meat up day.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.539
And for that day you have meat
with each meal.

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:27.579
Now it's not necessarily gorging
on huge steaks.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:29.859
We're talking small serving sizes,

00:22:29.859 --> 00:22:33.740
but you're having animal protein
with each meal.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.779
And the way I like to think about that
and the way I explain it to patients

00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:40.940
is that we are omnivores

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:47.140
and to think there were omnivores
that had access to animal meat every day

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.140
is not realistic.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.420
You can just look around the environment

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.940
and what would happen
is you would have a kill.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.299
You would capture some sort of animal,
whether it's a fish or bird,

00:22:57.299 --> 00:23:00.980
a rabbit or whatever it is
and you would eat a lot of it.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.660
You would eat it for, you know a day or two,
while it's still fresh.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.180
And I think that's how
our bodies are designed

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.779
and so that's how we style the plan
is to do that.

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:16.700
And what it's doing is providing nutrients
that you don't necessarily get from plants.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:22.500
I don't think that necessarily
animal products are bad in that sense

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.059
that some people do think they are
as far as health goes,

00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:30.740
but I think the problem is that the meat that
we have readily available is bad.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.380
And my approach
is kind of beyond macronutrients

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.619
so we can talk about sugars and fats
and things like that and that's important

00:23:38.619 --> 00:23:43.059
but I think even more important are
the fatty acids that are present in the fats.

00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:46.059
And if you look at the meat supply
in this country,

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:49.460
not only is the Omega 6 - 3 ratio
really poor

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.619
but you have really elevated levels
of palmitic acid.

00:23:52.619 --> 00:24:00.099
Palmitic acid is very inflammatory,
it activates TH1 and TH17,

00:24:00.099 --> 00:24:04.380
so you not only have inflammation
but you have revved up immune system

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.019
and that's what causes
atherosclerotic plaques.

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:11.539
So I think that if you have
really good quality wild game

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:16.259
it's completely different than the hot dog
that you get in your grocery store.

00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:17.900
Absolutely.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.579
So I think that's important.

00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:26.779
And if you look at some of the things that
become deficient in vegans in particular,

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:30.180
there are things that actually meats
are very rich in.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.460
So for example B12, carnitine,
those are very key elements.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:41.740
And in fact if you look at people who are ill,
who are going to try to incorporate ketosis,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.259
they are going to struggle if they have
mitochondrial dysfunction.

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.500
So if you're going to do
a more plant-based ketogenic style diet

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:55.180
on someone with mitochondrial dysfunction,
they are going to struggle without carnitine.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.099
It's essential.

00:24:57.099 --> 00:24:59.902
So meat is a great source of carnitine.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.299
So is once a week enough to supply
those people with the carnitine they need,

00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:06.979
or will you still supplement?
And the same question for B12 as well.

00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:11.539
Great question, so for the healthy individual
I think you probably would do fine,

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:15.180
which is once a week meat,
but not sick patients.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.460
And so we would regularly recommend

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.099
relatively high doses
of carnitine supplementation.

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:25.539
The B12, my preference
is actually to test for it.

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:31.579
I think the routine testing of key nutrients
like vitamin D and B12,

00:25:31.579 --> 00:25:33.619
they are so easy to do

00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:39.059
and you can actually measure this
and treat it as a titrated treatment

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.294
rather than just take this pill.

00:25:41.381 --> 00:25:45.220
So let's talk about that for a second,
because zero is a normal range in the lab

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.259
and that is derived from thousands
of patients who they thought were healthy

00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:54.220
and they checked their levels
and defined the normal range.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.460
Does that apply...
do you think that's a true normal range?

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.045
And where do you shoot for the levels
in that range?

00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:04.779
You can see she's giggling so...

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:07.339
No, I don't.

00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:11.220
So I like to use the term "reference range"

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.500
and the reference range includes
a lot of unhealthy malnourished people.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.059
So certainly with vitamin D levels

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:21.902
I really would encourage people to do
much higher than what's considered normal.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.997
So like 40 to 60?

00:26:25.099 --> 00:26:27.700
That will be a bare minimum.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.830
I am usually shooting for 80 to 120.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.245
Now isn't there a risk of vitamin D toxicity
at a too high-level?

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:38.740
It is actually quite rare and if you're going
to get in trouble with vitamin D,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.259
usually we're talking about 30,000 units
a day before you really see a problem.

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:46.859
For someone who's got kidney stone issues
might be little difference with renal failure,

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:52.579
but the average person can absorb
10 to 20,000 units a day without difficulty

00:26:52.579 --> 00:26:54.940
and not run in trouble.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.140
And with B12 I actually prefer
methylmalonic acid.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.819
I think the B12 levels get falsely elevated
with dysbiosis,

00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:05.940
which is an abnormal mix
of bacteria in the gut

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.380
which actually produce
B12 levels artificially.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.380
So I don't necessarily find
that a B12 level itself is very helpful.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.668
Methylmalonic acid I think is more telling.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.539
Now that's going to be a tough test

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:19.339
walking into a doctor's office
and asking for it.

00:27:19.339 --> 00:27:20.704
That's not going to happen.

00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:22.099
No, it's true.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.180
But fortunately
now there's direct labs for patients.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.539
So we obviously encourage people to work
with their doctors,

00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:31.779
but if there's a test that you're interested in
you can get them on your own,

00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:33.657
without your doctor's order.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.940
Yeah, so I think the good take-home
there is if you walk in your doctor's office

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.900
and they say, "Oh, your levels are fine,
don't worry about it",

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.339
don't stop there, dig a little deeper
because what applies to you

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:48.016
is not necessarily what the normal
reference range is.

00:27:48.017 --> 00:27:51.460
So rather than just supplementing,
you test with the B12,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.700
but you would supplement
with the carnitine

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.380
in someone who does have
some mitochondrial dysfunction,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.980
but someone who is healthy,
eating meat once a week

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.668
and you're fine with not supplementing,
just to summarize that.

00:28:02.741 --> 00:28:05.339
Yeah, we haven't seen that be an issue

00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:08.122
and obviously there are going to be
circumstances that may arise

00:28:08.123 --> 00:28:10.259
where could be a problem.

00:28:10.259 --> 00:28:13.460
But in general I think a healthy individual
with no indication of mitochondrial dysfunction

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.414
is probably going to do fine if they're
getting enough meat one day a week.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:24.068
And what about Omega 3s and iron
and calcium, any concern with those?

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.140
So certainly the mineral component
is a problem

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.900
with ketosis becoming deficient
in those minerals.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.500
We're not really deeply in ketosis.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.059
So I don't think it's quite the issue

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:38.707
that you had for example
with the therapeutic ketosis.

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:40.900
And when you say therapeutic ketosis,

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.299
are you talking about certain levels
like above three for beta hydroxybutyrate,

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:47.619
or you're talking about
using exogenous ketones?

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:49.908
What do you mean
when you talk about therapeutic ketosis?

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.980
Great question, so our goal is basically
to get to 0.8, to 1.5.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.660
That's kind of our level of ketosis
that we're shooting for.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.339
In that circumstance I don't think
we're seeing a level of fatty acid oxidation

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:03.579
that we're going to deplete the minerals

00:29:03.579 --> 00:29:07.460
to the levels you would
with someone to 3, 5 etc.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.779
With iron I think that with a menstruating
female it makes sense to supplement iron,

00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:14.900
but I think most men it's not a big issue.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.900
And certainly if you have meat once a week
I think you're going to be okay,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.059
assuming there are no chronic illness.

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:23.940
The things that I think that can be helpful

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.380
in terms of supplementation
on the mineral side,

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.700
I think applies to most people
is magnesium.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.579
I think most of us walk around
magnesium deficient,

00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:36.859
so that's one that I give
basically to everyone.

00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:39.500
And the other thing with that is
there's not a good test for it.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.180
So I don't have a way to titrate it,
so I just kind of give it to everybody.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.220
And generally it makes people sleep better

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.819
and when people sleep better,
they feel better.

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:51.220
So that's kind
of just an automatic one for me.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.220
And then if you look at the other aspects
of the minerals,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.579
I think the food tastes better
when you season it

00:29:59.579 --> 00:30:02.460
and so certainly just having them
add salt to the meals,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.859
which most people
are okay with and tolerate.

00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:08.420
I don't think you need to get to the point
where you're using supplements.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.358
We just haven't seen that to be a need.

00:30:11.421 --> 00:30:14.059
Let me interrupt you for a second,

00:30:14.059 --> 00:30:17.980
so, Stephanie is that something that you try
to incorporate in a lot of the recipes,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.900
different seasonings to help
with the micronutrients?

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.973
And what are some
of your favorite ones for that?

00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:25.500
Oh, gosh.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.660
I'm just thinking about my super lazy salad
dressing would be like olive oil, lemon, Dijon

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.940
and then I like to put Rosemary,
or I mean thyme, thyme is my favorite,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:41.140
and then I always use
Hymalaian pink salt.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.619
I think all of the herbs a really good
but one of my favorite mixes,

00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:48.660
I like to get mixes too,
because I like to be quick,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.420
I'm trying not to use the word lazy,

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.099
but Trader Joe's, they have
an organic herb salad mix,

00:30:56.099 --> 00:31:00.180
so you get kind of random
bits of herbs in each of them,

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.500
just kind of different, like dill,
all kinds of stuff in them,

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.819
so we try to use fresh herbs
as much as we can in things

00:31:06.819 --> 00:31:12.859
that are so high on antioxidants
and flavor let's face it.

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:16.859
And what else do I put in there?

00:31:16.859 --> 00:31:22.021
I guess I don't really keep track
of what I do in that.

00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:27.740
Well, I think that's a good starting point
and tips to find sort of prepackaged...

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.619
You said that Trader Joe have
the prepackaged ones that you can use and...

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:34.460
Because, let's face it,
we have to keep things easier

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.460
if we're going to be compliant with it and
that's probably a big part of what you do

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.428
is to help people stay on course.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.619
But I do say you should make
your own dressings,

00:31:42.619 --> 00:31:47.819
because in dressings they use canola oil
or soybean oil or whatever as a base.

00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:51.819
I mean I've got times myself when he's like,
"I've got to go, will you make me a lunch?"

00:31:51.819 --> 00:31:58.500
and I get a little tiny Tupperware cup
and just squeeze a half a lemon,

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.740
a scoop of Dijon, the olive oil, shake it up,
mix it with some herbs,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.420
I mean it's so fast but it's so important
to make your own dressing.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:10.779
So I definitely don't cut corners
on dressings.

00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:15.215
But Trader Joe's does have a mixed salad,
I think it's called the Green Goddess,

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:18.180
and that's an olive oil based one.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.980
And I'll fit it out with a little olive oil,

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.019
but it's a nice one
to give you a quickie boost.

00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:26.908
So I would like to touch on the Omega's,
if I could.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.316
Oh, yeah, please.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.059
I think one of important things
to understand about Omega 3

00:32:31.059 --> 00:32:33.460
it's the ratios what's really important.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:39.779
And when you're not consuming
a lot of the more basically...

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:41.691
what's the word I'm thinking of?

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:44.189
Like the pro-inflammatory Omega 6s?

00:32:44.259 --> 00:32:49.180
Yeah, so the food supply that we have
is very much tilted towards Omega 6

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.500
and in particular the meats.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.261
So if you're eating a plant--

00:32:53.339 --> 00:32:54.776
The grain fed meats.

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:57.019
Yes, thank you for clarifying that.

00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:59.180
So the more plant-based that you eat

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.539
the less you're going to expose yourself
with the inflammatory Omega 6s,

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:05.380
so your ratio is a little bit more healthy.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.579
But the other thing that's really important

00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:11.819
and I haven't seen this necessarily
in human data but from animal studies,

00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:15.779
when animals are fed
a high mono unsaturated fat diet

00:33:15.779 --> 00:33:19.059
their requirements of Omega 3s
dramatically change.

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:24.539
And so our main fat in our lifestyle
is actually monounsaturated.

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:27.740
Lots of olive oil, tons of avocados, nuts.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:33.700
So I don't think that our clients need
a lot of Omega 3,

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.740
because what Omega three they have,
is more effective I think, based on the studies,

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.900
and the fact that they don't have
a lot of inflammatory Omega 6

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.140
that they have to balance out.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.625
So in general we're not using a lot
of Omega 3 supplementation for that reason.

00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:49.980
So talking about that balance,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:55.299
so when you're not using butter
and ghee and lard as cooking oils,

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:59.740
a lot of people will go to the Omega 6
vegetable seed oils,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.220
that's sort of like a standard go-to
when you're not cooking with butter.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.500
So how do you counsel your patients
for cooking oils

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.101
and how do you keep them
away from those?

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.740
Well we definitely don't want them
to go to those oils.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.472
No, we teach them that they're evil.

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:16.700
And what are some
of your favorite substitutes?

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.236
Avocado oil.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.019
So we really like to cook
with avocado oil.

00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:24.219
And then we just literally encourage people
to drink olive oil.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.460
So if we say at the end of your salad

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.659
take your bowl
and just finish the rest of your oil.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.099
So olive oil is fantastic
and we really encourage it.

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:35.699
And then I think MCT oil
is what allows us

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:39.500
to have the level of plants
and carbs that we do.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.860
In fact with our color system
if you do eat one of the red plants,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.661
you have to have a tablespoon of MCT to go
with each serving to neutralize the effect.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:52.027
So what's an example of a red plant,
Like a "stop, don't eat" plant?

00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:54.180
Yeah, like the stoplight.

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:56.881
Not the red color,
but a "stop, don't eat this" example.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.099
So for example we both enjoy
the tropical fruits

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:03.860
and so pineapple will be an example.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:09.179
So what we'll do is we'll actually drown
that pineapple in coconut cream.

00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:14.059
That's what we like to do,
it's like a Pina Colada.

00:35:14.059 --> 00:35:17.500
But you can get the same effect
if you make a smoothie.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.539
Let's say you put pineapple in it,
put a tablespoon of MCT in it.

00:35:21.539 --> 00:35:24.659
What you want to do is, you know,
you've got...

00:35:24.659 --> 00:35:30.460
the red plants are basically ones
that have carbs greater than fats,

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.099
so that is one criteria for the colors

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:36.980
and the grams of carbs are greater
than 15 for the reds.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.780
So an MCT has basically
14 g of fat per tablespoon.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.019
So if you add that tablespoon of MCT
with your red plant,

00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:51.900
you basically get towards neutral,
close to neutral on the fat - carb ratio.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.739
Now we would limit that
to one serving a day

00:35:55.739 --> 00:36:00.780
but it allows you to have that sweet
that people tend to crave.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:06.780
So it's a way to incorporate flexibility
and really stick with the lifestyle.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:12.900
Those fats in general are not the same
as the other fats, in particular MCT.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.019
The MCT is absorbed directly
across the endothelium.

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:20.900
It does not go through lymphatic and drag
all these inflammatory compounds

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.940
like polysaccharide, which is the component
of bacterial cell wall,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.739
which is extremely inflammatory.

00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:31.219
I personally think that's why saturated fats
are unhealthy more than anything else.

00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:35.019
Is that they're dragging all these
inflammatory products in the blood stream.

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:39.820
So MCT is a way to avoid that
and increase the fat content in your diet.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.059
It also is more prone to generate ketones,
so it's going to facilitate that process.

00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:50.219
So we're really big fans of both MCT oil
and olive oil in particular.

00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:56.500
The other oils we'd really encourage you
to completely avoid as much as you can.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.374
And as a practical product... I always
mispronounce the name... Myiaka?

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.900
I was going to circle back to that.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.420
If you like butter,
the vegan cultured butter meat...

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.659
it's made out of coconut oil,

00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:15.487
but it tastes like cultured salted
delicious delightful butter, it's so good.

00:37:15.564 --> 00:37:19.485
You can cook with it, you can add it
to your vegetables high smoke point.

00:37:19.579 --> 00:37:22.699
Exactly, very, very tasty stuff.

00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:24.659
That woman is a genius.

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:26.619
And we've done blind taste test

00:37:26.619 --> 00:37:28.814
and you cannot tell the difference
between butter and this.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.380
No, you cannot...
the texture and everything.

00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:33.420
That statement makes me think
of the old days...

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.139
I can't believe it's not butter.
I'm not taking about that.

00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:41.460
Let's get into some controversies
about plants.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.619
Let's talk about Dr. Gundry
and his plant paradox book

00:37:44.619 --> 00:37:47.980
and the anti-nutrients, the lectins,

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:54.099
the problems that plants can potentially
cause for some people.

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:56.608
What's your take on that?

00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:59.619
I think first of all I really respect
what he has done.

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:02.820
I like people to think out of the box.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.820
but to my knowledge there is not a lot
of science behind what he's espousing.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:15.219
My personal take on it is that individuals
that are sick, that have a leaky gut,

00:38:15.219 --> 00:38:19.179
are more than likely to respond well
to his way of eating,

00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:24.219
because those toxins are going to be
much more toxic to a compromised individual,

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:27.780
whereas a healthy individual
with a very intact gut lining,

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.460
with an immune system
that's well-functioning,

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.059
they're not going to have as bigger reaction
to these things.

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:36.579
I mean, clearly they are toxins,
nature is pretty fascinating

00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:39.820
and it's designed these seeds very well

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.659
and there's a reason
why these compounds are in them.

00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:46.900
Just like there's compounds in other aspects
of plants that are very nurturing to humans.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:52.380
So I think it's something that is important
to consider with individuals who are ill,

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.260
I don't think it's as important
for healthy people.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.579
So that's kind of our take on it.

00:38:57.579 --> 00:38:59.459
Am I speaking for you?

00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:03.699
Yes, frankly if we get rid of them,
what else are we going to eat?

00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:11.900
So the next step then is that some people
do feel better when they get rid of plants

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.099
and that's where this whole carnivore
movement is coming from.

00:39:15.099 --> 00:39:17.980
And Sean Baker being the king
of the carnivore movement,

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.019
because of just what a powerful and strong
and imposing figure he is

00:39:22.019 --> 00:39:24.739
with the amazing things he's accomplishing

00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:26.900
but then even people like Georgia Ede

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.820
who take a more maybe
philosophical approach to it

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.099
and she has seen
all the benefits in herself

00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:37.940
by getting rid of plants
and going perfectly carnivore.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.340
And what is your take on that
when you see people feeling better

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.621
and sort of thriving
on a pure carnivore diet?

00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:48.980
 think it would go back
to some things that are similar

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.539
in the sense of the biochemistry
behind meat, I would say,

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:58.059
in the sense that mTOR
is a fantastic thing to stimulate,

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:01.980
but do you want to have it turned on
all the time your entire life?

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.019
I don't think so.

00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:06.780
Elevated levels of insulin growth factor,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.019
I mean these are things
that have positive effects.

00:40:10.019 --> 00:40:15.394
But like everything, if we really look at life,
it's in spurts.

00:40:15.395 --> 00:40:23.019
And so I think that these types
of styles of eating can make people feel well,

00:40:23.019 --> 00:40:26.539
but I don't think they're a good choice
for the longevity of their life.

00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:28.179
And that's the thing,

00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:32.980
is we don't have a snapshot of 20, 30,
50 years of eating a carnivore diet.

00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:35.148
We have months, or maybe a year or two.

00:40:35.238 --> 00:40:38.659
Oh, people could point to,
I guess the  Maasai and the Inuit

00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:43.619
that they were close to a carnivore diet,
maybe not completely, but they were close.

00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:47.166
So there's some evolutionary basis there.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.500
Well, I've also read some things that
the Inuit diet is not what we think it is.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.340
That maybe is questionable

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.059
and I'm not going to say
that that's a wrong style of eating,

00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:02.139
because I don't think
there is an ideal way.

00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:06.300
I think that the way you eat
is very individualized

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.619
and I think that the health
of the individual

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:14.940
and perhaps more importantly the composition
of the microbiome makes a huge difference.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.659
And most people have
unhealthy microbiomes.

00:41:18.659 --> 00:41:24.940
And so if you eat meat only that is
much easier on the gut to digest

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:30.780
and you're to have less issues with doing
that with an unhealthy microbiome

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.460
than someone who jumps in
and has 50 g of fiber a day at the gate.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.976
They're going to struggle.

00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.940
That's a great point.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.940
So one approach would be then
if you're having trouble with plants

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.380
then maybe need to fix your gut first and
then you won't have trouble with plants.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.940
And that's part of the problem
as providers and as physicians

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.900
and coaches taking care of these people,
what markers to be followed.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.659
Because when we talk about longevity
sure we could talk about mTOR,

00:41:56.659 --> 00:41:59.579
but it's kind of hard to measure mTOR
on a regular basis.

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:03.699
We can talk about MP kinase and PAK
but those are hard to measure,

00:42:03.699 --> 00:42:08.619
so we have to find our surrogate
so we use CRP, we can use IGF-I,

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:12.460
we can use blood sugar and insulin.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.460
But what you find as the best markers
that you think we can follow

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.067
to see if somebody's on the right track?

00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:24.099
Well, I think the ones you actually mentioned
those are the ones that I would tend to follow.

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:27.340
I think it also depends
on what the goals of the individual are.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:32.380
So for someone with purely longevity
or say cancer prevention approach,

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.139
that's very different than say
a cognitive patient.

00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:41.300
And I think that for a cognitive patient
we do need to have anabolic effects.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.820
In fact, I often tell my patients, I say,
"If you want to build brain you build muscle."

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.659
I really think the brain
is tied to the muscle.

00:42:48.659 --> 00:42:52.980
And so in that individual we have to have
periods of stimulation of mTOR.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.820
I think it's very important.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.860
That may be an elderly patient

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.699
and you may say, well are you putting them
at risk for shorter lifespan

00:43:00.699 --> 00:43:03.420
or are you putting them at risk for cancer.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.980
I don't know for sure, I don't think so
when it's pulsed, and I think that's the key.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.980
If you look at most hormones,
most hormones are pulsed.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:17.460
So I think you're okay
to periodically stimulate these things.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:24.019
I would be very hesitant to have someone
like that be on a carnivore diet.

00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:26.059
I just would.

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:29.739
On the other hand if you're in your 20s
and you're trying to build a beautiful body,

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:32.699
I mean that's what you're going to do.

00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:35.188
Who knows if that's
a good choice long-term though?

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.860
Yeah, very good point down.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:42.699
And now one of your exciting projects
is your book, so Keto With Plants.

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:46.043
And now what inspired you
to write the book?

00:43:46.723 --> 00:43:52.460
Well, I think as we kind of were exploring
for ourselves and for our practice

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.860
how to blend ketosis
with a plant-based diet,

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.659
we really started looking for help.

00:44:00.659 --> 00:44:03.539
Who's doing this?
Where do we look to for guidance?

00:44:03.539 --> 00:44:05.780
There's not many people.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.820
So with that sort of dearth of information
we decided we're going to do this,

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.260
we're going to try and do the research,
we're to try and put together the food plans

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.300
and make it really practical
so I think that's really important.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.099
If we're going to do that for ourselves
in our practice

00:44:20.099 --> 00:44:22.579
we should make it available
for everybody.

00:44:22.579 --> 00:44:25.860
And I think over the last year or two

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.780
we've started to see more people
become interested in this

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:34.059
and start to go in that direction
so I think it is a new trend let's say.

00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:38.179
But we feel that getting a book
is a great vehicle for us

00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:42.451
to get this experience that we've had
out to as many people as possible.

00:44:42.539 --> 00:44:44.539
Now is it mostly a recipe book

00:44:44.539 --> 00:44:47.260
or is there going to be some
of your coaching involved in there too

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.587
to help people stick with the program?

00:44:49.659 --> 00:44:51.500
It's a mixture of a lot...

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.619
there's the science in the beginning
that I'm trying to tone down

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:57.179
so that us, laypeople can...

00:44:57.179 --> 00:45:02.539
well, not you two, but me and the listeners
can understand and decode.

00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:05.179
So yeah, there's the science behind it

00:45:05.179 --> 00:45:08.340
for those who'd like to know
why they're doing these things.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.619
Then there's a little bit
of coaching elements.

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:13.980
So it's like okay, I know you're tempted 
overall your lives, but let's not do that

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.780
and just lay other foundation
to make sure...

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.219
to give people permission to take time
to take care of themselves...

00:45:20.219 --> 00:45:27.300
and it's kind of a mixture of everything
just to lay the foundations for a good start

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.820
of a change that's going
to become lasting.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.924
That was important too to us is that
this change would be lasting for people.

00:45:34.038 --> 00:45:35.539
Let's talk about that.

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:37.780
We spend so much time
talking about that the food,

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.420
but there's so much more
than just nutrition and food

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.619
that makes us healthy
and helps our lives.

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:45.460
So you mentioned some of them
with gratitude journaling

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.300
and giving yourself permission
to take time.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.699
So tell us a little bit more

00:45:50.699 --> 00:45:54.739
about what you think are the important
pillars for people to have in their lives

00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:58.619
that will help just make their nutrition
that much better for their lives

00:45:58.619 --> 00:46:01.219
and make their lives that much better
in general.

00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:02.686
Connection.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.260
Yeah, connection to each other
and well to yourself.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.139
Our modern medicine has separated
our mind from our body so much

00:46:10.139 --> 00:46:14.099
and treat them separately,
but the mind drives so much of it.

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:17.918
I found this myself
when I was struggling to lose weight.

00:46:17.919 --> 00:46:21.166
I was obeying all the rules
and the scale was just sitting there

00:46:21.167 --> 00:46:24.340
and I know I shouldn't like get on it 
all the time, because I don't like it,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.900
but I went on a five day meditation retreat
and lost weight on the retreat

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.300
and he kept telling me,
"It's stress, it's stress",

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.260
and I'm like, "You take your stress
and you just shove it... somewhere.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.179
I'm tired of hearing
about this stress nonsense."

00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:39.099
And it turned out he was right...
whatever.

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:41.249
It's hard to admit that sometimes.

00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:46.179
Yeah, sometimes,
but no, stress messes so many things up.

00:46:46.179 --> 00:46:49.380
And I didn't feel
like I was a stressed-out person,

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.659
but I guess I just was.

00:46:51.659 --> 00:46:54.940
You know, unhappy things frustrated me
and annoyed me really easily.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.059
So with the mindfulness...

00:46:58.059 --> 00:47:03.539
that taught me that you can kind of let go
of those recurring thoughts

00:47:03.539 --> 00:47:06.260
that drive the negativity.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:11.780
And you can let go of even weight I guess
if you can't let go of negativity.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:17.539
And then as women I think
we don't give ourselves permission,

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:22.139
because we're like we need to do this
for everybody else and give, give, give,

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:25.579
but you can't give from an empty vessel
and you know that's just really true.

00:47:25.579 --> 00:47:29.739
So you actually owe it to your family
to take time to take care of yourself,

00:47:29.739 --> 00:47:32.219
so that there's more of you
to go around,

00:47:32.219 --> 00:47:35.739
so it's really your duty
to take care of yourself first.

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:42.539
So I think shifting the thoughts on that
and then also the restriction thing,

00:47:42.539 --> 00:47:45.860
I try to shift the paradigm,
you know, the thinking on that,

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:51.340
that you are giving yourself nutrients
rather than restricting the pizza,

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.740
just kind of shift the--

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.659
-The focus.
-...the focus of it.

00:47:56.739 --> 00:47:59.179
Yeah, and the words you use
and the way you talk about it

00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:02.139
can be so important in reframing
someone's opinion of it

00:48:02.139 --> 00:48:04.300
and can affect your success
and their success.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.059
Right, so try to also find
the right motivation,

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:10.059
not, "I want to be sexy",
or "My doctor said I'm going to die".

00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:13.980
We tried to reframe to be more
like empowering positive psychology type.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.300
Reframed like...
we like to be immediately rewarded,

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:23.019
so I like to focus on how you feel
after you eat a day like this.

00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:25.619
So I really try to connect the mind
and the body

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:28.179
so that you are aware
of what you're putting into your body,

00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:29.887
how it makes you feel

00:48:29.888 --> 00:48:32.860
and then that becoming a motivator
rather than this long term goal

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.780
like, "I'm trying to avoid cancer",
or "Avoid dementia".

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.940
That's not motivating day-to-day
when you're in the trenches.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.420
So we try to get immediate rewards in place
and stuff like that.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.980
So it's a lot to pack into one book,
and then there are recipes yes, you're right.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.027
So yeah, it's coming together.

00:48:52.115 --> 00:48:56.603
So now do you have
any meat-based recipes in there?

00:48:56.604 --> 00:48:59.427
Because you believe in cycling
and doing this on occasion.

00:48:59.428 --> 00:49:01.141
Did you mention that in your book?

00:49:01.202 --> 00:49:03.619
We don't actually.

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:05.868
I think most people have that covered.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.340
You mean there's enough out there,
that's a good point, a very good point.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.300
What's the timeframe?
I am excited to see this book come out.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.019
Well, we got a couple of weeks left
before we have to get it done.

00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:17.651
So we're shooting for 28.

00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:19.699
Mm-hmm, of August.

00:49:19.796 --> 00:49:22.099
Very good.
This has been a wonderful interview.

00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:24.260
I've really enjoyed talking to you Dr. Mike
and Stephanie,

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.139
thank you so much for taking the time.

00:49:26.139 --> 00:49:28.179
Any last words you want to leave
our listeners with

00:49:28.179 --> 00:49:30.501
and where can they go
to learn more about you?

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:34.019
Well, first of all, we really appreciate
the opportunity to be here, it's been terrific.

00:49:34.019 --> 00:49:39.340
You can find us online
at www.ketowithplants.com

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.099
and so one thing we like to say

00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:46.940
is that all of this is something
that we're into... we're in together

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.260
and I think that working
in a collaborative nature

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.300
both as professionals
and as members of society

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.460
is the best way forward.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.852
And I think that's what I'd like
to leave you with.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.179
He means we as in you
and all of your listeners and not just us.

00:50:01.179 --> 00:50:04.172
All of us.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.851
Thank you so much for joining us
on the DietDoctor podcast.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.380
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
