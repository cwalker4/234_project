00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.280
It's a wonderful day today and
I don't know if you know this

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.290
or not, but George
Washington's birthday today.

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:09.620
Give it up for G Dubz.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.040
George Washington was
the father of our country

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.800
and he was famous for saying
that he could not tell a lie.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.895
He was also a Pisces,
according to Cosmo,

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.270
that means that he was very
attentive to the sexual needs

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.894
of his partner.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.010
So apparently the ladies didn't
need to lie to him, either.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.630
Know what I'm saying?

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.100
I looked up George Washington.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.840
He's had so many
wonderful quotes

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.300
and here's one thing I want
to share with you today.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.350
It said, "real integrity
is doing the right thing

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.630
knowing that nobody's going
to know whether you did it

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.680
or not."

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.490
Isn't that amazing?

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.987
That's beautiful.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.550
Actually it wasn't
George Washington

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.124
that said that, it was
Oprah, she said it.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.360
I think we can all agree she's
smart, she's inspirational,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.095
she's here today.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.720
So speaking of
Oprah and president,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.194
something happened over the
weekend that got my attention.

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:34.610
As you know, our
current president

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.990
spends a lot of time tweeting as
our forefathers really intended

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.120
for the president to do.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.420
And this is what President
Trump tweeted on Sunday night,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.770
"just watched a very
insecure Oprah Winfrey,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.290
who at one point
I knew very well,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.720
interview a panel of
people on '60 Minutes.'

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.300
The questions were biased and
slanted, the facts incorrect,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.270
hope Oprah runs so she can
be exposed and defeated just

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.520
like all the others."

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.840
Oh no you didn't.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.620
No, no, no.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.490
He's gone too far.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.531
Oprah is my friend, and
when you mess with Oprah,

00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.310
you mess with me.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420
Let's break down the
president's tweet.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.440
First he said Oprah is insecure.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.230
OK, so here is Oprah speaking
in front of her colleagues,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.350
and it doesn't seem like
she's insincere, you see.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.430
So I want all the girls
watching here, now to know,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.495
that a new day is
on the horizon.

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:51.048
And when that new
day finally dawns,

00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:56.520
it will be because of a lot of
magnificent women, many of whom

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.646
are right here in
this room tonight.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:02.478
And some pretty phenomenal men.

00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:07.880
Fighting hard to make sure that
they become the leaders who

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.720
take us to the time
when nobody ever

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.200
has to say, "Me, Too" again.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.740
Now here is the
president speaking

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.470
in front of his colleagues.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.610
Look at those hands,
are they small hands?

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.710
And he referred to my
hands, if they're small,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.390
something else must be small.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.085
I guarantee you there's no
problem, I guarantee it.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:44.290
You know everyone
knows that when

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.880
you talk about how
big your hands are,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.460
it means you're very secure.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.920
Now, the president also
said he knows Oprah.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.770
I know Oprah and here's what
Oprah did to help people

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.570
on her talk show.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.730
All right, open your boxes.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.650
You get a car!

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.640
You get a car!

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.630
You get a car!

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.620
You get a car!

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.610
You get a car!

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.600
You get a car!

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.590
You get a car!

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.570
You get a car!

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.035
Oh my goodness!

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:19.510
Everybody gets a car!

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.910
And here's what
President Trump did

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.326
to help the people
in Puerto Rico.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.780
You get paper towels,
and you get paper towels,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.880
and you get paper towels.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.480
So, President Trump, it's
time for an aha moment, OK.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.430
You're not just some
guy on Twitter anymore,

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.440
you're the president
for all of us.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.480
It is your job to
unite people and you

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.090
don't do it by attacking
people, especially Oprah.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.550
I mean George Washington may
be the father of our country,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.260
but Oprah is the
mother of our country.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.820
Like I said, you don't mess
with Oprah, she's my friend.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.597
Hi, I'm Andy.

00:05:21.597 --> 00:05:23.930
Ellen asked me to remind you
to subscribe to her channel

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.270
so you can see more
awesome videos, like videos

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.980
of me getting scared or
saying embarrassing things,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.380
like ball peen hammer.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.170
And also some videos of
Ellen and other celebrities,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.680
if you're into
that sort of thing.
