and you're going to answer it,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.010

that pops into your head, and
then you hit this, and for no

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470
When I think-- when I
think of the answer?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.160
Whatever it is.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.980
Pops into your head, and
you say it, and do that.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.925
I've already told you, pajamas.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.050
All right, but you answer
first, and then hit that.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.580
[DING]

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.079
All right.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.830
I've got to say it.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.990
Sorry, let me just
get this right.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.324
I give the answer, then I do it?

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:46.823
Yeah.

00:00:46.823 --> 00:00:47.930
It's very, very important.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.820
OK.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.660
If I gave the
answer to that one,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.580
I will get killed by their fans.

Yeah, that's all right.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.921
If you could only
watch one reality show

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.170
that you're not involved in
for the rest of your life,

No, silly.

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:17.445

the most hearing in auditions?

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.341
Grenade, Bruno Mars.

00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:43.840

Is that basing that a lot?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.620
No one can sing that song well.

This is so embarrassing.

I feel really stupid right now.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.370
Do it again.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.120
We'll just cut.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.510

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.600
Why?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.766
Because we both look in the
mirror at the same time,

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:10.130
saying how handsome we are.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.280

Yeah.

lied recently.

Are you a member of
the mile high club?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.422
It wasn't quite a mile.
