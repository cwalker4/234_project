Welcome to the Electricity of Life,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.350
brought to you by The Thunderbolts
Projectâ„¢ at Thunderbolts.info

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.100
In part 1 of this presentation, Dr.
Jerry Tennant introduced us to his

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.850
extraordinary research into the complex
electrical circuitry of the human body.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
Since his own remarkable battle
with debilitating illness,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.510
Dr. Tennant has worked to develop a kind
of map of this circuitry, illuminating

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.430
its essential connection
to physical well-being.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.940
In the previous episode, Dr.Tennant discussed the
particular significance of the circuitry connecting

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.550
teeth to other regions of the body.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.530
The concept of illness arising from
electrical imbalances is, of course,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.460
unconventional in modern
Western medicine.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.710
However, the application of electromagnetic
therapies in healing is not new.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.320
In this conclusion, we asked Dr. Tennant
to begin by discussing some of the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.450
earliest examples of the use of
electromagnetism as a physical remedy.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.660
Well, interesting question.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.080
If you go back in time, in the 1800's and early
1900's, electromagnetic therapies of a variety

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.220
of forms were commonplace.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.650
But that changed in about 1910 when Andrew
Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller decided

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.250
to become the major investors in the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.590
And so they had a report written called the
'Flexner Report' which they then took to Congress.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.090
At that time there were, I think, 13
homeopathic medical schools in this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.090
country and again, most physicians were
using some sort of electromagnetic therapies.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.270
Well, the Flexner Report got Congress to
forbid the use of any federal money for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.610
anyone who said there was energy
in the body, so that that closed

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
the thirteen homeopathic medical schools
and then, any physician who was using

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.120
an electronic device to treat
patients got put in jail.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.330
Well, that set up pretty much of a
chilling effect and that's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.310
how our country stopped looking at
energy in the body and that was the case

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.000
until Nixon went to China, saw some of
the people in his entourage undergo

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.560
surgery with acupuncture and came back
and told the NIH he wanted

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.010
acupuncture to be part of
traditional medicine.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.730
But even though that was what
the NIH was instructed to do, the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.750
people who control medicine in this
country basically continued to ignore it.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.330
So, for example, many states including my
state of Texas forbids the use of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.150
anything that's not standard
of care medicine.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.450
So what is standard of care medicine?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.580
Well, a group of physicians and
insurance people and so forth sat around

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.940
a table and said okay, if you make this
diagnosis you must treat it this way.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.420
And originally they said, these
are going to be suggestions in order to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.700
improve the quality of care.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.870
But of course, that wasn't the plan.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.880
The plan was to make those
the law and so it has de facto

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.400
become that so if you go to a
physician and the physician says you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.380
have this diagnosis and this diagnosis
code then the physician must treat you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.200
according to those guidelines.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.980
If he doesn't, he loses his license and he's
considered guilty of malpractice de facto.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.070
So even if a physician knows that

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.550
that's not going to harm you,
there's nothing to do about it.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.230
Even if the physician knows there's
a better way to treat you

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.450
there's nothing to do about it.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.070
Even if 10 universities and medical
schools have proven there's a better

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.980
treatment, the physicians can't
use that until that committee says

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.660
that it's become standard of care.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.260
Most people don't know that
but what that does then

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.320
is, it puts the control of how
medical care is delivered in this

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.760
country in the hands of the small group
of people who make up the rules of

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.030
standard of care and those are all slanted toward
pharmaceutical surgical medicine, you see.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.500
So that's why people like me have to say
well, everything that I say is using my

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.250
Arizona MDH license and
not my Texas license.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.590
Because I'm not allowed in the
state of Texas to tell you what I'm

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.060
telling you, I have to use my
Arizona license to do so.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.800
You know, medicine in this
country is the most controlled, most

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.800
supervised, most controlled business if
you please, of anything in the country.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.510
No other industry is more controlled
than the practice of medicine.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.190
The effort to push it into things that work
is constantly being suppressed even to the

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.280
place of physicians losing their
livelihood in order to prevent that.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.710
Now, even though medical schools, most medical
schools now have a division of

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.270
Integrative Medicine where they teach
this, it puts the physician in a very

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.590
difficult position because the physician
comes out of medical school knowing that

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.150
that's a useful thing to do but the
state medical boards won't allow it.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.120
It's a very difficult thing so what I have to do
is, I practice as a private expressive association.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.190
So the Supreme Court has had
72 different opinions given that

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.440
says that legislators make laws to
protect the public but the people in a

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.620
private group like a church group, a
sports group and so forth are not the public.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.500
And that any private group may do

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.720
anything they want to do as long as what
they do is not a clear and present

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.070
danger that rises to the level
of a substantive evil.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.880
You may not have ever
wondered why don't the police arrest

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.240
boxers because it's against the law to
go around slugging each other?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.400
Well, it's because boxing clubs are private
expressive associations as defined by the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.960
US Supreme Court and so even though
boxing is a clear and present danger,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.380
it does not rise to the level of a
substantive evil and so they don't get arrested.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:37.630
However, if religious people sexually
assault their parishioners, that does

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.930
rise to the level of a
substantive evil, and therefore the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.190
police can go and arrest a priest, a rabbi
or whatever for sexual abuse, you see.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.740
So for example that's the way I practice.
I don't practice, my practice isn't open

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.610
to the public in the sense that if you
want to come see me you must join my

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.770
private expressive association to become
a member of my group and then I can tell

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.000
you what's in the medical literature rather than
have to treat you with the standard care.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.620
If the health of living
cells is governed by voltage then an

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.200
obvious concern in modern society is the

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.800
rapidly growing pervasiveness
of wireless technologies.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.560
We asked Dr. Tennant to
identify some of the greatest

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.500
obstacles we should be aware of today.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.160
Well, there's no doubt that we have all
sorts of things that affect us.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.880
You know, for example, if I had you hold your
arm straight out and check the push down

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.650
on it, you would be strong, and then if I
had you take a wristwatch with a battery

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.160
in it and hold it right up against your chest
and I pushed on your arm, you would go weak.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:51.070
So again, when we put electromagnetic
energy within our

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:56.510
personal magnetic field, it weakens
us, our particular frequencies weaken us.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.030
And so we're being bombarded with
that sort of thing all the time.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.760
Here's the bottom line
of the whole thing.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.490
We are constantly wearing ourselves out,
so you get new cells in the macula of your

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.710
eye every 48 hours, the lining of your
guts replaced every three days, the skin

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.760
you're sitting in today is six weeks old,
your liver is eight weeks old, and your

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.140
nervous system eight months old, so as
cells wear out you have to make new ones.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.180
Or if the cells get damaged some way,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.060
you have to make new ones
so chronic disease

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.400
only occurs when you
lose the ability to

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.800
make new cells that work.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.540
Let me say that one more time,
chronic disease only

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.460
occurs when you lose the ability to make
new cells that work, which leads one to the

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.060
question of, well, what's it take
to make new cells that work?

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.910
Well, first of all, where cells
run at minus 25 millivolts

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.890
of energy it takes minus 50 millivolts
to make a new cell, so you have to have

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.810
the voltage, then you have to have
all the parts it takes to make a cell.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.880
You know, if tornado blows your house
down, you can't build a house back

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.210
with door knobs and bathroom tiles.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.450
You have to have everything it takes to make
a house and that's one of the big

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.050
mistakes people make when they say,
I'm trying to get well, and you say well,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.560
take this stuff!

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.260
They come back later and you say well,
are you still taking all this stuff?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.870
No, I just wanted to know what
thing, what one thing works so I've just

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.710
been taking one thing at a time.
Well nothing works, you see what I'm

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:27.320
saying, again, that concept of I want
to know what works, won't work because

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.890
you have to have everything it takes to
make a cell and that's the nutrition

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.880
piece of course. So we have to have 50
millivolts of energy, we have to have all

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.420
the parts it takes to make a cell, and we
have to get rid of any toxins that

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.480
damage cells as fast as you make them.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.490
So if you don't do all three of those
things, you won't get well.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.380
One then goes in and looks
at each of those

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:55.370
so for example, the voltage piece; we're able
to measure the voltages in the circuits

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.400
using something similar to
Nakatani et al. methodology,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.740
but one of the important
things to understand is that it's well

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.180
known in battery technology that if
you take a rechargeable battery and you

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.830
drain it all the way to zero, it'll flip
itself upside down, it flips the polarity.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.830
So if you take a battery upside down put it
in a battery charger, it won't take a charge

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:20.600
of course. So what we do is we go through
and we can measure the polarity of every

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.950
circuit in your body and figure out
which ones are upside-down and those are

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.790
the ones where you're going to be sick.
Because you don't have juice and they

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.260
are low circuits that are trying to borrow
voltage from the next-door neighbors.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.290
But I like to say, the neighbors will give
you a cup of sugar now and then but they

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.190
won't give you three meals a day.
There are two kinds of energy in the universe

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:45.380
that I'm aware of, electromagnetic and
then scalar, and of course scalar has the

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.180
ability to reverse the
polarity back to normal.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.300
So we have a device that will do
that, called a bio transducer, and we

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.080
simply can put it on one of the
acupuncture spots in the body and all

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.860
your batteries get turned back up.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.620
Of course, they're still discharged.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.170
Then we take the bio modulator
which puts out a specific

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.430
waveform and recharge your
batteries back up.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.310
Now your battery has power again
and then the body never

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:19.190
forgets how to repair itself, just that
it has to have the power to do it, has to

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.880
have the materials to do it.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.930
So no matter what's wrong with you,
again, you asked me

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:30.820
about neurology, nephrology, cardiology,
any of the -ologies.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.290
You treat them all the same way,
because they're all sick

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.510
for the same reason, they lost the
ability to make new cells that work

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.610
and/or they lost the power to run.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:46.760
You can't have a heart that works if it's trying to
run on five millivolts instead of 25 millivolts, right?

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.830
You can't have a macula
in your eye that works.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.880
All macular degeneration is because you've lost
power in the stomach circuit which is

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.540
the power, the stomach circuit, acupuncture
circuit, is the power supply to the macula.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.940
So anytime somebody has
macular degeneration and you

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.060
measure it, you always find
there's inadequate power and it's

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.610
reversed the polarity in the stomach circuit
whereas glaucoma, the optic

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.810
nerves are on a different circuit, it's on
the liver circuit and so every

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.170
time you see a glaucoma patient and
measure it, the liver circuit will have

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.660
flipped its polarity.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.450
So how do you treat it, you flip the
polarity back, charge the

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.320
battery back up and then you figure

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.510
out why did the battery lose its
charge in the first place.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.330
Well, there are five basic reasons.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.950
One is that you have to look at the
thyroid hormone, because thyroid

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.790
controls the voltage of every cell
membrane in the body, T3 controls the

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.140
voltage of the cell membranes and the
number of mitochondria, T2 controls the

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.970
function of the mitochondria.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.260
So you always, let's say you don't have a
thyroid hormon, your battery discharges to here.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.520
Now, if you put a scar across one
of your circuits and it touches the

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.570
fascia, it shorts it out like any other
electronic short, so wherever you have

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:04.370
scars, that's gonna short out that circuit.
So many women have a C-section

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.520
scar which goes right across
the stomach circuit.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.560
The spleen stomach circuit is
the entire reproductive system, the

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.770
entire endocrine system, the thinking
part of the brain, the macula of the eye.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.810
OK, so thyroid takes us down to here,
scars take us down to here.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.070
Dental infections; since every circuit
goes through specific teeth if you have

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.510
an infection in a tooth that acts like a
resistor and drops the voltage.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.810
All right, dental infections
takes you down to here.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.230
Emotions are stored in the body's
magnetic fields as I discussed in my

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:41.060
lecture to the Electric Universe and all
of us have emotions, but if you have a

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.620
wire and you put a magnetic field
around, it blocks the full voltage, that's

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.990
how emotions drop our voltage
and make us sick.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:54.520
Thyroid, scars, dental infections,
emotions, and finally toxins and now your

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.380
batteries drain to zero and flip upside
down and there you go, you're sick.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.330
One of the problems with American medicine
is that the scientists say, we have to

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:10.240
isolate everything else and look at just this one
thing to see if it's the cause of the disease.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.750
It almost never is.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.530
Almost all diseases are multifactorial.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.290
That's why we're having such a hard time in
American medicine, finding the cause

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:24.260
because it's almost always several
causes that flip the voltage.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.660
Then, when you don't have
voltage, as voltage drops,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.870
oxygen drops because the amount of
oxygen that will dissolve in a liquid

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.820
is dictated by the voltage of the liquid.
When you lose voltage, you lose oxygen.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.860
When you lose oxygen, your metabolism
becomes inefficient, infections show up,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:46.000
and when you get to plus 30 millivolts
you have cancer, as simple as that.
