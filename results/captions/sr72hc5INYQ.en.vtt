00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.660
Alright guys

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.960
Today we're hiking way up into this canyon

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.600
As you can see it's pretty snowy out

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.300
but back here there is an old mine tunnel

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.140
and it looks like there could be a building right next to it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.920
but the road has been completely washed out

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320
you can see, like, they had a flash flood here

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.800
So we've been hiking about

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.480
about a half mile

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.420
you can see the old road right there

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.760
right up there, you can see the old road

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.940
but look at this

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.380
there's a big flash flood through here

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.500
you can see this entire little valley now

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.820
As you can see

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.260
we've hiked

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.160
from this way

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.300
pretty far down, about a, about a mile that way

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.820
but over here you can see

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.160
the tailing pile of this mine

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.400
and if this tunnel is open, should be a pretty interesting explore.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.700
Let's go check it out.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.260
Here ya are, look guys, this is a tunnel.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.920
Looks pretty creepy too.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.120
Let's get our gear and take a look.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.060
Check out these icicles guys

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.400
That's not creepy lookin'

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.960
Look at that

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.740
I wonder how strong they are

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.340
So, I guess we're going to try and walk underneath them carefully

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.160
to get through

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.460
You gotta watch out for these icicles guys, look at them

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.320
Birds nest right here

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.900
Oh, lets turn on our oxygen meter.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.620
I do see some prints in here

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.280
this old coda...coda. Old soda can

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.280
got our oxygen sensors to be safe

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.520
Make sure we're safe

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.720
Alright, lets get started. Anybody, any of you, you explorers

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.360
know why they would do this to the walls?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.680
Let us know in the comments.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.840
Ok, we got good oxygen

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.000
This one seems pretty safe actually, but I don't want to say that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.960
cause them "boom", you know, something happens.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.880
You just see rocks start falling'.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.740
I see something back here. Let's go back and see a little further

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.100
There's a little bat you guys
