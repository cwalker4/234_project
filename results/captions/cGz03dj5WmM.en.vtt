00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:11.710
Hello Everyone for those of you who don't
know me, I'm Scott, and I've known Mike for

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.880
about, how old are you Mike?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880
29?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm the oldest of the McCusker brothers, and
one could say that I'm a trend setter.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.869
I'm the first of us to work electrical with
our father, as well as the first to go to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.920
Western University, and the first to bartend
at the Western University's campus bar.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.899
But, somehow the last to finish school.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.989
And, I'm Kyle, the youngest of the McCusker
brothers.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.050
I've known Mike for just about 23 years now
and I think I've liked him for about 5.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.729
For those of you know don't know me it's "Our
youngest" is how I'm usually described because

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:58.339
there's "Scott, he's got his PHD and he specializes
in Anesthesiology, hes so great" and "Mike,

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:09.770
oh my god he's going to take over the company"
and then "theres Kyle our youngest".

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.740
We would like to start by just thanking everyone
who came here today to celebrate Mike and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.740
Char.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.409
It is a true testiment to the Bride and Groom
that all fo you have taken your time out of

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.740
your busy schedules to come and witness their
marriage.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.210
We would also like to congratulate Mike and
Char for being the most elite couple that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.030
Whitby, or even Canada, has even seen.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.600
This power couple will go to the gym at 4
o'clock in the morning prior to working an

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.229
8-hour shift, come home, make financially
wise decisions, whle then preparing meals

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.040
for the next two weeks.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.200
Yeah, Mike and Char take hastag couplegoals
to a whole new level.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.870
My girlfriend Kal and Iare practising physicians
and when we talk about Mike and Char accomplishments,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.950
we wonder where the hell we went wrong.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.060
Imagine being part of the Amazing Race and
these two walk on set, "Uh, yeah, boss...

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.840
I'm going to be in tomorrow".

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.489
Thats pretty much how it would go essentially.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.050
Everyone in this audience today is safe because
you can always just say "Well thats just good

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.260
parenting", but we're Mike's brothers so we
have no excuse!

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.450
Where's Charlotte's brother Chris?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.030
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.950
Mike asked us to do his speech today, and
obviously we couldn't be more happy to be

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.160
doing this, but he thought it would be the
more "safe" option, but we are probably more

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.120
likely to offend him then anyone else in this
room.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.470
So, growing up Mike was the athelete.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.420
He playe Triple A Hockey with current NHL
players like PK Subban and Stephen Stamkos,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.720
as well as played lacrosse with the current
head coach of the Michigan State University

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.030
Lacrosse team right now.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.200
He was also intelligent and got an honors
specialization in biology "with distinction",

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.939
which essentially means he got higher grades
than both Kyle and I.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.340
Everything came natural to Mike and because
of this he was always labelled as the "golden

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.610
child".

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.860
But, we're here tonight to debunk that misconception.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.620
Dad, would you kindly stand up and let everyone
know here tonight that Mike is in fact NOT

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.530
the golden child.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.890
Um, well the way I see it guys and I'll say
this in front of everybody here.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.380
Mike, theres no way he's the golden child,
okay.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:04:04.102
I love all three of my boys, golden, not a
chance, platnum maybe, but gold?

00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:05.102
no way!

00:04:05.102 --> 00:04:06.102
Alright old man sit down, we're done here!

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:07.102
Yeah dad thats enough of that.

00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:08.102
But yeah, Mike definitely made our parents
proud.

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:09.102
How couldn't he.

00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:15.190
But the only person more proud of Mike than
our parents, has got to be Mike himself.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.660
That guy loves to boast about himself.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.940
During his years in school, he effortlessly
just aced courses.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.280
Didn't try, 95s, sure.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.480
High school, guy played Triple A Hockey, comes
home bleech blonde hair, but he'd get 95s

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.480
and he's only talking about his practices
he has to go to.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.330
I mean great job pal what round you get drafted
in again?

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.420
University, he's all into fitness now, and
he's still getting 95s/94s but he's still

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:59.600
more focussed on his body fat percentage going
from 3.1% to 3.08%, but he'll tell you all

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.920
about that.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.220
So modest about his education.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.700
And all these great things to go to Mike's
head, you'd be suprised it's still the size

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.280
of a peanut!

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:21.580
But yeah that was during school and he's all
grown up now, you think he'd be a little different,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.320
a little bit more humble?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320
Maybe.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:34.100
But in 2016 he took Charlotte to the Willis
tower, got down on one knee, and he said...

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.680
"You're welcome".

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:47.750
Jokes aside, Mike honestly you are a role
model for all of us gathered here in this

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.750
room tonight.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.040
I'm your older brother and Iook up to you...

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.780
litterally I can't believe you are taller
than me.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.350
You have a discipline that is on a completely
different level than everyone else here in

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.060
this room tonight.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.160
You show us the right way to share, and you
show us the right way to work, and most importantly

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.030
you show us the right way to love, and with
Charlotte by your side, I know that both of

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.720
you will show us the right way to live happily
ever after.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.850
And thats the real we are here tonight right?

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.450
Charlotte.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.810
I've known Charlotte for about almost 8 years
now.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.460
While Mike was in University essentially duplicating
my entire undergraduate experience but without

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.770
facial hair, he told me about a girl that
he met in Whitby in the Fall of 2010.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.760
My first impression of Charlotte is that she
was beautiful, charming, friendly and thoughful.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.720
Obviously confirming the old adage that opposites
attract.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.940
She fit in instantly with our family, as well
as tolerated our father when he had too many

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.190
drinks at The Keg.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.090
And we love her for that.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.160
So tonight, it is amazing just to see Charlotte.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Our first impression tonight, obviously she
looks stunning.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.520
Everyone obviously agrees so lets get a round
of applause for that.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:24.130
The dress is beautiful obviously a change
from the pants she wears in the relationship.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.030
So Charlotte, tonight is your night, and our
brother chose you to be his wife, and we could

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.930
not be more excited.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.200
Everyone here today agrees that both of you
look amazing.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:45.380
And, you're both amazing inside and out, best
people you'll ever meet, and you guys just

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.990
couldn't be luckier.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:08:01.550
So, to that, so everyone to that stand up
and raise a glass.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:09.860
Today Mike and Charlotte get married, and
Scott and I gain a sister, and Charlotte with

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:21.390
you becoming our sister we need to share with
you the 5 absolutely essential, crucial, things

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.140
you need to know to be a McCusker.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.180
Okay.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.560
Number one you do not ever!...

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:40.089
Oh, ugh, I've just been told that it's actually
past Mike and Charlotte's bedtime and we need

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:41.089
to wrap this up.

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:42.089
Sorry guys!

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.089
Cheers guys!

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.089
Cheers to Mike and Char!

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:49.240
Well I think everyone will agree Scott and
Kyle did a great job.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.170
Give them a round of applause.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.869
Next up we're going to have Charlotte's parents.
