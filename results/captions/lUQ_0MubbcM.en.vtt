00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.860
Why does the United States support Israel? Well, there's a history.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.460
and a very interesting one

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.920
that actually goes back to... goes back a long time.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.260
uh... one thing to remember is that

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.720
Christian Zionism is a very powerful force

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.520
which goes back long before Jewish Zionism.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.080
In England particularly Christian Zionism was a

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.750
powerful Force Among British Elites.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.649
It's part of the motivation for the Balfour declaration

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.529
and for Britain's support for

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.120
Jewish Colonization of Israel. Remember...

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.040
the Bible said... you know...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.040
and that's a big part of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.300
British Elite Culture. Same in the United States.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.059
Woodrow Wilson was a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.420
devout Christian who read the Bible every day.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.180
So did harry Truman.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.640
In the Roosevelt administration, one of the leading officials, Harold Ickes, once described

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.240
the return of the jews to Palestine as the greatest event in history.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.380
It's so realizing the lesson of the bible.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.100
These are deeply religious countries in which the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.600
Biblical command, so-called, are taken quite literally. Also, this is just part of colonization.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.220
This is the lastphase of European Colonization.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.460
And notice that the countries

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.140
that are most strongly in support of Israel are not just the United States.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.660
It's the United States, Australia, and Canada.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.420
The offshoots of England. Anglosphere sometimes called.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.800
Unusual forms of imperialism.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.400
These are settler colonial societies.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.040
Coloned societies in which the... not like India... not like the British in India, say...

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.780
Societies, South Africa, was a little like this, or Algeria under the French.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.529
Settler colonial societies in which the settlers came in,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.499
essentially eliminated the native population

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.290
also driven by

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.440
religious principles... Very religious groups driven by Christian Zionism. Those are major cultural factors.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.500
There are also significant geostrategic factors. In... you go back to 1948

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.400
There was actually a split between the state department and the Pentagon in the United States

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.100
over how to react to the new state of Israel.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360
The State Department was

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.790
... was... was...

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.100
questioned... it was not committed strongly to Israeli conquests,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.620
the establishment of the state, and was concerned about the refugees

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.620
It wanted an implementation of the refugee problem.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.740
The Pentagon, on the other hand,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500
Reckitt was very impressed with Israel's military potential.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.569
The Israeli military successes.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.310
If you look back at the internal record, in declassified, the Joint chiefs of staff described

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.600
Israel as the second largest military force in the region after Turkey

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.100
and a potential base for US power in the region. That continued

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.000
Can't run through the whole record,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.640
but in 1958 when there was a serious crisis in the region

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.289
Israel was the only state that strongly cooperated with Britain and the United States

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.230
And it won plenty of support from the governments and the military for that reason.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.738
1967 is when the current relations with Israel were pretty much established

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.580
Israel performed a major service to the United States by destroying secular Arab nationalism,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.700
a major enemy of the United States, and supporting radical Islam

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.480
which the U.S. supported and it continues right until the present

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.079
right now

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.709
we saw an example of that just during the... uh...

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.489
Gaza...

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.529
latest Gaza attack you recall that at one point

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.410
Israel began to run out of munitions

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.759
during the assault despite the fact that it's a armed to the teeth

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.640
that the United States provided Israel with additional munitions

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.480
through the Pentagon and notice where they were taken from

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.540
These were U.S. munitions pre-positioned in Israel

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.800
for eventual use by U.S. Forces

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.560
one of many signs of how

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.380
Israel is regarded as essentially a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.540
military officer of the United States.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.100
very close intelligence relations that go way back

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.740
many other connections

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.700
and the media tend

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.840
to take up... to support the policy of the government with

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.190
very few kind of little questioning around the edges, but basically

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.739
accept the policy so for example take another issue. Take the U.S. invasion of Iraq

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.430
You cannot find the phrase U.S. invasion of Iraq in the U.S. media.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.160
There was obviously an invasion.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.480
A blatant act of aggression. A textbook case of

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.180
That's what Nuremberg trials called the supreme international crime. Cannot be mentioned.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.090
President Obama is praised as an opponent of the invasion

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.719
What did he say? He said it's a mistake. It's a strategic blunder. We're not going to get away with it.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.960
Now that's about as that's the kind of opposition that

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.440
You heard from the German general staff during Hitler's invasion of Russia

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.470
It's a blunder. Shouldn't do it. We should knock off.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.340
England first.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.470
That's regarded as opposition the same in Vietnam, there's now...

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.699
There's now a commemoration underway. A big commemoration of U.S. sacrifices in Vietnam

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.840
Try to find the phrase U.S. invasion of South Vietnam

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.780
there or anywhere in the past years since 1961 when it took place

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.240
Nonexistent. Maybe on "Democracy Now",

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.180
what I write but way out of the fringe and this is not unique to the United States

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.980
Take, say, Britain.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.180
Right now there's interesting debates in the British literary journals like the times literary supplement

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.200
As to whether britain should finally begin to recognize the genocidal the word that's used

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.090
Genocidal

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.209
character of British Colonization

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.590
hundreds of years ago

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:52.060
Should Israel should Britain begin to face it? You know you can ask that question in many places

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.939
the tendency of the

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.769
intellectual community to go along like a herd in support of

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.109
state power, private power is just overwhelming

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:11.990
we... peo...

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.019
intellectuals like to think of themselves as

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:18.129
dissident, critical, courageous, standing up against power.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.580
Absolutely untrue. You look at the historical record that's a small fringe, and they're usually punished.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.200
The mainstream tends to be

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.180
what was once called a herd of independent minds marching in support of State power

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.380
Nothing new here.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.729
Unfortunate. You have to fight against it. Not new.
