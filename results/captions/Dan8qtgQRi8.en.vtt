00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.890
Recently, low carb diets, intermittent fasting
and even prolonged fasting have become very

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.140
popular and they all have something in common.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.809
They move you towards entering the state of
ketosis.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.039
Ketosis is a state where your body is running
primarily on fat, fat from your diet or your

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.440
body.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.180
Ketogenesis is when Fats are broken down into
something called ketones.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.150
These ketones (or ketone bodies) are usually
thought of as an alternate fuel source, because

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.640
instead of glucose, ketones are used to power
most tissues as well as the brain.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.070
Sustaining ketosis means restricting protein
to less than 20% of your calories and carbs

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.650
to less than 5%

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.510
Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of
confusion around ketones, most people have

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.380
been taught that ketosis is a dangerous unnatural
state that appears only during starvation

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.890
or in diabetics…

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.670
So with this video I’d like to clear up
some misunderstandings and, I’ll present

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.590
to you why entering this fat burning state
of ketosis can be perfectly natural, and might

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.160
even even be the preferred state for humans,
compared to having our bodies always running

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.270
off of carbohydrate.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.249
To see how there can be so much confusion
around a topic like ketosis, let’s first

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:11.259
take a look at the story of the thymus gland.

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.749
Back around the 18th and 19th century, it
was hard to get cadavers for anatomical study.

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:20.139
People didn’t really like having their recently
deceased loved ones cut up for examination.

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:24.350
So people called resurrectionists were employed
by anatomists to exhume the bodies of the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.259
recently dead.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.110
Sometimes resurrectionists would even wait
near a funeral and snatch the body right then

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.289
and there.

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.499
Because of this, wealthy people would purchase
very well crafted lockable coffins and they

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:39.350
would hire armed guards to protect the graves
of their loved ones.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.679
The 1832 Anatomy Act even said that if a person
died in a poor house, or their relatives could

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.560
not pay for medical expenses, their body was
to be immediately turned over to the anatomist

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.930
for study.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.189
This meant that anatomists were much more
likely to get their hands on the body of a

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.979
poor person who couldn’t afford such measures.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.209
So... what about the thymus?

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.070
Well, people facing the hardships that come
from being poor, are of course going to be

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.020
under a lot of stress.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.020
Chronic stress.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.679
Nowadays we’re very familiar with the fact
that chronic stress leads to all types of

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.870
diseases, and that it can atrophy certain
organs.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.069
In the case of the thymus, stress can reduce
its size by as much as 75%.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.099
So what ended up being recorded into the anatomy
books as a normal thymus gland was actually

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.030
a thymus that was severely reduced in size.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.400
Then, in the 1900’s a german anatomist called
Paltauf was trying to find the cause of Sudden

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.239
Infant Death syndrome.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.989
Manny middle and upper class babies were abruptly
dying of this.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.370
So Paltauf examines the bodies of these higher
class babies and notices that their thymus

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.599
glands appear to be abnormally large.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.299
So he concluded that if you wanted to be a
good parent you should irradiate the thymus

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.250
gland of your child to make it smaller and
prevent sudden infant death syndrome.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.319
By the 1920’s all the the leading pediatric
textbooks were offering this advice.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.659
Paltauf of course didn’t realize that he
was simply someone who had the rare chance

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.440
to look at the bodies of children whose thymus
was not affected by the chronic stress of

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.560
poverty.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.159
Unfortunately this misunderstanding persisted
well into the 1950’s, having several thousands

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.719
of people die from irradiation induced cancer.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.370
So, what does any of this have to do with
ketosis?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.670
Well, ketones also have the misfortune of
being misunderstood due to how they were discovered.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.790
Physicians first noticed ketones in the latter
part of the 19th century, when they were noticed

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.269
to be in abundance in the urine of patients
in a diabetic coma.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.079
It was understood that a vast overproduction
of ketones was responsible for the terrible

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.099
symptoms of something called diabetic ketoacidosis.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.250
So for half a century ketones were thought
to be the very negative product of impaired

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.550
carbohydrate utilization.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.841
Only after technology and analytical techniques
improved did we understand that ketone bodies

00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.629
are perfectly normal components of the blood.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.790
Even if you’re not technically in ketosis,
Ketone bodies are always present in the blood

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.569
of a healthy person and their levels increase
the longer you go without food.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.310
After an overnight fast, ketone bodies supply
2–6% of the body's energy requirements,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.859
while they supply 30–40% of the energy needs
after a 3-day fast.

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.140
Before we continue, being in ketosis through
fasting or diet is nothing like diabetic ketoacidosis.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.700
Ketoacidosis involves exorbitant levels of
ketone production, far higher than what you

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.470
could achieve even when fasting for weeks.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.230
Being worried about ketoacidosis through diet
or fasting is like worrying that eating at

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.720
a sushi restaurant is going to put you in
brief coma just like that one kid who chugged

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.060
a bottle of soy sauce on a dare.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.730
So not only are ketones normally found in
healthy people, but it’s been found that

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.090
certain tissues prefer to use ketone bodies.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.100
In fact, as is explained in the Biochemistry
textbook published by W.H. Freeman “Fatty

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.200
acids are the heart's main source of fuel,
although ketone bodies as well as lactate

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.310
can serve as fuel for heart muscle.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.080
In fact, heart muscle consumes acetoacetate
(a ketone body) in preference to glucose.”

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.410
Some people actually purposely enter ketosis
through fasting in order to improve mental

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.410
performance.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.370
A study at the University of Cambridge concluded
that a ketogenic diet “improved physical

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.440
performance and cognitive function in rats,
and its energy-sparing properties suggest

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.450
that it may help to treat a range of human
conditions with metabolic abnormalities.”

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.200
I guess Plato figured this out for himself
when he said “I fast for greater physical

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.380
and mental efficiency."

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.730
Going without food for better cognitive function
may sound ridiculous considering it was for

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.600
a long while thought that the brain can run
only on glucose ( carbohydrates).

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.600
George Cahill and his group at Harvard Medical
School demonstrated in 1967 that the brain

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.300
can use ketone bodies as a source of energy.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.450
What he found was that during starvation,
ketones are the predominant fuel for the peripheral

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.840
tissues and the brain, with the brain deriving
more than two thirds of its energy from ketone

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.110
bodies.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.950
Despite this, the body still requires some
glucose, even when you aren’t eating anything.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.840
For example red blood cells can’t run off
of ketone bodies because they don’t have

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.640
any mitochondria to metabolize them with.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.200
But all of the body’s glucose needs are
met by the fact that the body can make its

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.000
own glucose, for example it can make glucose
from the glycerol backbone of fat.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.070
For this reason, even during prolonged fasting,
people will keep a stable blood glucose level.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.500
This also illustrates that there is actually
no dietary requirement for carbohydrate.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.900
Of course vegetables and some fruit are very
important because they have all kinds of micronutrients

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.410
and fiber, but your body doesn’t actually
require the carbohydrate inside those foods.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.720
I’m not necessarily saying a zero carbohydrate
diet is best, just that it’s very possible

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.530
to live without dietary carbohydrate assuming
you get enough fat and protein.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.450
There are essential amino acids and there
are essential fatty acids - types of protein

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.710
and fat you must get from the diet.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.440
However, there is no such thing as an essential
dietary carbohydrate - your body is perfectly

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.780
capable of making as much glucose as it needs.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.430
In fact, in the absence of dietary carbohydrate,
the brain runs so efficiently off of ketone

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.630
bodies that you can drastically deplete glucose
levels of people in deep ketosis and it won’t

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.630
affect them.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.250
A 1972 paper describes an ethically questionable
study where overweight patients fasted for

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.050
2 months, putting them in deep ketosis meaning
they were producing a very large amount of

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.470
ketone bodies.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.070
Insulin was then infused into these patients
until their blood glucose went as low as low

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.780
as 9mg per deciliter - a level that should
cause coma or death.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.560
However, the patients didn’t really react
to this.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.990
There was no particular change in cognition,
nor did their body react to the drastic drop

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.990
in blood sugar.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.220
"The only people in the room who had palpations
and sweating and anxiety were the physicians.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.390
The people who had the blood sugar levels
that should be associated with coma or death

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.350
were completely unphased.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.600
Had completely normal mentation.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.900
It is clear that the human brain is perfectly
happy with beta hydroxybutyrate as not just

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.740
its majority fuel, but essentially its sole
fuel."

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.580
Actually anyone watching this video would
have, at at least one point in their lives,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.630
been in a similar situation where blood glucose
is very low and ketone utilization is very

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.210
high in their bodies.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.400
It’s estimated that a newborn’s brain
consumes on average between 60 and 71% of

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.550
its body’s energy budget.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.410
Compare that to the lowly 25% of the body’s
energy budget an adult brain uses.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:30.150
Despite this massive need for energy, a newborn’s
blood glucose level is incredibly low at around

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.700
35mg per deciliter.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.860
This is half of the lower end of a normal
adult’s blood glucose level.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.719
This means that the newborn’s brain would
have to be deriving more than half of its

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.130
energy from ketone bodies.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.820
In his book on the health potential of ketones,
Dr. Muneta Tetsuo, director of Muneta Maternity

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.380
Clinic in Japan explains that pregnant women,
whether they are restricting carbohydrate

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.890
or not are producing higher than normal levels
of ketones.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.300
By comparing the mother’s blood with the
newborn’s umbilical cord blood, he found

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:06.160
that out of 416 cases, 70% of babies were
born with even higher levels of ketones than

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.830
that of the mother.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.990
By analyzing the villi that provide contact
with the mother's blood to the fetal membrane,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.050
Muneta deduced that the fetus must be living
in an environment of elevated ketones from

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.060
the start of pregnancy.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:25.350
And, even a month after birth, babies on average
had a blood ketone level 5 times higher than

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.240
that of a normal person.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.430
As Muneta wrote in his book: “Newborns are
living off of ketones!”

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.570
Not only is ketosis helpful for supplying
the energy needs of the newborn baby, it may

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.330
also be an important factor in the development
of the brain.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.830
It’s been understood that exercise is beneficial
for the brain because it increases the level

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:50.320
of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor - BDNF,
which is a protein that promotes the growth

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.250
of new brain cells.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.840
Because of this, Dr. John Ratey of Harvard
Medical School has given BDNF the nickname

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.570
of “miracle gro for the brain.”

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.779
However, the mechanism for how exercise triggers
BDNF was not clear for some time, until a

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:08.430
paper came out last year that was headed by
Assistant Professor of Biochemistry Dr. Sama

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.430
Sleiman.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.260
I think the title is quite straightforward:
“Exercise promotes the expression of brain

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:20.080
derived neurotrophic factor through the action
of the ketone body beta hydroxybutyrate.”

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.360
Growth of the brain is very important in a
more broad sense as well - growing a big brain

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.920
is of course what allowed us to become human.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.510
And When it comes to human evolution, efficiency
is the name of the game.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.779
That is our bodies had to develop methods
for more efficient extraction and utilization

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:40.530
of energy, mainly to support our big energy
hungry brain.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:45.320
One tradeoff for a bigger brain was a smaller
gut- less energy spent on the gut meant more

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.120
for the brain.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.820
As is stated in a Public Library of Science
article titled "Man the Fat Hunter," to adjust

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.820
for the high metabolic cost of a large brain
“…shrinkage in gut size was a necessary

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.820
accompaniment.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.240
… A shorter human gut, had evolved to be
more dependent on nutrient and energy-dense

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.550
foods than other primates.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.890
A smaller gut is less efficient at extracting
sufficient energy and nutrition from fibrous

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:14.820
foods and considerably more dependent on higher-density,
higher bio-available foods that require less

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:20.750
energy for their digestion per unit of energy
/ nutrition released.”

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.940
This implicates fat as an important food source
because it is obviously very energy dense,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.029
providing 9 calories per gram.

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:32.280
But the efficiency of using fat for fuel is
deeper than just calories.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.550
Also, our brains’ power and capacity for
intellect comes not just from the increase

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:42.880
in size, but also from enhanced blood flow
and efficient use of oxygen.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.520
Roger Seymour of the University of Adelaide
and his team found that bloodflow to the brain

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.120
increased at an unexpectedly rapid pace over
a period of 3 million years.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.400
Seymour says: “While brain size was increasing
3.5 times, blood flow rate surprisingly increased

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.000
six hundred percent, from about 1.2ml per
second to 7ml per second.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.860
...This indicates that our brains are six
times as hungry for oxygen as those of our

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:15.560
ancestors, presumably because our cognitive
ability is greater and therefore more energy-intensive.”

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.730
This would suggest that the most important
fuel for the brain is going to be one that

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.920
uses oxygen more efficiently.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.480
And this is exactly what ketones do.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:32.550
Dr. Richard L Veech found in 1994 that administering
ketone bodies to a rat heart led to a 25%

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.490
increase in hydraulic work, but a decrease
in oxygen consumption.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:42.800
Theodore VanItallie explained this phenomenon
in a 2003 article by saying that the ketone

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.070
body beta hydroxybutyrate increases the efficiency
of energy production in the cell’s mitochondria.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.060
If you were schooled in the states and attended
even a day of biology class, you would know

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.570
that mitochondria are the “powerhouses of
the cell.”

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:01.720
But is this improvement in efficiency happening
in the powerhouses of the brain cells?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.370
Well, Vanitallie says that

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.680
“Studies of blood flow and oxygen consumption
in the brains of food-deprived obese human

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.060
subjects revealed values that were well below
the normal levels for adult human brains...

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.570
they suggest an increase in the metabolic
efficiency in human brains using ketoacids

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.560
as their principal energy source in place
of glucose.”

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.470
People who have done extended fasts will sometimes
report a euphoric or drastically enhanced

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:33.240
state of mental clarity around day 6 or 7
- this is when ketone bodies have reached

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.490
a particularly high concentration: somewhere
over 5 millimolars per liter depending on

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.520
the person.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.279
In essence ketone bodies may be a preferred
fuel source for the brain as they provide

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.380
more cellular energy per unit of oxygen compared
to glucose.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.270
Getting more bang for your oxygen through
ketosis would be incredibly significant for

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.900
the development and maintenance of big brains.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.670
Some of Dr. Dominic D’Agostino’s work
revolves around taking advantage of ketosis’s

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.330
efficient usage of oxygen in the cells.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.860
His research touches on ketosis’s potential
for treating a variety of illnesses including

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.770
Epilepsy, ALS, Alzheimer's , Parkinson's and
even some cancers.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.910
His initial research, funded by the Office
of Navy Research, was aimed at improving Navy

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.730
Seal Divers diving capabilities.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.050
The most straightforward display of ketones
efficient use of oxygen is that simply by

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:32.589
being in the state of ketosis, Dr. D’Agostino
was able to double his breath hold time from

00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:37.680
2 minutes to 4 minutes without any prior training.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.480
To sum all this up, when fasting long enough,
or when protein and carbohydrate intake are

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.350
restricted enough, our bodies switch over
to breaking down fat and making ketones - potentially

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.250
the most efficient fuel that can be used by
humans.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.930
The brain is a massive blood flow, oxygen
and energy hog that needs to constantly be

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.500
fueled - anything that could enhance energy
efficiency would be very important for the

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.990
survival of big brained humans.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.770
Despite the evidence that our bodies and brains
may actually prefer to run on ketones, ketosis

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:13.660
is still frequently misunderstood as a potentially
dangerous state.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:18.390
Going back to the thymus story, surely children’s
thymuses wouldn’t have been irradiated if

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.890
the anatomical data of healthy children had
been available at the time.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.730
And, maybe with ketones, the perception of
them would be totally different if the first

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:33.149
pieces of data didn’t come from a diabetic,
but say a healthy pregnant mother, or a healthy

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:33.559
newborn.
