00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.550
As the Emperor’s main enforcer, Darth Vader
quickly made himself well known across the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.590
galaxy as he spearheaded many of the Empire’s
military campaigns to claim and later maintain

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.550
its grip over the galaxy.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.550
While he sparked a deep fear in the Empire’s
enemies, that same fear also spread among

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.510
the Imperial ranks as officers were brought
up to speed with who Vader was and his true

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.290
authority when they were first introduced
to him by Palpatine.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.470
First in Canon, Darth Vader was officially
introduced to the officers of the Empire following

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.550
a few failed assassination attempts on the
Dark Lord.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.930
Initially, Vader just came out of nowhere
and was given command of Imperial units without

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.650
much clarification of who he was or his relation
to Palpatine.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.560
This caused some conflict among Imperials
that Vader worked with, with many of them

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.850
not taking him seriously at first as they
didn’t understand his true power.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.060
In reaction to the disrespect Vader faced
at first, he tended to kill the Imperials

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.240
out right.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.770
That made Palpatine unhappy, as he didn’t
want to rule an Empire of dead men.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.780
So he told Vader to knock it off and that
he couldn’t go around killing everyone who

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.209
made him angry.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.080
As such, the Imperials that worked alongside
Vader continued to view and treat him as if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.540
he were just some brute that wore a mobile
life support system.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.440
However, a few weeks later Vader discovered
that a few high ranking Imperial officers

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200
had staged a few assassination attempts on
him, likely revenge on him for how he treated

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.240
them earlier.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.501
He couldn’t conclude exactly who these men
were, but he knew they came from the high

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:10.750
command staff.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.700
So Vader came to Palpatine and explained what
he knew and that he believed it was necessary

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.860
to punish a few Imperials as an example to
the rest.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.840
Palpatine agreed, also viewing this as a great
opportunity to officially establish Vader’s

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.170
role in the Empire to his military.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.660
So Palpatine called up all the higher ups
of the various branches of the Imperial military

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.720
to formally introduce Vader.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.280
He explained to them that Vader spoke on behalf
of himself, that an order from him was to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.140
be treated as an order directly from himself.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.350
They were all to clearly pass this information
down to their men to eliminate any future

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.490
confusion.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.240
Once Palpatine finished, Vader then stepped
up and called up 5 random names, asking them

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.730
to approach forward.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.100
He explained how he survived 2 assassination
attempts and discovered they came from the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.270
higher command of the officer core.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.150
He didn’t know exactly who planned these
assassinations, but that didn’t matter to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.150
him.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.120
He would always survive, but they would not
if they continued with their actions.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.430
Vader then force choked the 5 unfortunate,
randomly selected officers as an example to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.870
the rest of the room.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.510
The room quickly was swept with fear as everyone
witnessed their fellow peers just get executed

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.500
with a power they didn’t understand.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.870
And for most of them it was enough to never
question Vader’s authority again.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.960
In Legends, Darth Vader was officially introduced
to the Empire a few days following the creation

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.400
of the New Order.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.030
Before the arrival of the two Sith, the officers
were all crowded into the audience chamber,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.000
casually making small talk with each other
as some talked about how they were given honorary

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960
awards for accomplishments they didn’t fully
deserve.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.970
A few mentioned their doubts on what really
happened to the traitor maked Jedi, and how

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.530
their accomplishments in the Clone Wars were
being erased and instead given to regular

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.530
generals.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.260
Upon the arrival of Palpatine and Vader, the
room went silent and stood at attention.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.590
When they first saw Palpatine, many gasped
in shock to see how deformed he was from the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.870
apparent attack the Jedi staged on him.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.870
Hoping to make it clear to everyone what had
happened to him, Palpatine decided to set

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.330
the story straight of how the Jedi tried to
assassinate him.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.670
But while he was giving his explanation, an
Imperial officer yelled out how he couldn’t

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.979
believe what he was hearing.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.600
In reaction to the officer’s outburst, Vader
angrily asked the man if he was suggesting

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.260
that the Emperor was lying.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.900
Palpatine then decided now would be an excellent
time to introduce everyone to his new enforcer,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.470
clarifying that Vader spoke on behalf of himself.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.130
Vader then demanded the officer to answer
his question again.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.509
The officer tried to suggest that a mistake
must of been made, as the Jedi he knew would

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.250
never have done the act the Emperor suggested.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.780
But before he could finish his case, the man
was lifted up and force choked by Vader in

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.229
front of everyone.

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.710
His lifeless body was then slammed into the
crowd, with Vader sarcastically asking if

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.400
anyone else had any more questions for the
Emperor.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.630
With the room remaining silent, Vader then
established the new rules of how absolute

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.460
loyalty was to be expected at all times.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.870
And that due to the current chaotic state
of the galaxy, that resignations were temporary

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.260
not allowed.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.990
Once everyone was dismissed to leave, some
officers began to have doubts about what they

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.150
had originally signed up for, as they realized
how little their lives meant to the Emperor.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.531
Others believed that once the galaxy was stabilized,
that they would be allowed to resign, but

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:28.700
in the meantime it was best to keep a low
profile and not show any signs of treachery.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.810
While others who held great ambitions were
ready to do whatever it took to climb the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.389
ranks of the empire and in a way impress the
unnaturally powerful being they just witnessed

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:50.090
that was Darth Vader.
