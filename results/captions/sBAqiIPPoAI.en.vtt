00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:03.460
You were supposed to be here last week and
at the last minute, that morning,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.940
you cancelled because you had fever and
you were sick.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.995
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You were gonna have healers come over.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:09.341
How'd that work out?

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:11.774
&gt;&gt; I have cupping marks on my butt.

00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:12.540
&gt;&gt; Did it work?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.682
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes, it did work.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:14.232
&gt;&gt; Cupping works?

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:14.807
&gt;&gt; They were really good.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:15.987
Cupping works.

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:16.608
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:20.641
&gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about you know,
I mean like, with the cups.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes, I feel a lot better but

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.970
it turns out if you work really
hard non-stop for 15 years and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.725
don't take a break,
it's not like good for your body.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:29.623
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:30.282
&gt;&gt; I didn't know.

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:30.870
&gt;&gt; Your body.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.600
&gt;&gt; I came here before I ever went
on the road ever 10 years ago.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.639
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; It was like is it gonna be good and

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:38.035
you're like mm-huh.

00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:40.044
And you're telling the truth, it's hard.

00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:40.699
&gt;&gt; It's hard.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:41.742
It's hard to be on the road,

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.793
because you're in a different
hotel room all the time.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:46.304
Which is why I said everyone
should start coming to me.

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:47.389
&gt;&gt; Just come to you.
&gt;&gt; And I got a show.

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:48.329
So they would come to me.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.928
&gt;&gt; This is great.

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:50.265
&gt;&gt; Because touring is harder.

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.518
&gt;&gt; She's smart, you're smart.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.080
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I'm stupid.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.500
&gt;&gt; That's nice.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.590
You bring everything to you, the seasons.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything, these are all gifts.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.300
These are all people
that are like sacrifices.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.842
That's a bowl of onions, I think.

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:05.259
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I don't know that that's good.

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so congratulations.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.368
You're in love, you're happy.

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:10.566
You have a boyfriend since I saw you last.

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.326
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:12.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.042
He's very lucky.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.104
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I think it was kind of because of my

00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:20.428
appearance on here last time.

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:23.277
He saw my outfit and he was like,
I wanna get involved in this.

00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:23.830
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.708
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.422
&gt;&gt; Did you have a outfit that was skimpy?

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:29.531
&gt;&gt; I was roller skating
in front of Hillary.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:30.914
&gt;&gt; It was that, that's right.

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:34.441
&gt;&gt; Obviously he was like hm.

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:35.107
Dating app?

00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:38.413
Yeah, we met and I think neither of
us were really looking for anything.

00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:40.493
But we really liked each other right away.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.620
And I liked him so much,
I was like I'm gonna make him wait.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.686
And I did.

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:48.032
All through dinner.

00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:50.893
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No, we didn't go to dinner.

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:55.030
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But he was awesome.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.200
We've been very honest with each other.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.670
I was like upfront I was
like look I'm realistic.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.158
I know for a fact that I
don't have any diseases left.

00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:05.973
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:08.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.922
&gt;&gt; You guys have never been tested,

00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:10.806
Ellen's audience?

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:13.909
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I know it's the holidays.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.209
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But we just had our year anniversary,

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.474
that's very cute.

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:20.010
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.430
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you, we need it.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.544
It's still early,
we're still, like, lying.

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:29.710
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Neither of us had ever been

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.832
to France because we're both trash.

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:32.332
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:36.097
&gt;&gt; And so, we were like, let's go.

00:02:36.097 --> 00:02:37.119
And so we go and

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:39.718
it was like we wanna be romantic.

00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:42.617
It's an intimidating city.
And then we had one of those hotel rooms

00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:46.373
where the bathroom, when you're in it and
someone goes like [COUGH],

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:49.560
you hear it loudly in the whole room.
You can hear everything.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.320
And we both got violent food poisoning.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.860
Violent.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.230
And so it hits him first.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.190
And he's in there just, blah, blah, blah.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.231
And then the way it
manifested itself in me.

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:11.464
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Is basically I was in there just like.

00:03:11.464 --> 00:03:13.522
How do I say this?

00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:18.717
Just kind of like [SOUND] machine gun.

00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:21.984
[SOUND] And I knew it was over.

00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:23.090
I'm yelling at him.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.780
It was so great dating you,
I wish you the best luck,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.445
you're gonna meet the greatest girl,
but I knew.

00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:31.842
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I knew it was over.

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:35.298
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.424
&gt;&gt; Who can make it through that?

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:41.108
And then I thought,
I'm just gonna be the one with that end.

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:45.009
And he's going back in there, he's put his
head where I was just [SOUND] and then-

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:46.790
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.560
&gt;&gt; Under a year, we're together.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.690
But then he hears me go!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.465
And I grab the trash, and
I had to, so all ends.

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:56.785
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I was like the fountain on Friends,

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:57.955
you know, basically.

00:03:57.955 --> 00:03:59.710
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And that is when I learned

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.044
not to ever throw up
in a wicker basket.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.945
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Happy holidays, guys.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.455
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's when you learned.

00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:11.074
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:11.074 --> 00:04:12.645
&gt;&gt; My God, my God.

00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:14.155
&gt;&gt; We're still together.
