00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.334 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Congratulations,
first of all, on the,

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.937 align:start size:94% position:6%
I will say on the stand-up
special, in general.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.405 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think it was the
fastest-selling

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.941 align:start size:94% position:6%
or highest-grossing special
in the U.K.,

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.443 size:81% position:41%
and then it was one of
the biggest purchases

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.711 align:start size:94% position:6%
on Netflix, ever.
-Yeah.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.513 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Honestly,
I've had a great time.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.249 align:start size:94% position:6%
I loved the tour.
It was my favorite tour ever.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.717 align:start size:94% position:6%
-It's your favorite tour?
-Yeah.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.486 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Why?
-So many reasons.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.122 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think -- I hadn't
done one for seven years.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.657 align:start size:94% position:6%
And that wasn't on purpose.
It's just getting pushed back.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.027 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, I did, like,
"Derek," a couple of movies,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it just --
'Cause I always considered

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.665 align:start size:94% position:6%
stand-up to be the second
or third thing I did,

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.267 align:start size:94% position:6%
whereas this
has changed my mind.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.101 line:92%
Now it's my favorite thing I do.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.871
Now I could lose everything else
and just do stand-up

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.973 align:start size:94% position:6%
for the rest of my --
Well, I won't be standing up

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.609 align:start size:94% position:6%
for long, but sit-down.
Just me in --

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
Even if I have to be
wheeled out in a bucket,

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.613 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'll just be saying --
No, actually,

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.115
I remembered the privilege of it
and, you know --

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.519 size:88% position:44%
Even if I get final edit
on a movie or a TV show,

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's still
60 people involved.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.689 align:start size:94% position:6%
With stand-up, it's just me.
I can say what I want.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.757 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah.
-It's amazing.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.859 align:start size:94% position:6%
And, also, I think
the audience have known me

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start size:94% position:6%
for long enough now,
they get me.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:02.729 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't have to
explain it so much.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start size:94% position:6%
I can go further, and I can
hit the ground running,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.566 line:92%
and they get what I'm doing.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.569
-Doesn't it make harder because
they do know who you are?

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.239 size:88% position:44%
-No. Well, only when you
sort of warm up, maybe.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.275 line:92%
Like, I do a warm-up show,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.444 size:81% position:41%
and people on YouTube
will get in the press.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.779 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I book theaters,
and I sort of do

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
a little theater show
just for me

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.083 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
to just rehearse.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.350
And I approached it differently,
as well.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.120 size:78% position:39%
My first four shows,
I sort of wrote them.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.822 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know,
I planned them and went out --

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.457 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Set up punch lines.
-Exactly.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start size:94% position:6%
And this one,
I just wandered out

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.694 align:start size:94% position:6%
and just did it
really organically.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.995 align:start size:94% position:6%
And that's the great thing
about stand-up --

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.731
the audience
chooses your best bits for you.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.400 line:92%
And I felt freer, as well.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.801 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Like, I felt I didn't --

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.104 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think I've got
old-people's rights now.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:48.808 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean, I can say what I want,
'cause I'm gonna die soon.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.344 size:88% position:44%
How can anyone hurt me?
They go, "I'm offended."

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.480 align:start size:94% position:6%
I go, "I'm gonna
[bleep] die soon."

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.981 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.182 align:start size:94% position:6%
-That's true.
-Yeah.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.652
-But every time you come on,
you always tell a great story.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.121 align:start size:94% position:6%
About your uncle
getting the toupee.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.489 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you remember that one?
-Oh, yeah.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.857 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's a true story.
That's in there.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.391 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I know, I saw it
in the special, as well.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.293 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah, my Uncle --
my Uncle Reginald.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.196 size:81% position:41%
I won't give it away,
but my Uncle Reginald,

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.498 size:88% position:44% line:92%
he went bald in his 20s.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:15.969
And he was bald for 10 years,
so they called him Bald Reg.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.904 align:start size:94% position:6%
So he was bald
to his 30s, right?

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:21.508
Turned up at our house one day,
ding dong, Elvis.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.442 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.477 align:start size:94% position:6%
Just...
And I said to my Aunt Edna,

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.547
"What happened to Uncle Reg?"
She went, "It was a miracle."

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.816 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
So, yeah.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.417 align:start size:94% position:6%
I loved --
It's much more personal.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.286 align:start size:94% position:6%
I talk about my family
for the first time.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.723
-I love that, too -- "Don't
show me photos of your kid."

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:37.490 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
-Oh, God, yeah.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.791 align:start size:94% position:6%
-"Don't show me
photos of your kid."

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.394 align:start size:94% position:6%
-That's a true --
Even though I don't have kids,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.296 size:81% position:41%
people still show me
photographs of theirs.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.197 line:92%
And it's very sweet, right?

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.298 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I haven't done it to you,
have I?

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.766 align:start size:94% position:6%
-No, you haven't,
but I don't mind it, really.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.202 align:start size:94% position:6%
But you could be really busy,
and someone would go,

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.803 size:75% position:38%
"Oh, I was just out,
taking my youngest.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.305 align:start size:94% position:6%
She's 7."
I go, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.607 align:start size:94% position:6%
Even strangers go,
"I've got a picture of her."

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.842 align:start size:94% position:6%
I want to say,
"Do you know what?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.977 align:start size:94% position:6%
Show me if she goes missing,"
right?

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:01.714 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
It's like -- No -- I --

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:05.051 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Audience groans, laughter ]
-What?

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.452 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I just --
I don't need --

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.321 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Why do I need to see it?

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.490 align:start size:94% position:6%
I know what a kid looks like.
-Yes.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.025 align:start size:94% position:6%
-"Oh, yeah, 7 years old,
it's a kid.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:12.892 line:92%
I know what it looks like."

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.527 align:start size:94% position:6%
Unless they say,
"No, no, this one."

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.764 align:start size:94% position:6%
If she's just a head with
tentacles, I'll have a look.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:18.665 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.401 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks for showing me that."

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.237 align:start size:94% position:6%
Yeah. But if it's just a kid,
yeah, I know.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.705 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah, I know.
-They all look alike.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.574 align:start size:94% position:6%
-But you also talk about
the length of time

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.042 align:start size:94% position:6%
you look at the photos.
-Yeah.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.744 align:start size:94% position:6%
You got to go through
the whole polite rigmarole.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:36.883 align:start size:94% position:6%
You've got to go,
"Oh. Oh, she's beautiful."

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.750 line:92%
It's got to be that long.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.587
'Cause too short, and it's like,
"Yeah," they know.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.455 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you know what I mean?
[ Laughter ]

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:46.492 line:92%
And too long, it's like, "Oh."

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.161 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.897 line:92%
-No, it's not like that, no.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.965 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Too long, see?
-Too long, yeah.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.467 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I need to go,
"Oh, she's [bleep] beautiful."

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.502 align:start size:94% position:6%
-No, I don't think it's that.
-It's just...

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.304 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's too much.
That's what I'm saying.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.173 line:92%
You've got to do it just right.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:02.909 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's a minefield.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.545 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Looking at a photo
is a minefield, yeah.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.281
Also, a runner through the thing
is you saying,

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.450
"I should've just left it."
-Well, that's about me --

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.518 align:start size:94% position:6%
Yeah, I talk about
arguments on Twitter.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
The worst people --
Twitter is amazing.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.422 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Why do you get in arguments
on Twitter?

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:20.326
-Well, because it's fun.
It's like research for me.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.327 size:75% position:38% line:92%
I love it, you know?

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.096 align:start size:94% position:6%
I actually
go looking for trolls,

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.530 line:92%
because I don't really get them.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.599
The good thing about Twitter is,
it's like looking

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.669 size:78% position:39%
at every toilet wall
in the world at once.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.205 align:start size:94% position:6%
So you can really
find proper crazies.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.340 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah, yeah.
-And I wind them up.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.111 align:start size:94% position:6%
Everything from just --
It's just mad fundamentalists

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.580 align:start size:94% position:6%
to just people
who live in a bin.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.215 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know what I mean?
[ Laughter ]

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:45.818 align:start size:94% position:6%
-And you do it.
-I just -- I wind them up.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.153 line:92%
-And you should've just left it.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.188 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah, and I get
into arguments with them.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.658 size:78% position:39%
The running thing is,
I should've left it.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.626 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Someone with 24 followers.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.528 align:start size:94% position:6%
-You're getting into
a major fight with them.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.497
-Well, I got into a fight
after doing this show.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.899 align:start size:94% position:6%
'Cause I didn't think about
being on the plane,

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.968 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they're saying,
"We're not handing out nuts

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.638
on this flight because this lady
is so allergic to nuts

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.508 align:start size:94% position:6%
that even someone else
eating nuts in the vicinity

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.143 align:start size:94% position:6%
would cause her
to have a fatal reaction."

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.679
And I talked about this
on this show that I was furious.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.816 align:start size:94% position:6%
Right? Like I was going --
"Oh, God.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.319
Just 'cause someone's gonna die,
I'm not allowed to eat nuts?"

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
And I do this --

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.254 size:88% position:44% line:92%
I did the whole routine.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.589
I was going, "I wish I'd brought
my own nuts on."

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.826 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I say it as a joke.
I said, "And now when I fly,

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.329 align:start size:94% position:6%
in case that happens again,
I have a shower,

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.365 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I just rub myself all over
in nuts," right?

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.666 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
And it went out,

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.601
and someone on Twitter
was going, "How dare you.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.337 align:start size:94% position:6%
My daughter's
got a nut allergy."

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
And she was -- and you and me
and causing trouble.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.809
She was going, "How disgusting,"
you know?

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.012 align:start size:94% position:6%
And someone else got involved.
Ohio moms are going nuts.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:50.917
One of you filmed a little girl
and put it on YouTube

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:54.420 size:84% position:42%
and sent me the link,
and it was just like --

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.521 line:92%
A sweet little girl, about 7.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
She went, "Dear Mr. Gervais,
I have a fatal nut --"

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:01.761 align:start size:94% position:6%
Delete, you know? No.
[ Laughter ]

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.132 size:84% position:42%
-Ricky, I want to show
a clip from "Humanity."

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:09.535 size:81% position:41%
This is Ricky Gervais'
new stand-up special,

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:13.439 align:start size:94% position:6%

Check this out.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.040 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
-A lovely welcome.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.242 size:88% position:44%
Just for that, I'm gonna
try my hardest tonight.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.877 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
I know what you're thinking.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:18.711 line:92%
You're thinking, "Rick, relax.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.681 align:start size:94% position:6%
We've already had our money's
worth just seeing you."

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.248 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.283 align:start size:94% position:6%
What?
"You're a legend, shut up."

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:28.187 align:start size:94% position:6%
Why is he --
I'm not a god.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:28.988 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:31.491 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm just an ordinary guy,
you know,

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.192 line:92%
going round talking to people.

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:37.463 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, sort of like Jesus.
[ Laughter ]

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.699 size:78% position:39% line:92%
In a way, but better.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.136 align:start size:94% position:6%
Well, I've actually
turned up, so...

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.505 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.740 line:92%
-Our thanks to Ricky Gervais!

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.644 align:start size:94% position:6%
