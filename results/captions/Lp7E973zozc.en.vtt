00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:14.653
Bigger welcome!
Hello, San Francisco!

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.705
TEDx – oh my God, blinding light!

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:20.741
Hi, everybody! How are you?

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:23.905
(Audience cheering) Fine?!
Oh my gosh! Okay, so...

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:27.872
My name is Mel Robbins,
and for the last seventeen years,

00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:33.991
I have done nothing but help people
get everything that they want.

00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:38.670
Within reason! My husband's here.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.073
So, I've done it in the courtroom,
in the boardroom, in the bedroom,

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:47.604
in people's living room,
whatever room you want to be in,

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:52.280
if I'm there, I will help you get whatever
you want by any means necessary.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.471
For the last three years –
I host a syndicated radio show.

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:59.198
Five days a week,
I go live in forty cities

00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:03.426
and I talk to men and women
across America who feel stuck.

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:09.105
Do you know that a third of Americans
feel dissatisfied with their lives right now?

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:15.906
That is a hundred million people!

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:18.601
That's insane!

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:21.683
And I've come face to face with it
in this new show that I'm doing,

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.435
which is also insane,
it's called "In-laws".

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:29.349
I move in with families across America –
(Laughter)

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.711
You guessed it!

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.350
– who are at war with their in-laws.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.076
We move them into the same house,
I verbally assassinate everybody,

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:42.949
we open up Pandora's box,

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:46.158
and I get people to stop arguing
about the donuts

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:47.989
and who is hosting
Thanksgiving dinner,

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:51.410
and talk about the real stuff.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.036
And that's what I want
to talk to you about.

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:56.439
I'm here for you.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.369
I'm going to tell you everything I know
in less than eighteen minutes

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.733
about how to get what you want.

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:05.070
So I want you to take
a millisecond right now

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.837
and think about what you want.

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:08.485
You!

00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:10.439
And I want you to be selfish.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.537
Screw Simon and the "We" thing.
This is about me, right now!

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:17.095
(Laughter) (Applause)
Sorry, Simon.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:21.008
What do you want?
And here's the deal.

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:24.760
I don't want it to sound good
to other people.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.761
Being healthy will not get your ass
on a treadmill.

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:32.122
Losing your manboobs,
so you can hook up with somebody,

00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:35.575
now that's motivation.
(Laughter)

00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:39.750
So, I want to know: What do you want?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.252
Do you want to lose weight?
Do you want to triple your income?

00:02:43.252 --> 00:02:47.071
Do you want to start a nonprofit?
Do you want to find love?

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:49.168
What is it? Get it, right here.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.737
You know what it is, don't analyze it
to death, just pick something.

00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:56.575
That's part of the problem.
You won't pick.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.438
So, we're going to be talking about
how you get what you want.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:07.642
And frankly, getting what you want
is simple.

00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:12.263
But notice I didn't say it was easy.

00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.565
It's very simple.

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:18.151
In fact, if you think about it,

00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:21.472
we live in the most amazing
moment in time.

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:25.324
So that thing that you have up here,
whatever it may be,

00:03:25.324 --> 00:03:28.746
you want to use healthy eating
to cure your diabetes,

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:32.606
you want to figure out
how to take care of the elders

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:34.556
and start a new hospice center,

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:38.138
you want to move to Africa
and build a school... Guess what?

00:03:38.138 --> 00:03:41.240
You can walk into a book store
– right now! –

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.928
and buy at least ten books
written by credentialed experts

00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:46.906
on how the hell you do it.

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:48.919
You could Google it.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.002
And you could probably find at least,
I don't know - a thousand blogs

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:57.165
documenting the step, by step,
by step transformation

00:03:57.165 --> 00:03:59.963
that somebody else is already doing.

00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:04.520
You can find anybody online
and cyber-stalk them!

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.003
(Laughter)

00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:10.353
You can just walk in their footsteps –
just use the science of drafting.

00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:14.267
Follow what everyone else has done,
because somebody is already doing it!

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:16.956
So why don't you have what you want,

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.645
when you have all the information
that you need,

00:04:19.645 --> 00:04:22.334
you have the contacts that you need,

00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:26.115
there are probably free tools online
that allow you to start a business,

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:30.944
or join a group, or do whatever
the heck you want!?

00:04:30.944 --> 00:04:33.696
It all comes down to one word:

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:37.129
F*©#.

00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:42.778
Shut the front door,
you know what I'm talking about?

00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:46.714
The f-bomb. It's everywhere!

00:04:46.714 --> 00:04:48.318
You hear it all the time!

00:04:48.318 --> 00:04:51.701
I honestly don't understand
what the appeal is of the word.

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.938
I mean, you don't sound smart
when you say it.

00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:59.636
And it's really not expressing
how you really feel.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.801
It's sort of a cheap shot to take.

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:09.633
And of course you know
I'm talking about the word "fine".

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:12.301
"How you doing?"
"Oh, I'm fine."

00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:14.442
Oh, really? You are?

00:05:14.442 --> 00:05:17.765
Dragging around those extra
forty pounds, you're fine?

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:20.888
Feeling like roommates with your spouse,
and you're fine?

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:23.852
You haven't had sex in four months,
you're fine?

00:05:23.852 --> 00:05:26.768
Really?!

00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:29.100
I don't think so!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.900
But see, here's the deal with saying
that you're fine: It's actually genius.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.496
Because if you're fine,
you don't have to do anything about it.

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:44.999
But when you think about this word "fine",
it just makes me so angry.

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.999
Here we are at a conference
about being alive

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:52.292
and you're going to describe
the experience of being alive as "fine"?!

00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:55.792
What a flimsy and feeble word!

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:57.466
If you're crappy, say you're crappy!

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:59.691
If you're amazing say you're amazing!

00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:01.423
Tell the truth!

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:04.717
And this not only goes
for the social construct:

00:06:04.717 --> 00:06:07.230
"Oh, I don't want to burden you
with the fact that I hate my life",

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.003
or: "Hey, I'm amazing! But that
would make you feel terrible."

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:12.600
The bigger issue –

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.111
The bigger issue with "fine"
is that you say it to yourself.

00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:20.665
That thing that you want,
I guarantee you,

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:25.578
you've convinced yourself
that you're fine not having it.

00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:28.957
That's why you're not pushing yourself.

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:31.446
It's the areas in your life
where you've given up.

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:32.845
Where you've said,

00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:35.009
"Oh, I'm fine.
My mom's never going to change,

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.208
so I just can't have that conversation."

00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:40.840
"I'm fine. We've got to wait until
the kids graduate, before we get divorced,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.735
so we'll just sleep in separate bedrooms."

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:46.696
"I'm fine. I lost my job,
I can barely pay my bills,

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:51.517
but whatever – It's hard to get a job."

00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:57.960
One of the reasons why this word also just
annoys me so much is,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.363
scientists have calculated –

00:07:01.363 --> 00:07:03.330
Oh yeah, I'm coming down!
(Laughter)

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.964
Scientists have calculated

00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:08.242
the odds

00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:09.988
of you

00:07:09.988 --> 00:07:12.808
being born.

00:07:12.808 --> 00:07:17.136
That's right. They've crunched
the numbers. I see you up there.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.962
They've crunched the numbers on you –

00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:22.320
Yeah, you guys standing up,
you want to sit down for this.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.261
They've crunched the numbers
on you being born.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:29.822
And they took into account
all of the wars,

00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:33.096
and the natural disasters,
and the dinosaurs,

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:35.654
and everything else.

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:41.559
And do you realize that the odds,
the odds of you,

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:43.645
yeah, right here,
put your computer away,

00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:47.093
stand up for me, Doug!
(Laughter)

00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:50.493
So the odds of Doug here,
turn around, say "hi" to everybody –

00:07:50.493 --> 00:07:54.771
the odds of Doug being born

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:57.292
at the moment in time he was born,

00:07:57.292 --> 00:08:03.328
to the parents you were born to,
with the DNA structure that you have,

00:08:03.328 --> 00:08:08.993
one in four hundred trillion!

00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:11.244
Isn't that amazing?
Doug: I'm so lucky!

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:15.460
Mel: Yes! You're not fine,
you're fantastic!

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.826
You have life-changing ideas for a reason,
and it's not to torture yourself.

00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:26.193
Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
(Applause)

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:30.328
Christine was right when she said
all of you could be on stage.

00:08:30.328 --> 00:08:33.370
Because all of you
–&nbsp;we're all in this category.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.463
One in four hundred trillion.

00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:41.743
All day long you have ideas
that could change your life,

00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:45.744
that could change the world,
that could change the way that you feel,

00:08:45.744 --> 00:08:49.077
and what do you do with them?
Nothing!

00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:51.984
(Grunts) Hopefully I won't moon you.
(Laughter)

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:57.180
You didn't pay for that.
(Laughter)

00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:03.092
And I want you to just think for a minute,
because we all have –

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:06.728
I love to use the analogy
"the inner snooze button" –

00:09:06.728 --> 00:09:09.078
you have these amazing ideas
that bubble up.

00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:10.898
You've been watching people all day

00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:15.395
and I guarantee you,
like ping pong balls – bam-bam-bam

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:19.851
and everytime you have an idea,
what do you do? – Hit the snooze!

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:22.920
What's the first decision
you made this morning?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.460
I bet it was to go back to bed.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.090
"Yeah, first decision today,
I'm one in four hundred trillion,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.620
I'm going to go back to sleep."

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.351
And I get it! Your bed is comfortable!
It's cosy, it's warm!

00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:40.794
If you're lucky, you've got somebody
that you love next to you,

00:09:40.794 --> 00:09:46.130
or in my case, I've got my husband
and my two kids and possibly the dog.

00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:52.865
And the reason why I'm bringing up
this first decision that you made today,

00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:57.771
and the inner snooze alarm,
is because

00:09:57.771 --> 00:10:02.677
in any area of your life
that you want to change,

00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:07.583
any – there's one fact
that you need to know.

00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:09.535
This one:

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.743
You are never going to feel like it.

00:10:16.743 --> 00:10:19.029
Ever.

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:22.495
No one's coming,
motivation isn't happening,

00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:24.961
you're never going to feel like it.

00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:27.929
Scientists call it activation energy.

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:30.487
That's what they call the force required

00:10:30.487 --> 00:10:32.658
to get you to change
from what you're doing

00:10:32.658 --> 00:10:34.829
on autopilot to do something new.

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:37.000
So try this test tomorrow.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.663
You think you're so fancy,
I know, you're attending TED.

00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:43.365
(Laughter)
Try this.

00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:48.769
Tomorrow morning, set your alarm
for thirty minutes earlier.

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:51.894
And then when it goes off,
take those sheets,

00:10:51.894 --> 00:10:56.734
throw them off, and stand up
and start your day.

00:10:56.734 --> 00:10:59.153
No snooze, no delay,

00:10:59.153 --> 00:11:03.806
no, "I'll just wait here for five seconds
because Mel's not standing here" –

00:11:03.852 --> 00:11:05.231
Do it.

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:10.564
And the reason why I want you to do it
is because you will come face to face

00:11:10.564 --> 00:11:14.642
with the physical,
and I mean physical force

00:11:14.642 --> 00:11:19.430
that's required to change your behavior.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.175
Do you think that somebody
who needs to lose weight

00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:25.306
ever feels like going on a diet?

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:27.344
Of course not!

00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:30.990
You think they ever feel like eating
boiled chicken and peas

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.636
instead of a croissant?

00:11:32.636 --> 00:11:35.284
I don't think so!

00:11:35.284 --> 00:11:37.778
The activation energy

00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:43.149
required to get your ass away
from your computer and out the front door,

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:46.228
to go on the walk, you said
that you were going to go on,

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:49.450
is the exact same amount of force
that it takes you

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.367
to push yourself out of a warm bed
and into a cold room.

00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:57.051
What's interesting about being an adult

00:11:57.051 --> 00:12:01.110
is that when you become eighteen,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:07.096
nobody tells you that it's now
going to be your job to parent yourself.

00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:09.704
And by "parent yourself",

00:12:09.704 --> 00:12:15.455
I mean it's your job to make yourself
do the crap you don't want to do,

00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:20.728
so you can be everything
that you're supposed to be.

00:12:20.728 --> 00:12:24.929
And you're so damn busy
waiting to feel like it.

00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:26.786
And you're never going to!

00:12:26.786 --> 00:12:30.062
My son never feels like getting off his DS.
That's my job!

00:12:30.062 --> 00:12:33.194
Get off the damn DS!

00:12:33.194 --> 00:12:35.663
Kendall, clean up the Barbies!

00:12:35.663 --> 00:12:39.930
If you're going to have a nude party
in my bathroom, at least clean it up!

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.901
(Laughter)

00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:48.466
God, chew with your mouth closed!
We're not a barn, for crying out loud!

00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:52.000
Alright, dinner is coming,
get out of the pantry.

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:57.273
As parents, and you were a kid,

00:12:57.273 --> 00:13:00.599
your parents make you do the things
you don't feel like doing.

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:03.717
Because you won't. Ever.

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:06.756
Not now, not then, not ever!

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:09.418
And even when you get good at something,

00:13:09.418 --> 00:13:11.975
you'll figure out something else
you don't want to do.

00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:15.862
And then you'll plateau out, get bored,
"I hate this job. Blah blah boring."

00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:19.337
But will you look for a new one?
No! You'll just bitch about that one.

00:13:19.337 --> 00:13:22.758
It's very, very simple
to get what you want.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.247
But it's not easy.

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:32.171
You have to force yourself.

00:13:32.867 --> 00:13:35.240
And I mean force.

00:13:36.263 --> 00:13:38.403
And the reason why
I use the word "force" –

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:42.683
when Roz was up here
and talking about the emotion tracking,

00:13:42.683 --> 00:13:45.785
and she had the picture
of two sides of the brain –

00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:49.134
I look at the brain the exact same way.

00:13:49.134 --> 00:13:52.401
Only I describe one side
of your brain as autopilot

00:13:52.401 --> 00:13:54.725
and the other side as emergency brake.

00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:58.937
That's the only two speeds you get:
autopilot, emergency brake.

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:02.796
And guess which one your brain
likes better: autopilot.

00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:05.730
You've had the experience where
you've driven to work and you get there

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.484
and you're like, "Oh my God,
I don't remember ever driving here."

00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:09.443
(Laughter)

00:14:09.443 --> 00:14:13.354
You weren't drunk!
That was your brain on autopilot.

00:14:13.354 --> 00:14:16.464
It was functioning just at this level.

00:14:16.464 --> 00:14:19.335
And the problem with your mind
is that anytime

00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:22.852
you do anything that's different
from your normal routine,

00:14:22.852 --> 00:14:26.189
guess what your brain does —
emergency brake!

00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:29.330
And it has that reaction for everything.
Everything!

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.975
You walk into the kitchen
and see

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:33.291
everybody's left their breakfast
dishes for you.

00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:36.232
And you think for the hundredth time,
"I'm going to kill them.

00:14:36.232 --> 00:14:39.998
In fact I'm gonna leave it here
and I'm going to make them do it."

00:14:39.998 --> 00:14:42.354
But that's not your normal routine, is it?

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.462
So your mind goes: emergency brake!

00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:46.012
And you go right into autopilot.

00:14:46.012 --> 00:14:48.753
"I'll just load it, and be pissed,
and then not have sex.

00:14:48.753 --> 00:14:53.776
That's what I'm going to do."
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:54.669 --> 00:14:56.868
So, when I say "force",

00:14:56.868 --> 00:15:01.971
anything that's a break from your routine
is going to require force.

00:15:02.018 --> 00:15:04.556
And if you think about your life,

00:15:04.556 --> 00:15:09.167
it's kind of funny because we are kids
and then we become adults,

00:15:09.167 --> 00:15:11.407
and we spend so much time
trying to push our life

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:13.647
into some sort of stable routine,

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:15.888
and then we grow bored of it!

00:15:15.888 --> 00:15:19.506
You wake up at the same time every day,
you have largely the same breakfast,

00:15:19.506 --> 00:15:22.470
you drive to work the same way,
show up at work, look busy,

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.845
avoid making calls,
update Facebook,

00:15:24.845 --> 00:15:27.220
you attend a meeting
and doodle the whole time,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.865
go back and update Facebook,
make plans for the evening,

00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:32.387
you look busy some more,
then drive home the same way,

00:15:32.387 --> 00:15:34.962
you eat largely the same dinner
or a variety of it,

00:15:34.962 --> 00:15:36.873
you watch the same kind of media,

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:39.642
and then you go to bed,
and do the same thing all over again!

00:15:39.642 --> 00:15:41.909
No wonder you're bored out
of your mind!

00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:44.659
It's the routine that's killing you.

00:15:44.659 --> 00:15:48.075
I have this theory about
why people get stuck in life.

00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:51.893
So, most of you've probably taken
your Basic Psych 101 class,

00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:56.515
and you've bumped into
Abraham Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs"?

00:15:56.515 --> 00:16:01.893
Well, your body is kinda cool.
Because you have these basic needs.

00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:06.660
And your body is wired
to send you signals.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.974
If you need food, what do you feel?

00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:14.187
If you need water, what do you feel?

00:16:14.187 --> 00:16:18.841
If you need sex, what do you feel?
(Laughter) Thank you.

00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:24.527
I think when you feel stuck
or dissatisfied in your life,

00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:26.959
it's a signal.

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:30.293
And it's not a signal
that your life is broken.

00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:35.104
It's a signal that one of your most
basic needs are not being met.

00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:37.611
Your need for exploration.

00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:41.270
Everything about your life,
about your body, grows!

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.941
Your cells regenerate,
your hair, your nails,

00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:47.236
everything grows for your entire life.

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:51.060
And your soul needs exploration
and growth.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.678
And the only way you'll get it is
by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.

00:16:57.694 --> 00:17:01.356
Forcing yourself to get outside,

00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:04.734
out of your head.
Thank you.

00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:07.040
If you're in your head,
you're behind enemy lines.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.670
That is not God talking, okay?
It's not!

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.496
In fact, if I put a speaker on it
and we broadcast what you say to yourself,

00:17:14.496 --> 00:17:18.322
we would institutionalize you.
(Laughter)

00:17:18.322 --> 00:17:20.699
You would not hang out with people
that talk to you

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:22.815
the way you talk to yourself.

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:25.455
So get out of your head!

00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:29.566
Your feelings!
Your feelings are screwing you!

00:17:29.566 --> 00:17:33.983
I don't care how you feel!
I care about what you want!

00:17:33.983 --> 00:17:36.827
And if you listen to how you feel,

00:17:36.827 --> 00:17:40.779
when it comes to what you want –
you will not get it.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:44.159
Because you will never feel like it.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.443
And you need to get outside
your comfort zone.

00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:49.694
It's not about taking risks,

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:53.272
it's about getting outside
your comfort zone.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:58.447
Those first three seconds when
you push yourself out of bed, they blow.

00:17:58.815 --> 00:18:02.315
But once you're up, it's great.

00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:06.816
Those first three seconds when
you're sitting here in a stadium like this

00:18:06.816 --> 00:18:09.307
and somebody says,
"Get up and come dance,"

00:18:09.307 --> 00:18:11.798
and you think,
"Oh, I should do that,"

00:18:11.798 --> 00:18:14.290
and then you're like, "Uhmm."

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.286
That experience that you had
when you had the impulse to do it

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:23.776
and then you didn't do
the activation energy

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:26.279
required to force yourself,

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.613
your emergency brake got pulled –
"I'm sitting right here.

00:18:29.613 --> 00:18:33.682
I'm not going up with those
crazy people, I don't like to dance..."

00:18:34.422 --> 00:18:37.385
What happened for me is
I came up, and I bumped into Rachel,

00:18:37.385 --> 00:18:41.441
and then we started talking,
and next thing you know, she's tweeting.

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:45.993
And we're friends.
And – boom! Get outside.

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:47.832
That's where the magic is.

00:18:47.832 --> 00:18:53.504
That's where the one
in four hundred trillion exists.

00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:58.277
So everything I do –
oh, OK, this is the last part. Sorry.

00:18:58.277 --> 00:19:02.259
So one more thing that you can use,
I call it the five-second-rule.

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:07.578
Your mind can process a facial expression
in 33 milliseconds.

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.197
It can move pretty damn quick.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.262
The other thing that it does very quickly

00:19:16.262 --> 00:19:21.246
is if you have one of those little
impulses that are pulling you,

00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:25.490
if you don't marry it with an action
within five seconds,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.948
you pull the emergency brake
and kill the idea.

00:19:27.948 --> 00:19:29.622
Kill it!

00:19:29.622 --> 00:19:33.894
If you have the impulse to get up
and come dance while the band is playing,

00:19:33.894 --> 00:19:35.817
if you don't stand up in five seconds,

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:38.766
you're going to pull
the emergency brake.

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:41.130
If you have an impulse about,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.574
you were inspired by somebody's
speech today,

00:19:43.574 --> 00:19:46.105
and you don't do something
within five seconds

00:19:46.105 --> 00:19:49.043
–&nbsp;write a note, send yourself a text –

00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:52.189
anything physical to marry it
with the idea,

00:19:52.189 --> 00:19:56.873
you will pull the emergency brake
and kill the idea.

00:19:56.873 --> 00:20:00.796
Your problem isn't ideas.
Your problem is you don't act on them.

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:05.712
You kill them. It's not my fault.
It's not anybody's fault.

00:20:06.028 --> 00:20:09.857
You're doing it to yourself.
Stop it!

00:20:10.337 --> 00:20:14.746
I'm counting on you.
One in four hundred trillion.

00:20:15.596 --> 00:20:17.633
You got stuff to do!

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:20.627
And it's not going to happen
in your head.

00:20:20.627 --> 00:20:23.295
So I want you
to practice this today.

00:20:24.132 --> 00:20:26.534
When we go off to party,
thank God it's coming soon,

00:20:26.534 --> 00:20:29.956
because I think
we all could use a cocktail,

00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:33.653
I want you to practice
the five-second-rule.

00:20:33.653 --> 00:20:36.105
You see somebody and you think
you have an impulse,

00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:39.747
they look interesting?
Walk over there!

00:20:39.747 --> 00:20:42.365
You were inspired by somebody
and you have a request?

00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:44.119
Make it!

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:47.325
That's why you're here!

00:20:48.285 --> 00:20:52.009
Experiment with it, and I think
you'll be shocked about what happens.

00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:56.368
And one more thing, I want you to know
that everything that I do,

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.627
whether it's the radio show,
or the television show,

00:20:58.627 --> 00:21:01.342
or the book that I wrote,
or the column,

00:21:01.342 --> 00:21:03.220
it's for you.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.367
And if there is anything that I can do,

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:12.865
if I can do anything to make you do
the things you don't want to do,

00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:16.731
so you can have what you want,
I will do it.

00:21:16.731 --> 00:21:20.541
But you need to walk over,
you need to open your mouth,

00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:22.763
and you need to make the request.

00:21:22.763 --> 00:21:26.494
You got it? Good.
Go do it.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.564
(Applause)

00:21:32.262 --> 00:21:35.606
Thank you! Thank you, yes!
Stand up!

00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:38.526
You have the impulse, stand up!
Thank you!
