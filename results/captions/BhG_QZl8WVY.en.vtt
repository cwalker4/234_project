00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.029
You don’t have to be much of a science enthusiast
to have heard that you can’t go faster than

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.029
light.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.960
Well, I’m going to tell you at least one
way that two real, honest-to-god objects,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.000
that exist in our universe, can move away
from one another faster than the speed of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
light.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.660
Now, don’t get super excited.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.370
I’m talking about ways this can happen without
breaking the laws of physics.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.070
To be ultra clear, I’m not talking about
something that will lead to this.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.100
Or this.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.310
Or this.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.530
We're gonna have to go right to- ludicrous
speed!

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.579
Ludicrous speed?

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.300
Sir, we've never gone that fast before!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.420
I mean, I totally want to know how to go ludicrous
speed.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.280
But, unfortunately, and I hate to have to
tell you- these are all fiction.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.790
So, if it’s possible to go faster than light,
what exactly do I mean by the speed of light?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.180
I mean the speed of light in a vacuum in a
location where spacetime is not bent or changing.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.071
Under those conditions, the speed of light
is about 186,000 miles per second or, for

00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:40.430
the metric crowd, precisely 299,792.458 kilometers
per second, or fast enough to circle the globe

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.720
7.5 times in a single second.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.369
Light is like really, really, fast.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.450
When physicists use the symbol “c” to
denote the speed of light, it’s this speed

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.040
that they’re talking about.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.470
So, how can you go faster than light?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.770
I can think of three examples, although they
all aren’t quite what you probably think.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.030
The first is cheating.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.010
When light enters a transparent medium like
water or glass or something, it slows down.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.810
In glass, light travels at about two thirds
the speed it does in a vacuum.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.459
In water, it’s about three quarters.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.879
You can see the effect of this change in velocity
by simply sticking a pencil in a glass of

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.879
water.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.109
The pencil doesn’t really bend, but appears
to because of this effect.

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.459
While light slows down in a transparent medium,
other particles do not.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.139
That means that if you shoot an electrically
charged particle like an electron or a muon

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.699
traveling at near the speed of light at that
same medium, the charged particle travels

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.749
faster than light in the medium.

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.120
Cool, huh?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.500
When this happens, the charged particle emits
blue light like you see here.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.340
This light is called Cherenkov light after
its discoverer, Pavel Cherenkov.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.379
Explaining just how Cherenkov light is formed
is, well, tricky- and maybe I’ll make a

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.959
video about it.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.909
But the blue light you see here proves that
it is possible for objects to move faster

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.589
than light in a transparent medium.

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.819
In this example, the light is formed when
radioactive material emitting highly energetic

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.930
particles is immersed in water.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.199
It’s all way cool.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.139
So that’s maybe a cheat.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.690
Particles move faster than light, but it’s
not because particles got faster, but because

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.909
light got slower.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.870
Are there other examples?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.650
Well there is another instance of information
traveling faster than light which I’ll mention

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.819
only briefly and this involves a topic called
quantum entanglement.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.059
Quantum entanglement is a category of quantum
mechanics, which is known for its bizarre

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.729
predictions- cats both alive and dead and
all that.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.279
It is not possible to explain it in detail
here.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.049
That would actually require not just one video,
but an entire series, but here I can give

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.189
the highlights.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.909
In quantum mechanics, probability rules.

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:16.639
Anything that is possible can happen, governed
by the probabilities of that particular situation.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.479
As an example, a subatomic particle can have
a spin of plus or minus.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.080
You can’t know which of those spins it has,
until you actually measure it.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.699
It’s important to understand that this isn’t
a simple case of ignorance.

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.759
It’s not that the spin is plus or minus
and you just don’t know.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:43.540
It’s both plus and minus and it becomes
plus or minus when you measure it.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.990
Now suppose you take two particles and set
them up so that they have opposite spins.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.050
If one is plus, the other is minus, and vice
versa.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.800
When physicists do this, they say that we've
entangled the two particles.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.860
You can’t know in advance which particle
is plus and which is minus.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.150
You then separate the two particles by a large
distance and look at one of them.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.960
Say you find that it's a plus spin.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.070
If you look at the other particle, you’ll
find it's a minus spin- every single time.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.320
And this will be true even if you look at
the second particle so quickly that you see

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.960
it before a signal arrives from the first
particle traveling at the speed of light.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.340
Einstein called this a “spooky action at
a distance” and it says that the information

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.819
in quantum mechanics can travel faster than
light.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.409
Nobody understands this, but it’s well established
and it's just a true effect.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.280
So that’s a case of something traveling
faster than light, but you can’t use it

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.750
to send a message and it’s still not the
same as an object moving faster than light

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.860
like the Starship Enterprise or the Millennium
Falcon.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.719
So let’s talk about a third situation where
things actually can travel faster than light.

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.699
And that’s the expansion of the universe.

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.620
Now I should be cautious.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.440
When you hear people saying “the universe
expands faster than light,” it’s obviously

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.340
a statement that requires some care, because
your first question should be “what does

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.599
that mean?”

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:22.400
Well, obviously the universe can’t mean
our planet, our solar system, or even our

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.410
galaxy.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.659
After all, none of them are expanding much,
if at all- and certainly not at the speed

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:28.740
of light.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.599
In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble
combined measurements taken by several people

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.789
and found that distant galaxies are moving
away from Earth and, the further away they

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.819
are, the faster they're moving.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.699
This is now understood to be evidence that
the universe is expanding.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:55.800
Using modern numbers, a galaxy a megaparsec
away is moving away from us at 70 kilometers

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.120
per second.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.319
A megaparsec is million parsecs, which is
3.26 million lightyears by the way, but astronomers

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.169
use megaparsecs, so I will too.

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:13.629
If a galaxy a megaparsec away is moving away
at 70 kilometers per second, a galaxy two

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.820
megaparsecs away is moving away at 140 kilometers
per second.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.840
Three megaparsecs means 210 kilometers per
second, and so on.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.400
So we know that the speed of light is 300,000
kilometers per second, so we can figure out

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.520
how far away we have to go to have a galaxy
moving away from us at the speed of light.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:45.509
That turns out to be 4,296 megaparsecs or
just shy of 14 billion lightyears.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:51.500
This means that the surface of a sphere, centered
on the Earth, and with a radius of about 14

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.000
billion lightyears is moving away from us
at the speed of light.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.520
It also means that bigger spheres are moving
away from us at faster than light.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.069
A sphere with a radius 28 billion lightyears
across is expanding at twice the speed of

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.069
light.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.409
So, what does this mean?

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:14.039
Does it mean that there are galaxies moving
away from us at speeds faster than light?

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.039
Yeah.

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.120
Yeah, it does.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.099
Of course, it also means that we can never
see them.

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:26.460
If objects move away from us faster than light,
then that means that light emitted by them

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.139
never get to our eyes.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:33.810
So, we can never see the light emitted by
anything currently further away than 14 billion

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.380
lightyears.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.530
The true number is a little different because
of details of how the expansion speed has

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.220
changed over time.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.779
To get the number right means we have to take
a more nuanced approach than I’m doing here,

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:49.190
but those details don’t change the big message.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:55.600
It’s also incredibly important to be super
careful about how we envision it.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.510
The reason is that it’s not precisely accurate
to say that these galaxies are moving away

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.440
from us faster than light.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:08.470
Yes, the distance between us is increasing,
but it’s because space is expanding, not

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.600
because the galaxy is moving away in space.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.380
It’s kind of like putting a rubber duck
in a river.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.010
The duck isn’t moving as far as the water
is concerned.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.240
It’s the water that’s carrying the duck
away.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.440
Or like drawing dots on a balloon that’s
inflating.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.440
The dots don’t move on the surface of the
balloon, but the distance between them is

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.130
increasing because the balloon is stretching.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.740
So it’s entirely fair to say that there
exist galaxies that move away from us faster

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.860
than light, but only in the sense that the
expansion of space makes it happen.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.500
Those galaxies are stationary, or at least
nearly stationary with respect to their own

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.500
space.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.730
They’re not moving through space.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.930
I’ve described three examples of the phenomenon,
but none of them are something that those

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.510
of us who hope to explore the cosmos would
like to see.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.720
According to our best understanding of the
laws of physics, light obeys the ultimate

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.910
speed limit.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.320
Now, our understanding of the rules that govern
the universe are constantly improving and

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.480
it’s okay to hope that we’ll discover
some new principle that makes it possible

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.550
to go faster than light.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.680
Although unlikely, it may be that we will
eventually find some new phenomenon that changes

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.509
our prospects for exploring the galaxy, and
then, and only then, we will have finally

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:30.540
figured out a way to go-

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.220
LUDICROUS SPEED!

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.940
People say that it’s impossible to go faster
than light, and, as a practical matter, it’s

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.940
probably true.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.110
But we’ve learned in this video about a
few ways in which we can at least kind of

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.690
break that rule.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.530
So now you have some tidbits to use at your
next cocktail party.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.830
You’re welcome.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.380
If you like what you’ve seen, remember to
be sure to like, share and comment.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.700
We want to know what you think.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.020
And, as always, remember- physics is everything.
