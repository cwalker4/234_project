00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.120
WARREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.460
Mr. Stumpf, the Wells Fargo Vision and Values
Statement -- which you frequently cite -- says:

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.539
"We believe in values lived not phrases memorized.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.210
If you want to find out how strong a company's
ethics are, don't listen to what

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.990
its people say, watch what they do."

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.190
So let's do that.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:31.339
Since this massive years-long scam came to
light, you have said repeatedly, "I am accountable."

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.920
But what have you actually done to hold yourself
accountable?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.539
Have you resigned as CEO or Chairman of Wells
Fargo?

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.260
STUMPF: The board, I serve at the...

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.399
WARREN: Have you resigned?

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.539
STUMPF: No I've not.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:43.539
WARREN: All right.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.160
Have you returned one nickel of the millions
of dollars that you were paid while this scam

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.160
was going on?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.429
STUMPF: Well first of all this was by 1 percent
of our people...

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.429
WARREN: That's not my question...

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.429
STUMPF: And, and...

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.129
WARREN: My question, it's about responsibility.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.110
Have you returned one nickel of the millions
of dollars that you were paid while this scam

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.110
was going on?

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.632
STUMPF: The board will take care of that.

00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:09.632
WARREN: Have you returned one nickel of the
money you earned while this scam was going on?

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.810
STUMPF: And the board will do...

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.710
WARREN: I will take that as a no then.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.550
Have you fired a single senior executive?

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.510
And by that I don't mean a regional manager
or branch manager.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.670
I'm asking about the people who actually led
your community banking division

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.680
or your compliance division?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.570
STUMPF: We've made a change in our regional,
to lead our regional bank....

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.150
WARREN: I just said, I'm not asking about
regional managers, I'm not asking about branch

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.110
managers, I'm asking if you have fired senior
management.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.180
The people you actually led community banking
division, who oversaw this fraud, or the compliance

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.880
division that was in charge of making sure
that the bank complied with the law?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
STUMPF: Carrie Tolstedt...

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.060
WARREN: Did you fire any of those people?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.060
STUMPF: No.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.060
WARREN: No.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.060
OK.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.060
So you haven't resigned.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.210
You haven't returned a single nickel of your
personal earnings.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.760
You haven't fired a single senior executive.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.490
Instead evidently your definition of accountable
is to push the blame to your low-level employees

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.260
who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm
to defend themselves.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.540
It's gutless leadership.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.849
In your time as Chairman and CEO, Wells has
been famous for cross-selling -- which is pushing

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.260
existing customers to open more accounts.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.920
Cross-selling is one of the main reasons that
Wells has become the most valuable bank in the world.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.159
Wells measures cross-selling by the number
of different accounts a customer has with Wells.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.579
Other big banks average fewer than three accounts
per customer.

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.769
But you set the target at eight accounts.

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.810
Every customer of Wells should have eight
accounts with the bank.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.230
And that's not because you ran the numbers
and found that the average customer needed

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.409
eight banking accounts.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.579
It is because "8 rhymes with great."

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.940
This was your rationale right there in your
2010 Annual Report.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.329
Cross-selling isn't about helping customers
get what they need.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.219
If it was, you wouldn't have to squeeze your
employees so hard to make it happen.

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:20.739
No, cross-selling is all about pumping up
Wells' stock price isn't it?

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.739
STUMPF: No.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.580
Cross-selling is shorthand for deepening relationships.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.680
We -- what we do well...

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.099
WARREN: Whoa, let me stop you right there.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.099
You say no?

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.099
No?

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.099
STUMPF: I -- I...

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.680
WARREN: Here are the transcripts of 12 quarterly
earnings calls that you participated in from

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.510
2012 to 2014, the 3 full years in which we
know this scam was going on.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.950
I'd like to submit them for the record, if
I may, Mr. Chair.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.069
Thank you.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.640
These are calls where you personally, made
your pitch to investors and analysts about

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.090
why Wells Fargo is a great investment.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.950
And in all 12 of these calls, you personally
cited Wells Fargo's success at cross-selling

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.859
retail accounts as one of the main reasons
to buy more stock in the company.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.340
Let me read you a few quotes that you had.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:27.260
April 2012, quote, "We grew our retail banking
cross-sell ratio to a record, 5.98 products

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.600
per household."

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:38.180
A year later, April 2013, quote, "We achieved
record retail banking cross-sell of 6.1 products

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.560
per household."

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:49.880
April 2014, quote, "We achieved record retail
banking cross-sell of 6.17 products per household."

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120
The ratio kept going up and up.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.440
And it didn't matter whether customers used
those accounts or not.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.780
And guess what?

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.520
Wall Street loved it.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.100
Here, is just a sample of the reports from
top analysts in those years, all recommending

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.690
that people buy Wells Fargo stock in part
because of the strong cross-sell numbers.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.530
And I'd like to submit them for the record.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.530
SHELBY: Without objections.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.750
WARREN: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.500
So when investors saw good cross-sell numbers
-- they did, while this scam was going on

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.200
-- that was very good for you personally,
wasn't it, Mr. Stumpf?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.900
Do you know how much money, how much value
your stock holdings in Wells Fargo gained

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.490
while they scam was under way?

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.650
STUMPF: Well, first of all, it was not a scam.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.300
And cross-sell is a way of deepening relationships.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.300
When customers...

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.300
(CROSSTALK)

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.300
WARREN: We've been through this, Mr. Stumpf.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.300
I asked you a very simple question.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.870
Do you know how much the value of your stock
went up while this scam was going on?

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.661
STUMPF: It's all of my compensation is in
our public stock...

00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.661
(CROSSTALK)

00:05:56.661 --> 00:05:57.661
WARREN: Do you know how much it was?

00:05:57.661 --> 00:05:58.870
STUMPF: It's all in the public filing.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.980
WARREN: You're right, it is all in the public
records because I looked it up.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:11.820
While this scam was going on, you personally
held an average of 6.75 million shares of

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.370
Wells Stock.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.820
The share price during this time period went
up by about $30 which comes out to more than

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.800
$200 million in gains all for you personally.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.040
And thanks, in part, to those cross-sell numbers
that you talked about on every one of those calls.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.770
You know, here's what really gets me about
this, Mr. Stumpf.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.350
If one of your tellers took a handful of $20
bills out of the crash drawer, they'd probably

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.980
be looking at criminal charges for theft.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.830
They could end up in prison.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.790
But you squeezed your employees to the breaking
point so they would cheat customers and you

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.890
could drive up the value of your stock and
put hundreds of millions of dollars in your

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.360
own pocket.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.440
And when it all blew up, you kept your job,
you kept your multimillion dollar bonuses

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.880
and you went on television to blame thousands
of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.850
to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.780
This is about accountability.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.210
You should resign.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.290
You should give back the money that you took
while this scam was going on and you should

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.940
be criminally investigated by both the Department
of Justice

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.920
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.350
This just isn't right.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:46.920
A cashier who steals a handful of $20s is
held accountable, but Wall Street executives

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:54.860
who almost never hold themselves accountable,
not now and not in 2008 when they crushed

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.970
the worldwide economy.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.830
The only way that Wall Street will change,
is if executives face jail time when they

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.730
preside over massive frauds.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.580
We need tough, new laws to hold corporate
executives personally accountable and we need

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.060
tough prosecutors who have the courage to
go after people at the top.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.180
Until then, it will be business as usual.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.490
And at giant banks like Wells Fargo, that
seems to be cheating as many customers, investors

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.510
and employees as they possibly can.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.510
Thank You, Mr. Chair.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.620
Mr. Stumpf, as you know, some of my colleagues
and I sent you a letter last week about the

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.540
board's plans to claw back compensation from
senior executives who are responsible for

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.899
overseeing this scam.

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:46.249
Wells Fargo provided us with a response yesterday,
I noticed that although we sent the letter

00:08:46.249 --> 00:08:52.390
to you, that the response actually came from
somebody else in the company, which I guess

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.459
is another example of holding yourself accountable.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:04.060
I wanna focus now, on the mysterious circumstances
surrounding Carrie Tolstedt's retirement in July.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.080
As you know, Ms. Tolstedt ran the community
banking division, the division where this

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:12.720
scam occurred for the entire time that this
scam took place.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.730
She was in charge of all the 5,300 employees
who were fired and she oversaw the creation

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.759
of 2 million fake accounts.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:26.670
Now, in July of this year just two months
before the settlement was announced and before

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:32.709
those facts became public, Ms. Tolstedt retired
at age 56.

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:38.089
You indicated in the letter, responding to
our letter, that she walks away with over

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:42.240
$90 million in stocks, stock options and awards.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.720
Fortune Magazine says it's actually about
$125 million.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.959
But -- and here's the key part -- according
to Fortune, if Ms. Tolstedt has been fired

00:09:53.959 --> 00:10:02.680
instead of retiring, she would've had to
forfeit as much as $45 million of that award.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.290
Mr. Stumpf, the response to our letter confirms
that knew of this scandal.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.420
Before Ms. Tolstedt retired, it said -- and
this is from your letter, quote, "Senior management

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:21.709
and the board were aware of the pending litigation,
investigation and discussions with our regulators,

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:27.670
relating to sales practices when Ms. Tolstedt
indicated her decision to retire."

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.649
Is that accurate, Mr. Stumpf, what this letter
says?

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:36.470
Were you personally aware of the massive problem
that occurred under Ms. Tolstedt's watch in

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.649
July when she announced her retirement?

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:43.779
STUMPF: I was aware that we were involved
in discussions with the city attorney, the

00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:45.649
OCC and the CFPB, yes.

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:48.870
WARREN: So you had some indication there was
a massive problem?

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.009
STUMPF: We had some indication that we had
one percent of our people who were doing the

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:54.009
wrong thing.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:55.009
(CROSSTALK)

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.009
WARREN: Also known as a massive problem.

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:57.009
STUMPF: Well...

00:10:57.009 --> 00:11:02.269
WARREN: If you knew this, did you consider
firing Ms. Tolstedt before she retired?

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:07.199
STUMPF: Well, at the time she was reporting
to our president and chief operating officer

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:08.199
and...

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:09.199
(CROSSTALK)

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:11.600
WARREN: It's a simple question, you knew there
was a problem, did you consider firing her?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.129
STUMPF: No because of her full...

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:14.129
WARREN: Seriously?

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:20.129
You found out that one of your divisions had
created 2 million fake accounts, had fired

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:26.600
thousands of employees for improper behavior
and had cheated thousands of your own customers

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.279
and you didn't even once consider firing her
ahead of her retirement?

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:37.660
STUMPF: In fact, when I look at her full body
of work and I look at the -- at the customer

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.269
loyalty improvement and the customer service
improvement...

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:41.269
(CROSSTALK)

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:42.269
WARREN: Are you sure that those were not fake?

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:46.740
STUMPF: All the work that was done, she chose
to retire and I'd also like to make one other

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.769
comment because you made...

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:48.769
(CROSSTALK)

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:52.999
WARREN: So -- so you -- no just on this, you
never considered firing her.

00:11:52.999 --> 00:12:00.540
So now Ms. Tolstedt has apparently retired
but is also staying with the firm through

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.680
the end of the year.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.490
And in the response to our letter, you state
-- or the person writing it -- states, quote,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:17.680
"Ms. Tolstedt is eligible to be considered
for a 2016 annual incentive award."

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.329
An incentive award for doing a great job in
2016?

00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:25.680
Mr. Stumpf, that is unbelievable.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.759
You are the chairman of the board and the
CEO.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:35.470
In those roles, do you think it would be appropriate
for Ms. Tolstedt to get another bonus on top

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:41.860
of the millions that she has already gotten
as a reward for her role in this massive scam?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.850
STUMPF: The board will consider that and I
don't wanna prejudice the board but I also

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.850
want to make one comment...

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.850
(CROSSTALK)

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.089
WARREN: I don't understand that answer.

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:53.089
WARREN: You know, you and your board have
already made changes.

00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:57.810
You've made changes to the compensation scheme
for thousands of employees.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.980
You've sat here today and talked about that.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.689
You've removed sales quotas, I think you've
told us.

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:05.720
You've reformed incentives.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:12.850
Why can that be done quick as a wink across
the entire bank but a question about cutting

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:21.059
compensation for a highly placed executive
who oversaw a massive fraud takes long deliberation?

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:22.459
Why is that?

00:13:22.459 --> 00:13:26.660
STUMPF: Because there's a board governance
process and we want that to work properly.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.339
And whether Carrie was retired or she was
fired there'd be no difference with respect

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:33.800
to how the board can deal with that.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.920
WARREN: I'm sorry if she was fired, it is
my understanding she would not be entitled

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.139
to large parts of her compensation.

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:46.259
This is not just a claw back issue we're talking
about she doesn't get them to begin with if

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:47.259
she gets fired.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:50.009
But you let her walk out of the door with
a retirement.

00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:51.860
I don't quite understand.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.119
How do you explain this to your own shareholders?

00:13:56.119 --> 00:14:01.589
STUMPF: There is a process that the board
goes through and they will do that.

00:14:01.589 --> 00:14:02.649
They've already met...

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:03.649
WARREN: Mr. Stumpf...

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:04.740
STUMPF: ... and everyone give that their...

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.740
WARREN: I don't understand.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.379
You keep saying there's, you know, the board,
the board, as if these are strangers that

00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:11.980
you met in a dark alley.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.999
Under the bylaws of Wells Fargo and I'm quoting
here: "The Chairman shall preside at all meetings

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:18.999
of the board."

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:19.999
STUMPF: (inaudible)

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:21.119
WARREN: You were able to make changes.

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:23.439
Why can you not make a change here?

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:26.749
STUMPF: I'm not on the Human Resources Committee
of the board.

00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:29.519
They have their own governance and structure.

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:33.399
We want that to proceed in the process in
which we have.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:35.690
WARREN: All right so we'll do this your way.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:41.600
Our letter asked a number of questions about
claw backs of Ms. Tolstedt's and other executive's

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.759
pay, including yours.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:49.059
Wells Fargo's answer to our letter was just
basically, you punted, that the decision would

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:50.059
be up to the board.

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:52.199
The same punt you've given here.

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:56.929
So you're the Chairman of the Board, let me
ask it this way: will you personally support

00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:01.429
clawing back all or part of Ms. Tolstedt's
pay?

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:08.390
STUMPF: I'm not going to in any way try to
influence or prejudice the board as they do

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.390
their deliberation.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.149
WARREN: So you have absolutely no opinion
on this?

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:14.140
STUMPF: I'm not going to opine on that--

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.250
WARREN: You're not going to opine.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.009
You're going to say get out there, defraud,
cheat, lie, steal, and I have nothing to say

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:22.069
about whether or not you ought to still be
getting your bonus?

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:26.059
STUMPF: I never said, and I would, we'd never
say as our company, go out there and do any

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:27.059
of those things.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.059
We try to do the right thing every day.

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:33.290
WARREN: But you say if you do them, you can
count on Chairman Stumpf not to stand up and

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.040
say you shouldn't get your incentive bonus.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.870
STUMPF: The board has a process...

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.791
WARREN: I think you started this whole thing
by saying, don't tell me what you say, tell

00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:42.029
me what your actions are.

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:47.489
And your actions are, people do this and you're
not going to take a single step to shut it down.

00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:52.449
So I guess I can ask this question again:
will you personally support clawing back any

00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:57.149
or all of the pay for the person in charge
of compliance? Someone we haven't talked about

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:58.309
much today.

00:15:58.309 --> 00:16:05.289
The person who is supposed to be responsible
to make sure that the bank is following the law.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:07.119
Will you have any recommendation about that
person?

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:09.430
STUMPF: I'm going to have the board do their
process.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.509
WARREN: You are going to have no recommendation
at all?

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:12.509
STUMPF: I...

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:13.509
WARREN: Ever?

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:14.509
At any point in this process?

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:18.910
STUMPF: Whatever the board accepts, whatever
they do I will accept and I will support.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.269
WARREN: You are not passive here.

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:25.259
If you have nothing to do then what are you
doing serving as Chairman of the Board?

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:29.819
If you have no opinions on the most massive
fraud that has hit this bank since the beginning

00:16:29.819 --> 00:16:34.550
of time how can it be that you actually get
to continue to collect a paycheck for being

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.550
Chairman of the Board?

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.259
STUMPF: Well first of all, I disagree with
the fact this is a massive fraud.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:44.579
But secondly the board will do their work
and I'm not going to prejudice their work.

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:48.790
And I will accept whatever they come up with
and I will be supportive.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:57.170
WARREN: Now, I, you accepted all along as
this fraud built up, this massive fraud, you

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:02.769
accepted all of the performance bonuses based
on the cross selling that is at the heart

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:03.769
of this.

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:11.429
You watched your own stock go up by more than
$200 million based in part on exactly this

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:12.500
massive fraud.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:18.309
You got out and you pumped it to Wall Street
and you said to Wall Street, hey we are doing

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:24.949
such a great job cross-selling here at Wells
Fargo, you should tell everybody to buy our stock.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:31.051
And now you turn around and say I shall remain
passive and simply accept what Wells Fargo

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.200
wants to do.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.399
You know, in 2008, Wall Street promised change.

00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:40.250
But it looks like it is business as usual.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:46.899
A giant bank cheats the little guys and the
executives line their own pockets.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:51.140
Mr. Stumpf you make it clear that Wall Street
won't change until we make it change.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.420
Thank you Mr. Chair.
