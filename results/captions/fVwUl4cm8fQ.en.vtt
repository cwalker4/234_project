00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.759
What's up guys so I am going to be starting

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.750
We are going to be starting a 30 by 40 garage and this is a residential garage

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.119
It's gonna be 12 foot tall and it's gonna have a 16 foot door in the front

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160
what I would say is probably the most common residential garage out there and

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.209
Small enough to be built by just about anybody

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.970
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to this build series. You're gonna want to follow along you're gonna want to subscribe

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.619
I'm gonna try to take you through step by step what it takes to put this up

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.939
And hopefully you'll be able to do this yourself if you want to if you're not my area if you're in my area

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.940
You know, hopefully you give me a call. Let me build it for you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
first thing that I got to do when we show up site is

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.320
Logistically, we've got to make sure everything is where we want it and get prepared a site that is basically a jumbled up mess

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.309
You just start off on the wrong foot. We don't have a ton of room

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.948
I mean, you know typically if you're out in a farm

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.188
You know out the middle of a field you got all sorts of room to put stuff everywhere

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.809
But this is our site. We've got a 30 by 40. I don't probably need the 33 94 mega deck but

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.400
You know, I'm gonna use it. Anyway, all this material got dropped by my supplier

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.650
Now we've got to put it in a spot get it out of our way

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.810
So that we can start cutting it up. So we lay out this building and get it dug in

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.429
so one of the first things that we're going to do is we're going to find in our layout our

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.269
constant line and so what the customers requested back here is they've got a

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.779
porch off the house that they want us to square the back or

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.969
Run our back of our wall parallel with so what we're doing back here is we're getting a string line

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.549
Attached to that porch and then we ran it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.470
Parallel to that porch to determine where the back of our building is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
And once we have that line to find that will be your constant line that you won't move

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.479
Throughout the process of getting your building laid out and square

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.239
Pretty old-fashioned way of doing our setup we use jet Stakes so you can see this nail right down here. That is our loose

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820
location that was defined

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.179
Based on running a parallel line off of this porch

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.639
You can see the string sitting there. This is the location the customer already determined where they wanted to start the building over here

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.540
There was a post here a little stick

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.939
So we measured over our 30 foot on this string line to determine that point

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.839
so this line will stay here and we'll use that to determine the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.219
Front two corners up here and we'll do that by pulling some tapes

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.589
Both on the walls and across the diagonal. Okay. So what we've done is we use that back line as our constant we then

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.940
basically used

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.809
Two nails on the ground to find a square dimension

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.300
Which is this nail that we got on the ground right here?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.749
And then all we're gonna do temporarily is put our string lines

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.700
Visually over that nail to get it close enough that we can then pull out our tapes and get exact dimensions on these strings

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.059
Gregor you looped down there. Yeah, okay

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280
Little over-under not

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.740
Okay

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.609
There's that and then let's pull

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.850
Let's go ahead and pull then Greg gonna pull the tape off

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.179
Yeah, but you don't have a 39 Niner, right?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840
Yep

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.709
So we're just pulling off of that mark down there, this is a 39-foot nine to mention

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.849
He's burning me a foot, which means I'm gonna mark 40 foot nine inch

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.820
And we're all set a nail

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.310
You got enough over there Zack if I put a loop

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.049
Do it a little tug, okay

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.920
All right, we just got everything laid down we got our marks all on the ground

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.039
So now the fun part busting out the Kubota to do some digging

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.410
What I always have Greg do is he goes around with the level and that level?

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.950
Not only oops that level not only determines to be perfectly underneath that string line

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.030
but also the distance of it so that like two and a half inches of

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.239
level keeps our whole Center so that our bracket when it sits center of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.370
The peer if that makes sense

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.299
So when the bracket is in the center of the peer on the center of the hole

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.640
It should be on the edge of that string line that make sense Greg. I think it does

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.130
Yeah, you've done it a lot of time. So

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.190
the more time that you spend in the setup stage

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.130
You know the layout the thought process the more time you spend there. Don't get in a hurry the better

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.320
The end result will be guaranteed

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.869
All right, we got the holes dug and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go around

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.009
And we're gonna take what we call crummers or like a clamshell

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.809
Shovel, and we're gonna clean out all that loose dirt that's down in the bottom

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.780
I know in some of the videos you see us kick the dirt back in that's really just to clean around the hole

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.869
Instead of having to shovel it over to the pile. We let the auger do the work so you can kind of see

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.660
here

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.380
Getting a little bit of moisture down there in the bottom we have had a bunch of rain in the last couple days

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:54.539
But goal is to get these cleaned out as much as possible well look at that

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.930
That was cool, huh?

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.989
We're right by an airport, so we're gonna have planes flying over us

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.549
It's a big I think it's a FedEx UPS terminal big one. So there's always

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.219
747s coming in so that's kind of cool. We got the Stabila rotary laser set up

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.890
We're gonna go around now, we're gonna set all of our tubes in their locations and get them to grade

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.339
So when I say sonotubes these are what I'm talking about. They're really that's just a generic name

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.280
These are actually coil inserts

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.150
40 inch by 20 inch 20 inch diameter 40 inches tall and we cut these down

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.030
just to form the top of our sonotube and

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.339
make the top a little bit smaller than the bottom of the hole and these come from

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.070
Metal suppliers. So these are

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.979
Basically, I don't pay but I think 2 bucks apiece for these things if anybody's bought sonotubes, you know how expensive they are

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.570
So now that it's time to set our tubes in the ground

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.769
We've already got a predetermined grade height measurement

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.450
So that's sitting on the laser and I'm gonna basically put this tube

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.440
I'm gonna put this tube

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.230
at that laser mark

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.599
And the top of them will all be the same

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.220
and that kind of is more of a visual thing and it makes it easier for us to

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.870
Build our walls later on down the road. We don't have measurements all across the board

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.430
Oh, hey Greg, yeah

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.020
Yep

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.860
Go ahead

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.959
So we're just gonna then fill around this tube and that friction alone is what's gonna hold this tube where we want it

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.770
Yep, it's gonna hold it where we want it until we pour already mix and

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.009
all so what this does is this

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.820
This brings the top of this hole a little bit smaller

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.950
than what the rest of the hole is at the bottom that way there's a little bit of a bell shape and it helps with

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.379
uplift or heat down the road

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.850
So, there we go, we've got all of our holes

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.799
Ready for concrete you can see in there nice and clean on the bottom

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.660
this is

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.150
Usually the case if you look around see how much further

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:19.739
Zoom in here way back in that corner, see how that tube is sticking out of the ground about 8 inches and

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.440
across that whole back

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.600
typical

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.549
Excavator comes in puts in a quote unquote level pad and it's usually closed

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:36.120
But the sonotubes never lie the top of them are all set with the laser and you can see this one is flush

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.999
And then they drop down drop down drop down drop down and then they come back up the hill

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.330
So, you know, we're gonna always set our tubes

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:51.600
Level so that our brackets are level when you look across because eventually they're gonna pour a floor in here

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.430
They're gonna do all that work and we want that to be nice and level all the way around

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
So there we go. That's it now

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.500
Concrete truck will come in here after lunch. We'll get these poured and then we'll set these brackets

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.820
These are midwest perma column brackets. So we get these questions all the time

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.910
They're sturdy wall 630 Peas and these are for actually it's

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.570
63

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:23.580
Ot and the OT is for Ohio Timberland. These are made specifically for Ohio Timberland Post because Ohio Timberland Post

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.430
Which is what we're using they are

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:34.139
milled they take those three ply columns and every two by six in them gets ran through a mill to get

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.250
to become true

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.119
Dimension and when they do that, you're obviously gonna lose a little bit of dimension

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:46.109
So instead of being a four and a half by five and a half post, it's like four and three-eighths by five and three-eighths

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.009
Okay, you can see behind me. We got the concrete truck coming so

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:56.400
Six bag mix is what we're putting in these holes. We're out of the, you know winter time calcium hot water thing

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.780
Just like that concrete board

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.979
Get everything poured we got it smoothed off

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.800
Now we're going to do we're going to go through we'll mark all of our locations on the string

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.310
Exactly where we want to set these brackets and then we will

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.190
We'll get them set

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.360
Easy

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.989
Burn the foot eight four and a half

00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:59.889
23

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
You
