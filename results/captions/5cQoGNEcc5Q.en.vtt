00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.329
Let me ask you something.

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:15.525
Have you ever been in a situation

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.172
where you've asked yourself
the following question:

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:26.021
is this person, is this person
flirting with me?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.415
Picture the scene:
you're at a friend's party.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.564
You sashay into the kitchen

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.839
because we all know
that's where the fun is.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.985
And you see an attractive stranger

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.996
getting a drink refill from a box of wine.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.456
Your friend's a student.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.372
And so you get a drink refill,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
and you say something hilarious
to the attractive stranger.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.146
Attractive stranger laughs.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.537
Good for you.

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.458
And then for the next few minutes

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:58.050
there's some eye contact, more talking.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.877
But then after a few minutes

00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:04.641
you start thinking,
'Is this person flirting with me?'

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.420
Sound familiar, anyone?

00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:12.729
See the person sitting next to you,
it's happened to them.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.736
The person in front of you,
it's happened to them.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.872
You see this is a universal conundrum.

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:20.196
But no more!

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.198
Because in the next ten minutes

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:25.077
I'm going to tell you
the signs of flirting

00:01:25.102 --> 00:01:29.383
and never again will you wonder:
is this person flirting with me?

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.139
I'm Jean Smith.

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.382
I'm a social anthropologist
who studies flirting,

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:38.179
a flirtologist, if you will.

00:01:39.112 --> 00:01:44.920
Now, as a flirtologist, I do research,
I write books, I give talks.

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:48.366
And I work with clients
both private and corporate,

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:52.034
all with the goal of helping people
to become better flirts.

00:01:53.148 --> 00:01:56.040
So I can see some of you
sitting there, you're thinking,

00:01:56.064 --> 00:02:00.869
'Really!? Is this necessary?
I mean teaching people how to flirt?'

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:02.139
Yes.

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.279
(Laughter)

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:04.400
Yes, it is.

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.490
I've been doing this for over a decade.

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:07.970
And if the question -

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.901
is this person flirting with me -
was popular then,

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:14.410
it's now everyone-wants-
to-take-it-to-prom popular

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.370
because over the last decade

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:19.295
the way that we flirt
has changed dramatically.

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:23.622
People are relying more and more
on digital ways of communicating.

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:24.911
But let's face it,

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:27.321
an emoji with its tongue sticking out,

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:30.041
it's only going to get you so far.

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:32.635
At some point, you're going
to have to meet in person.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:35.545
Unless of course, you're a Japanese male,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.856
and in that case, you could go on to marry
your video game girlfriend: Rinko.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:44.452
So as part of my quest
to help people become better flirts,

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:45.831
I did research.

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:49.372
I went to the cities of London,
New York, Paris and Stockholm,

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:53.382
and I researched the flirting behaviour
of its inhabitants.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:57.405
And I found there were six things
that they all had in common.

00:02:57.506 --> 00:03:00.642
Six ways that they could signal
they were flirting

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:04.343
and understood when someone
was flirting with them.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.877
And I teach this as

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:09.759
H.O.T.-A.P.E.

00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:11.556
(Laughter)

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:16.227
It's the six signs - it's an acronym
for the six signs of flirting.

00:03:17.288 --> 00:03:21.153
So what if I were to say to you:
'You must be a parking ticket

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:24.508
because you've got "fine"
written all over you.'

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:26.608
Would you laugh?

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.809
Well, 'H' is for humour.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.685
Raise your hand
if you thought my joke was funny.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.022
Go ahead, don't be shy.

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.025
OK, everyone with their hands up,

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.945
I would totally date you.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.256
(Laughter)

00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:42.825
Well, if my husband
weren't such a control freak.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.311
But anyway, if you
didn't raise your hands,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.805
it's not a good match.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.097
It's just not going to work between us.

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:50.650
But it's me, not you.

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:53.367
But this is a good thing

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:55.457
because HOTAPE-ing people -

00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:57.727
it takes time.

00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.780
Does anyone here
like reading a good novel,

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.827
watching an interesting TED talk?

00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:06.100
Does anyone here like test cricket?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.042
These things also take time,
especially test cricket, five days?

00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:14.477
And this is where people
often get it wrong

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.720
because they want to attract everybody.

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:19.646
But no, you just want
to attract those people

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:21.450
who match with you.

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.018
And that's why humour,

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.281
specifically a shared sense of humour,

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:28.319
is really important
for helping you to differentiate

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:34.844
between your potential HOT-APEs
and squirrel monkeys.

00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:37.079
I mean, yeah, they're cute.

00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.658
I'm sure they have a great personality.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:42.047
But at the end of the day
it's a squirrel monkey.

00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:43.832
It's no HOT-APE.

00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:47.838
So 'O' is for open body language.

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:49.609
Three things to remember.

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:52.554
Number one, don't do this.

00:04:53.273 --> 00:04:55.340
I know some of you are guilty of this.

00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:56.820
I've heard it all before,

00:04:56.844 --> 00:05:00.210
oh, but I'm cold, or, this is comfortable.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:03.340
OK, whiny voice aside, in which instance

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:04.940
do you want to HOT-APE me more?

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:06.193
Like this?

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.126
Or like this, right?

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:11.071
Not HOT-APE.

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:12.716
HOT-APE.

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:17.064
Number two: make sure your shoulders
are facing the person.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.026
So not HOT-APE,

00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:23.696
not HOT-APE, still not HOT-APE.

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.929
HOT-APE.

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:27.844
Not HOT-APE.

00:05:28.476 --> 00:05:29.962
HOT-APE.

00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:32.691
Now, the third,
this is the most important,

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:34.702
and I'm only telling you guys.

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.500
This is a really good one.

00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:38.431
To see if someone's interested,

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:41.053
look at the direction
in which their feet are pointing.

00:05:41.086 --> 00:05:44.302
So if their feet
are pointing at you, a good sign.

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:46.492
If they're kind of out to the side,

00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:49.346
it means they're planning
their escape route.

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:52.683
The further away our limbs
are from our brain,

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:56.348
the harder it is for us to control them.

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:59.955
So, Shakira, I know you say:
the hips don't lie,

00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:03.527
but the flirtologist is here
to say the feet don't lie.

00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:07.048
'T' is for touch.

00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:13.673
Like humour, touch also has a positive
physiological response on our body.

00:06:13.697 --> 00:06:17.724
Now as a general rule, shoulder -
it's a safe place to touch.

00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:22.114
But as you go down the arm
towards the hands,

00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:24.194
the touch gets more intimate.

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:28.110
That's why I recommend everyone
should kind of tap the hand

00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:29.974
and say something like:

00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:31.394
'Oh, you're so funny',

00:06:31.418 --> 00:06:33.599
people seem to love that stuff.

00:06:36.548 --> 00:06:39.334
Oh, another place
that would be nice to touch

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:40.676
would be just here

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.135
at the top of the back
between the shoulder blades,

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:46.975
perhaps if you're passing by,
you can give a light touch.

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.407
Now, of all of the flirting signs,

00:06:49.531 --> 00:06:53.687
people seem to be wariest
about using touch.

00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:55.707
As one of my clients said,

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.066
'Well, the other signs
you can get away with.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.860
But when it comes to touch,
you're culpable.'

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.916
But touch can get you
out of the friend zone,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.917
and it can also show someone
that you're interested.

00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:09.427
And as long as you remember,

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:10.826
I like test cricket,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.027
it lasts five days,

00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:14.337
I don't have time
to HOT-APE with everyone,

00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.398
then if the person
doesn't respond positively,

00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:19.151
you can try someone else.

00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:22.538
'A' is for attention.

00:07:22.862 --> 00:07:25.347
This one might seem obvious.

00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:29.048
The more attention someone is paying you,
the more they like you.

00:07:29.072 --> 00:07:31.858
But the problem is
once you are in the interaction,

00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:34.498
it's really hard to be objective.

00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:37.478
Which is why in anthropology,
we have a methodology,

00:07:37.502 --> 00:07:39.448
it's called participant observation.

00:07:39.472 --> 00:07:42.949
And I think this could be a really
useful tool for you to use in flirting.

00:07:44.052 --> 00:07:47.245
It means that you're participating,
you're in the interaction,

00:07:47.312 --> 00:07:49.823
but you're not so in it
that you can't observe.

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:53.080
So if you were to, for example,

00:07:53.104 --> 00:07:56.350
touch and say something
and see the other person blushed,

00:07:56.574 --> 00:07:59.169
it means that you're not so self-conscious

00:07:59.193 --> 00:08:03.120
that you can't observe the effect
that you're having on the other person.

00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:06.624
And that my friends
is when the flirting gets really fun.

00:08:08.014 --> 00:08:09.885
'P' is for proximity.

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:13.470
Now proximity was used in two ways.

00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:16.000
The first, if you see someone
across the room

00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:19.370
and then all of a sudden
they're next to your side,

00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.134
this is not a coincidence.

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:25.431
It means they like what they see
and they must explore further.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:27.752
The other way proximity was used

00:08:27.776 --> 00:08:30.121
is when you're actually
in the interaction,

00:08:30.145 --> 00:08:32.381
they're standing closer than usual.

00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:34.041
So if you're attracted, great.

00:08:34.065 --> 00:08:37.015
If you're not, they're in your space.

00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:42.121
So the last of the flirting signs
is the most important.

00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:45.287
Can anyone guess what it is?

00:08:46.476 --> 00:08:47.702
Thank you.

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:49.253
It's eye contact.

00:08:49.277 --> 00:08:51.143
This was the number one way

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:54.271
that people could understand someone
who's flirting with them

00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:58.025
and the difference
between friendly and flirting.

00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:02.824
So in flirting eye-contact
the gaze happened more often.

00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:05.424
It was held for a longer amount of time,

00:09:05.448 --> 00:09:07.548
and it was more intense.

00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:10.734
So using these signs:

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:15.822
humour, open body language, touch,
attention, proximity, eye contact,

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.414
you can recognize
when someone is flirting with you.

00:09:18.438 --> 00:09:21.220
And as a general rule,
the more signs the better.

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:25.305
Now my favourite story of HOT-APE
being used in the field

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:27.974
was relayed to me by one of my clients.

00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:30.566
She had shared HOT-APE
with all of her friends.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.584
And one night, they went out
HOTAPE-ing guys.

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:38.145
One of her friends was making
eye contact with a guy at the bar,

00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:40.375
and she went over and spoke with him.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.848
She came back a few minutes later,

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:45.335
bit dejected, my client said,

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:49.375
'What happened? What happened?'
And she's like, 'Oh nothing.'

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:52.565
'Well, did you HOT-APE him?'
She's like, 'Yeah, yeah.'

00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:54.804
And then they started
going through the sides:

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:57.055
'Did you use humour?'
She's like 'Yeah, yeah.'

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.555
'What about open body language?
You didn't do this like you usually do?'

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.767
'No, no.'

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:05.326
'What about touch?
Did you touch him? Back, hand.'

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.117
'Uh, God, I didn't use touch.'

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:11.886
And then they started laughing,
like, 'Well, no wonder.'

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.827
And what normally could have been
a situation of dejection

00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:17.797
or, you know, feeling bad,

00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:20.201
it just turned into a fun game.

00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:23.228
And this is the power of HOTAPE

00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:26.067
because it turns flirting
into what it should be.

00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.613
It's something fun, easy,
it's not a big deal.

00:10:30.473 --> 00:10:32.718
And when we think
about flirting like this,

00:10:32.742 --> 00:10:35.572
it totally changes
our paradigm of rejection.

00:10:36.312 --> 00:10:41.338
And in situations where we're often
feeling self-conscious or a bit nervous,

00:10:41.362 --> 00:10:44.823
we have scientific tools
to help us remember what to do.

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:47.348
And finally,

00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:49.730
it makes it's not about us,

00:10:49.813 --> 00:10:52.519
it's a checklist; it's a task.

00:10:52.543 --> 00:10:57.030
It's things to do rather than
how we often see flirting

00:10:57.054 --> 00:11:00.413
which is a stranger's
evaluation of our worth.

00:11:01.813 --> 00:11:04.505
So now you know the signs of flirting,

00:11:04.577 --> 00:11:09.695
and I encourage you to not just
recognize but be proactive,

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:14.276
because these signs also use
for you to express interest.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.984
And this is my challenge to you:

00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:22.120
forget about the game,
forget about the rules,

00:11:22.344 --> 00:11:24.151
be genuine.

00:11:24.175 --> 00:11:27.895
Take action and go HOTAPE someone.

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:30.239
Thank you.

00:11:30.264 --> 00:11:32.049
(Applause)

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:33.614
Thank you.
