00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.610
Oprah: IT'S BEEN NEARLY 30 YEARS

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.810
SINCE GARY ZUKAV...

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.150
[ CHEERING ]

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.090
...WROTE "THE SEAT OF THE SOUL."

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.260
NOW, THAT BOOK IS ALWAYS BY MY NIGHTSTAND.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.930
IT IS THE BOOK THAT

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.860
PROFOUNDLY CHANGED

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.330
THE COURSE OF MY LIFE.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.000
I CAN GIVE THE TEACHINGS,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.670
THE MASTERY OF THAT BOOK,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.210
CREDIT FOR CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.510
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.480
"THE SEAT OF THE SOUL" CHANGED THE LANGUAGE

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.850
OF WHAT I WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.290
I MEAN, MY HEART, MY ENERGY FELT A CERTAIN WAY,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.290
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE VOICE OR THE LANGUAGE

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.160
TO EXPRESS

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.730
MULTI-SENSORY PERCEPTION.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.500
AND HE, GARY, WAS ABLE

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.770
TO ARTICULATE IN A VOICE

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.300
THAT RESONATED WITH ME.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.870
I WAS READY FOR IT, SO ANYBODY WHO'S READ IT

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.640
AND FEELS LIKE, "AH, I DON'T GET IT,"

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.410
IT MEANS YOU'RE JUST NOT READY FOR IT.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.480
AND I CONTINUE TO BE READY FOR IT.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.980
AS I SAY, IT'S ON MY NIGHTSTAND.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.680
AND EVERY TIME I READ IT, I GET SOMETHING NEW.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.380
GARY IS THE VERY REASON,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.590
ACTUALLY, THAT WE ARE ALL TOGETHER HERE TODAY.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.060
BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER HAVE

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.790
DREAMED OF THIS DAY

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.560
HAD I NOT READ THAT BOOK.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.230
I WOULD'VE NEVER HAD IT IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.070
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.470
IT'S 'CAUSE OF GARY THAT I ALSO

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.640
CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY SHOW,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.410
WHERE I CHANGED THE INTENTION OF THE SHOW.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.410
AND I WOULD BELIEVE IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY INTENTION

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.250
THAT THE "OPRAH" SHOW

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.750
BECAME WHAT IT BECAME IN THE WORLD --

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.990
TRULY A FORCE AND A VOICE FOR GOOD,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
FOR ELEVATING CONSCIOUSNESS

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.560
AND FOR INSPIRATION FOR 25 YEARS.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.930
THAT ALL CAME BECAUSE OF THE CHAPTER THAT I READ

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.670
ON INTENTION IN 1989.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.600
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.740
IS A RESULT OF THAT CLARITY OF INTENTION.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.410
THAT'S WHY IT'S MY FAVORITE WORD.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.380
GARY ZUKAV! COME ON OUT.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.180
GARY ZUKAV, ONE OF MY MASTER TEACHERS.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.760
THIS IS YOUR SEAT.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.390
WHOA. HEY, GARY.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.160
ONE OF MY MASTER TEACHERS.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.500
SO, HERE'S THE WAY IT WORKED.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.670
LONG BEFORE I HAD A BOOK CLUB, I WOULD READ BOOKS

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.600
AND I WOULD GO TO THE BACK OF THE BOOK

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240
AND THERE WOULD BE LIKE,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.910
A LITTLE AUTHOR BIO IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.710
AND WHEN I FINISHED READING "SEAT OF THE SOUL,"

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.750
I LOOKED IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.750
AND IT SAID GARY ZUKAV

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.220
LIVED IN MOUNT SHASTA, CALIFORNIA.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.490
AND I NEVER HEARD OF IT, BUT BACK IN THE DAY, YOU KNOW,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.160
WE HAD SOMETHING CALLED TELEPHONE BOOKS.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.930
ANYBODY REMEMBER THOSE? TEL-E-PHONE BOOKS.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.170
SO, I CALLED INFORMATION, AND I GOT HIS NUMBER

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.370
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AUTHORS WERE LISTED

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.110
IN THE TEL-E-PHONE BOOK.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.180
AND I CALLED UP GARY, AND I SAID, "HELLO MR. ZUKAV,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.910
THIS IS OPRAH WINFREY."

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.580
AND YOU SAID...

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.920
"WHO?"

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.280
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.490
AND THEN I SAID, "OPRAH." AND HE SAID...

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.420
"SPELL THAT."

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.560
IT'S 1989 -- I'D BEEN ON THREE YEARS ALREADY.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.030
AND HE DIDN'T --

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.530
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A TELEVISION, RIGHT?

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.600
I HAD A TELEVISION FOR WATCHING MOVIES,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.200
BUT IT WASN'T HOOKED UP TO ANYTHING ELSE.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.530
WASN'T HOOKED UP TO ANYTHING ELSE --

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.740
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO HOOK IT UP.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.440
IT WAS JUST A CHANNEL. YOU JUST TURNED IT ON.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.940
REALLY. AND SO, I EXPLAINED WHO I WAS

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.080
AND THAT I HAD A TALK SHOW,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.910
AND THAT I JUST FINISHED READING HIS BOOK

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.620
AND I HAD SOME QUESTIONS OF MY OWN.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.020
AT THE TIME, I WASN'T CALLING

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.090
FOR HIM TO BE ON THE TALK SHOW

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.390
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT SOULS

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.330
AND THE LANGUAGE OF SOULS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.290
SO I WAITED A LONG TIME, ACTUALLY,

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.470
BEFORE I ACTUALLY COULD CONVINCE MY PRODUCERS

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.300
THAT WE COULD DO A SHOW TALKING ABOUT THE SOUL

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.040
AND GET PEOPLE TO WATCH.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.170
SO, WE DID OUR FIRST INTERVIEW

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.550
MANY YEARS LATER ON CAMERA IN 1988.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.980
AND THAT INTERVIEW WAS A SHIFT

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.820
IN THE WAY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.350
SAW AND FELT AND HEARD

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.060
WHAT IT MEANT TO HAVE A SOUL.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.760
SO I JUST WANT TO RUN A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.090
RIGHT NOW.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.830
HERE'S A SHORT LOOK

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.200
AT THAT FIRST INTERVIEW

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.170
WHERE GARY EXPLAINS WHAT THE SOUL IS.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.470
WE THOUGHT WE HAD TO DO THIS,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.870
BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A SOUL WAS.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.580
-WHAT IS THE SOUL? -THE SOUL IS WHAT YOU ARE.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.010
THE SOUL IS NOT A MYTHICAL ENTITY.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.220
THE SOUL IS A POWERFUL, PURPOSEFUL...ESSENCE.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.860
IT IS AT THE VERY CENTER OF WHO YOU ARE.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.730
BUT DO NOT THINK THAT YOU ARE THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR SOUL.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.730
A SOUL IS ENORMOUS.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.030
YOUR SOUL EXISTED BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.500
AND YOUR SOUL WILL EXIST AFTER YOU DIE.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.570
YOU, THE OPRAH THAT I AM SPEAKING TO,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.540
I, THE GARY THAT IS SPEAKING TO YOU,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.740
ARE PERSONALITIES.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.350
I HAVE A CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.880
I HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN IN MY LIFE.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.350
I HAVE EMOTIONS. I HAVE INTUITION AND COGNITION.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.720
I HAVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.660
BUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL DIE.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.230
BUT MY SOUL WILL NOT, AND NEITHER WILL YOURS.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.860
DOES MY SOUL KNOW ME?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.360
YES, YES.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.630
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.100
EVERY FLEET OF SHIP THAT SAILS

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.200
HAS A MOTHER SHIP --

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.600
ONE SHIP THAT KNOWS

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.070
WHERE ALL OF THEM ARE GOING

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.770
AND SETS THE DIRECTION AND SETS THE DIRECTION FOR ALL OF THOSE SHIPS TO SAIL.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.410
MM-HMM.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.110
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE MOTHER SHIP DETERMINES

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.880
WHAT HAPPENS ON EACH OF THE OTHER SHIPS IN THE FLEET.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.880
LIFE ON ONE OF THE SHIPS MIGHT BE MOSTLY PLEASANT.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.320
ON YET ANOTHER SHIP, IT MIGHT BE MOSTLY UNPLEASANT.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.620
NOW, IMAGINE THE MOTHER SHIP

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.260
IS THE BIGGEST SHIP YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.130
IT'S A CITY AFLOAT, MAGNIFICENT.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.130
AND NOW, IMAGINE THAT THE REST OF THE BOATS,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.730
THE SHIPS, ARE NOT REALLY SHIPS

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.730
BUT LITTLE BOATS.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.960
MM-HMM.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.730
THE MOTHER SHIP IS YOUR SOUL,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.700
AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE LITTLE BOATS.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.870
THE MOTHER SHIP KNOWS WHY... AH, THAT'S JUST --

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.740
THAT'S A VERY NICE ANALOGY, REALLY.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.750
THE MOTHER SHIP KNOWS WHY YOU ARE IN THE WATER.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.950
YOU MAY NOT KNOW ALL OF THE TIME.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.520
THE MOTHER SHIP KNOWS WHY YOU ENCOUNTER STORMS.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.620
YOUR JOB,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.630
WHILE YOU HAVE THE AWESOME PRIVILEGE

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.660
OF BEING A LITTLE BOAT,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.500
IS TO LEARN HOW TO SAIL IN THE SAME DIRECTION

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.170
AS YOUR MOTHER SHIP.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.870
BECAUSE YOU CAN CHOOSE AND CREATE

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.170
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.270
YOU CAN SAIL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.540
IF YOU WANT.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.210
THAT IS A SURE WAY TO FIND ROUGH WATER.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.980
BUT AS YOU SAIL IN THE DIRECTION

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.950
THAT YOUR MOTHER SHIP WANTS TO SAIL,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.720
YOUR LIFE FILLS WITH MEANING AND PURPOSE AND LOVE.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.560
YOU ARE EXCITED ABOUT BEING ALIVE.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.060
YOU ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WITH

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.130
AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.760
'CAUSE YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE MOTHER SHIP.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.930
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.870
SO, YOU CAN SEE ME GET IT, RIGHT?

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.300
I HOPE YOU GOT IT, TOO.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.640
THAT MOTHER SHIP CONVERSATION --

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.570
ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND CONVERSATIONS

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.170
AND LEARNINGS OF MY LIFE,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.770
AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.010
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.940
-HOW DID THAT... -YEAH, THAT WAS CREATED FOR YOU.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.150
-WAS IT? -I HAD NEVER --

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.650
I DON'T REMEMBER EVER SPEAKING

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.680
IN TERMS OF THE SOUL AND A MOTHER SHIP

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.850
BEFORE YOU AND I WERE TALKING THAT MORNING.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.120
BECAUSE I SAID, "WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.720
TO BRING IT DOWN

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.030
SO THAT THE AUDIENCE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SOUL IS."

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.360
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THIS ANALOGY OF THE SHIP.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.830
SO, THANK YOU.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.630
[ LAUGHS ] YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.540
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR US TO FOLLOW THE MOTHER SHIP?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.770
THAT'S THE THING.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.610
I MEAN, AND THAT THING CLICKED FOR ME

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.410
IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THIS MOMENT,

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.880
I STILL HONOR THAT PROCESS OF,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.780
"WHERE IS THE MOTHER SHIP HEADED

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.650
AND WHERE IS MY LITTLE BOAT

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.150
IN PROPORTION TO THAT MOTHER SHIP?"

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.860
AND I HEARD SOME OF YOU GIVE A "AMEN" TO,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.790
WHEN YOU'RE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE SHIP,

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.260
THAT'S WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER THE ROUGHEST WATERS.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
SO WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR US

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.200
NOT TO JUST STAY IN FLOW WITH THE MOTHER SHIP?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.530
FEAR.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.740
FEAR.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.640
IF YOU IMAGINE THAT YOUR SOUL HAS MANY PERSONALITIES

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.210
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THEM,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.250
AND YOU ARE...

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.820
...IN THE EARTH SCHOOL --

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.280
THE PERSONALITY. -MM-HMM.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.790
THAT'S THE SPAN BETWEEN THE BIRTH OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.160
AND THE DEATH OF YOUR PERSONALITY.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.430
RIGHT, SO, THIS WHOLE UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.060
AS A DENSE BODY, AS A BODY,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.860
A PERSONALITY WITHIN THE BODY,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.470
IS AN EARTH SCHOOL,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.270
IS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.310
I LOOK AT IT AS THE ENTIRE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE...

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.510
WHICH PERSONALITIES --

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.980
WHICH USED TO BE JUST FIVE SENSORY --

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.580
THOUGHT EXTENDED TO INFINITY.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.920
BUT WE'RE BECOMING MULTI-SENSORY.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.250
AND NOW WE'RE BEGINNING TO SENSE

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.490
THAT THE ENTIRE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.950
AND EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS TO US AND THAT WE EXPERIENCE

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.290
IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.860
AND IT'S NOT THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.000
AS WE BECOME MULTI-SENSORY, AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.400
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.800
WE BEGIN TO SENSE.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.240
WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.100
BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE FIVE SENSES.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.840
WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE OURSELVES

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.440
AS MORE THAN MINDS AND BODIES.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.580
RIGHT.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.010
THAT'S YOUR SOUL, THE MORE.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.650
WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE OUR LIVES

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.480
AS MORE THAN RANDOM AND GOOD LUCK OR BAD LUCK.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.720
WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE THEM AS MEANINGFUL.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.090
YEAH, AND YOU BEGIN TO SEE

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.020
THAT THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.920
OUT OF THE ORDER AND DESIGN OF YOUR OWN LIFE.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.560
YES.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.930
EVERY INTERACTION BETWEEN YOU AND ANYONE

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.370
OR OTHER PEOPLE IS PERFECT,

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.940
AND OFFERS EACH INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.170
OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW SPIRITUALLY

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.840
THAT ARE PERFECT FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL GIVEN

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.110
THE WISDOM OF THE CHOICES THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS MADE.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.680
YOU FOLLOW THAT?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.220
OKAY, TRACKING?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.490
SO, HE'S SAYING, EVEN IF YOU'RE IN AN ENCOUNTER

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.320
THAT FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.090
OR THAT BRINGS ANGER OR DISRUPTION,

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.160
THAT ENCOUNTER HAS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.260
IN ORDER TO GROW YOU

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.230
OR PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.730
FOR YOU TO GROW TO WHATEVER IS THE NEXT LEVEL

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.400
OF YOUR PERSONAL EVOLUTION.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.170
THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING TO YOU

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.250
THAT ISN'T HAPPENING TO YOU TO GROW YOU TO THE NEXT LEVEL

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.580
OF YOUR EVOLUTION.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.920
EVEN IF YOU'RE IN A TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.350
OR IN A JOB THAT YOU DON'T LIKE.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.050
I SAY TO MY DAUGHTERS FROM SOUTH AFRICA ALL THE TIME,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.720
DOING A JOB YOU DON'T LIKE

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.060
IS FANTASTIC INFORMATION FOR YOU,

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.130
BECAUSE KNOWING WHAT YOU DON'T WANT

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.500
HELPS LEAD YOU TO WHAT YOU DO WANT, CORRECT?

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.300
-LET'S LOOK AT THE WORD "YOU." -MM-HMM.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.370
THERE IS A LITTLE --

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.040
THERE'S A "YOU" WITH A LITTLE "Y."

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.540
-YEP. -THAT'S YOUR PERSONALITY.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.810
-CORRECT. -NOW, THERE'S A "YOU"

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.680
WITH A BIG "Y," WITH A CAPITAL "Y."

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.180
-YES. -THAT'S YOUR SOUL.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.780
-RIGHT. -SO WHEN YOU SAY

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.980
IT'S ALWAYS LEADING YOU TO WHAT YOU WANT,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.550
YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY BECAUSE OFTEN,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.650
IT LEADS YOU TO THE THINGS

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.450
THE "YOU" WITH THE LITTLE "Y" DO NOT WANT.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.320
OKAY, SO LITTLE "Y" AND BIG "Y."

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.760
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.560
SO WHY I'M BRINGING THIS OUT IS FEAR.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.630
YEAH.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.900
BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.360
YOU CAN SAY ARE ALWAYS PERFECT,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.870
AND IF THEY SEEM TERRIBLE OR IF THEY'RE DISRUPTIVE

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.370
OR IF THEY'RE DIFFICULTY,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.740
THAT'S BECAUSE OF PARTS OF YOUR PERSONALITY...

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.240
-THAT ARE AFRAID. -CORRECT. THAT ORIGINATE IN FEAR.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.240
AND THOSE PARTS WE EXPERIENCE, OR YOU EXPERIENCE,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.720
AS ANGER, JEALOUSY, RESENTMENT, SUPERIORITY, ENTITLEMENT,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.890
NEED TO PLEASE, INFERIORITY, EVERY OBSESSION,

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.720
EVERY COMPULSION, EVERY ADDICTION --

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.330
THESE ARE ALL EXPERIENCES OF FEAR.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.990
AND WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ONE OF THOSE

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.200
AND YOU SAY, "THIS IS TERRIBLE.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.270
MY LITTLE DAUGHTER'S GOT CANCER. THIS IS TERRIBLE."

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.440
THAT IS A FRIGHTENED PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.540
BUT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.670
WHO WOULD LOOK AT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.110
VERY DIFFERENTLY,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.150
AND THESE ARE THE PARTS OF YOUR PERSONALITY... THAT ORIGINATE IN LOVE.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.150
-YES.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.750
AND WE EXPERIENCE THEM AS GRATITUDE.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.320
SO, YOUR DAUGHTER HAS CANCER,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.090
YOU HAVE CANCER, SOMEBODY IN YOUR FAMILY

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.290
HAS A TERRIBLE DISEASE OR DIAGNOSIS.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.630
YOUR FEAR...

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.330
OF LOSING THEM,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.160
YOUR FEAR OF ABANDONMENT,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.900
YOUR FEAR THAT THEY WON'T BE HERE,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.470
YOUR FEAR OF THAT

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.570
IS WHAT CAUSES ALL OF THE ANGST,

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.940
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.080
THE EXPERIENCES OF A PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.280
THAT ARE FRIGHTENED... -YEAH.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.050
...IS EXPERIENCING ANGST OR TURBULENCE.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.220
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT --

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.150
RESENTMENT, VENGEANCE --

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.060
IT'S NOT COMING FROM THE UNCHANGEABLE GROUND

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.320
OF YOUR BEING. -RIGHT.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.990
IT'S COMING FROM A PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY,

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.160
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE CONTROLLED BY IT.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.630
CORRECT.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SPIRITUAL PRACTICE, HOWEVER,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
AND DON'T KNOW THAT THERE

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.470
IS A PART OF YOUR BEING THAT IS SOLID,

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.740
THAT IS CONNECTED TO ALL BEINGS,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.470
ALL THINGS,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.610
AND GROUNDED FROM THE SOURCE OF ALL BEINGS AND ALL THINGS,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.410
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT,

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.250
THEN YOU BECOME EVEN MORE FRIGHTENED, CORRECT?

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.120
YES, IT HELPS TO KNOW THAT.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.350
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.620
AND IF -- IF --

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.390
HELPS TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A MOTHER SHIP,

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.790
AND THAT YOU ARE GROUNDED BY THE MOTHER SHIP.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.360
SO, OUT OF -- AND THE MOTHER SHIP

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.530
IS NOT ALL OF THE BENEFICENCE OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.770
-NO, IT IS NOT. -THAT IS BOUNDLESS.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.800
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.470
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT GROUNDING,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.040
YOU WILL EVENTUALLY.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.770
BUT IT'S WHEN YOU RESIST...

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.170
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.680
WHEN YOU'RE IN ANGER, JEALOUSY, RESENTMENT,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.680
AND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.080
A PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.180
AND THAT YOU CAN SHIFT YOUR ATTENTION

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.420
TO A PART THAT'S GRATEFUL OR APPRECIATIVE

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.390
OR IN AWE OF THE UNIVERSE OR PATIENCE,

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.560
THEN YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THAT LITTLE MINI-CLIMATE.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.830
-RIGHT. -AND IT'S HELL.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.660
IT'S VERY PAINFUL.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.030
BUT WHEN YOU KNOW

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.800
THAT THAT EXPERIENCE IS PRESENTED TO YOU

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.200
IN THE EARTH SCHOOL FOR A REASON.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.210
AND THAT REASON IS FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE IT FULLY,

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.140
NOT TO DENY AN EMOTION, REPRESS IT EVER.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.380
NOT TO RESIST IT.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.810
BUT TO FEEL IT,

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.480
AND WHILE YOU'RE FEELING IT,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:15.150
CHOOSE THE HEALTHIEST PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY THAT YOU CAN

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.490
TO RESPOND FROM.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.960
-CHOOSE LOVE. -YES.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.790
SO, OUT OF THE 36 SHOWS THAT WE TAPED WITH GARY,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.860
THE ONE THAT STANDS OUT FOR MANY PEOPLE

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.430
AND THAT CONTINUES TO RESONATE WITH ME

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.300
WAS ABOUT HOW TO GET YOUR POWER BACK.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.540
WE DID A SHOW ON HOW TO GET YOUR POWER BACK.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.000
AND I HEARD THAT IT'S THE SHOW

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.410
THAT YOU ALSO GET ASKED ABOUT THE MOST.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.780
WE MET A COUPLE, JODY AND IRA WERE THEIR NAMES,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:45.950
WHO HAD RECENTLY LOST ONE OF THEIR TWIN SONS.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.350
TWINS BORN, AND JUST FOUR DAYS

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.860
AFTER HE WAS BORN,

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.590
BABY RYAN DIED.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.430
UNDERSTANDABLY,

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.130
THIS COUPLE WAS TRAPPED IN THEIR OWN GRIEF

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.770
AND COULDN'T SEE A WAY OUT

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.440
OR A LIFE BEYOND WHAT THEY HAD ENDURED.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.470
ANYBODY WHO HAS EVER LOST A CHILD

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.840
OR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER KNOWS,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.610
PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A CHILD.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.440
THEY WERE SUFFERING AND ALSO FEELING

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.680
THIS OVERWHELMING "LOSS OF CONTROL",

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.920
IS WHAT SHE HAD SAID TO US EARLIER IN THE SHOW.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.520
HE DIED, AS I SAID, AFTER BEING ONLY FOUR-DAYS OLD.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.260
SO, I WANT US TO JUST WATCH THIS CONVERSATION.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.420
THIS WAS AN EYE-OPENING CONVERSATION

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.960
FOR MANY PEOPLE ABOUT THE SOUL.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.300
TAKE A LOOK.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.330
Zukav: THIS IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE --

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.670
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PERSONALITY,

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.640
OR THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOUL.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.740
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOUL,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.010
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PERSONALITIES

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.210
ARE MEANINGFUL.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:50.150
AND EVERY SOUL COMES INTO THE EARTH SCHOOL...

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.580
WHEN IT CHOOSES,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.450
AND EVERY PERSONALITY OR SOUL

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.790
LEAVES THE EARTH SCHOOL

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.490
WHEN IT CHOOSES.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.190
IF YOU LOOK AT RYAN

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.630
AS A PERSONALITY WHO LIVED FOR A FEW DAYS

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.730
AND THEN ENCOUNTERED TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.530
AND DIED, THEN YOU ARE LOOKING

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.200
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSONALITY.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.940
IF YOU LOOK AT RYAN AS A SOUL,

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.980
LIKE YOURSELF,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.280
LIKE IRA,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.510
LIKE OPRAH, LIKE ME,

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.180
LIKE EVERYONE ON THIS EARTH,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.450
THAT LEFT THIS EARTH WHEN IT CHOSE,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.730
THEN YOU WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.090
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE GIFTS

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.300
THAT THIS SOUL OFFERED TO YOU

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.400
DURING ITS SHORT STAY ON THE EARTH.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.970
YOU WILL REACH A PLACE IN YOUR LIFE

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.670
WHERE YOU ARE GRATEFUL THAT THIS SOUL CHOSE

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.940
TO BE WITH YOU FOR HOWEVER SHORT A TIME.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.580
IF YOU DO NOT, YOU WILL LIVE YOUR LIFE

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.780
IN ANGUISH THINKING THAT A TRAGEDY HAS OCCURRED.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.520
WHENEVER YOU SEE YOUR OTHER SON GROWING UP,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.760
YOU WILL SAY, "RYAN SHOULD BE HERE."

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.120
WHEN HE GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.790
YOU'LL SAY, "RYAN SHOULD HAVE GRADUATED."

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.030
WHEN HE FINDS HIS WIFE, YOU WILL SAY,

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.400
"RYAN SHOULD BE GETTING MARRIED, TOO."

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.230
AND THROUGH ALL OF THIS TIME,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.940
YOU WILL IMPOSING ON YOUR OTHER SON A BURDEN TO CARRY

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.010
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES OR HOW SUCCESSFUL HE IS,

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.480
HE WILL BE CAUSING MOMMY PAIN.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.380
IF YOU LOOK AT RYAN AS A SOUL,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.580
A GREAT SOUL LIKE YOURSELF,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.050
WHO VOLUNTARILY ENTERED THE EARTH SCHOOL

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.660
AND VOLUNTARILY LEFT IT

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.230
IN ORDER TO BE WITH YOU...

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.530
...AND TO OFFER GIFTS,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.730
THEN YOU WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.800
OF FATHOMING AND APPRECIATING

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.100
AND BECOMING GRATEFUL FOR THE POWER

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.940
OF THE INTERACTION THAT YOU HAD WITH THAT SOUL.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.570
AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE GIFTS

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.180
THAT THAT SOUL CAME TO THIS EARTH

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.380
TO GIVE YOU, TO GIVE IRA,

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.750
TO GIVE TO HIS SIBLINGS.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.250
AND IF YOU DO NOT,

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.920
YOU WILL CONTINUALLY BE TURNING AWAY FROM THOSE GIFTS.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.120
YOU WILL BE DENYING THE VERY WEALTH

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.330
OF WISDOM AND COMPASSION

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:20.170
THAT WAS OFFERED TO YOU BY THIS SOUL.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.730
WELL, THAT MIGHT BE THE MOST POWERFUL THING

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.540
I EVER HEARD YOU SAY.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.670
THAT'S PRETTY POWERFUL.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:33.650
THAT WAS PRETTY POWERFUL.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:34.850
THAT'S PRETTY POWERFUL, AND I...

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.050
DO YOU FEEL THAT HIS SOUL LIVES ON,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.950
AND THAT SOMEHOW OR SOME WAY,

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.850
THAT WE CAN, YOU KNOW,

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.090
CONTACT THAT SOUL

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.720
OR FEEL THAT SOUL...

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.430
-IN OUR LIVES? -YOU ARE FEELING IT RIGHT NOW.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.560
EVERY ONE OF US FEELS THE SOUL OF RYAN

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.600
RIGHT NOW, AT THIS MOMENT.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.230
EVERY ONE OF US FEELS THE SOUL OF RYAN,

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.070
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT GARY'S TALKING ABOUT

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.670
IN MULTI-SENSORY PERCEPTION.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.040
IN THE BOOK ABOUT MULTI-SENSORY PERCEPTION --

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.480
IF YOU THINK IT'S ONLY WHAT YOU CAN SEE,

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.980
THEN YOU'RE MISSING THE WHOLE POINT.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.710
'CAUSE EVERY ONE OF US SAW THAT STORY, HEARD THAT,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.780
AND NOW FEEL THE PRESENCE OF YOUR SON

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.420
WHO WAS ONLY HERE FOR A SHORT FEW DAYS.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.220
AND HIS OWN LITTLE LIFE, WEIGHING 1 1/2 POUNDS,

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.790
HAS IMPACTED THROUGH THE TELLING

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.760
OF THAT STORY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.930
WE ALL FEEL IT. WHY DO YOU THINK --

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.730
WE'RE ALL FEELING THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.270
ARE WE NOT, GARY?

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.970
Zukav: WE ARE.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.700
I AM. -WELL, THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.470
AND YES --

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.480
THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS "YES."

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.350
-[ APPLAUSE ] -NOW...

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.620
...WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THAT...

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.220
...THAT SHOW WAS IN 2000,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.020
AND HERE WE ARE, 17 YEARS LATER,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.520
EVERYBODY WHO JUST SAW THAT TAPE AND FELT WHAT YOU FELT.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.330
THAT WAS THE SOUL --

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.760
ANOTHER NAME, SPIRIT --

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.730
OF BABY RYAN, WHO ONLY LIVED FOUR DAYS.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.440
AND LOOK AT THE IMPACT

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.340
THAT FOUR DAYS OF LIFE ON EARTH HAS HAD

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.440
ON EVERY ONE OF US.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.610
SO, HOW DID YOU COME TO SEE LIFE AND DEATH IN A WAY

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:19.150
THAT YOU EXPLAINED TO RYAN'S PARENTS?

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:24.420
BY OPENING MYSELF.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.260
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ARTICULATE IT EITHER,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.130
UNTIL I WAS...

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.800
TILL I ENCOUNTERED SOME OF THESE THINGS

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.000
AND WAS TAUGHT THEM SO THAT I COULD SHARE THEM.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.370
I HAD A GRANDMOTHER WHO PASSED ON

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.270
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.570
AND BEFORE THAT,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.210
SHE WOULD TAKE ME THROUGH THIS LARGE BUILDING

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:48.180
WHERE PEOPLE HER AGE WERE RETIRING,

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.020
AND IT WAS A SEA OF GRAY HAIR.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.220
SHE'D TAKE ME TO THE RESTAURANT,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.720
AND AFTERWARDS, WE'D WALK THROUGH

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.350
AND SHE'D INTRODUCE ME TO THIS PERSON AND THAT PERSON.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.920
SHE'D SAY, "YOU REMEMBER MR..." AND, "YOU REMEMBER MRS..."

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.160
AND IF I DIDN'T OR I DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.430
SHE'D JERK DOWN ON MY HAND, AND SHE'D SAY, "SHH!"

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.600
SO, WHEN SHE PASSED ON,

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.270
I WAS HEARING HER EULOGY IN THE FUNERAL HOME,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.870
AND THE RABBI WAS SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS,

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.710
BUT TO HIS RIGHT WAS AN ALCOVE WHERE THE FAMILY WAS SITTING.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.040
THAT'S WHERE I WAS,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.050
AND I WAS WATCHING HIM FROM THE FRONT VIEW

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.850
ON A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.720
AND THOSE DAYS, CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION WAS SO NOVEL,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.360
IT WAS BRAND NEW,

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.560
THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY, AND I STARTED TO LAUGH.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.190
AND GRANDMA LIBBY JERKED MY HAND DOWN

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.160
AND SHE SAID, "SHH!"

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.130
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME LAUGHING AT THE FUNERAL.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.370
SO, HOW COULD I EVER MISS HER AFTER THAT?

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.740
SHE SCOLDED ME BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T --

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.910
SHE WANTED TO HEAR WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.350
SO, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT AS MULITISENSORY PERCEPTION.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.020
I JUST KNEW THAT'S GRANDMA LIBBY.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.020
AND I DIDN'T TELL MY PARENTS FOR MAYBE 20 OR 25 YEARS,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.160
BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.690
THEY'D THINK THAT I WAS DISTRAUGHT WITH GRIEF

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.300
OR IT WAS A WISHFUL FULFILLMENT,

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.330
BUT IT WAS REAL.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.240
AND IT WAS ONLY MUCH LATER,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.400
AFTER A LOT OF RESISTANCE IN MY LIFE,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.010
A LOT OF TRYING TO AVOID THE PAIN IN MY LIFE

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.880
WHICH IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE FEAR IN MY LIFE.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.150
AND THE WAY I WAS DOING THAT IN MY EARLIER DAYS WAS --

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.350
THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM,

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.120
BUT THERE WERE SOME BASIC ONES --

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.220
I WAS A SEX ADDICT,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.690
I LOVED RIDING MOTORCYCLES,

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.730
I ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THE MONTHLY MIRACLE OF THE RENT

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.960
SO I TRIED TO AVOID THAT.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.600
AND THEN, I AVOIDED IT BY JOINING THE MILITARY,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.070
WHERE I WAS IN THE ARMY.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.480
AND THEN, I CAME OUT OF THE ARMY AND...

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.810
WEREN'T YOU A GREEN BERET, WEREN'T YOU?

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.350
I WAS A GREEN BERET. I WAS A GREEN BERET OFFICER

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.610
IN VIETNAM.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.450
MM-HMM.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.450
SO, ALL OF THESE WERE WAYS OF AVOIDING PAIN.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.920
THEY ARE DESTRUCTIVE WAYS OF AVOIDING PAIN,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.720
WHICH MEANS THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS WAYS

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.120
OF AVOIDING PAIN.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.790
IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME IN THOSE DAYS,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.660
"GARY DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.630
YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE YOUR FRIGHTENED?"

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.900
-AND YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY. -YEAH.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.230
MM-HMM, FROM YOURSELF.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.300
I NOT ONLY WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT,

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.840
I WOULD'VE EXPLODED.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.470
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY TELLS SOMETHING TO YOU

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.780
THAT A FRIGHTENED PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.280
CONSIDERS TOO PAINFUL

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.850
OR SHAMEFUL TO LOOK AT,

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.380
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THE MESSENGER.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.950
AND THAT IS THE MESSAGE,

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.150
THAT FEELING OF EMOTIONAL PUSHING AWAY,

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.190
OF RESENTMENT. -WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.360
THAT HITS THE NERVE OF FEAR FOR YOU,

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.100
GENERALLY PEOPLE REACT WITH...ANGER.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.030
ANGER, OR THEY WITHDRAW, OR THEY BECOME WEEPY.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.130
MM-HMM.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.600
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.570
YOU ASKED WHAT KEEPS PEOPLE FROM FOLLOWING THE MOTHER SHIP,

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.170
AND I SAID FEAR.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.510
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.010
IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF THE FEAR IN YOU,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.550
WHICH MEANS THE FRIGHTENED PARTS OF YOUR PERSONALITY,

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.450
WHICH MEANS IF YOU HAVE NOT DEVELOPED

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.650
AN EMOTIONAL AWARENESS

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.650
IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SENSATIONS IN YOUR BODY,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.650
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE CHOICES

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.860
WHICH MEANS CHOICES FOR WHICH YOU ARE WILLING

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.530
TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY,

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.190
YOU'RE ON AUTOMATIC.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.800
YOU'RE JUST ROLLING.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.330
IN FACT, THE BUDDHISTS CALL THAT A WHEEL --

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.730
THE WHEEL OF SAMSARA, OR SUFFERING.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.470
AND YOU KEEP TURNING AROUND AND AROUND.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.500
WHEN SOMEONE OFFENDS YOU, YOU GET ANGRY, YOU SHOUT,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.740
YOU CREATE CONSEQUENCES FROM REACTING UNCONSCIOUSLY.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.080
AND THEN, YOU ENCOUNTER OTHER EXPERIENCES

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.780
THAT GIVE YOU OTHER OPPORTUNITIES,

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.920
AND IF YOU REACT EACH TIME,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.990
YOU CREATE NEGATIVE, PAINFUL EXPERIENCES UNTIL --

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.490
UNTIL YOU DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO BECOME AWARE

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.620
OF THESE FRIGHTENED PARTS OF YOUR PERSONALITY.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:57.660
-THAT'S A WAKE-UP CALL. -AND THEY ARE PAINFUL.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.160
THIS IS A PASSAGE THAT CAUSED,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.330
FOR ME, A MILLION LIGHTBULBS TO TURN ON

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.870
AND REALLY CHANGED --

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.300
NOT JUST CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.840
IT CHANGED THE COURSE OF EVERY SHOW THAT I DID.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.510
ON PAGE 23 --

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.040
THIS IS THE 25-YEAR ANNIVERSARY --

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.840
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S STILL ON PAGE 23,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.140
MAYBE IT IS.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.080
ALL THOSE YEARS, IT WAS ON PAGE 23.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.850
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.120
IN THE OLD BOOK, IT WAS ON PAGE 23.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.750
OKAY, SO PAGE 23,

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.560
YOU SAY,

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.190
"EVERY ACTION, THOUGHT, AND FEELING

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:29.600
IS MOTIVATED BY AN INTENTION.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.130
AND THAT INTENTION

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.170
IS A CAUSE

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.100
THAT EXISTS AS ONE

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.070
WITH AN EFFECT."

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.640
YOU GO ON TO SAY

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.210
THAT YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE CAUSE

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.150
WITHOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE EFFECT.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:53.720
THAT SENTENCE CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.950
I'M GONNA READ IT TO YOU AGAIN.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.390
"EVERY ACTION..."

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.360
'CAUSE THIS IS THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION IN PHYSICS,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.390
YOU ALL KNOW THAT, RIGHT, FROM PHYSICS?

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.530
EVERY ACTION HAS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.170
SO, WHAT GARY INTRODUCED OR GAVE LANGUAGE TO, FOR ME,

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.940
IS THAT NOT ONLY IS THERE THE PHYSICAL LAW

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.240
OF EVERY ACTION CREATING ITS OWN REACTION --

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.180
THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION, PHYSICS.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.650
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT GOES UP IS GONNA COME DOWN.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.180
WHAT GOES OUT

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.720
IS ALWAYS... GOING TO COME BACK.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.590
WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH WHAT GOES UP, COMES DOWN,

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.190
BUT SOME PEOPLE THINK LIKE MAYBE IT WON'T COME BACK.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.520
MAYBE I'LL DIE FIRST.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.260
MAYBE I'LL DIE BEFORE IT COMES BACK.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.400
-[ Chuckling ] AH! -OR MAYBE THEY'LL DIE FIRST.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.700
-THAT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE. -NO, IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.670
THAT'S NEVER WORKED, BUT NOW WE KNOW IT.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.030
WHAT GOES OUT

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.140
IS ALWAYS COMING BACK.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.110
AND EVERY ACTION, THOUGHT, AND FEELING

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.880
IS PRECEDED BY AN INTENTION.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.820
AND THAT INTENTION IS ONE WITH THE EFFECT

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.120
OR THE OUTCOME,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.620
SO YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE CAUSE, OR THE DOING,

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.890
OR THE ACTION

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.630
WITHOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE EFFECT.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.830
AND THE INTENTION IS GOING TO DETERMINE

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.560
WHAT THE EFFECT IS.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.100
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.300
AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE IN SUCH A WAY --

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.540
I DON'T KNOW EVEN IF YOU KNOW THIS --

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.470
AFTER GETTING IT, REALLY GETTING IT --

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.840
I USED TO HAVE THE NEED TO PLEASE

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.540
AND I'D DO EVERYTHING EVERYBODY ELSE WANTED ME TO DO,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.850
SO IT CHANGED ME, PERSONALLY.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.020
I STOPPED DOING THINGS THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.520
I LEARNED THAT THE REASON WHY EVERYBODY KEPT ASKING ME

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.050
IS BECAUSE MY INTENTION WAS TO PLEASE THEM

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.320
AND TO MAKE THEM THINK I WAS NICE.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.560
AND THEY THOUGHT I WAS SO NICE

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.160
THAT THEY ALWAYS CAME BACK AND ASKED ME AGAIN.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.060
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.670
I'D SAY, "I JUST GAVE YOU MONEY. WHAT IS THE DEAL?"

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.600
HE'S LIKE, "'CAUSE YOU'RE SO NICE,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.970
I CAN ASK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN."

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.140
SO, IT CHANGED THAT FOR ME. BUT WHAT IT REALLY CHANGED WAS,

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.880
IT CHANGED THE WAY I OPERATED MY BUSINESS.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.180
SO I HAD EVERY PRODUCER BEFORE PRESENTING,

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.620
'CAUSE I GOT THE FINAL VETO OR "YES" ON EVERY SHOW,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.190
BUT BEFORE THEY WOULD BRING ME THE SHOW,

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.090
I WOULD SAY, "YOU BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOUR INTENTION IS,

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.990
AND I HAVE TO FIND WITHIN THE SHOW

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.700
A REALM OF TRUTH,

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.000
A THREAD OF TRUTH

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.830
THAT I CAN SIT IN EVERY DAY

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.800
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE FALSE MOMENTS."

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:30.110
SO, MY INTENTION HAS TO ALIGN WITH WHAT YOUR INTENTION IS.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.340
I GOT TO FIND THE SPACE IN THERE

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.010
SO THAT I AM NOT DOING SOMETHING

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.250
THAT IS NOT TRUE TO MYSELF.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.850
AND THAT IS WHY WE WERE NUMBER ONE FOR 25 YEARS,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.160
'CAUSE WE INTENTIONALLY,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.230
EVERY DAY...

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.190
WE HAD AN INTENTION FOR EVERY SINGLE --

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.490
AND SOMETIMES, I COULD TELL

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.000
THE PRODUCERS WERE JUST MAKING IT UP.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.830
THEY'D SAY, "BRAD PITT.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.900
IT'S BRAD PITT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.870
IT'S BRAD PITT."

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.870
W-W-WHAT DO YOU WANT? SO, EXPLAIN --

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.510
WHAT I REALIZE IS, THAT EVEN UNTIL THE FINAL SHOWS,

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.010
PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR."

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.310
WHAT, IS INTENTION SAYING THE SAME AS MOTIVATION?

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.020
IS INTENTION WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.190
EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEANT BY "INTENTION."

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.890
YES AND YES, AND I WANT TO EXPLAIN INTENTION

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.390
A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.090
IT IS A MOTIVATION.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.100
IT'S THE REASON FOR DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.730
-YEAH. -IT IS AN ENERGY

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.600
THAT INFUSES THE DEED

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.200
-OR THE WORD NOW. -THAT'S GOOD.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.910
"IT'S THE ENERGY THAT INFUSES THE DEED OR THE WORD."

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.140
-AND -- -IT'S THE THING --

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.740
IT'S THE REAL REASON WHY YOU CAME HERE TODAY.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.780
-PRECISELY! -IT'S THE REAL REASON.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.350
THE REAL REASON, AND IF YOU GO DOWN,

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.620
DRILL DOWN DEEP INTO YOUR INTENTION,

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.220
YOU'LL GET TO A BEDROCK BOTTOM PLACE

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.190
WHERE THERE'S ONLY TWO INTENTIONS --

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.290
LOVE AND FEAR.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.030
SO, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.330
SOMEONE COULD WANT TO BE ON "THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW"

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.400
OR ANYTHING YOU'RE DOING. -YEAH.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.830
BECAUSE THEY WANT EXPOSURE.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.870
BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY. -YEAH.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.140
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.370
THEY WANT TO PROMOTE SOMETHING OR...YEAH.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.210
EXACTLY. OR THEY WANT THEIR MOM

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.450
TO BE PROUD OF THEM, OR SOMETHING.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:20.120
ALL OF THOSE ARE INTENTIONS OF FEAR.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.890
OR, THEY COULD BE ON "THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW"

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.360
OR SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY ON THE STREET,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.690
AND THE INTENTION CAN BE LOVE.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.360
THE INTENTION CAN BE TO CONTRIBUTE.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.830
THE INTENTION CAN BE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN GIVE TO LIFE --

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.130
IN OTHER WORDS, TO GIVE THE GIFTS

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.470
THAT YOU WERE BORN TO GIVE.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.910
AND THEN, LET YOUR INTUITION SHOW YOU

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:45.510
HOW THAT PLAYS OUT IN AN INTERACTION

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.110
WITH SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW OR SOMEONE YOU JUST MET.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.150
SO THESE ARE THE TWO INTENTIONS.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.450
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I JOINED THE MILITARY,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.060
I JOINED IT BECAUSE I FELT SO INSECURE

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.790
AND INADEQUATE ABOUT MYSELF.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.460
I NEEDED JUMP BOOTS,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.490
I NEEDED A COMBAT INFANTRY BADGE,

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.830
I NEEDED JUMP WINGS,

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.300
I NEEDED A BERET,

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.900
I NEEDED A MISSION AND A WEAPON.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.000
MY WEAPONS HAD THE SERIAL NUMBERS TAKEN OFF

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.470
ON SOME OF OUR PATROLS.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.040
MY MISSIONS WERE TOP-SECRET.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.510
AND STILL, I DIDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF ADMIRABLE.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.680
I WANTED OTHER PEOPLE TO CONSIDER ME ADMIRABLE.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.710
-IN OTHER WORDS -- -BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEN.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.280
-I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEN. -YEAH.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.850
I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T REALIZE.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.590
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A LOT OF INTIMACY

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.160
IN A LOT OF SEX.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.020
THERE'S NOT... IN A LOT OF SEX.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.960
BECAUSE I USED TO THINK --

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.030
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THE WOMEN I WAS WITH

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.560
DIDN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.340
BUT WHAT REALLY SHOOK ME WAS WHEN I REALIZED

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.300
THAT I DIDN'T MEAN ANYMORE TO THEM

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.940
THAN THEY MEANT TO ME.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.370
[ CROWD "OOH"s ]

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.380
YES, OOH.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.880
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.710
IT'S JUST KINDA HARD TO PICTURE LAID-BACK GARY

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.880
AS A SEX ADDICT, I GOT TO TELL YOU.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.520
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.660
I'M TRYING TO GET THAT PICTURE IN MY MIND.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.960
-IF YOU THINK THAT'S... -I MEAN LIKE,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.430
ARE YOU DOING SOUL-TALK

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.390
OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THE TIME, YOU KNOW?

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.900
IF YOU THINK THAT'S HARD TO PICTURE,

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.670
IMAGINE HOW IT WOULD'VE BEEN FOR ME

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.770
TO TRY TO PICTURE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.370
YEAH, YEAH.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.870
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.640
ANOTHER LIFE-CHANGING LESSON FOR ME, UM...

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.140
THIS IS THE ONE.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.380
AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS AT THE VERY END OF THE SHOW.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.080
WHEN THE PERSONALITY --

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.680
IF YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING ELSE, THIS IS IT --

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.950
WHEN THE PERSONALITY COMES TO --

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.390
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS WHOLE BOOK IS ABOUT.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.390
-YES. -WHEN THE PERSONALITY COMES

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.030
TO SERVE FULLY THE ENERGY OF ITS SOUL,

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.700
THAT IS AUTHENTIC POWER --

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.030
AUTHENTIC POWER.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.870
SO WILL YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT IS

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.670
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK AUTHENTIC POWER MEANS,

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.470
"I OWN THE ROOM. I'M AUTHENTIC WITH MYSELF.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.710
I GOT THIS, GIRL," YOU KNOW?

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.210
-YEAH. YEAH. -THAT'S RIGHT.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.880
ALL OF THAT IS EXTERNAL POWER. -THAT'S EXTERNAL POWER.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.050
IT'S THE PURSUIT OF EXTERNAL POWER --

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.690
THAT IS THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE AND CONTROL.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.620
-YEAH. -AND WHEN YOU'RE EXPERIENCING

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.490
A FRIGHTENED PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY,

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.290
THAT IS WHAT THAT PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY IS DOING.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.290
-MM-HMM. -IT'S PURSUING EXTERNAL POWER.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.900
IT'S TRYING TO COVER A VERY DEEP PAIN --

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.100
THE PAIN OF POWERLESSNESS,

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.200
THE PAIN OF WANTING TO BELONG AND NOT BELONGING.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.000
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT EXTERNAL POWER.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.440
I MEAN, WE LIVE IN A BOTOX WORLD

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.370
WHERE EVERYBODY'S JUST TRYING TO STAY EXACTLY

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.180
LIKE THEY WERE 20 YEARS AGO.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:33.110
SO, EXTERNAL POWER --

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.050
BEAUTY, WHEN YOU USE YOUR BEAUTY,

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.120
YOUR LOOKS, YOU CAR, YOUR STUFF,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.820
YOUR THINGS -- EXTERNAL POWER.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.950
ALL OF THAT

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:43.950
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS EXTERNAL,

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:45.090
Both: ALL OF THAT.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.760
-AND MORE. -AND MORE, OR COURSE.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.630
AND MORE.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.530
LIEUTENANTS GOT MORE -- LIKE I WAS --

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.300
HAD MORE EXTERNAL POWER THAN A PRIVATE,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.430
LIKE I WAS AT ONE TIME.

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:59.100
BUT A MAJOR HAS GOT MORE, AND A GENERAL'S GOT MORE.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.610
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A BUILDING DOWNTOWN,

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.310
THE PEOPLE WITH THE LEAST EXTERNAL POWER

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.180
ARE IN THE BASEMENT, AND THEY'RE WEARING JEANS

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.680
AND NOBODY SEES THEM.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.150
IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE EXTERNAL POWER,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.550
YOU'RE WORKING ON A HIGHER FLOOR IN THE BUILDING

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.250
AND NOW YOU'RE WEARING A SUIT, MAYBE.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.150
AND THEN IF YOU GO TO A HIGHER FLOOR,

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.990
YOU'RE WEARING A TAILORED SUIT. -RIGHT.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.630
IF YOU GO TO ONE OF THE HIGHEST FLOORS,

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.560
YOU'VE GOT A BIG OFFICE,

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.460
AND YOU DON'T BUY YOUR SUITS,

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.200
NOT EVEN IN SAKS OR NEIMAN'S.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.570
YOU HAVE IT MADE. -YEAH.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.300
AND THEN IF YOU GO AS HIGH AS THAT BUILDING GOES,

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.810
YOU WEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.410
YOU CAN WEAR FLIP-FLOPS TO WORK.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.010
YEAH.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.210
AND THE ORIENTATION IS,

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.680
"I OWN THIS BUILDING."

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.550
AND THE ORIENTATION IS, "I OWN YOU."

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:52.060
THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE OF DEEP POWERLESSNESS.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.730
WE THINK THAT THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.990
HAVE THE MOST POWER.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.570
THEY HAVE THE LEAST POWER. THEY ARE IN THE GRIP...

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.530
IT SURE DOES APPEAR LIKE THEY'VE GOT SOME POWER.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.740
WHEN IT'S YOUR BOSS AND HE'S WRITING YOUR PAYCHECK,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.040
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE'S WEARING,

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.480
STILL FEELS LIKE HE HAS THE POWER.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.040
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.380
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.480
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.880
NO, I KNOW OPRAH.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.390
SHE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL INTERVIEWER

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.590
BECAUSE SHE ASKS QUESTIONS ABOUT EXACTLY

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.420
WHAT NEEDS MOST ELUCIDATION. -YEAH.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.690
SHE CAN SENSE IN AN AUDIENCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SAYING,

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.130
[ Chuckling ] "NO. NO, NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT,"

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.870
AND ASKS EXACTLY THAT QUESTION.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.970
AND FEAR --

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.840
WHEN YOU'RE IN A FRIGHTENED PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY,

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.980
YOU'RE TRYING TO FILL A VACUUM, AND THERE'S NO END TO IT.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.110
IF YOU WERE A SEX ADDICT LIKE I WAS,

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.380
THERE'S NO END TO SEX.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.150
YOU COULD BE COMPLETELY SATISFIED,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.150
AND 30 MINUTES LATER, THINKING ABOUT SEX.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.890
YOU COULD HAVE $17 MILLION A YEAR

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.990
IN DISCRETIONARY INCOME,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.820
OR $152 MILLION,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.360
AND YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT MORE.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.160
THAT'S THE BOTTOMLESS PIT.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.500
THAT IS POWERLESSNESS.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.430
YOU ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FRIGHTENED PARTS

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.700
OF YOUR PERSONALITY. -MM-HMM.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.410
AND AUTHENTIC POWER IS RECOGNIZING THEM.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:20.150
IT'S NOT EASY TO SAY "NO" TO A GLASS OF SCOTCH

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.910
WHEN YOU'RE ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.680
IT'S NOT TO SAY "NO"

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.150
TO A WILLING PARTNER

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.520
WHEN YOU ARE A SEX ADDICT.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.690
IT'S NOT EASY TO SAY "NO" TO THE IMPULSE IN YOU

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.920
THAT WANTS A BIGGER MOUNTAIN BIKE

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.790
OR THE BEST DREADLOCKS DOWN TO YOUR WAIST,

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.130
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.100
IN OTHER WORDS, THE PURSUIT OF EXTERNAL POWER

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.700
DOESN'T HAVE TO DO

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.370
WITH HOW MUCH OF ANYTHING MATERIAL

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.270
YOU HAVE OR YOU DON'T HAVE.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.210
IT MANIFESTS ITSELF...

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:53.410
AS TRYING TO MAKE YOURSELF --

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:55.980
AS TRYING TO ACQUIRE

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.220
THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE AND CONTROL.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.720
SO WHEN YOU'RE A GENERAL,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.320
YOU'RE LIVING IN A WORLD YES-MEN,

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.650
EXCEPT FOR GENERALS.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.190
WHEN YOU'RE A C.E.O.,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.330
YOU'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF YES-PEOPLE.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.730
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO LIVE

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.600
AN AUTHENTICALLY-EMPOWERED LIFE.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.870
IT MEANS YOU ARE LINED UP -- THIS IS HOW I SEE IT.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.770
IT'S WHAT I SAID AT THE END OF "THE OPRAH SHOW"

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.540
EVERY SINGLE DAY, PARTICULARLY AFTER 1989

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.310
AND LINING UP WITH INTENTION.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.910
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.540
I WAS LINED UP

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:32.120
IN EXACTLY THE FLOW OF MY LIFE,

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.850
WHICH IS WHAT I WANT FOR ALL OF YOU --

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.390
TO BE IN EXACT ALIGNMENT,

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.490
SERVING...

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.060
THE ENERGY OF YOUR SOULS.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.830
SO, GARY SAYS,

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.600
"WHEN THE PERSONALITY COMES..."

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.870
TO FULLY SERVE THE ENERGY OF YOUR SOUL.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.300
AND WHEN YOU...

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.840
YOU ARE USING YOUR PERSONALITY, YOUR LITTLE BOAT...

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.570
-PRECISELY. -OKAY. YOU'RE USING

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.940
YOUR LITTLE BOAT TO HONOR,

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.940
TO HARMONIZE WITH,

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.550
TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE MOTHER SHIP.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.780
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.490
YOU'RE USING YOUR LITTLE BOAT,

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.820
YOUR LITTLE PERSONALITY, THE LITTLE YOU,

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.190
TO LINE UP WITH THE MOTHER SHIP.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.830
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE WORK

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.960
TO KNOW WHAT THE MOTHER SHIP REALLY CAME TO DO.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.230
I'D LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE THAT

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.930
BY AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE ME FROM --

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.770
THAT YOU JUST GAVE ALL US FROM YOUR LIFE.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:23.570
YEAH.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.300
WHEN YOU SAW WHAT YOU SAW

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.170
AND YOU SAID, "NO, I'M NOT SAYING 'YES'."

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.940
-YEAH. -"I'M JUST NOT SAYING 'YES'."

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.980
I WAS WITH YOU ONCE WHEN YOU SAID --

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.640
WELL, I WON'T SAY HIS NAME, BUT YOU SAID,

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.810
"I WAS JUST OFFERED..." AND YOU TOLD ME A NAME

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:38.220
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST NAME IN ENTERTAINMENT

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.020
IN THE WORLD.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.090
AND YOU SAID, "NO, I'M NOT HAVING HIM.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:47.660
I DON'T WANT THAT -- I DON'T WANT THAT ON MY SHOW."

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.890
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.330
ABC'S GOT STOCKHOLDERS REMINDING THEM

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.000
AT THE END OF THE QUARTER,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.830
THEY WANT RETURNS. -MM-HMM.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.170
AND YOU'VE GOT A SYNDICATOR

00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.840
SAYING, "I WANT THOSE RATINGS UP.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.610
THEY'VE GOT TO BE UP, OPRAH." -YEP.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.610
AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL OF THAT,

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.040
THERE'S A PART OF YOU THAT DOESN'T WANT TO SAY "NO,"

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.750
AND IT WAS A FRIGHTENED PART OF YOU

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.150
THAT KEPT SAYING, "YES, YES."

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.720
BUT IT WAS AN EMPOWERED,

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.190
IT WAS A LOVING PART OF YOU THAT SAID, "NO."

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.590
AND YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO FIND A COMMON THREAD

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.360
BETWEEN WHAT'S VALUABLE TO YOU AND WHAT YOUR PRODUCERS

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.030
WERE GIVING YOU AS AN INTENTION.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.960
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS LOVE.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.030
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THERE OF VALUE.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.600
THE RATINGS ARE NOT ENOUGH. -MM-HMM.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.840
THE SENSATIONALISM IS NOT ENOUGH.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.410
THE CELEBRITY-DOM IS NOT ENOUGH.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.740
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING --

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.080
THERE'S GOT TO BE AT LEAST A KERNEL...

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.510
A KERNEL OF TRUTH THAT I CAN SIT IN, YEAH.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.550
AND THAT TRUTH IS LOVE.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.920
IT IS SOMETHING TO GIVE, TO GIVE TO PEOPLE.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.050
AND LIKE I MET GRANDMA LIBBY AFTER SHE DIED,

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.660
YOU TOLD YOUR GRANDMA

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.090
WHEN SHE SAID, "LOOK AT THIS, GIRL,"

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.190
AND YOU'RE HANGING UP THE CLOTHES

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.590
OUTSIDE IN MISSISSIPPI,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.060
"YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS SOME DAY."

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.600
AND YOU TOLD HER, "NO, I'M NOT."

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.000
SO YOU KNEW, BUT IT WAS A WHILE LATER

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.700
BEFORE YOU KNEW THAT YOU COULD USE

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.400
WHAT YOU KNEW AND YOUR PERSONALITY

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.840
AND REALLY START COOKING WITH GAS.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.940
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU KNEW INTENTION,

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.780
AND THE INTENTION THAT REALLY PRODUCES RESULTS

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.650
IS THE INTENTION OF LOVE.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.050
THE INTENTION OF LOVE. -YEAH.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.250
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO EVERYBODY,

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.250
IF YOU'RE NOT LINED UP,

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.320
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.390
ONE OF THE THINGS THIS KIND OF GATHERING

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.130
WITH ALL OF THESE LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE,

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.060
ALL OF US SEEKING THE SAME THING,

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.870
THE HIGHER ORDER OF OURSELVES,

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.340
IS TO LINE YOURSELF UP WITH THE MOTHER SHIP.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.670
AND WHEN YOU LINE UP WITH THE MOTHER SHIP,

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:46.310
WHEN YOU START USING YOUR PERSONALITY

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.950
TO SERVE THE GREATER CALLING

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:56.520
THAT YOUR SOUL CAME HERE...FOR,

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.420
NOBODY CAN TOUCH YOU.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.860
NOBODY CAN TOUCH YOU,

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.530
BECAUSE THAT IS

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.000
WHAT AUTHENTIC POWER IS.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.200
THAT'S WHERE --

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.970
THAT'S WHEN YOU ARE YOUR STRONGEST.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:13.970
THAT'S WHEN YOU ARE

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.540
YOUR MOST FORCEFUL AND YOUR BEST.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.640
WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD WHERE EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO BE

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.650
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.450
WE'RE ALL INSTAGRAM-ING. I LOVE INSTAGRAM,

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.420
BUT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE SAME LIP.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.350
EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME LIP AND FOREHEAD.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.590
I LOOK ON TV, EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME FOREHEAD.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.920
NOBODY'S FOREHEAD'S MOVING.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.560
THEY'RE JUST TALKING OUT OF THEIR LIP.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.930
WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING TO LOOK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.370
THE POWER IS USING THE ENERGY

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.100
OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.440
TO SERVE THAT BIG MOTHER SHIP.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.610
AND WHEN YOU CAN DO THAT, YOU ARE UNSTOPPABLE.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.110
AND THAT'S WHY YOU WERE BORN.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.150
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE BORN. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.850
YOU'RE HERE TO LINE UP WITH THAT THING.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.350
SO, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR WORLD TODAY.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.150
I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES. -NOW, CAN I SAY ONE THING?

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.450
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE CLAPPING,

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.190
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN A POWER STRUGGLE WITH SOMEONE,

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.890
REMEMBER THESE WORDS.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.330
THAT'S THE TIME TO CREATE AUTHENTIC POWER.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:08.960
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE FEELING INADEQUATE,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.330
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET OUT OF BED,

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.300
OR YOU WANT TO KILL SOMEONE OR YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF,

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.200
REMEMBER, THAT'S THE TIME TO CREATE AUTHENTIC POWER.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.900
THAT IS THE TIME TO REACH

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.340
FOR THE HEALTHIEST, MOST GROUNDED,

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.810
WHOLESOME PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.410
AND ACT FROM THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.110
'CAUSE AUTHENTIC POWER IS THE ABILITY

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.250
TO DISTINGUISH WITHIN YOURSELF

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.650
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOVE AND FEAR.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.550
AND CHOOSE LOVE NO MATTER

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.620
WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE OF YOU

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.720
OR WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF YOU.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.230
AND THAT'S IT.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.560
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR WORLD TODAY

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.960
AND HOW THE LESSONS FROM THE EVENING'S "SUPER SOUL"

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.270
CAN SPEAK TO TIMES WE'RE LIVING IN.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.300
AND YOU TITLED OUR CONVERSATION TODAY,

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.140
"THE NEW PERCEPTION OF COMMUNITY AND THE SOUL."

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.740
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN,

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.810
THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO STEP

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.480
INTO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A UNIVERSAL HUMAN.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.420
WE ALL KNOW HOW POLARIZED WE ARE IN THE WORLD TODAY.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.850
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST ACCEPTED.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.860
MORE DIVIDED WE ARE THAN EVER, AND WE --

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.690
ACTUALLY, IT FEELS IN SOME PLACES,

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.760
IN PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY, BECOMES SPLINTERED.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.530
AND I KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS FOR US

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:26.240
TO STEP INTO WHAT YOU CALL THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.470
WELL, YOU CAN'T STEP INTO IT.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.870
YOU GOT TO CREATE AUTHENTIC POWER,

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.240
AND THAT WILL LEAD YOU INTO IT.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.580
-MM-HMM. -BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.510
CLEARLY, THAT FROM MY PERCEPTION,

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.920
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD TODAY

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.420
AND SPECIFICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.280
BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.020
WHICH IS ENCOURAGING HATE CRIMES,

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.920
WHICH IS ENCOURAGING DIVISION,

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.190
WHICH IS ENCOURAGING FEAR.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.800
-YEAH. -THAT WE MIGHT --

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.660
WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO THINK THAT'S BECAUSE...

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.870
WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FEAR-BASED LEADERSHIP,

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.370
WHICH IS ONLY GONNA LEAD TO MORE FEAR

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.610
AND MORE FEAR AND CREATE MORE FEAR

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.370
UNLESS WE, THE PEOPLE,

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:06.080
CAN AUTHENTICALLY ALIGN WITH OURSELVES.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.880
Woman:  OPRAH FOR PRESIDENT!

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.680
[ CHUCKLES ] [ CHEERS ]

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.880
NO, THANK YOU.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.390
NO, THANK YOU.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.960
WASN'T TRYING TO GET THAT, BUT...

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.730
THOSE WERE EXACTLY MY SENTIMENTS

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:23.990
ABOUT THREE ELECTIONS AGO.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.460
BUT SHE WASN'T LISTENING. THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT,

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.630
NO, THANK YOU.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.430
BUT WHAT I WANT TO SUGGEST IS THIS.

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:32.070
THERE IS THIS, IN MY PERCEPTION,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.910
MISCONCEPTION THAT IF WE ELECTED SOMEONE ELSE,

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.270
THINGS WOULD CHANGE.

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:41.180
AND I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.110
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURES,

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.780
WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING, AND GOVERNANCE IS ONE OF THEM,

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.120
THEY'RE ALL BASED ON FEAR.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.820
THEY'RE ALL BASED ON FEAR,

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.190
SO OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE --

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.860
REPRESENTATIVE, CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY --

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.560
IS NOT BROKEN.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.830
IT'S PERFECT.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.600
IT'S DOING WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.300
BUT WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.300
IS HARNESS CONFLICTING PURSUITS

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.610
OF EXTERNAL POWER FOR THE COMMON GOOD.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.970
NOW, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE COMMON GOOD

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.240
IS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO OUR REVOLUTION?

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.280
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PURSUIT OF EXTERNAL POWER PRODUCES

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.610
ONLY VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION?

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.250
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:26.490
SO, HOW CAN YOU CHANGE A WORLD THAT'S BUILT ON EXTERNAL POWER?

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.860
YOU CAN TRY TO CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE,

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.390
BUT THAT'S THE PURSUIT OF EXTERNAL POWER.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.930
SO YOU'RE ADDING MORE TO THE WORLD

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.570
OF WHAT THE WORLD IS ALREADY MADE OF.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.400
THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE IT

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.370
IS TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING NEW TO IT.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.480
AND THAT IS AUTHENTIC POWER.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.540
THAT IS LOVE.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.240
IF YOU HATE THOSE WHO HATE,

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.580
YOU STEP INTO THE DARKNESS WITH THEM.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.820
IF YOU HAVE NO COMPASSION

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.250
FOR THOSE THOSE WHO HAVE NO COMPASSION,

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.490
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THEM?

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:00.090
SO, THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THE WORLD

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.130
IS TO CHANGE YOURSELF.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:03.730
SO A LOT OF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.530
YOU HEAR IT, AND YOU LIKE IT.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:08.230
YEAH.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:12.300
THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT RECOGNITION.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.840
BUT IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.410
ONCE THE RECOGNITION COMES TO YOU, LIKE OPRAH,

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.480
IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.910
YOU ARE EACH VEHICLES OF GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION.

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.050
AND THAT FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE INTELLECT

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:27.650
OF FIVE-SENSORY OF LOGIC,

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:31.220
BUT THE HEART UNDERSTANDS IT.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.290
THE HEART UNDERSTANDS IT, AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.030
IT JUST IN THAT ILLUSTRATION OF BABY RYAN,

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.660
FOUR DAYS ON THE EARTH.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.530
LOOK AT WHAT A SOUL --

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:42.700
IT HAD TO BE A LARGE SOUL -- A LITTLE BABY...

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.340
YES, LITTLE BABY RYAN WAS A PERSONALITY.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.310
THAT WAS THE FOUR-POUND ENTITY. -YEAH.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.740
THE SOUL IS HUGE.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.740
-HUGE. -AND...

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.940
-AS IS YOURS. -AS IS YOURS.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.550
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING -- AS IS YOURS.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:59.150
SO, LOOK AT THE IMPACT THAT FOUR DAYS ON EARTH DID.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.250
SO, IF YOU'RE BLAMING OUR PRESIDENT

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.120
OR IF YOU'RE BLAMING OUR ADMINISTRATION

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.690
OR IF YOU'RE BLAMING

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.490
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BIGOTED,

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:12.000
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE IN PAIN...

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.130
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING POWERLESSNESS.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.340
NOW, HOW WILL YOU...

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.340
RESPOND TO THAT?

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:29.010
IF YOU RESPOND WITH THE SAME KIND OF VISCERAL,

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.710
UNAWARE, WHICH MEANS IGNORANT,

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.680
WHICH MEANS UNCONSCIOUS,

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.320
FEAR THAT YOU ARE ENCOUNTERING,

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.950
YOU ARE ADDING MORE OF THAT TO THE WORLD.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:42.730
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO GROW SPIRITUALLY,

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.600
TO CREATE AUTHENTIC POWER.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.560
AND WHEN YOU CHALLENGE TO PART OF YOU

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.500
THAT WANTS TO REACT WITH FEAR,

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.070
THAT'S WHERE THE SPIRITUAL RUBBER

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.840
MEETS THE SPIRITUAL ROAD.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.740
AND YOU CAN HEAR AS MANY TALKS

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.140
AND BE AS INSPIRED AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN BE,

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.110
AND THERE'S VALUE IN ALL OF THAT

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:01.880
IF THE INTENTION BEHIND THE TALK

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.350
OR THE INSPIRATION WAS LOVE.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.780
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.220
YOU'VE GOT TO GO HOME WITH YOUR CHILDREN,

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.550
WITH YOUR HUSBAND, WITH THE PERSON

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:13.390
YOU DON'T GET ALONG WITH OR THE PERSON YOU DO,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.290
AND THEN START TO APPLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.030
CREATING AUTHENTIC POWER,

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.970
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN LOVE AND FEAR IN YOURSELF

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.100
AND CHOOSING LOVE,

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.170
EVEN WHEN THE OTHER PERSON'S WRONG.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.200
EVEN WHEN THE OTHER PERSON'S BRUTAL.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.070
EVEN WHEN THE OTHER PERSON IS A TORTURER,

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.910
YES, YES, YES.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.350
OUR DEAR FRIEND,

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.980
AND YOURS LONG BEFORE MINE,

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.980
MAYA ANGELOU,

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.850
SAID SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS FREQUENTLY.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.290
ONE OF THEM IS, "WE'RE MUCH MORE ALIKE

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:43.990
THAN WE ARE DIFFERENT."

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.620
DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS RACE?

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.960
THERE IS NOT. THERE IS NOT,

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.400
GENETICISTS AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.330
DISCARDED THAT TERM 50 YEARS AGO.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:59.270
THEY'RE ONLY ETHNIC DIFFERENCES.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.540
IN OTHER WORDS, THE DIFFERENCE

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.540
IN THE COLOR OF MY SKIN AND THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.080
IS NO MORE SIGNIFICANT GENETICALLY,

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.280
THAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COLOR OF MY EYES

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.320
AND THE COLOR OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S EYES.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.750
LET THAT SINK IN.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.520
WHEN YOU SAY "BROTHER" AND "SISTER,"

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.820
UNDERSTAND THAT'S REAL.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.060
IF YOU WANT TO USE ANTHROPOLOGISTS AS A SOURCE --

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.500
THERE MAY NOT BE RACE, BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY RACISM.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.930
-THERE IS RACISM. -RACISM.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.730
IT IS ABUNDANT EVERYWHERE --

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:32.470
EVERYWHERE.

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:36.170
AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR KNOW IT.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.140
NO MATTER HOW IT APPEARS OTHERWISE,

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.640
THERE IS RACISM.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.580
SO HOW CAN THERE BE RACISM WITHOUT RACE?

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.850
FEAR.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.280
FEAR OF DIFFERENCES.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.920
-YEP. -FEAR OF DIFFERENCE --

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.750
THAT'S WHAT FORMS COMMUNITY.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.420
AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO HOW WE OPENED THIS TALK.

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.560
-YEAH. -COMMUNITY --

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.090
MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE FIVE-SENSORY

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.730
THINK THAT COMMUNITY IS A GOOD THING.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.300
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER WHO THINK ALIKE,

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.470
BEHAVE ALIKE, TALK ALIKE, ACT ALIKE,

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.970
AND IT GIVES THEM A SHELTER...

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.010
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DON'T,

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:11.440
AND THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.610
AS WE BECOME MULTI-SENSORY,

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.210
WE BEGIN TO SEE SOMETHING SO SHOCKINGLY STOCK-EVIDENT

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.450
THAT WE CAN'T IMAGINE WE DIDN'T SEE IT BEFORE.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.590
COMMUNITIES DO NOT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.320
THEY KEEP THEM APART.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.230
IN OTHER WORDS...

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:34.260
IF YOU'RE ONLY ASSOCIATING WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.800
PEOPLE WHO THREATEN YOU THE LEAST,

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.700
YOU ARE EXCLUDING

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.840
ALMOST ALL OF THE WORLD FROM YOUR COMMUNITY.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.510
SO THINK ABOUT A COMMUNITY THAT DOES NOT EXCLUDE ANYONE.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.420
A COMMUNITY THAT DOES NOT EXCLUDE ANYONE.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.920
THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST COMMUNITY.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.650
NOW, GIVE THAT A CAPITAL "B" AND A CAPITAL "C."

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.590
THAT IS THE BIGGEST COMMUNITY,

00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:03.190
AND THAT'S THE COMMUNITY THAT I STRIVE...

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:06.230
TO BE THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN IN THAT COMMUNITY.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:08.500
THAT IS THE SAME AS BEING A UNIVERSAL HUMAN.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.900
AND I BELIEVE, OPRAH,

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.670
THAT THAT IS THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU SPEAK TO

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:15.910
AND THAT YOU'VE USED TELEVISION SO WELL

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:20.180
AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU DO -- MOVIES, STAGE, "O" MAGAZINE --

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:24.610
IT IS ADDRESSING THE POTENTIAL OF THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.980
OR, TO PUT IT IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY,

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.250
THE BIGGEST COMMUNITY.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:33.390
THE BIGGEST COMMUNITY. THE BIGGEST COMMUNITY.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.030
OUR UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY. WE COULD TALK ALL DAY.

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.460
