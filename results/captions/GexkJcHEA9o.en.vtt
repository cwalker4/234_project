00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:13.126
&gt;&gt; Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.128
WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.461
TONIGHT.

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:17.196
DEMOCRAT PHIL MURPHY

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:17.797
REPLACED CHRIS CHRISTIE

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:18.498
TODAY AS GOVERNOR OF NEW

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.831
JERSEY.

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:19.932
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.135
HE DID WAS CREATE A NEW HIGH

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:23.469
PROFILE STATE AGENCY.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.804
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT'S

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.942
RAMPANT OPIOID ABUSE IN NEW

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:30.777
JERSEY, UNFORTUNATELY.

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:31.978
WON'T BE WORKING TO BOOST

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.613
THAT STATE'S LAGGING ECONOMY

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:33.946
EITHER.

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:36.716
IT WON'T FIX THE BUDGET

00:00:36.717 --> 00:00:38.751
WHICH PERPETUALLY IN DEFICIT

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:41.921
OR FILL SOME OF THOSE

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.456
UBIQUITOUS SHOCK ABSORBERS

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:45.158
WHEN YOU PULL OFF FOR COFFEE

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.225
IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:46.793
FIGHTING CRIME.

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:48.628
IN FACT, DOING JUST THE

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:48.995
OPPOSITE.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:50.630
GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY'S NEW

00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:52.799
STATE TASK FORCE WILL EXIST

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.701
SPECIFICALLY TO SUBVERT AND

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:56.135
UNDERMINE AMERICA'S EXISTING

00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:56.436
LAWS.

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:57.403
THE OFFICE IS CALLED THE

00:00:57.404 --> 00:01:00.273
OFFICE OF IMMIGRANT DEFENSE

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:01.474
PROTECTION IT WILL OFFER

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.142
LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO ILLEGAL

00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:04.811
IMMIGRANTS SO THEY CAN EVADE

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:08.681
RECEIVE THE DRIVERS LICENSES

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.850
AND TAXPAYER FUNDED COLLEGE

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.118
AID THAT GOVERNOR MURPHY

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.453
ALSO WANTS TO GIVE THEM.

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:14.554
SO THE MESSAGE OF ALL OF

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:16.589
THIS COULD NOT BE CLEARER.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.790
GOVERNOR MURPHY'S TOP

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:21.694
PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.663
THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:24.764
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:26.699
TAKE A LOOK AT NEW JERSEY

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.200
CITIES.

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.367
NEARLY ALL OF WHICH ARE

00:01:28.368 --> 00:01:30.136
HURTING BADLY AND HAVE BEEN

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:32.138
FOR GENERATIONS.

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:33.506
CAMDEN ACROSS THE RIVER FROM

00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:34.841
PHILADELPHIA IS ONE OF THE

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:35.775
TOUCHEST PLACES ON THIS CON

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:36.876
CONTINUE INEPT.

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:37.810
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS MORE

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.345
THAN DOUBLE THE NATIONAL

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:39.812
AVERAGE.

00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:41.581
30% OF ITS RESIDENTS LIVE

00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:42.715
BELOW THE POVERTY LINE.

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:44.283
PARTS ARE SO DANGEROUS YOU

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:45.852
WON'T WALK DOWN THE STREET.

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:50.156
GOVERNOR MURPHY HAS NOT

00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:51.524
ANNOUNCED A NEW STATE AGENCY

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:53.392
TO FIX THOSE PLACES.

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:54.827
NO OTHER LIBERAL GOVERNOR IN

00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:56.863
AMERICA IS DOING THAT EITHER

00:01:56.864 --> 00:01:58.197
BECAUSE, LET'S BE HONEST,

00:01:58.198 --> 00:02:00.700
DEMOCRATS HAVE GIVEN UP ON

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:01.200
BLIGHTED AMERICAN

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:01.634
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:02.535
THE SCHOOLS ARE TERRIBLE,

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:03.636
THEY ARE NOT GETTING BETTER.

00:02:03.637 --> 00:02:05.238
THE PEOPLE THERE SHOOT EACH

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:08.775
FAMILIES, DRUG ADDICTION, IT

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.810
IS A TRAGEDY IN SLOW MOTION

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.345
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:13.980
BUT WHERE'S THE ENERGY TO

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.615
TAKE ANY OF IT BETTER TO

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:17.850
HELP OUR FELLOW AMERICANS?

00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:19.385
WELL, IT'S BEEN SIPHONED OFF

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:21.487
TO SERVE A NEW AND MORE

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:25.625
FASHIONABLE CAUSE, ONE NOT

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:26.392
INCIDENTALLY LONG-TERM

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:27.560
ELECTORAL PROSPECTS.

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:28.261
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:29.128
THAT'S THE NEW CAUSE.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.197
AS FOR THE AMERICAN POOR,

00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:31.931
PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:33.533
BEEN HERE FOR 300 YEARS AND

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:34.700
ARE STILL SUFFERING AND

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.402
DYING YOUNG, AS LONG AS

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:37.336
DEMOCRATS TAKE THEIR VOTES

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:38.204
FOR GRANTED, THEY WILL

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:39.672
CONTINUE TO GET LIP SERVICE

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:45.278
THE NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLY AND

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.546
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:47.713
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:51.450
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON,

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:51.851
TUCKER.

00:02:51.852 --> 00:02:52.451
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I CHECKED THE

00:02:52.452 --> 00:02:54.453
NUMBERS IN NEWARK, NEW

00:02:54.454 --> 00:02:55.888
JERSEY ABOUT 12% OF HIGH

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.156
SCHOOLERS ARE ADEQUATE IN

00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:57.957
MATH.

00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.560
IN CAMDEN, AMONG KIDS IN

00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:01.928
GRADES 3 THROUGH 8 IT'S 7%

00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:05.731
WHY WOULDN'T THE INCOMING

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:06.833
GOVERNOR MAKE THAT HIS

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:09.468
PRIORITY AND NOT LEGAL AID

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.236
TO ILLEGAL ALIENS.

00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:11.771
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU ARE UNFAIR IN

00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:12.738
THE PREMISE YOU SAID.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.906
FIRST AND FOREMOST AS IT

00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.178
OUR STATE THAT'S 6% OF OUR

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.579
POPULATION.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.513
SO THEY'RE NOT THE CRIMINALS

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:24.984
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I'M NOT CALLING

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:26.185
THEM CRIMINALS.

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:27.587
WHAT I'M CALLING THEM IS

00:03:27.588 --> 00:03:28.387
NON-AMERICANS WHICH THEY

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:28.654
ARE.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.558
I THINK THEY ARE PROBABLY

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:33.759
MOSTLY NICE PEOPLE.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.194
THE GOVERNMENT HATS DUTY

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.762
FIRST AND FOREMOST TO

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:37.663
PROTECT ITS OWN PEOPLE.

00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:38.531
IN NEW JERSEY I USED TO LIVE

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.603
THAT PA THEY THICK AND

00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:44.337
DANGEROUS AND THE SCHOOLS

00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:44.837
ARE TERRIBLE.

00:03:44.838 --> 00:03:46.806
WHERE IS THE EMPHASIS ON

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:47.106
THAT.

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:47.740
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:49.775
SAY THE SCHOOLS IS TERRIBLE.

00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:51.711
GOVERNOR MURPHY GOING TO

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:54.747
MAKE SCHOOLS FUNDING

00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:55.114
PRIORITY.

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:58.751
CAN YOU PICK SCORE CITIES

00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:01.654
AND TRY TO MAKE --

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:02.388
&gt;&gt; Tucker: IS NEWARK THE

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.325
BIGGEST CITY IN NEW JERSEY

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:07.493
12% OF HIGH SCHOOLERS

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:08.194
ADEQUATE IN MATH.

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:08.895
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:09.228
SUCCESS.

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:11.597
BETTER.

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:12.865
THAT'S ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:13.232
PRIORITY.

00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:14.133
I THOUGHT WE CAME TO TALK

00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:15.268
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT THAT IS

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.736
GOING TO LOOK AFTER THOSE

00:04:16.737 --> 00:04:18.838
WHO ARE REFUGEES, THOSE WHO

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.438
ARE DREAMERS.

00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.341
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:24.210
HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:24.610
INFORMATION.

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:25.544
NO DIFFERENT THAN ADEQUATE

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:26.879
LEGAL SERVICES.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.546
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SO I THINK WE

00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:29.415
WILL BOTH AGREE THAT A

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:30.349
GOVERNMENT'S FIRST JOB IS TO

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.784
TAKE CARE OF ITS OWN

00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:32.752
CITIZENS, THE ONES WHO PUT

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:34.320
IT IN POWER IN THE FIRST

00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:36.389
PLACE, WHOSE VOTES GIVE IT

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.923
LEGITIMACY.

00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:45.298
WILL ILLEGALS HELP NEW

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:45.631
JERSEY.

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:46.599
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SKIPPING AHEAD.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.868
WHEN IT COMES TO IT, WHAT WE

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:49.835
NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:04:49.836 --> 00:04:50.903
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST

00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:51.837
YEAR AND A HALF OR YEAR OF

00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:53.539
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.207
SEEN STATISTICS GO DOWN FROM

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:56.642
A CRIME REPORTING

00:04:56.643 --> 00:04:58.377
PERSPECTIVE AMONG THE LATINO

00:04:58.378 --> 00:04:59.445
POPULATION AS IT RELATES TO

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:04.417
DOWN BY AS MUCH AS 20%.

00:05:04.418 --> 00:05:05.217
WHY IS THAT?

00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:06.852
IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID

00:05:06.853 --> 00:05:07.553
TO REPORT IT.

00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:08.754
IS THAT IN OUR BEST INTEREST

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.890
TO KEEP US SAFE?

00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:12.491
DO YOU THINK THAT CRIMINALS

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:15.561
ARE DISCRIMINATING AND GOING

00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:18.931
AFTER UNDOCUMENTS?

00:05:18.932 --> 00:05:20.866
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WE MAY BE HAVING

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:22.301
PARALLEL CONVERSATIONS.

00:05:22.302 --> 00:05:23.369
OUR GOVERNOR SAID THE PLAN

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.738
IS TO HELP THE CHILDREN HERE

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:27.306
ILLEGALLY GO TO COLLEGE.

00:05:27.307 --> 00:05:28.574
I KNOW WHY IT'S GREAT FOR

00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:29.675
THEM AND WHY THEY ARE HAPPY

00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:35.581
&gt;&gt; OVERALL YOU ARE TAKING

00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:36.749
PEEVES THE COMPONENT WHAT WE

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.817
ARE GOING TO BE TALKING

00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:38.117
ABOUT.

00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:38.884
WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.453
ABOUT DRIVERS LICENSES.

00:05:40.454 --> 00:05:41.854
GUESS WHAT, UNDOCUMENTS

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:42.455
DRIVE ANYWAY.

00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:44.457
ISN'T IT BETTER TO MAKE SURE

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:45.992
THEY TAKE A SAFETY TEST.

00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:48.194
BETTER PREPARED TO DO SO AND

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:49.695
DRIVERS GET INSURANCE.

00:05:49.696 --> 00:05:50.296
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I DON'T KNOW.

00:05:50.297 --> 00:05:51.464
PROBABLY BEST IF THEY LEFT.

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:54.100
SINCE THEY ARE HERE I GET IT

00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.267
SINCE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

00:05:58.105 --> 00:05:59.372
MILLIONS OF

00:05:59.373 --> 00:05:59.972
AFRICAN-AMERICANS,

00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:00.639
AMERICANS, CITIZENS WHO

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.208
DON'T HAVE DRIVERS LICENSES.

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:03.142
WHY IS NEW JERSEY STARTING A

00:06:03.143 --> 00:06:05.111
PROGRAM TO GET THEM DRIVERS
