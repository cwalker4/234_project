00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.870
-The Special Counsel
in the Russia investigation

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.739
revealed that President Trump's
ex-National Security Adviser

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:09.442
has been cooperating
with multiple investigations

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.843
after lying to the FBI.

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.179
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.683
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.186
It has now been two years
since the Trump administration

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.388
first faced questions
about his ties to Russians

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.556
and the firing of

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.457
National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn.

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:28.060
And it's worth remembering
just how many times

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.796
they've changed their story
since then.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.531
All the way back
in January 2017, for example,

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.433
when the Flynn allegations
first emerged,

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.636
Vice President-elect
Mike Pence insisted

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.171
that the campaign
had no contacts with Russians

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.974
of any kind, period.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.542
-Was there any contact
in any way

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.478
between Trump or his associates

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.281
and the Kremlin
or cutouts they had?

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.916
-I -- I joined this campaign
in the summer,

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:55.555
and I can tell you that all the
contact by the Trump campaign

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.723
and associates
was with the American people.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.026
-Did any adviser or anybody
in the Trump campaign

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.295
have any contact
with the Russians

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.397
who were trying
to meddle in the election?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.866
-Oh, of course not.
And I think --

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.703
I think to suggest that
is to give credence

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:15.975
to some of --
of these bizarre rumors

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:18.811
that have
swirled around the candidacy.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.048
-"Bizarre rumors
around the candidacy"?

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.551
Bizarre rumors
were the candidacy.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.585
[ Laughter ]

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.054
Trump campaigned for President

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.623
like a high school sophomore
gossiping at his locker.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.790
[ Laughter ]

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.960
"Did hear Barack
was born in Kenya?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.463
And Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK.
Pass it on.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.031
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.167
And you know, he doesn't
get as much credit for it,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.203
but Mike Pence
is just as slippery of a liar

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.272
as anyone else
in this administration.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.440
The only difference
is that when he lies,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.911
he crinkles his brow
and he uses a solemn tone.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.313
And when Trump lies,
he sweats like a fugitive

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.615
who's being chased
by a pack of police dogs.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.183
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:58.183 --> 00:02:00.319
Just look.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.521
Just look at the differences
in how they lie.

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.891
Both of these statements
were equally untrue,

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.327
and they were both made around
the same time in early 2017.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.530
-I joined this campaign
in the summer,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.366
and I can tell you
that all the contact

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.801
by the Trump campaign
and associates

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.336
was with the American people.

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:18.871
-Well,
I had nothing to do with it.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.272
I have nothing
to do with Russia.

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:23.108
I told you,
I have no deals there.

00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:25.578
-It's like when
the cops separate two suspects

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.114
in a bank heist,
and one of them says,

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.482
"I'd like to speak
to my lawyer,"

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.116
and the other guy's
in the next room, screaming,

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:32.852
"It was all Mike's idea!"

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.320
[ Laughter ]

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.587
Also, why does Trump

00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:39.458
always hold his hands out
like this when he lies?

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.228
It's like he's already
practicing to get handcuffed.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.362
[ Laughter ]

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:46.899
Or to hold up a name slate
for his mug shot.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.901
Seriously,
whenever he does that --

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.070
whenever he does that,
I have the strong urge

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.439
to throw him a basketball.
"Think fast!"

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.809
[ Laughter ]

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.211
So, that was
what they said at first,

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.345
that there were no contacts

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.846
with any Russians of any kind,
period.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.783
Then we found out
that Flynn had secretly spoken

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:04.850
with the Russian ambassador

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.519
about lifting sanctions
on Russia

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.654
and that he lied about it
to the FBI.

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:10.456
A few weeks later,
Trump fired him

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:14.126
while also insisting that Flynn
hadn't done anything wrong.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.229
-Mike Flynn is a fine person.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.532
And I asked for his resignation.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.066
He respectfully gave it.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.235
He didn't have to do that,

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.905
because what he did
wasn't wrong.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:28.441
When I looked
at the information, I said,

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.642
"I don't think
he did anything wrong.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.377
If anything,
he did something right."

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.213
I was not happy with the way
that information was given.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:36.215
You know,
he was just doing his job.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.084
-Then why did you fire him?

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.219
[ Laughter ]

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.120
"Mike, you come in
on time every day,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.721
you make lots of money
for the company,

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:44.089
the guys at corporate love you.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.324
Clean out your desk, bud."

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:46.659
[ Laughter ]

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.661
And if you closed your eyes
and just listened to him,

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.598
you'd think Trump was arguing
with his identical twin.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.566
"He resigned!
But he didn't have to.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.667
He did something wrong.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.302
If anything,
he did something right!"

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.403
[ Laughter ]

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.972
"I can't be mad at you,
identical twin."

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.741
[ Laughter ]

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:02.908
Then, of course, it came out

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:04.176
that almost
everyone around Trump

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:05.611
had secret contacts
with Russians.

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:06.813
Jared Kushner tried to set up

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.448
a secret back channel
with the Kremlin.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.383
Jeff Sessions met
with the Russian ambassador.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.718
Trump's Foreign Policy Adviser
met with Russians in Europe.

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.722
And Stephen Miller moonlights as
Vladimir Putin's shoulder raven.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.524
[ Laughter ]

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.961
Then, after we found that the
President's son Don Jr.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.163
met with Russians offering dirt
on Hillary Clinton

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.899
in the summer of 2016,
the story shifted again.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.735
They stopped saying there was
no contact with Russia

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:30.803
and started insisting

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.805
there was no collusion
with Russia,

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.173
because anyone
would've taken the meeting,

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.075
and besides, nothing came of it.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.843
-For me,
this was opposition research.

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:40.613
They had something -- you know,
maybe concrete evidence

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:41.914
to all the stories
I've been hearing about

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.450
that were probably
underreported for years,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.018
not just during the campaign.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:47.486
So I think
I wanted to hear it out.

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.788
But, really, it went nowhere.

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:52.391
-"This was a meeting to get
information on an opponent,

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.827
totally legal and done
all the time in politics,

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:57.930
and it went nowhere.
I did not know about it."

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.898
-"It was totally legal.
It went nowhere.

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:01.334
I didn't know
anything about it."

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.869
Trump's like a kid who didn't
study for a multiple-choice test

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.605
and fills in all the bubbles.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:07.740
[ Laughter ]

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.442
As a general rule, if you have
three different alibis,

00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:12.678
none of them are true.

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:14.614
If your boss asks you
to take a drug test,

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.682
and you say, "I've never
smoked marijuana in my life.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.584
I didn't inhale.
Weed is legal now,"

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:21.454
get ready to pee in a cup.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:25.024
In fact yesterday,
GOP Senator Chuck Grassley

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.893
was asked why
the President's tweets

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.327
get him in trouble so often,

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.763
and he offered a solution that I
don't really think would work.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.599
-Hey, listen, the President
could solve all of his problems

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.535
if he'd just
show his wife the tweet

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.570
before he punches
the "send" button.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.374
-Oh, come on.
You think he talks to his wife?

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.508
[ Laughter ]

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.877
She's the only person who,
if Trump said

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.847
there were no contacts,
I would believe it.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.849
Also, when I look
at Chuck Grassley,

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.185
I don't exactly think
social-media strategist.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:54.554
I'd think he was
one of those dudes

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.823
eating lunch on that steel beam.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.491
[ Laughter ]

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:01.827
In fact, Grassley
has his own weird tweets

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.162
about the Russia investigation.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.796
After the Don Jr.
meeting surfaced,

00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:07.600
Grassley himself tweeted,
"Dems, don't go berserk

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.735
about Trump assoc talking
with a Russian lawyer

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.169
about Russia adoption policy.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.372
I and a Dem Sen
did same advocacy

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.041
with Russian foreign min."

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.209
Jesus.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.943
[ Laughter ]

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:20.178
Did you type that
during a fistfight

00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:23.048
on top of a moving train?

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:25.217
You think Trump should
show his tweets to his wife?

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:27.286
You need to show yours
to a 1st grader.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.554
[ Laughter ]

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.722
"Yeah, I'm not
a great speller, man,

00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:32.258
but I think this is all wrong."

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.726
[ Laughter ]

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.628
So their story went from there
were no contacts with Russians

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.362
to there was
no collusion with Russians

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:39.065
to we tried to collude
but nothing came of it.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.834
But then, as one Trump associate
after another was indicted

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:44.103
or pled guilty, the Trump team
changed their story again.

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:47.173
Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani,
insisted that Trump himself

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:49.675
couldn't be guilty because he
didn't do the hacking himself.

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.810
-I don't even know if that's a
crime, colluding about Russians.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.179
-Okay.
[ Chuckles ]

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.081
-You start analyzing the crime,
the hacking is the crime.

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.316
The hacking is the crime.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:58.351
-That certainly
is the original problem, yes.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.552
-Well, the president
didn't hack.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:00.586
-Of course not.
That's the original problem.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:01.887
-He didn't pay them
for hacking.

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:03.322
-Of course he didn't
pay for the hacking.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.589
Trump doesn't pay for anything.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:05.791
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.826
If Mueller doesn't take Trump
to federal Court,

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:10.163
Putin might have to take him
to the People's Court

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.264
just to get the money he's owed.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.800
[ Laughter ]

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.367
And then Rudy
just straight up said

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:17.403
that collusion
is not against the law.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.171
-I've been sitting here
looking in this federal code,

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.574
trying to find collusion
as a crime.

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.675
-It's not.
-Collusion is not a crime.

00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.779
-I like the idea that Giuliani's
been looking in the federal code

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.014
trying to find
the word "collusion."

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:30.716
Just because that word
isn't in there,

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.384
doesn't mean it's not a crime.

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:34.854
It's like a public defender's
client who's accused of murder.

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.889
"Good news!
I looked in the federal code,

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.958
and the words "shoved off a
balcony" aren't in there.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.725
So you're home free, baby!"

00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:42.562
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:45.430
Trump, of course,
is also under investigation

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.565
for obstruction of justice

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:48.534
for asking
then-FBI Director James Comey

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.802
to shut down
his investigation of Flynn

00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:52.371
and for signaling to witnesses,

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.606
like his ex-campaign chairman
Paul Manafort

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:56.308
that if they refused
to cooperate with Mueller,

00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:57.442
he'll pardon them.

00:07:57.442 --> 00:07:59.011
And so now Trump's defenders
on Fox News

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.412
are trying out a new argument.

00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:03.782
If he obstructs justice
in public, it can't be a crime.

00:08:03.782 --> 00:08:06.718
-Some critics of the President
said, "Well, this is obviously

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:08.921
him trying to obstruct justice,"
but if that's the case,

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.657
he's obstructing justice
in front of the world.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.958
-Yeah.
-I mean, can you actually

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.560
obstruct justice if you're
not doing it in secret?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.398
-Oh, it can still be a crime
if you do it in public.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.902
For example, no one's ever been
arrested for private urination.

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:29.175
[ Laughter ]

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.642
Now, one of
the potential witnesses

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:32.311
who Trump has expressed
support for on Twitter

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.879
is his former adviser
Roger Stone,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.415
who allegedly had
secret contacts with WikiLeaks,

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.250
along with an associate,
Jerome Corsi,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.219
a longtime right-wing
conspiracy theorist.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:42.755
And Stone responded by claiming
Muller had pressured Corsi

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.123
into making that confession.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.925
-This is really simple.

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:49.629
It shows what happens when
you hotbox a 72-year-old man

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:53.199
for 40 hours, as
the Mueller interrogators did.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.233
-Wait.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:55.835
[ Laughter ]

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.703
They hotboxed him?

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.172
So they put him in a car
and made him smoke weed

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.440
until he confessed?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.276
[ Laughter ]

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:07.313
"You know
what's a funny word to say?

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.314
Putin."

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:11.650
[ Laughter ]

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.651
"Putin."

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:17.055
[ Laughter ]

00:09:17.055 --> 00:09:18.457
"Putin."

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:19.558
[ Laughter ]

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:20.693
In order to believe Trump

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.927
and everyone around him
are innocent,

00:09:21.927 --> 00:09:23.228
you'd have to believe
that they've been lying

00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:25.665
for two years,
because they did nothing wrong.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.366
But the Cohen plea deal
and the Flynn memo

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:28.801
make clear
that Mueller knows they lied,

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.269
and he can prove they lied.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.538
I don't know if Trump will ever
try to fire Muller, but if does,

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.006
even Trump will have to say...

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.541
-He was just doing his job.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.042
-This has been
"A Closer Look."

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:41.047
[ Cheers and applause ]
