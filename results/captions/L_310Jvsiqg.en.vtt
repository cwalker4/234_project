00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:37.646 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT. THEY ARE HIGH-TAX STATES.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.281 line:92%
THEY ARE HIGH-TAX STATES. GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID YOU CAN’T

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:41.350 line:92%

TAXES. SO YOU RUN THAT RISK.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.426 line:92%
SO YOU RUN THAT RISK. BUT THERE’S A COUPLE OTHER

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.460 line:92%
BUT THERE’S A COUPLE OTHER POINTS TO BE MADE.

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.263 line:92%
POINTS TO BE MADE. FIRST, YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE

00:04:54.264 --> 00:04:56.365 line:92%
FIRST, YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE STATE -- WITHOUT THE STATE AND

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.733 line:92%
STATE -- WITHOUT THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION, IT’S KIND

00:04:57.768 --> 00:04:59.935 line:92%
LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION, IT’S KIND OF A FORM OF DOUBLE TAXATION.

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:04.774 line:92%
OF A FORM OF DOUBLE TAXATION. YOU’RE TAXED ONCE BY THE

00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:05.975 line:92%
YOU’RE TAXED ONCE BY THE GOVERNMENT, ONCE BY THE STATE

00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:08.945 line:92%
GOVERNMENT, ONCE BY THE STATE AND YOU DON’T GET ANY CREDIT FOR

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.180 line:92%
AND YOU DON’T GET ANY CREDIT FOR HAVING PAID TO THE STATE.

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:13.983 line:92%
HAVING PAID TO THE STATE. AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS THE

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:15.318 line:92%
AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS THE MOST PROSPEROUS STATES,

00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:18.754 line:92%
MOST PROSPEROUS STATES, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH, ARE

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:20.490 line:92%
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH, ARE DISPROPORTIONATE LOSERS TO HOW

00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:22.025 line:92%
DISPROPORTIONATE LOSERS TO HOW MUCH MONEY IS ALLOCATED.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.160 line:92%
MUCH MONEY IS ALLOCATED. SO THERE’S STILL A BIG TRANSFER

00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.396 line:92%
SO THERE’S STILL A BIG TRANSFER OF FEDERAL INCOME IN EFFECT FROM

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.530 line:92%
OF FEDERAL INCOME IN EFFECT FROM NEW YORK TO PLACES LIKE

00:05:27.564 --> 00:05:29.498 line:92%
NEW YORK TO PLACES LIKE MISSISSIPPI OR ALABAMA AND

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.099 line:92%
MISSISSIPPI OR ALABAMA AND PLACES LOOK THAT.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:32.301 line:92%
PLACES LOOK THAT. SO THERE’S A LOT OF PUTS AND

00:05:32.302 --> 00:05:34.503 line:92%
SO THERE’S A LOT OF PUTS AND TAKES IN OUR FISCAL POLICY AND

00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:36.906 line:92%
TAKES IN OUR FISCAL POLICY AND IN OUR TAX CODE AND I’M NOT SURE

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.208 line:92%
IN OUR TAX CODE AND I’M NOT SURE THAT -- I’M NOT SURE THAT THIS
