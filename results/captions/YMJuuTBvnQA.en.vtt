00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.371
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.106
That's a lot of years
since the last President,

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.575
and we'll be back.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.176
(laughter)

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.514
And thank you to Attorney
General Sessions; thank

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.251
you, Director Wray;
Assistant Director Resch

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:22.489
for hosting me here at the
FBI National Academy to

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.225
address our wonderful
local police and sheriffs

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.526
from all over America.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.594
A very special honor.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.197
And it's an honor to
stand here today with the

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:35.502
incredible men and women
of law enforcement.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.269
Thank you.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.509
(applause)

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.011
We're here to celebrate
your graduation from the

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.946
National Academy
at Quantico.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.884
For over 80 years,
this rigorous and

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.887
world-renowned program has
trained America's most

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.891
dedicated local law
enforcement officers from

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.093
all across the country.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.028
So respected.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:05.465
Let me begin by saying
to each member of the

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.902
graduating class:
Congratulations.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.539
You left home for 11 weeks
to enroll in this program

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.141
because you love your
jobs, you love your

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:20.046
communities, and you
love your country.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.682
Earlier this week, you
completed the harrowing

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.652
6-mile "Yellow
Brick Road."

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:26.953
Just signed that
beautiful brick

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.321
(laughter)

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.358
I just signed that brick -
designed for the Marines

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:35.662
to push even the
toughest to their limit.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:39.566
You endured muddy waters,
barbed-wire fences, icy

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.969
creeks, steep hills, and
so much more, knowing that

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:49.008
your elite training
will help save lives.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.511
The training you received
at Quantico will give you

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:56.282
that extra edge you need
to defuse a threat, to

00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:00.720
disarm a criminal, and to
deliver a child safely to

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.522
her mother's arms.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.658
I am here not only to
congratulate you, but to

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:10.129
honor you for your courage
and for your devotion.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.900
And I want you to know
that with me as your

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.971
President, America's
police will have a true

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.541
friend and loyal champion
in the White House - more

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:26.479
loyal than anyone else
can be, I tell you.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.748
(applause)

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.785
Thank you.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:37.223
Thank you.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.760
I also want to take a
moment to speak to all of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.496
the law enforcement
families here today.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.866
You make tremendous
sacrifices.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:50.603
American families can
sleep soundly at night

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:54.307
because of the burden that
you carry for all of us.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.911
So on behalf of all
Americans, to every law

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.681
enforcement family here
today, and all across the

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.951
nation: Thank you, thank
you, thank you very much.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.586
(applause)

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.297
And you do that under the
most difficult conditions.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:21.301
You very rarely get the
recognition you deserve, I

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.536
can tell you that.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.272
But your families know
what you deserve, and

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.007
ultimately, that's the
most important

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.776
thing, isn't it?

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:33.713
It's not a news story when
our officers save a life,

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.449
rescue a family,
or stop a crime.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.085
It's just another
day on the job.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.788
Yet, no matter the
circumstances, you serve

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:46.259
tirelessly, selflessly,
and heroically.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.863
You do it because you
really believe in doing

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:54.100
your duty and
doing it properly.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.470
Being a police officer is
not just a career,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.371
it's a calling.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.272
And I've seen it.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.642
I have so many friends
that are police officers -

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:04.744
so many people in the FBI.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.480
These are great,
great people.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.849
These are really
heroes for all of us.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.250
So thank you very much.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.520
(applause)

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.829
And as we, as a country,
must do a better job

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.164
showing our police
officers the respect and

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.634
gratitude that
you have earned.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.402
And we will do that.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.939
So when you return home to
your local precincts, I

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.342
want you to deliver a
message to your fellow

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:40.680
officers: The President of
the United States has

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.017
your back 100 percent.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.686
(applause)

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.064
I will fight for you, and
I will never, ever let

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.433
you down - ever.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:05.104
Now, more than ever, we
must support the men

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.373
and women in blue.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:09.976
In the last two years,
America has seen a tragic

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.279
rise in violent crime.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:19.986
In 2015 and 2016, we
witnessed the steepest

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.056
two-year consecutive
increase in murders in

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.858
nearly half a century.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.996
And you look at what's
going on in Chicago.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.032
What the hell is
going on in Chicago?

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:33.700
(laughter)

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.368
What the hell is
happening there?

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:38.204
(applause)

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:46.746
For the second year in a
row, a person was shot in

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:50.516
Chicago every three hours.

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.018
You don't think these
people in this

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.019
room can stop that?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.387
They'd stop that.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.522
They'd stop it.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.092
And just north of our
nation's capital, in

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.561
Baltimore, on average,
someone was murdered

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.297
nearly every day
of this year.

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:07.200
Police departments are
overstretched, they're

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.205
underfunded, and they're
totally underappreciated -

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.306
except by me.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:16.642
(applause)

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:25.384
Instead of holding up our
police as the role models

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.387
and mentors they are, they
have been subjected to

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:33.459
malicious attacks on their
character and integrity.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.663
This anti-police sentiment
is wrong, and it's

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:42.101
dangerous, and we
will not stand for it.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:45.204
Most concerning of all,
we have seen an alarming

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.206
increase in violent
assaults carried

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:49.942
out against our
police officers.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:53.246
Last year, an officer was
assaulted in America, on

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.415
average, every 10 minutes.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:07:00.219
In 2016, more than 140
officers lost their lives

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.822
serving in the
line of duty.

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:06.492
These deaths fill our
hearts with pain

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.427
and with grief.

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:12.532
Every drop of blood
spilled from our men and

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:18.538
women in blue is a wound
inflicted on our nation.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:22.441
And when a brother or
sister in uniform is hurt,

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:27.446
on that day, all of
America bleeds blue.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.318
I want to send a message
today to those who

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:36.355
threaten violence against
our police: We will

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:40.493
protect those
who protect us.

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:44.564
And we believe criminals
who kill police officers

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.400
should get the
death penalty.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.336
(applause)

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.181
One of my first executive
orders as President

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.218
instructed the Department
of Justice to take all

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:09.222
necessary steps and legal
action to protect law

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.758
enforcement from acts of
violence against them.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.561
The Department of Justice
has also announced more

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.198
than $98 million in grant
funding to help your local

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:21.901
police departments hire
desperately

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.303
needed new officers.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:29.375
Also, just as I promised,
we are allowing our local

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:34.247
police to access surplus
military equipment -

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.849
something the previous
administration, for some

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.517
reason, refused to do.

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:39.485
(applause)

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.319
Explain that one.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:46.292
Explain it to me, please.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.228
Never understood that one.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:51.497
Somebody out
there can explain.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.099
Anybody want to stand
up and explain it?

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.267
It'd be tough.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.534
(laughter)

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:58.037
If we want to bring down
violent crime, then we

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:01.540
must stand up
for our police.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.611
All of us gathered here
today share a common goal.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.581
We want every child to be
able to walk safely home

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.018
from school, and we want
every mother and father to

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.987
know their children will
be secure when they

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.956
tuck them in at night.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:20.026
No family should have to
worry about bullets flying

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:22.828
through windows, or gangs
recruiting

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.597
on street corners.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:28.100
Every American child
should be able to grow up

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.037
in a safe community,
surrounded by a loving

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:35.041
family, and preparing
to embark on a bright,

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.443
beautiful future.

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:40.446
As President, my greatest
duty is to protect our

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:44.984
nation and to
protect our people.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.954
As we have witnessed
recently, America

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:51.123
faces grave threats.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:54.660
Terrorists have struck in
the streets and subways of

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.897
New York City twice
in a few months.

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:01.600
Both terrorists came to
our country through the

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.570
dysfunctional immigration
system that we are

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.807
correcting, and rapidly.

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:12.845
And one came through
chain migration - chain

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:15.448
migration; the
other, visa lottery.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.483
They have a lottery.

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:18.417
You pick people.

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.387
Do you think the country
is giving us

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.855
their best people?

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:23.556
No.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:24.223
(laughter)

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:25.424
What kind of a
system is that?

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.727
They come in by lottery.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.363
They give us their worst
people, they put them in a

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.366
bin, but in his hand, when
he's picking them is,

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.967
really, the worst
of the worst.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.003
Congratulations, you're
going to

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.004
the United States.

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:38.637
Okay.

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:40.306
(laughter)

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.642
What a system -
lottery system.

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:48.314
We're calling for Congress
to end chain migration and

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.617
to end the visa lottery
system, and replace it

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:56.088
with a merit-based
system of immigration.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.758
(applause)

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.566
We want a system that puts
the needs of American

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:11.203
families, taxpayers,
and security first.

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:15.041
That is why I have also
directed the federal

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.877
government law enforcement
to work closely with our

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:22.681
state and local police to
destroy criminal cartels

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:26.752
like the savages of MS-13.

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:29.522
(applause)

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:38.097
Already this year, the
Department of Justice has

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:41.767
worked with partners in
Central America to arrest

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:47.540
and charge roughly
4,000 MS-13 members.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.342
And the Department of
Homeland Security has

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:54.313
arrested nearly 800
MS-13 gang members and

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:59.085
associates, an 83 percent
increase from the previous

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.887
year, and we're much
higher this year than

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.355
we were last year.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:06.092
And we'll get rid of them
completely

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.426
very soon, right?

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:10.529
Right?

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.865
They're working hard.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.267
(applause)

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:19.271
Earlier this year, ICE
officers conducted the

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.707
largest crackdown on
criminal gangs in the

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.476
history of our country.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:27.113
In just six weeks, ICE -
these are great people

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.449
too; great people - and
the Border Patrol agents -

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:33.385
great people - and our
law enforcement partners

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:37.890
arrested nearly 1,400
suspects and seized more

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.128
than 200 illegal firearms
and nearly 600

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:47.466
rounds of narcotics -
over 600 pounds.

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.534
That's a lot of stuff.

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:52.438
Recently, prosecutions
of criminal firearm

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.840
possessions were
up 23 percent.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.879
To any member of MS-13
listening, I have a

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:03.482
message for you:
We will find you.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.618
We will arrest you.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.354
We will jail you.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.756
We will throw you the
hell out of the country.

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:11.891
(laughter)

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.693
I mean, somehow, I like
it better than jail.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.162
Jail we have to
take care of them.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.530
Who the hell wants
to take care of them?

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.199
(applause)

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.038
You know the jail stuff is
wonderful but we have to

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.106
pay for it, right?

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.607
(laughter)

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:32.111
But these are killers,
these are people that are

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:33.812
sadists in many cases.

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:34.813
We don't want them.

00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:36.182
We don't want them.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.416
They're getting
out of here.

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:41.520
Our cities should not be
sanctuaries for criminals;

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.256
they should be sanctuaries
for Americans.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:47.993
It is our duty to serve
the hardworking citizens

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:51.397
of our country who raise
our families, cherish our

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:54.200
values, salute our flag,
and make

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.502
this land our home.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:00.105
These are the citizens you
represent, and these are

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:05.010
the citizens you
courageously protect.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.213
By the way, you
are great people.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.281
You are incredible people.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.785
Just so you understand,
you are great people doing

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:13.886
an incredible job.

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:15.387
But I hope your
families know that.

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:17.489
I'd say 90 percent of -

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:18.824
probably 90 percent
agree, right?

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.259
(laughter)

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:22.228
The other 10 percent,
that's not working

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:23.262
out so well.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.897
(laughter)

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:29.168
We heard from one such
hero among us earlier

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:32.671
today, your class
spokesperson, DEA

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:36.175
Officer Craig Wiles.

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:40.479
It is truly amazing to see
Craig's father sitting in

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:43.616
the very seat where Craig
himself sat 40 years ago,

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.818
when he was just
15 years old.

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:47.253
Where is his
father, by the way?

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:48.387
Where is his father?

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.456
Where is your father?

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:51.290
There he is.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:56.895
(applause)

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.372
He's better looking
than you, by the way.

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:07.473
(laughter)

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:10.276
It's a great story though.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.510
It's fantastic.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.544
Thank you for being here.

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:13.646
That's really nice.

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.447
You proud of
your son, right?

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:16.115
Good.

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:17.216
So am I.

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:20.152
That day, Craig watched
his father speak

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.820
at this podium.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.056
When he listened to his
father's words, he was

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:28.260
filled with pride and such
devotion that, at that

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.230
moment, he too decided to
become a

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.300
law enforcement officer.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.467
Terrific.

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:38.771
Today, it's incredible
that his own children have

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:42.374
joined us for this
special moment.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:45.844
His daughter, Ashley, is
carrying on the legacy of

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.980
her father and
grandfather.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.151
She now serves in law
enforcement at the FBI.

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:54.753
His son, Austin,
is in college.

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:57.222
And no matter what he
chooses to do, I think we

00:15:57.222 --> 00:16:00.993
can confidently - and we
really can, with great

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:04.663
confidence - say that,
this, he will always be

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:08.434
better because of his
father's lifelong example

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:12.638
of selflessness and
courage, and of love.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.708
So, thank you, Craig
and your family.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:19.311
It's a terrific story and
really is a great

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.079
honor to be with you.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.347
Thank you very much.

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.116
(applause)

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.690
But as I look out in the
audience today, I see many

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.059
young, bright faces.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:38.063
To them, and to many other
young Americans watching

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:40.265
at home, of which there
are many - you see,

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.600
there's the fake
news back there.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.634
Look, everybody.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.737
(laughter)

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.672
Fake news.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.807
No, actually, some of
them are fine people.

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.309
(laughter)

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.478
About - let's see,
who's back there?

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:53.545
Yeah, about 30 percent.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:55.347
(laughter)

00:16:55.347 --> 00:17:00.152
You are the men and women
who teach them what it

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:02.354
means to be a
police officer.

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.790
You are always
there for us.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:10.062
The men and women in blue,
in the dark of night, in

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:14.600
the rush of danger, you
break down doors, race

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.704
down alleys, chase down
suspects, and

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.839
bring down criminals.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.208
And you do it with
strength and

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:26.412
skill and pride.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.081
There's a reason that your
children look up to you

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:34.686
with their eyes full of
awe and full of wonder.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:39.324
There's a reason that they
rush to the window just to

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:44.696
catch a glimpse of your
sirens flashing by.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:50.636
Because to them, and to
all of us, and to me, you

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:54.440
are the guardians who keep
us safe, who ward off

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:00.145
danger, and who confront
evil so that the good

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:03.449
will always prevail.

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:07.686
You represent the
best of America.

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:11.190
And you leave us with a
debt we can

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.794
never hope to repay.

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:20.132
Today, we honor you, we
thank you, and we know

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:25.070
that by your example, some
of the children here today

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.274
and watching at home will
be inspired to fill your

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:34.947
shoes, to continue your
service, to follow in your

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:41.620
footsteps, and to take the
oath, to carry the badge,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.625
to wear the shield, and to
join the ranks of heroes.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:56.235
Thank you to our police,
thank you to our sheriffs,

00:18:56.235 --> 00:19:03.208
thank you to the FBI,
and thank you to our law

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.444
enforcement families.

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:06.512
God bless you all.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.579
Thank you very much.

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:08.580
(applause)
