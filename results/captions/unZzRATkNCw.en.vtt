00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:11.750
10 More Facts That Sound Like BS, But Are
True (Part 4)

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.080
10.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.860
Chicago Was Once Raised 6 Feet (and no-one
noticed)

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.780
There are some facts that you instinctively
know are BS, even if you’re not sure why.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.250
The idea that someone once managed to make
the city of Chicago levitate 6 feet in the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.680
air without anyone noticing is definitely
one such fact.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.210
For one thing, it’s impossible.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.940
For another, well, just listen to what you’re
saying.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.680
You might as well claim the Moon is made of
cheese.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.640
Well, sorry, but we’re about to completely
mess with your perception of how reality works.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.479
On New Year’s Eve 1855, the Chicago Board
of Sewage Commissioners tasked engineer E.S.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.530
Chesbrough with finding a solution to the
city’s regular cholera outbreaks.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
Chesbrough decided the easiest option would
be to hike the entire city out its swamp,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.799
6 feet into the air.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.539
It was known as the Raising of Chicago, and
it was completely literal.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.049
To get the city out the cholera-infested swamp
it sat on, hundreds of men jacked up the streets

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.810
using massive screws, filled in the space
beneath them, and called the result ‘ground

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.810
level’.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.450
The work carried on for 20 years, and was
often completely mad.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.420
There are stories of whole hotels being hoisted
up into the air, and not a single person inside

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.340
them realizing it was happening.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.500
Nor was it a temporary fix.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.909
The Chicago you see today is the ‘raised’
version.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.840
That’s right: Chicago is still levitating
today, and no-one living there has ever noticed.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840
9.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.770
Irish Traffic Police Accidentally Invented
their own Supervillain

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.731
Not so long ago, the name Prawo Jazdy struck
fear into the hearts of Ireland’s traffic

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:38.731
cops.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:42.740
A Polish immigrant, Mr. Jazdy was also the
most prolific petty-criminal the Garda had

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.740
ever encountered.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.840
Over the course of two short years, he racked
up over 50 speeding tickets in every part

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
of the island.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.700
Stranger still, he’d never been caught.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.799
It gets weirder.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.509
Mr. Jazdy was a master of disguise.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.320
Sometimes he’d be dressed as a middle-aged
man when he was stopped.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.250
Other times he’d be dressed as a young woman.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.909
Irish traffic cops found he’d given them
a different driver’s license every time

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.909
they’d stopped him.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.200
He’d given 50 different home addresses,
and 50 different dates of birth.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.010
Eventually, a special task force was assigned
to catch this international man of mystery.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.040
At which point a native Polish speaker joined
the Garda’s traffic division.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.000
He took one look at Mr. Jazdy’s file and
probably fell down laughing.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.780
Y’see, Prawo Jazdy wasn’t a supervillain.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.880
He wasn’t even a person at all.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.300
Prawo Jazdy is Polish for ‘driver’s license’.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.850
According to the BBC, Ireland’s confused
traffic cops had spent 2 years writing up

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.460
tickets for different Polish drivers under
the assumption that they were all the same

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.460
person.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.510
The mistake was finally discovered in 2009,
to the embarrassment of all.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.510
8.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.410
The State of Maine Has More Black Bears than
Black People

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.770
The northeasternmost state of the US, Maine
is one of the most-rural places in America.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.700
With a population of 1.33 million, it’s
not the emptiest state, but it’s definitely

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.020
kinda lonesome.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.570
It’s also one of the whitest places in the
whole of the States.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.120
How do we know this?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.860
Because according to data from both the state
of Maine and the US Census, Maine has more

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.160
black bears than it has black people.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.820
Seriously, it ain’t even close.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.530
The last US Census recorded roughly 19,000
African-Americans living in Maine.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.450
A couple of years before, the state of Maine
estimated its black bear population at roughly

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.450
36,000.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.630
In other words, there are roughly two black
bears for every single black person in Maine.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.480
That’s a crazy figure, especially if you
grew up in a big city, or in the South, or

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.670
on the West Coast, or, well, anywhere but
Maine.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.750
Nationally, black people make up 13.2% of
the US population.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.660
In Maine, they make up just 1.4%.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.170
By contrast, if black bears were people, they’d
make up 2.7%.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.490
7.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.150
Congress Name-Checks Hitler Seven Times a
Month

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.150
hitler

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.300
Godwin’s Law states that the longer an argument
goes on, the greater the chance of someone

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.300
bringing up Hitler.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.860
It further states that, the minute Hitler
comparisons are invoked, the conversation

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.860
becomes worthless.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.500
Which, when you think about it, is the perfect
way of describing Congress.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.820
Both parties have been engaged in a never-ending
argument for decades now, and both have essentially

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.130
become worthless.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.650
We know this because they just can’t stop
bringing up Hitler.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.060
The nonprofit Sunlight Foundation tracks all
words in the official Congressional record

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.120
for their Capitol Words project.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.370
The database stretches back to 1996, and contains
millions of words.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.590
In 2015, they crunched the numbers for Hitler,
and found Congress name-checked the Nazi dictator

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.470
an average of seven times a month.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.370
Hitler has been compared in Congress to Saddam
Hussein, to global warming, to modern China,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.880
to Gaddafi’s Libya, to Sudan, to Iran, to
ISIS, to the cloning of human beings, to the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.700
American military, and (bizarrely) to the
Founding Fathers.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.760
No other dictator even comes close.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.700
The high point came in 2003, when Hitler was
mentioned 93 times in a single month.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.040
Republicans mention Hitler slightly-more often,
with 57% of mentions to the Dem’s 43%.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.080
But, as the Daily Dot pointed out, no party
has yet been known to mention Godwin’s Law.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080
6.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.880
We Still Have No Idea How Many People Chernobyl
Killed

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.420
On April 26, 1986, the nuclear reactor at
Chernobyl, Ukraine, exploded.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.420
The resulting meltdown killed 31 people more-or-less
instantly, and poisoned millions of square

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.950
miles of land.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.120
At the time, the World Health Organization
estimated the disaster would ultimately cause

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.810
4,000 deaths from radiation-induced cancer.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.139
Over 30 years later, we’re still guessing.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.300
Depending on your source, Chernobyl caused
anywhere from a mere 53 deaths, to over half

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.300
a million.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.560
The trouble is Chernobyl blew radiation over
such a vast area, no one really knows how

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.630
many excess fatal cancers in Europe, Asia
and Africa are due to the accident.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.100
The UN estimates around 16,000.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.960
The Russian Academy of Sciences estimates
up to 200,000.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.930
The Ukraine National Commission for Radiation
Protection calculates 500,000.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.790
And those numbers keep climbing.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.980
One recent high-end estimate pegged the total
number dead at nearly one million.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.080
If true, that would make Chernobyl the deadliest
disaster in human history bar the catastrophic

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.669
China Floods of 1931 (which may have killed
up to 4 million).

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.900
For comparison, the combined atomic bombing
of Nagasaki and Hiroshima killed a maximum

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.010
of 236,000.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.150
That’s right, the screw up of a bunch of
Soviet engineers may yet turn out to be deadlier

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.390
than the bloody endgame of the most-brutal
war in human history.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.390
5.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.690
Nintendo Existed at the Same Time as the Ottoman
Empire

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.360
One is a modern Japanese entertainment company,
best known for a certain, red-suited, Italian

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360
plumber.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.200
The other was a vast Islamic empire founded
in the 14th century, that was ruled by sultans

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.570
and once laid siege to Vienna in Austria.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.480
Both of these things existed at the same time
for thirty three whole years.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.450
The issue here is that Nintendo is way older
than you probably imagine, while the Ottoman

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.970
Empire didn’t fall apart till much later
than you probably think.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.280
The Ottoman Empire only collapsed in 1922
as a result of losing WWI, after the Allies

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.380
had carved up its territory for themselves.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.300
Nintendo, meanwhile, was founded way, way
back in 1889.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.530
At the time, Nintendo was a simple playing
card company, with nary an Italian plumber

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.530
in sight.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.360
That’s probably not surprising, as Italy
had only been a unified state for less than

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.580
2 decades by that point, less than the time
separating us now from the release of Titanic.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.360
Europe was still (mostly) ruled by the Prussians,
Austro-Hungarians, Russians and Ottomans,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.560
and Britain had an empire that stretched all
the way around the world.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.290
Meanwhile, Japan had only just left two and
a half centuries of self-imposed isolation

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.290
35 years beforehand.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.290
4.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.880
The Ocean Contains 20 Million Tons of (unclaimed)
Gold

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.190
Imagine if you discovered a near-limitless
supply of gold sitting right under your nose.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.820
All your worries would be over, right?

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.720
Well, we’ve got some good news and some
bad news for you.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.630
The good is that such a stash of gold really
does exist, likely within easy driving distance.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.139
The bad is that its scattered over the entire
ocean.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.620
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), our planet’s oceans

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.830
contain a staggering 20 million tons of unclaimed
gold.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.560
That’s enough to give every single person
alive today 9 pounds of the stuff… or to

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.060
just hoard it for yourself and become the
richest person on the entire planet.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.200
The trouble, sadly, is getting at it.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.090
Much of the oceans’ gold is distributed
on a very, very fine level.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.610
As in, a single liter of seawater contains
13 billionths of a gram of gold.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.650
There’s just no way of extracting that,
and the stuff that’s concentrated is equally

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.830
hard to get at.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.699
The biggest gold deposits are buried a mile
or two under the sea’s surface, and would

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:28.740
require a massive mining operation to extract.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.060
Still, if you go looking, you might get lucky.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.559
In 2015, the nation of Colombia discovered
$1 billion worth of sunken Spanish gold sitting

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.909
right off the coast of Cartagena.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:39.909
3.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:44.290
The Biggest Quake in History Hit 23 on the
Richter Scale

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.120
If you live in earthquake country, you’ll
know anything above about a 4 on the Richter

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.829
Scale is terrifying.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.199
The 2010 earthquake that leveled Haiti was
a magnitude 7.0.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:57.920
The 1964 earthquake that nearly upended the
whole of Alaska was 9.2.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.410
The largest in modern history was a 9.6 off
the coast of Chile, and that caused 35 foot

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.130
waves 6,200 miles from the epicenter.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.160
But there’s actually an even-bigger earthquake
on record.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.449
It went beyond standard measurements and hit
a devastating 23 on the Richter Scale.

00:09:15.449 --> 00:09:19.129
That estimate comes courtesy of NASA, who
observed the quake in action.

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:23.059
That’s right, thankfully for all life on
Earth, the quake happened millions of lightyears

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:24.600
away, at a star known as SGR J1550-5418.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:33.920
The ‘starquake’ was big enough to destroy
everything in a 10 light year radius.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.860
Starquakes are caused when the crust of a
magnetar – a super, super dense neutron

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.279
star that packs the mass of more than million
Earths into an area the size of Manhattan

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.290
– cracks.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.560
The resulting release of energy is one of
the deadliest events in the universe.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.619
Any nearby planets would be wiped out instantly.

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:55.800
One single, 20 minute quake releases more
energy than our sun does in 20 whole years.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.940
Thank God we haven’t got any in our galactic
neighborhood.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.589
Antechinus Mice are so Sex-obsessed They Literally
Screw Themselves to Death

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:06.970
You might like to think you’ve got going
power in the sack.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.170
You ain’t got nothing on the Antechinus.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.769
A mouse-like marsupial found in Australia,
the male is capable of mating for 14 hours

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:14.769
straight.

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:18.770
In mating season, guy Antechinus’s get so
much action in that they literally screw themselves

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.870
to death.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.300
We don’t mean there’s some crazy biological
mechanism that makes them die after reproducing.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.720
We mean they simply keep going for so long,
and go so hard, that their bodies are destroyed

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.740
by multiple stress injuries and they die of
a failed immune system.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.720
Think about how you get more susceptible to
disease if you’re tired and already injured,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.350
from playing football, say.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.110
Mr. Antechinus gets that times a million.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:45.269
Eventually, his stress levels rise so high
that his immune system cuts out and he dies.

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:49.189
According to National Geographic, this malady
infects every single male Antechinus.

00:10:49.189 --> 00:10:54.029
11 months after birth, they become so desperate
to mate that they wind up screwing for 3 weeks

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.040
solid.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.459
They then die, and a new generation of boys
are raised, who will also grow up to have

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.970
a libido even Ron Jeremy would envy.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:02.970

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.889
You Make History Every Time You Shuffle a
Deck of Cards

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:08.980
Stop reading this for a second, and go find
yourself a deck of cards.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.980
Got it?

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.430
Right, now give that mother a shuffle and
lay the cards in the order they come out.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.100
Congratulations, you’ve just done something
completely unique in the whole of human history.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.519
52 cards may not sound like much, but it creates
an insane number of possible combinations.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:30.440
Highbrow British quiz show QI calculated the
number at 52 factorial, which means 52 times

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.260
51, times 50, times 49… etc.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.959
Written out, it looks like this:

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:35.959
80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000.

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:40.930
That’s a big number, but we’re not even
close to describing just how insanely big.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:46.230
The QI ‘Elves’ phrased it like this: “If
every star in our galaxy had a trillion planets,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.350
each with a trillion people living on them,
and each of these people has a trillion packs

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.510
of cards and somehow they manage to make unique
shuffles 1,000 times per second, and they’d

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:01.050
been doing that since the Big Bang, they’d
only just now be starting to repeat shuffles.”

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.050
So there you have it.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.009
If you wanna make history, don’t cure cancer
or invent a new device or conquer half the

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:07.009
world.

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:09.089
Just grab a pack of cards and get shuffling.

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:28.589
We guarantee the results will be historically
unique.
