00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:02.753
CHILDREN OF HIS CLIENTS.

00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:04.087
NOT ON THEIR MERITS, BUT THROUGH

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:04.388
FRAUD.

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:06.690
&gt;&gt; Melissa: WE ARE JOINED NOW

00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.125
BY PROFESSOR ALAN DERSHOWITZ, OF

00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:09.760
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:11.495
HE'S A PROFESSOR EMERITUS THERE.

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:12.996
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:13.263
US.

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:14.565
JUST EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.167
JUST JOINING US, THIS WILLIAM

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:18.535
SINGER WAS ALLEGEDLY THE LEADER

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:20.137
OF THIS RING AND HE OPERATED

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:20.838
OTHER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, AT

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:21.539
LEAST IN PART.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.476
AS SOMEBODY WHO HELPED THE KID

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:25.076
GET INTO COLLEGE, HE DID

00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:26.912
ADMISSIONS COUNSELING.

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:28.980
HIS APPROACH WAS TWO-PRONGED.

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.715
HE HAD ONE VERY ELABORATE SCHEME

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:33.084
TO HELP KIDS CHEAT ON THE ACT OR

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:35.554
THE S.A.T., WHICH INVOLVED

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:36.721
HAVING THEM SUBMIT A NOTE FROM A

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:38.023
DOCTOR THAT THEY NEEDED EXTRA

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.791
TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD LEARNING

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:40.525
DISABILITIES, THEN HE WOULD GET

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:41.326
SOMEONE IN THE ROOM TO EITHER

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:43.361
TAKE THE TEST OR CHANGE THEIR

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:43.695
ANSWERS.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:47.065
HIS OTHER VENUE WAS TO BRIBE

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.633
COACHES AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.869
TO SAY THAT THEY WERE RECRUITING

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.037
THE CHILD FOR ONE OF THE ATHLETE

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:54.005
SPOTS AND GET THEM IN THAT WAY.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:55.206
THAT COACH WOULD TAKE A BRIBE

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:56.374
AND WHEN THE KID GOT TO SCHOOL

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.110
THEY WOULD EITHER FAKE AN

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:01.046
INJURY, JOIN THE TEAM FOR A

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:03.481
MINUTE AND QUIT, OR JUST SAY

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:04.649
THEY CHANGED THEIR MIND ABOUT

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.884
PLAYING THE SPORT.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:07.519
SOME PEOPLE, THEY SAID, THEY

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.488
ALLEGE IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:11.123
THAT THEY PAID AS MUCH AS

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:11.523
$6 MILLION.

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:14.727
AND THEY PAID THE MONEY TO A

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:15.461
CHARITY, SO EVERYBODY INVOLVED

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:17.563
DEDUCTED THE AMOUNT OF THEIR

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:18.864
BRIBE FROM THEIR TAXES.

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:19.131
WOW!

00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:20.733
WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.201
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:25.104
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS CASE

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:25.471
UNFOLDING?

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:28.707
&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS THE

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:30.876
WORST SCANDAL INVOLVING ELITE

00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:31.677
UNIVERSITIES IN THE HISTORY OF

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:34.279
THE UNITED STATES.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.148
LET THERE BE NO DOUBT ABOUT

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.682
THIS.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:38.751
NOBODY CAN DIMINISH THE

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:39.284
IMPORTANCE OF THIS.

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:41.420
INVOLVING AS IT DOES SOME OF THE

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.722
MAJOR, MAJOR UNIVERSITIES IN THE

00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:44.056
COUNTRY.

00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:45.758
LOOK, EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.725
CHARGED SHOULD BE PRESUMED

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:47.092
INNOCENT.

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:48.160
WE HAVE TO WAIT AND HEAR THE

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:49.128
EVIDENCE.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.732
BUT THIS INVOLVES THE MOST ELITE

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.934
UNIVERSITIES, COACHES, THE

00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:58.504
S.A.T., THE ACT -- THIS IS

00:01:58.505 --> 00:01:59.805
REALLY ONE OF THE GREAT SCANDALS

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.675
OF THE 21ST CENTURY.

00:02:02.676 --> 00:02:05.344
HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK IT IS

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:06.912
JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:08.147
REMEMBER, THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:11.083
THE SUPER, SUPER RICH.

00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:11.750
THE SUPER, SUPER RICH BUY

00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:13.919
BUILDINGS FOR THE UNIVERSITY.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.888
THEY DONATE HUNDREDS AND

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.089
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.590
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.693
THEIR KIDS GETTING IN.

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:22.127
THIS INVOLVES THE VERY RICH.

00:02:22.128 --> 00:02:23.095
THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T QUITE

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:25.364
AFFORD TO GIVE A BUILDING BUT

00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:28.534
CAN AFFORD TO SPEND $5 MILLION

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:28.967
OR $6 MILLION.

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.569
AND ONCE THIS INVESTIGATION IS

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.706
COMPLETE, WE WILL SEE THAT THIS

00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.341
PERSON, SINGER -- IF THE

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:36.041
ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE -- WENT

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:39.678
OVER ANY POSSIBLE LINE AND DID

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:40.679
CLEARLY COMMIT CRIMES.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.716
APPARENTLY HE IS PLEADING GUILT

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:44.049
GUILTY.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.417
IN SOME RESPECTS, THIS IS A

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:45.918
MATTER OF DEGREE.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.222
THAT WE WILL SEE OTHER MANY

00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:53.692
SCANDALS INVOLVING CONTRIBUTIONS

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:55.961
UNIVERSITIES, COACHES WHO ARE

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:56.695
PREPARED TO STRETCH THE RULES.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:59.265
AT BOTTOM, YOU KNOW THE FAULT

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.766
FOR THIS LIES IN THE FACT THAT

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:01.400
WE'VE ABOLISHED GRADES AND

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:02.935
UNIVERSITIES IN MANY PARTS OF

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:03.369
THE COUNTRY.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.371
NOBODY FAILS ANYMORE.

00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:07.506
IF WE WENT BACK TO THE SITUATION

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:08.207
THAT OCCURRED WHEN I STARTED

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.377
TEACHING AT HARVARD, ALMOST 60

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:13.546
YEARS AGO, THIS COULDN'T WORK.

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:15.381
BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WOULD FAIL

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:15.648
OUT.

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.350
IT DIDN'T PAY FOR THEM TO GET

00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.319
INTO COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY WOULD

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.155
MAKE IT THROUGH.

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:23.289
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACADEMIC

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.123
RESOURCES TO MAKE IT.

00:03:24.124 --> 00:03:26.359
BUT TODAY NOBODY FAILS.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.961
TODAY, NOBODY GETS BAD GRADES.

00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:30.697
NOBODY EVEN GETS Cs.

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:32.298
IN MANY UNIVERSITIES THEY HAVE

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:32.799
ABOLISHED GRADES.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.802
SO THERE IS NO WAY OF TESTING

00:03:35.803 --> 00:03:36.736
WHETHER THEY ARE QUALIFIED OR

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:37.670
COMPETENT.

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.273
ONCE THEY GET INTO COLLEGE, MANY

00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:41.841
JUST SAIL THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE

00:03:41.842 --> 00:03:43.443
WAY UNIVERSITIES HAVE DECIDED TO

00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:45.845
TREAT THEIR STUDENTS.

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:48.948
I THINK WE WILL SEE THIS AS THE

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.718
TIP OF A VERY, VERY DEEP

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:52.052
ICEBERG.

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:53.320
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE

00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.890
SPECIAL SLOTS FOR ATHLETES.

00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.492
COLLEGES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:00.927
ABOUT ATHLETICS.

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:02.896
ATHLETICS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:03.296
COLLATERAL.

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:04.764
TODAY KIDS WHO AREN'T QUALIFIED

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:05.932
OR ARE MINIMALLY QUALIFIED GET

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:06.967
IN BECAUSE THEY ARE A GOOD

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:08.468
QUARTERBACK VERY GOOD SOCCER

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.802
PLAYER.

00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.871
THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:14.141
PROBLEM.

00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.109
THIS INVOLVES OVERT CHEATING AND

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.278
PARTICULARLY ON THE S.A.T.S,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.580
BRIBERY.

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:22.316
IT CROSSES THE LINE.

00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:23.850
ONCE THE INVESTIGATION UNFOLDS

00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:25.919
WE WILL SEE THAT THERE IS MORE

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.521
TO THIS BESIDES THE REALLY BAD

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:30.090
GUYS AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM.

00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:31.024
IT'S A CONTINUUM.

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:32.693
&gt;&gt; Melissa: YEAH.

00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:34.428
THIS IS SO ELABORATE, THIS

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:35.095
SCHEME.

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:36.563
BECAUSE HE HAD DEVELOPED

00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:37.531
RELATIONSHIPS, IT SEEMS -- AND

00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:39.299
THEY'VE SAID THIS IN PART, BUT

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.467
IT'S OBVIOUS FROM HOW IT PLAYED

00:04:40.468 --> 00:04:42.970
OUT -- HE HAD ESTABLISHED

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:43.704
RELATIONSHIPS WITH COACHES AT

00:04:43.705 --> 00:04:46.707
MANY DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES WITH

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.876
PEOPLE WHO WORK WITHIN THE

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:49.610
TESTING COMMUNITY AT THE S.A.T.

00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:54.448
AND THE ACT.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.083
IT IS SO ELABORATE, TO HAVE

00:04:56.084 --> 00:04:57.284
CONNECTIONS IN ALL THESE PLACES.

00:04:57.285 --> 00:04:58.886
AND TO FIND PEOPLE IN ALL THESE

00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:01.121
PLACES THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO

00:05:01.122 --> 00:05:02.055
TAKE BRIBES.

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:06.760
IT SEEMS LIKE, INEVITABLY, THE

00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:06.861
RELEASED

00:05:08.563 --> 00:05:09.563
BOY THEY STUMBLED UPON THIS WAS

00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:10.364
A TOTALLY UNRELATED CASE.

00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:12.233
THEY HAD SOMEONE IN THEIR GROUPS

00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:13.767
WHO SAID, "BY THE WAY, I HAVE A

00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:15.102
HUGE SCANDAL YOU DON'T KNOW

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:15.569
ANYTHING ABOUT.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.905
HERE'S A TIP ON IT."

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:18.639
THAT'S HOW THEY GOT STARTED ON

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.174
THIS ROAD.

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:22.209
&gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WAY MANY OF

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.911
THESE HAPPEN.

00:05:23.912 --> 00:05:24.578
&gt;&gt; Melissa: AND CONSPIRACY,

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.515
WHAT DOES THAT -- THIS IS

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:28.315
RACKETEERING, NO?

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:31.152
&gt;&gt; THIS IS RICO.

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:31.585
RACKETEERING.

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:32.286
IT INVOLVES AN ENTERPRISE.

00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:35.056
OBVIOUSLY, THE SINGER COPPING

00:05:35.057 --> 00:05:35.824
DOWN MY COMPANY IS

00:05:36.258 --> 00:05:36.724
THE ENTERPRISE.

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:40.094
THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE THEY

00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:42.063
COMMITTED THESE BRIBES, FRAUD,

00:05:42.064 --> 00:05:42.430
CHEATING.

00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.465
RICO CARRIES A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:44.966
CRIMINAL SENTENCE.

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:46.868
IT ALSO HAS CIVIL LIABILITY.

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:49.203
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THIS THING

00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:49.537
SPREAD.

00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:50.371
QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO RAISE

00:05:50.372 --> 00:05:53.074
WHETHER THE KIDS THAT GOT IN

00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:54.342
SHOULD HAVE THEIR DIPLOMAS

00:05:54.343 --> 00:05:54.709
REVOKED.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.145
WHAT IF THEY GOT AN A+, AND DID

00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:57.912
VERY WELL?

00:05:57.913 --> 00:05:58.713
IT INVOLVES THE COACHES, EACH OF

00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:01.516
WHOM IS PRESUMED INNOCENT.

00:06:01.517 --> 00:06:02.717
SOME OF THEM TOOK THE MONEY FOR

00:06:02.718 --> 00:06:03.951
THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO THIS

00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:04.352
INDICTMENT.

00:06:04.353 --> 00:06:05.119
SOME OF THEM SHARE THE MONEY

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.820
WITH THE UNIVERSITY.

00:06:05.821 --> 00:06:09.023
THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW HIGH UP

00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:10.625
IN THE UNIVERSITY DOES THIS GO,

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:12.260
AND HOW HIGH UP IN THE S.A.T.

00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:14.362
AND ACT DOES THIS GO?

00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:16.197
I HOPE IT DOESN'T BRING ABOUT

00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:17.765
THE RESULT OF ABOLISHING THE

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:19.200
S.A.T. OR ABOLISHING THE ACT.

00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:20.201
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:20.535
MISTAKE.

00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:22.704
IT WOULD MEAN THAT KIDS GET INTO

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:25.940
UNIVERSITIES BASED ON WHO THE

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:26.507
PARENTS ARE, THEIR

00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:27.275
PERSONALITIES, COLLATERAL

00:06:27.276 --> 00:06:29.677
FACTORS LIKE RACE AND OTHER

00:06:29.678 --> 00:06:30.011
ISSUES.

00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:31.379
WE STILL NEED STANDARDIZED

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.946
TESTING.

00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:34.349
BUT NOW WE'VE SEEN THE

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.983
STANDARDIZED TESTING BEING

00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:36.351
CORRUPTED, ITSELF.

00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:38.486
THIS IS A MAJOR, MAJOR SCANDAL

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:40.188
THAT INVOLVES EVERY ASPECT OF

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.556
ADMISSIONS UNIVERSITIES.

00:06:41.557 --> 00:06:43.324
I HOPE I'M RIGHT BY SAYING

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:44.259
HARVARD ISN'T INVOLVED, BECAUSE

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.761
AT LEAST, AT THE MOMENT, THE

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:48.229
UNIVERSITY THAT I TAUGHT AT FOR

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.865
50 YEARS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:51.232
INVOLVED.

00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:52.067
THOUGH THE UNIVERSITY THAT I

00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:55.136
WENT TO, YALE LAW SCHOOL, DOES

00:06:55.137 --> 00:06:55.770
SEEM INVOLVED.

00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:56.771
IT'S JUST A TRAGEDY.

00:06:56.772 --> 00:06:58.707
IT'S A TRAGEDY FOR KIDS WHO

00:06:58.708 --> 00:06:59.941
DIDN'T GET INTO COLLEGE, BECAUSE

00:06:59.942 --> 00:07:01.643
OF THE KIDS CHEATED THEIR WAY

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:02.077
INTO COLLEGE.

00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:04.946
IT'S A TRAGEDY FOR INNOCENT

00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:06.381
PEOPLE AT THESE UNIVERSITIES WHO

00:07:06.382 --> 00:07:07.449
WILL NOT BE SUSPECT.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.751
SO WE HAVE TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT

00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:11.953
THE EVIDENCE AND MAKE SURE THE

00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:12.587
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

00:07:12.588 --> 00:07:14.889
REMAINS, BUT THAT IF THERE IS

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.724
EVIDENCE OF GUILT, THE GUILTY

00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:16.624
ARE PUNISHED.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:17.258
&gt;&gt; Melissa: THE QUESTION

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:18.460
BECOMES A LOT OF THE STUDENTS

00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:20.562
ARE CURRENTLY AT THE SCHOOLS

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:21.529
RIGHT NOW.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.630
WHAT DOES THE UNIVERSITY DECIDE

00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:23.498
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.435
THEY MADE THAT POINT, THAT IT
