00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.440
The internet is a very powerful tool, putting
the knowledge of humanity at our very fingertips.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.560
However, the internet is also a source of
misinformation.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.370
You can hear all sorts of explanations, stated
authoritatively, and with good intentions,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.930
but also utterly and totally wrong.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.010
So, in this video, I thought I’d address
a common one and give a correct explanation

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.310
for why light slows down in water.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.580
Actually, that’s just a catchy title.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.071
I want to tell you why light slows down in
any transparent medium- certainly water, but

00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:45.860
also glass, plastic, and even air.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.890
If you ever took a physics class, you learned
about the index of refraction of a material.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.120
The index of refraction is just a fancy term
for how much light slows down in that material.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.960
The index of refraction, always written as
little n, is a number greater than one.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.990
And the speed of light in a material is just
the speed of light in a vacuum, divided by

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.390
the index of refraction.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.200
I put a table here to give you a sense of
how much light can slow down in common materials.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.789
This slowing down is the reason that objects
look bent when stuck in water.

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.730
It’s because the path that light follows
bends when it enters or exits water.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.700
It’s the reason that you can get pictures
like this one here.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.619
And I should let you know that no physics
teachers were harmed in shooting that photo.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.910
There’s a ton of interesting phenomena I
could show you that arises because of the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.840
index of refraction and the slowing of light,
but I want to focus entirely on the slowing

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840
thing.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.770
So, to do that, let’s look at this animation.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.530
So suppose you have a piece of glass with
index of refraction equal to 1.5.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.140
That means that light will travel at 2/3 the
speed of light in the glass.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.070
If you shoot a laser at the glass, the light
from the laser will travel at the speed of

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.470
light until it hits the surface of the glass.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.510
When it hits the surface of the glass, the
light will slow down to 2/3 its original speed

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.380
and it will change its direction.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.820
Once the light gets to the other side of the
glass, it will emerge from the glass, change

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.879
its direction, and move again at the speed
of light.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.670
That’s what happens.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.569
In addition, the light emerging from the glass
will travel in exactly the same direction-

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.069
well, more precisely, in a path that is parallel
to the direction of the incident light.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.750
The path is offset a smidge to the left, but
the angles are the same.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.799
So that’s what happens.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.630
It’s been tested and there's no debate on
any of that.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.980
So now for the real question.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.319
Why does the light slow down?

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.079
And how can it speed up again when it leaves?

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.750
There are two very common explanations that
you find on the internet and both of them

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.700
are completely wrong.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.780
Let me tell you them first.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.499
The first one makes kind of some sense.

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.709
It’s wrong, remember, but it does make sense.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.200
It's the idea that light scatters off atoms
as it passes through the glass.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.349
The light hits an atom and goes careening
off at an angle, then hits another atom and

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.859
careens off at a different angle.

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.349
Light always travels at the speed of light
between atoms.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.909
That process occurs again and again as the
light passes through the glass, but let’s

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.640
focus on just these two scatters to see how
the explanation goes.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.720
If we take away the atoms, we can see the
important bits.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.599
There is the actual path traveled by the light
in this scenario, which we can compare to

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.769
the straight line path.

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.859
If we straighten out the actual path, we see
that it is longer than the straight line one.

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.629
And, if light travels at the speed of light
in a vacuum between scatters, we see that

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.790
it will take longer that it would take if
it went the straight line distance.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.400
Taking longer is another way of saying effectively
going slower.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.599
And this is how some people explain the effective
slower speed of light in glass.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.400
So how do we know it’s wrong?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.230
Well scattering isn’t a precise process.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.340
Light can scatter in lots of directions.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.440
For instance, it could have scattered like
we see here.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.750
This is a much more serious scatter, with
a much longer path, and consequently, light

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.020
would effectively be much slower if this happened.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.590
Furthermore, there is no way to guarantee
that the light would end up back traveling

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.040
in the original direction.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.250
In fact, if light did what is being claimed,
it wouldn’t follow the path we observe.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.510
Instead, light would come out of glass with
a range of velocities and a range of angles.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.470
This idea just doesn’t work because it doesn’t
make correct predictions.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.100
So, no good.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.170
The second wrong idea is that light is not
scattered, but rather that it is absorbed

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.670
and re-emitted by atoms.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.130
Between atoms, the light travels at the speed
of light in a vacuum.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.380
The amount of time the atom takes to absorb
and emit the light seems to slow the light

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.490
down.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.260
You can see what I mean in this example here.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.020
The speed of the photons while moving is always
the same, but the time taken during the absorption

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.270
and emission makes the solid line take more
time than the dashed one.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.280
This effectively makes light slower.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.250
Now this idea, while sensible, is also wrong.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.850
Let’s see why.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.621
The problem is that when an atom has been
absorbed by a photon, it doesn’t remember

00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.030
where the photon was coming from.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.780
And when it emits a photon, it can do it in
any direction.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.390
So what really would happen in the absorption/emission
case is something more like this.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.530
The photon would be absorbed and reemitted
in a willy-nilly direction.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.700
In the end, the passage of light through the
material would end up looking like this, which,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.970
well, isn’t what we see.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.770
So, if neither of these ideas work, what does?

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.910
First, I should say that these two ideas kind
of have buried deep at the bottom of them

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.820
the idea that light is a particle.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.310
However, the reason that that light slows
down in material is better illustrated if

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.760
one embraces the idea of it being a wave.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.460
There are many properties of a wave, most
importantly, the wavelength.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:33.150
The wave oscillates up and down, with a separation
between peaks and a time between oscillations.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.920
A second important property is what we call
superposition, which is just a fancy way to

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.750
say that you can add them.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.340
And adding them is easy.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.890
You just take the height of the two waves
and add them together.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.530
If the two waves are lined up so the peaks
are at the same place, the result is a single

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.940
wave with a higher peak.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.980
If the wave is lined up so a peak corresponds
to a trough, then the two waves cancel.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.190
And, if one wave has a different wavelength
than the other, you end up with a funny looking

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.190
shape.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.250
That’s just how it works.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.940
It gets more interesting when one wave is
moving at a different speed than the other

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.980
one.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.920
The result is a different wave, but one that
has a different speed than either of the two.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.710
That’s super important, so let’s just
take a careful look at it.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:28.190
If we add the two top waves, which have different
speeds, the bottom wave also moves, but slower.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.170
So let’s get back to light moving through
glass or water.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.640
Remember that light is a wave of electric
fields.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.330
It oscillates with a characteristic wavelength
and frequency.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.560
That wavelength depends on the color of light,
with blue light being about 400 nanometers

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.780
and red light being about 700.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.810
The numbers don’t matter as much as that
you remember that light is changing electric

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.220
fields.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.560
Now of course glass is made of atoms, which
are surrounded by electrons.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.340
Electrons have an electrical charge and that
charge feels a force from the oscillating

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.370
field of light.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.520
Because it feels a force, the electrons move.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.800
But moving electric charges also set up their
own oscillating electric field.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.690
Said simply, the oscillating electric field
of light makes electrons move which make a

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.620
second oscillating electric field.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:27.000
And, if you have two oscillating electric
fields, that's two oscillating waves and you

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.200
can add them together just like we saw before.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.580
The net effect is that the two waves combine
and make a single wave of oscillating electric

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.860
fields.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.579
And that is the wave that moves through matter.

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:46.339
And- and this is important- it moves at a
slower speed than light does in a vacuum.

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:50.249
This also explains something that many people
were confused by.

00:08:50.249 --> 00:08:54.629
Most people were willing to accept that passing
through glass would slow down light.

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:58.610
But they were very puzzled about light speeding
up when it left the glass.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.500
That seemed like it created energy and, well,
that didn’t make any sense.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.459
But now I hope it does.

00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:08.819
Before light hits the glass, it travels at
the speed of light in the vacuum.

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:13.370
When it passes through the glass, the light
causes the electrons to move and generate

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.249
a second wave that adds to the light.

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:20.120
Light still moves at the speed of light in
a vacuum, but the wave from the electrons

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.689
move at a different speed, and the combined
wave moves slower than light would if the

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.560
atoms weren’t there.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.839
Then, when light leaves the glass, there are
no atoms around to make electric fields to

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:36.009
add to light and then light speeds along at
the preferred vacuum speed.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:37.190
So that’s it.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.899
Light effectively travels slower through material
because when it is in material it generates

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:47.420
a second wave that combines with light and
the combined new wave moves slower than the

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.060
familiar speed of light.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.620
Ta da!

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.560
Alright, so tell everyone.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.510
This is something for which you often hear
wrong explanations on the internet.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:02.329
But now you know and that means you’re eligible
for membership in the physics cool kids club.

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.439
Well, that was pretty awesome.

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:07.110
I hope you remembered to like, subscribe and
share.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.160
I always love to find out the underlying answer
for how things work- especially when you often

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.449
find wrong explanations online.

00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:19.220
But, as is often true, the way to find out
the right answer is to learn some physics,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.680
because, well- as I’m sure you'll agree-
physics is everything.
