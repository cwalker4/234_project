00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.310
Well, now that the government shut down, as
over in the IRS appears to be working again,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.980
people are starting to file their taxes, both
Democrats and Republicans alike. And what

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.180
a lot of Trump supporters have found out is
that, oh, they didn't get those republican

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.370
tax cuts like they were promised just 15 months
ago. Now, if you'll remember, Republicans

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.000
told us, an analysts told us in economists
told us that the tax cuts immediately went

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.380
into effect for the, for the top one percent,
right? They, they got their tax cuts immediately.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.040
It was an accent at the end of 2017, they
got the IRS for 2018. The rest of us, we had

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.290
to wait another year. It is really didn't
kick in until we filed our taxes in 2019.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.050
So we weren't going to get our paychecks,
you know, blowing up immediately. Had to wait

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.320
until the next year. Well, now that people
are filing their taxes and still collecting

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.370
paychecks, they've realized that they were
swindled and Trump voters, Trump supporters

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.900
are absolutely pissed off.
And taking to twitter to share their horror

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.390
stories about filing their taxes this year.
A raw stories done a phenomenal job of kind

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.190
of cataloging a lot of these tweets. So I'm
going to go through. I'm and read just a couple

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.290
here. Uh, let's start with this one from a
a dentist. Jordan says, I am a Republican

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.940
voter. I just did our taxes. The GOP tax bill
costs my family thousands of dollars this

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.830
year on our return due to changes thereby
hitting us with the largest tax increase of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.900
our lives. We are middle class homeowners,
homeowners. And you raised our taxes. Infuriating.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.800
Here's another one, says I have to pay $2,000
more in taxes this year. What happened? I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.020
voted for you. I thought you were fixing this.
Not making it worse. I thought I would get

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.440
money back this year. There's another one.
Nyc Girl voted for you. Family. Have two hard

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.110
working.
New York cops did taxes for years. We would

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.160
pay more and get a refund at the end of the
year to help pay debt. FIRSt Time in 30 years,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.980
we had to pay more in federal taxes. I'm disgusted.
Another one here from Joel Services at Potus.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.330
Thank you for screwing the middleclass with
your tax reform. I have never in my life.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.269
I'm 49 years old. Had to pay into the IRS
until this year. We have a combined income

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.081
of $150,000. The middleclass voted for you.
I will not make the same mistake twice. The

00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:22.349
list goes on. I mean this. You can read more.
Just follow the link in. The description is

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.370
video, but there's so many of them and now
I've said in the past I'm going to stop showing

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.141
sympathy for Trump voters voters. But listen,
this, I get, okay, this, I understand. Not

00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.640
that I didn't understand the others, but,
but I do have sympathy on this particular

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.419
issue.
These people bought into the lie that Republicans

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.409
were going to give us trickledown economics
and trickle down economics on this, you know,

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.989
fourth, fifth try. Whatever it was was totally
going to work this time. Well, it didn't,

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.819
you know, you should have known better on
that part, but here's what they didn't realize

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.950
and this is why so many people are paying
more in taxes, is that we had to give the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.640
top one percent, you know, everything they
wanted and the middle class we were going

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360
to get a tax cut, right? Our taxes, we're
going to go down slightly, but what they did

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.279
to make up for that was they got rid of a
lot of our middleclass deductions, so things

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:17.859
in the past that we were able to write off
and take a big chunk off of our tax bill.

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.090
We can't do that anymore.
The that didn't happen for the top one percent,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.459
but it happened for us among the changes by
the way, is that teachers can no longer write

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.950
off the total amount that they spend out of
pocket to buy supplies for their classroom.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.859
And if I seem pissed off about that, I am.
I am married to a teacher who spends at least

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.569
$100 every month of the year out of her pocket
to buy stuff for her classroom. We don't get

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.349
to write that crap off anymore. I have not
yet filed my taxes, but like everyone else

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.830
in this twitter thread here, I am also likely
going to end up paying more. I did not get

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.849
a reduction in any of my paychecks for the
last 14 months showing that I got a tax cut.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.719
In fact, because insurance prices when up
again at the start of the year as they always

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.659
do, my paychecks are technically less right
now than they were one year ago.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.500
I'm with you on this folks, except I wasn't
full hearty enough to vote for Donald Trump.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.990
I knew better, but I also knew better than
to not believe the Republicans when they tell

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.280
us anything about taxes because they're liars,
but here's the great thing. These people get

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.400
it now and so many more, so many more than
just what's in this twitter thread. They understand

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.450
it, they get it, and hopefully they will never
make the same mistake twice as this one. Twitter

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.729
users said, this is what Republicans do. They
pull you in with these lofty promises and

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.490
then screw you over every chance they get.
They have been proving this for decades, and

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.400
finally, finally, some of these people are
starting to open their eyes and realize that

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.639
the Republican Party is nothing more than
a party of Donald Trump's just con men as

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:18.860
far as the eye

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:29.669
can see.
