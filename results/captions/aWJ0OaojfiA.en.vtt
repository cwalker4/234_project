00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.300
College in America: it's four years
of all nighters, keg stands, ethnically

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.980
diverse welcome brochures, Pinterest
perfect dorm rooms and crushing

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.414
student debt.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.749
I have $69,812, $47,000, 
$90,000, $35,000, $350,000,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.070
$60,000 worth of student loans. My
minimum student loan payment is $1,000

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.633
a month.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.470
It should take me about 10 years to
pay that back, I will be roughly 36,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
45-years-old, I don't know how old I'll
be when I pay that off. I was

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.179
actually on campus at Penn State and I
saw that I had so much to pay and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.130
it just was overwhelming. I didn't know how
to do it, I never saw a number

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.560
that big. I just went to school for
a few months found out that it was not

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.418
what I wanted at all, and now
I have this forty thousand extra dollars

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.596
that I have to pay and nothing really
to show for it. If I wasn't paying

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.810
this student debt, oh my God, I would
just invest all of my money. It feels

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.290
like I will have a roommate for the
rest of my life because my debt is so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.360
much. You can't point at someone
and say, this person made your student

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.690
debt load so much more, it's the
whole system. So why is college so

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:30.470
expensive, and is it worth it? Higher
education today is made up of three

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.820
main sectors. They all bring in money
from tuition but where they get the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.242
rest of their revenue varies.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.630
Public schools are your state schools
like SUNY or Iowa state. They get

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.800
money from the government. Private
for-profit schools like the University

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.510
of Phoenix or Capella University
get money from shareholders. And private

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.770
non-profits are those like Yale an
American University, they get a lot of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.988
their money from donors. More on
that later. But choosing a college hasn't

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.602
always been so complicated. In
1636, America's first college was founded.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.088
You might have heard
of it before, Harvard University

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.750
For hundreds of years college in America
was a pretty exclusive club to get

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.670
into. But we've come a long
way from Harvard's first graduating class of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.120
just nine men in 1642. In
2018 more than three million Americans were

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.568
expected to receive a college degree.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.180
The demographics of American
higher education have been utterly

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.014
transformed.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.360
In 1944 the G.I. bill was signed
into law giving veterans money to attend

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.846
school.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.399
The G.I. Bill of Rights looks
after the money end too. That's right.

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.845
Tuition is taken care of. Funds
are provided for laboratory fees, books,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.543
supplies and equipment are included.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.640
Just a few years later, nearly
half of Americans enrolled in college were

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.839
veterans.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.000
You cannot underestimate the G.I.
Bill. This educated an entire generation

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.550
of men and some women too. And
it opened the doors people who hadn't even

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.350
thought that they might go to
college. The G.I. Bill changed what American

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.044
families could aspire to.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.040
But not everyone was able to take
full advantage of the bill's benefits. It

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.970
was significantly harder for women and
people of color to get the tuition

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.690
money and enroll in college
because of the widespread discrimination by

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.305
both schools and banks.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.545
Dateline Russia 1957.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.902
In a moment the story. In the
50s a little beach ball sized satellite

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.570
launched into space by the Soviet Union
had a big impact on the American

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.002
education system.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.080
The first Sputnik. People were worried
about this clash between the Soviet

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.610
Union and the United States. And
suddenly it was popular to study science

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.599
and math. It was patriotic.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.135
In the 60s the civil rights movement
helped push the doors open even wider

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.800
to give women and people of
color access to higher education. In those

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.400
years students at University of
California schools paid less than a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.648
thousand dollars in registration fees. No
tuition if you were a resident.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.888
But with the 70s
came the taxpayer revolt.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.452
If you want something you pay for it.
Don't expect me to pay for it. It's

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.638
your problem not mine. And so
what happened was the student loan process

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.331
exploded. And then came the
U.S. News and World Report.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.855
It was one of the luckiest
or most ingenious publishing decisions ever.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.120
In 1983 U.S. News and World
Report published a list of America's Best

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.278
Colleges. It became a highly data
driven ranking. Every one of the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.330
criteria that U.S. News used
depended on name recognition, traditional

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.752
quality, prestige and most of all
wealth. Rankings played a big thing for

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.070
me.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:00.925
I was an athlete and
so I was pretty competitive.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.890
There have been a ton of new lists
since the 1983 ranking but the U.S. News

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.900
and World Report still reigns king.
And colleges keep a pretty close eye

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.290
on it.

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:17.420
If you ask them they will say they
pay no attention to it. But within the

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:20.810
conference rooms of the admissions
office and provost offices across the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.370
land, I can assure you they
pay very close attention to it.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:30.620
One thing they're paying attention to
are their test score averages. By the

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.270
90s, colleges started boosting base tuition
and using the extra money to

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.560
give merit based scholarships to kids
who tested well. The chief data

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.240
strategist at U.S. News and World
Report downplayed test scores as a major

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.140
factor in their ranking, saying it's
less than eight percent of the

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.190
methodology today. And that "We've
seen schools perform best in the

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.390
rankings if they emphasize and
perform strongly in student outcome areas

00:05:56.384 --> 00:06:01.040
like graduation and retention rates.
He also said they further decrease

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.710
the weight of SAT and ACT scores.
Tuition costs at both public and private

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.520
colleges have doubled since the late
80s, even when you account for

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.010
inflation. Even so, more Americans
are getting college degrees. But state

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.980
funding for public universities has taken
a hit. States spent less on

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.980
higher education in 2017 than they
did in 2008 before the recession. And

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.450
that means students are spending more.
The tuition they're paying is a big

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.790
moneymaker for colleges. 2017 was the
first year ever that most state

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.660
schools got more money from tuition
than they did from government funding.

00:06:41.654 --> 00:06:44.600
If you're sitting in the state
legislature and you're looking for money,

00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:48.750
the university system is one of
your biggest costs. So when you realize

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.230
well we cut them 2 percent last
year, they didn't go out of business.

00:06:51.217 --> 00:06:55.640
Let's cut them another 2 percent. What
happens is you pass the buck. It

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.030
goes from the
taxpayer to the student.

00:06:58.993 --> 00:07:04.040
The average student graduates with
about $37,000 in student debt

00:07:03.998 --> 00:07:08.300
altogether. The U.S. has
$1.5 trillion dollars of it.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.570
I had this mindset that I was gonna
go to college undergrad and then I was

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.600
gonna go to grad school and get my
PhD. I thought that I would get through

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.430
it and then come out on the other side
with a job and then be able to pay

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.777
it off. But that did
not go according to plan.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.080
Rachel Brandt got her undergraduate degrees
in math and economics from Iowa

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.162
State. Then she moved to New
York to pursue her master's in economics.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.230
She left grad school after her
first semester to better cope with mental

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.850
health issues she was going through.

00:07:47.838 --> 00:07:51.630
I thought that I would just withdraw
and be fine. But then a couple of

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.170
weeks after I withdrew, I got an
email from the school saying that I owed

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.290
them $6,000 right away. And that was
rough. So I didn't know how I was

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.344
going to pay that.
And that was very stressful.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:12.040
Three, four, five, six,

00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:18.460
seven different student loans that all
have to be paid with different

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.790
interest rates.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:28.147
The number just keeps going up. I
will be paying $867 in rent a month

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.540
and that's about how much I'm going to
have to be paying in loans. I look

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.425
at my bank account every
day and it's very scary.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.090
Rachel is far from the only one
not to finish a degree she started. Only

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:48.660
about 57 percent of undergrads complete
their degree within six years. One

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.680
option students turn to for a
more flexible and at times more affordable

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.630
path to a degree are for-profit
colleges like University of Phoenix or

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:04.110
DeVry University. The industry has been
in flux, but today a little more

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.707
than 900,000 students attend for-profit colleges
in the U.S., many of whom

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.165
use federal loans to
help cover the cost.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.170
I feel like I want to do
something practical that would that would clearly

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.520
lead to a specific job. The Art
Institute of New York City was suggested

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.490
to me. Now, I really regret that it
was because it turned out to be a

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.700
terrible financial experience.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.760
Despite for-profits being just a small
fraction of all colleges in the

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.290
U.S., for-profit students default on their
student debt at a much higher

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.576
rate.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.750
Chyna is a first generation college
student from New York who studied web

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.830
design and interactive media at the Art
Institute of New York City when it

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.167
was run as a for-profit.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.880
I withdrew from the school, that
was something could have entirely taught

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.240
myself using tutorials.

00:09:54.217 --> 00:10:01.050
For-profit schools date all the way
back to colonial times. Not everyone

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.190
could attend institutions like Harvard,
so entrepreneurs saw a business

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.390
opportunity and began teaching reading, writing
and trade skills *** for a

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.130
fee. Benjamin Franklin was a big
fan of for-profit schools and the

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:20.500
practical skills they offered. In
1994, University of Phoenix's parent

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.050
company Apollo Education Group went public
and laid the groundwork for the

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.610
for-profit education
corporations of today.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.190
But this big business approach
to education hasn't come without

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.616
controversy.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.930
With so much money on the line many
turn to the schools that show the best

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.860
numbers, the best chances at a new
job when you graduate. But can you

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.492
believe what some of those
for profit colleges tell you?

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:49.810
When I went there for the so-called
tour it was it was basically a sales

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.480
pitch.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:56.740
That should have been a red flag but
it wasn't because I was 18, not having

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.870
parents who completed college, you
know, being a first generation student

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.810
it's like I
didn't have the discernment

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.100
to just leave those kind of
schools alone. The Art Institute did not

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.320
respond to a request for comment.
However the director of Cato's Center

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.300
for Educational Freedom defended
the for-profit system, saying non-profits

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.140
make a lot of money too.
They just distribute it differently. He

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.790
said traditional colleges often use it
to "make the lives of people

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.320
working in them more comfortable."
He also said everyone in higher

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.820
education is almost certainly seeking
profit and there is little evidence

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.540
that people in for profit schools
are less focused on students best

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.340
interest. Since Chyna left, the Art
Institute of New York City along with

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.490
43 other Art
Institute campuses shut down.

00:11:48.486 --> 00:11:53.480
There are a number of
lawsuits against various campuses. However Chyna's

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.520
not able to qualify for loan
forgiveness because she left the college just

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.590
before the cutoff date. And she
feels trapped. Since she hasn't paid off

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.460
her student loans in full, she's not
able to get her transcript, which she

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.900
needs that to apply to state schools.
So for now she's enrolled in another

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.340
for-profit school in the hopes of using
the degree to apply to a master's

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.399
program at a state school.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.340
I feel like all these for-profit
schools they prey on people who are

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.050
already who come from low
income backgrounds. Enter the non-profits.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.160
Amari Lilton is from St. Louis but
went to undergrad at a private college

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.440
in Chicago. Now she works at an
advertising agency in New York City and is

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.838
paying off her more
than $40,000 in student debt.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.040
You want to have the college
dream without the student debt, because you're

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.320
just coming into something and you
feel like I'm gonna have all this

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.010
independence I'll be able to pick
my own classes I'll have this freedom

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.317
I've never had before. So you want
to go to the coolest place you can.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.900
Every college wants to be the best.
They want to compete with the next

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.830
college. They want to attract the
top students. That means they have to

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.685
have the best facilities they
have to build new buildings.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.550
And remember tuition discounting? While
the sticker price of non-profit

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:18.230
colleges are rising, so is the tuition
discount rate. The price you see on

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.650
a college website is higher than
what many students end up actually

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.670
paying. You would think that most of
the money is going to the cost of

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.900
running the school, but nearly
half of undergrad tuition at non-profits

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.310
goes to help other people pay
for their schooling. Amari didn't pay the

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.330
full price of tuition at her
private college but she's still facing more

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.476
debt than she was expecting.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.240
I just cried. Yeah I just cried because I
had no clue how I was going to do

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.509
it. I dream about it.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.860
It's always on my mind. If I'm like
going out to lunch and I'll just say,

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.600
oh my God I hope this goes through
because I know they just took my money

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.930
out. I just hope, I hope. I want
to double my payments by the end of this

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:03.620
year so $2,000 a month. My goal is to
not go into my 30s with debt. If I

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.820
go to Wells Fargo and say like
I want a portfolio with all my best

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.110
investments help me out, they won't
take me seriously because I have $250

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.964
in the bank.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.810
So where do we go from here? I've
been studying this for a long time and

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.550
advocating for reform and this is
the hardest type of problem to fix

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.226
because

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.935
it's structural. It's all of
us. It's the whole market.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.840
Jarrett Freeman ran for New York State
Senate in 2016 when he was just 26

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.240
years old. I declare my candidacy for
New York State Senate. And a big

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.923
part of his platform
was education and student debt.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:50.300
I was actually on campus and I saw that
I had so much to pay and it just

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.100
was overwhelming. I didn't
know how to do it.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.180
I never saw a number that big.
Americans are becoming less convinced that a

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.370
college degree is worth it. In 2013,
53 percent of people thought a four

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.948
year degree was worth it. In 2017
only 49 percent of people thought so.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.630
I think that it's so ingrained in your
head that you have to go to college,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:17.300
that college is the next step after
graduation. I think in hindsight I see

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.819
that college is not for everyone.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:25.941
Overall I feel a little jaded about
college being worth it for everyone, or

00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:29.337
at least for students
directly out of high school.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.830
Knowing what I know now, I would have
even taken a few years off before I

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:39.110
went to college. There is this
idea that 18-year-olds are supposed to know

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.680
what they want in life. And now
that I'm turning 25 tomorrow, I still

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.800
don't know exactly what's going on.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.060
That mindset could be a problem
for the future job market. It's expected

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:55.220
that by 2020, 65 percent of jobs
in the U.S. will require people to have

00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:00.140
some college education to even be considered.
So there are a lot of jobs

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.860
that require you to spend some money
on school before they'll pay you to

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.350
work. In many cases that
sum is a lot of money.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.790
Student debt is a national crisis.
Unfortunately we don't have bills on the

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.330
floor that are
actually addressing that.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.990
The reality is there probably isn't
just one solution that's going to solve

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.560
everything. It will take a
lot of different approaches, and different

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.850
approaches are being tested across
America. One of the proposed solutions

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.398
is an income share agreement.
Essentially, instead of taking out loans,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.370
students could agree to repay an
investor a percentage of their income for

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.240
a set amount of years after
they graduate. The idea has support from

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.840
politicians on both sides of the
aisle and some schools are starting to

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.160
test it out. In New York
City, Governor Cuomo implemented a program that

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.210
gives middle-class residents free tuition
at select state schools. And

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.600
some billionaires like Bill Gates are
giving their own money to try and

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.328
fix the system. And of course
there's the idea to offer free college.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.540
I do not agree with free college.
I think that when you give someone

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.220
something for free they do not realize
the value of it, and that's just my

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.467
opinion, and I think that there
should be some cost associated with it.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.480
Free college is a great idea. I
am fully supportive of free college. The

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.047
catch is: who's going
to pay the bill?

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.440
In other countries taxpayers foot most
of the bill. So instead of paying

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.940
student loans later in life, you're
paying higher taxes. Roughly two dozen

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.720
countries across the world provide free
or almost free college to its

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.945
citizens.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.240
The solution probably won't be that
simple in the U.S. But with student

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.020
debt rising and the need for
a college degree becoming more and more

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.670
important, the future of American
education depends on figuring this out.
