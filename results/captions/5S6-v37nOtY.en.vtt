00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.730
Let me tell you the story of how one man accidentally
gave us the obesity epidemic, kept cardiovascular

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.769
disease growing, made billions for the pharmaceutical
industry and programmed us to be afraid of

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.009
fat and cholesterol.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.610
All the benefits from skim milk, low fat snacks,
and cholesterol lowering Cheerios that were

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.070
sold to you are based on hypotheses made by
a man named Ancel Keys.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.300
The idea that we should avoid saturated fat
and cholesterol at all costs comes from the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.190
Keys’ “Diet-Heart Hypothesis” and “Lipid
Hypothesis”.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.300
These ideas come from him analyzing the data
from 7 countries which showed that when you

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.290
plotted incidence of heart attacks against
fat consumption you see that the countries

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.980
that ate more fat had more heart attacks.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.510
It was simple, you could draw a straight line
through the data points which showed more

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.530
fat equaled more heart attacks.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.011
Pretty straight forward, you eat more fat,
you get fat, your cholesterol rises, your

00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:58.290
arteries get clogged, and you have a heart
attack.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.079
Ancel Keys got this accepted by the USDA,
the American Medical Association, the American

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.080
Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association
and off went the anti-fat anti-cholesterol

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.770
movement.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.590
The only catch here is that there weren’t
only 7 countries for which data was available,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.700
there were 22 countries.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.950
When you factor in the remaining countries
there is no straight line to be drawn.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.690
Maybe Keys had access to the remaining data,
maybe he didn’t, but he sure worked fast

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.280
to have his recommendations put in place.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.939
The lack of good evidence didn’t go unnoticed,
though: Dr. George Mann, one of the researchers

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.060
on the Framingham study which was actually
supposed to bolster this cholesterol theory,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.850
said, “Dietary fat is not the determinant
of either high cholesterol or coronary heart

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.510
disease” and ‘”the diet heart hypothesis
is the greatest scam ever perpetrated on the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.510
American public.“

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.811
That’s a bold claim but by the way, it’s
still called “hypothesis” because it’s

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.790
never been proven.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
You’re probably up to date with recent health
information and maybe even OK with the idea

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.180
of a low carb diet, but chances are you’re
still not completely comfortable with fat.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.500
After all, we’ve been programmed to associate
saturated fats with “Artery Clogging”

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.370
and we’ve seen the commercials where they
do something like clog a drain with bacon

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.580
fat.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.920
Also Butter, Lard and Coconut Oil solidify
at room temperature so it’s pretty easy

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.730
logic that those solid fats will clog your
arteries.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.550
The problem with these images is that you
can melt those saturated fats easily in your

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.611
hand, like I'm doing here, and the temperature
in your body is much hotter; and the thing

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:33.541
that clogs your arteries resulting in a heart
attack is not an accumulation of fat.

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.840
Fat doesn’t even stay intact in the body-
your stomach bile works kind of like the dish

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.860
liquid I’m dropping here.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.920
It breaks the fat up into these small droplets..

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.810
Then it gets wrapped inside carrier molecules
called lipoproteins.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.760
Fat is never technically even in the bloodstream,
it’s always transported inside of a lipoprotein

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.120
shell.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.239
When you look at health from an evolutionary
standpoint, the concept of engineering fat

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.540
out of our foods for our health doesn’t
make much sense.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.670
Our brains, which is what got us so far, are
the most metabolically expensive organs that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.340
we have: consuming 25% of the adult metabolic
budget.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.629
To adjust for the high energy cost of a large
brain, our guts had to shrink because they

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.930
too required a lot of energy to run.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.710
So, our gut became less efficient at getting
enough energy from fibrous foods and was more

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.410
dependent on more bio-available, nutrient-dense
and energy dense foods.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.099
Cooking food of course was an important development
for us too, but fat still takes first place

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.650
for most calorie dense nutrient at 9 calories
per gram.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.300
So fat would then be a very valuable macronutrient
that we would get as much of as our environment

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300
allowed.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.050
There is even evidence that suggests homo
sapiens may have eaten most of the fat on

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.160
an animal before even touching the meat.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.819
Sure we have plenty of fruits and vegetables
that have been cultivated to be more nutrient

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.080
and calorie dense and we spend much less time
moving around, so ravenously eating fat is

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.970
hardly necessary.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.519
However it’s not very plausible that a macronutrient
that used to be so important to us is now

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.269
killing so many of us .

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.769
Timothy Olsen showcases the efficiency of
fat in spectacular fashion.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.549
He holds the record for the Western 100 Endurance
run, a 100 mile ultra distance race in California

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.930
that includes an 18,000 feet climb and 23,000
feet descent.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.430
He said he used to consume dozens of sports
gels throughout his races to keep him going,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.809
but switched to a low carb, high fat diet
for more stable energy;

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:40.320
"Towards the end of the race y'know after
lots of heat and lots of gels and whatnot,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.520
I ended up taking a crap in the woods like
20 some times.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.120
That's when I switched to more primal like
grain free diet, I had huge success with it"

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.389
You might have stopped and thought “How
can fat not be the problem?

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.469
I ate a plant based diet and reversed my atherosclerosis!”Living
in Japan, I’m very aware of how healthy

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:05.419
a high carbohydrate diet can be, especially
a primarily plant based one like the Okinawan

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.090
people’s who frequently live to be 100 while
less than 8% of their calories come from fat.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.229
Don’t worry, we’ll get to this.

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.339
Despite our bodies preferring the energy dense
fat, this idea that saturated fat and cholesterol

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.590
needs to be reduced at all costs became medical
dogma.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.189
However, not only does our body want fat,
it doesn’t want to reduce cholesterol.

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.630
Cholesterol is incredibly important: we need
it for the membranes of our cells, we need

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.870
it to make brain cells, we need it to make
several important hormones like estrogen,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.949
progesterone and testosterone.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.279
Probably due to things like that bacon fat
commercial, the common assumption is that

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.139
fat and cholesterol build up on the arterial
wall.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.889
This isn’t quite how it works.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.689
Where the build up takes place is actually
under the arterial wall.

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.750
The process leading up to a heart attack starts
with a damaged, inflamed arterial wall and

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.080
then the body wants to mend that damage, much
like it would want to mend a cut you might

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.039
have, so it sends cholesterol and other things
like calcium, and fibrin in an attempt to

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.409
seal up the hole.

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.110
Sure cholesterol is found inside this inflamed
area, but you would blame getting burned for

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.490
your blister, not the fluid that builds up.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.460
Blaming cholesterol instead of the inflammation
is like blaming one of the firemen instead

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.050
of the fire.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.159
Back to the Okinawan people: they have such
a low incidence of heart disease because they’re

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:32.409
not eating foods that cause inflammation so
atherosclerosis never develops.

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.559
Of course they live long: they eat locally
grown, organic, fiber rich vegetables designed

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:41.999
to nourish them, not optimized for profit
and laden with pesticides.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.729
Keep in mind by the way that the saturated
fat our homo sapien ancestors were getting

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.919
was from wild animals, (cage free, pasture
raised, organic - that is)not from highly

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.629
processed ham slices in Kraft Food’s “Lunchables”
, and certainly not from the butter of cows

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:00.490
pumped with hormones while living in cow jail
and eating processed corn scrap.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.119
Also they were getting their unsaturated fat
in the form of omega-3’s from fish and omega-6’s

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.680
from nuts, not mostly from Canola seeds that
had to be washed in hexane solvent &amp; sodium

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.180
hydroxide, bleached and then steam injected.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.370
Wait a minute, but What if you have too much
cholesterol?

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.219
It doesn’t really matter.

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.819
One of the authors of the “The Great Cholesterol
Myth,” Dr. Johnny Bowden explained in this

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:28.460
lecture that in the Lyon Diet Heart Study
they had a group of 605 people with high cholesterol

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.900
and a very high risk of heart disease.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.969
In one group they put them on the Mediterranean
diet and in another they recommended they

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:40.559
cut saturated fat, reduce cholesterol intake
to 300mg per day and follow the “healthy”

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:41.559
western diet.

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:42.689
The results?

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:47.399
Cardiac death and all cause mortality on the
Mediterranean diet was significantly lower

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:50.389
than on the low saturated fat diet.

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:55.699
After explaining this, Dr. Bowden says “What
do you think happened to the cholesterol of

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.951
the people on the Mediterranean diet?

00:07:58.951 --> 00:08:00.800
Their cholesterol didn’t budge.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.580
They just stopped dying.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.509
Cholesterol had nothing to do with it.”

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:11.370
OK so total cholesterol is not a useful piece
of information.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.449
But what about the HDL “good” cholesterol
and the LDL “bad” cholesterol?

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:18.669
This concept is also outdated.

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:23.349
In Peter Attia’s wonderfully long and technical
talk about cholesterol he explains...

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:28.589
“We were taught that LDL cholesterol is
the big risk right, if your LDL cholesterol

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:31.459
is high, you are at risk for heart disease.

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:36.969
And yet we're seeing that some of the time
that turns out to be patently false.

00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:45.330
This is a study that looked at 136,000 patients
admitted to the hospital for a coronary artery

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.330
event.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:52.870
And in these patients they looked at LDL cholesterol
level and you can see that nearly 50% of them

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.730
had what you would consider a low LDL cholesterol
level”

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.680
There are a number of different types and
sizes of HDL and LDL particles, and what is

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.900
actually important is to avoid having too
many triglycerides sitting in your bloodstream,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.560
which are also transported by lipoproteins.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.050
Peter cites studies that show an increase
in processed carbohydrates and sugar leads

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.050
to an increase in the triglyceride concentration.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.440
The best way for the subjects to decrease
their triglyceride concentration was ironically

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.269
to go on a higher fat, low carbohydrate diet.

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:29.709
Therefore these low-fat products marketed
to health conscious people that switch fat

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:36.470
for more carbohydrates are directly increasing
your risk for heart disease.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.120
We trusted you, Snackwell's

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.170
One quick thing: If that last part had you
thinking “how in the world could sugar,

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.089
instead of fat, lead to a higher triglyceride
concentration?”

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:52.610
Take a moment to look at Doug McGuff’s thorough
explanation of glucose metabolism here or

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.129
you can see my cliffnotes version here.

00:09:55.129 --> 00:10:00.430
It wasn’t like nobody knew that the culprit
behind our health problems wasn’t so much

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.920
fat, but sugar.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.731
British physiologist John Yudkin wrote a book
in 1972 “Pure, White and Deadly: The Problem

00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:12.670
of Sugar” which correctly warned that the
consumption of sugar is what is really dangerous

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.220
to our health, an argument he had made since
at least 1957.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:24.620
Nonetheless, in 1977, the US government gave
us our new low fat healthy guidelines.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.550
and What’s happened since then?

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.149
Hospitalizations for Heart Failure went up
and heart disease is still the leading cause

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:33.620
of death in the world.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.209
In fact, when it comes to weight gain, the
data suggests people started gaining weight

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:40.139
immediately after the guidelines came out.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:44.560
"Hey Clinton, get back to work!"

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.430
"Make me!"

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.899
We now understand that:

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:52.649
1 Knowing total cholesterol as well as “good”
and “bad” cholesterol are virtually irrelevant

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:53.649
to your health

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:58.950
2 Reducing inflammation, and triglyceride
concentration in the blood is what is actually

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.720
important for avoiding heart disease

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.300
and 3 The real things you need to limit are
sugar and processed carbohydrates.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.250
Despite all this, the same guidelines are
still in place.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.649
What is worse than that is we’re still being
prescribed Statin drugs, whose harmful effects

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:19.980
are a constant testament to how important
cholesterol is for the body.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.700
Some of you might even have been prescribed
a statin.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.779
If so, you might want to ask your doctor what
the number needed to treat for statin drugs

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:27.810
is.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.690
Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin explains that
the number needed to treat is the number of

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.220
people that have to take the drug before one
person actually benefits from it.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.550
“…So The number needed to treat for the
most widely prescribed statin, what do you

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.550
suppose it is?

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.319
How many people have to take it before one
person is helped?

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:46.490
Three hundred.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.570
300 people have to take the drug for a year
before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.089
event is prevented.

00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:58.620
So for this particular drug, the side effects
occur in 5 percent of the patients and they

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.339
include terrible things – debilitating muscle
and joint pain.

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:06.120
But now you're thinking well 5%, not very
likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
take the drug.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120
but wait a minute.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.399
300 people take the drug, right?

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:14.070
One person’s helped, five percent of those
300 have side effects, that’s 15 people.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:20.100
You are 15 times more likely to be harmed
by the drug than you are to be helped by the

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.019
drug.“

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:26.300
By the way, remember how I said cholesterol
is important for producing sex hormones like

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.810
testosterone and estrogen?

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.130
What do you think the second highest revenue
prescription drug is for Pfizer after Lipitor,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.300
which is the #1 prescribed statin?

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.790
Viagra comes in right after Lipitor.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.420
There’s only an 8% difference between the
two.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.459
Let me end this video with a rule of thumb
you can use to pick out your food:

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:50.300
Just think about how much something has been
screwed with before you make the decision

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.550
to eat that.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.621
For example: coca Leaves in their natural
state are quite harmless, the farmers in the

00:12:56.621 --> 00:13:00.700
Andes have chewed on them for hundreds of
years for a small boost in energy.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.709
However, when you process the hell out of
them, you get cocaine.

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:08.139
Eating a lot of sugar beets probably isn’t
so bad for you, but if you boil them in water

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:12.589
to make a crude syrup, then wash that solution
with calcium hydroxide and proceed to refine

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:16.800
it with 6 different boilers… maybe you shouldn’t
put the resulting white powder in your coffee

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.009
every day.

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:23.430
You can apply this idea to anything from processed
cheese to packages of so called “whole wheat

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.430
bread”.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.810
This goes for fats and meat too.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:31.050
If Jack the cow just had to walk around and
eat grass, the food that comes from him is

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.249
going to be more nutritional than Jeff the
cow’s if Jeff had to be confined to a tiny

00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:39.210
space, given all sorts of antibiotics, and
fed corn all his life.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.499
Here’s a fun fact: Livestock consume 70%
of the antibiotics in the united states.

00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:49.269
They need these antibiotics to survive the
ill health effects caused by confinement and

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:54.399
the acidosis that results from a corn based
diet - a diet which is completely unnatural

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.560
for a cow to eat.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.569
I’m not here to sell you on any one diet
or argue what macronutrient ratio is best.

00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:06.249
However, I can tell you for certain that this
sugary processed crap that has somehow found

00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:10.290
its way into every store on the planet isn’t
what our bodies need.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.329
It’s more likely that our recent health
problems came from the nutritional sacrifices

00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:19.080
that were made for better profits, and not
from a basic macronutrient like fat that we

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.670
have been eating for centuries.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.410
