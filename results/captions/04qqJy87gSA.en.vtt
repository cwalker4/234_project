00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.149
So I saw this story.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.440
How many people saw this story?

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.460
Did you see it?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.960
Yeah.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.310
So-- so congratulations on
your wedding, first of all.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.810
Thank you.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.200
So this was on the day.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.700
Yeah.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.580
And it was-- the wedding
had already taken place,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.121
and you were out,
then, just taking--

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.730
It was shortly after.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.000
We'd just got married, and we
were doing our wedding photos

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.890
in the park, and
different backdrops.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.640
And there was these
three kids-- several--

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.556
or they were following
us for several minutes.

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:28.140
And just giggling
and laughing at us.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.507
And we didn't think much of it.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.590
Then they started walking
towards that pond, where

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.670
you see the picture.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.755
And I just thought-- my
dad instincts kicked in.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.860
I'll keep an eye on 'em,
see what they're doing.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.860
Brittany was doing
some solo shots,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.520
and I was just sort
of waiting for and.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.344
And I looked over where the kids
were, and I only saw two kids.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.260
I just thought, I better
go check, to be safe.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.160
Because there were three.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.826
There was three.

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:48.890
I could only see two.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.301
Yeah, so I was like, oh,
I better just go see.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.800
It's not a very deep pond in
some parts, but you never know.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.690
And then I--

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.430
I walked over
about 30, 40 yards.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490
And when I looked over
the ledge, the boy, there,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.310
he was just having a hard
time keeping his head up.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.430
And I was able to
jump down the ledge.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.010
And at first I
couldn't reach him.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.150
Then I made eye contact with
him, and I said, grab my hand.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.790
And he got close enough to me
and I grabbed him by his wrist,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.248
and I just scooped him up and
put him back up on the ledge.

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:15.940
So yeah, it was--

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.611
Well, he must have
been so scared.

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:18.360
I mean, he's tiny.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.280
Yeah, he's not a very big guy.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.780
Yeah.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.884
So I was able to lift
him up pretty quick.

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:24.300
And then he just
leaves you there.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.296
Yeah.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.284
Just walks away.

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:29.020
Yeah.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.952
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:30.619
Kids these days.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.285
That's my point.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:32.200
That's what I'm--

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.500
So yeah.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.140
So then you go back to
just taking pictures?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.910
So I was taking
pictures by a tree,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.110
and my photographer
was, like, look there.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.820
Look there.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.460
And I look over,
and Clay's there.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.840
And I'm like--

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.100
I shouted out.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.431
And I was like--

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:49.680
I don't even know what I said.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.890
I must have said, like, Clay!

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.220
And then-- and then, yeah.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.965
So I just saw him
pull out that boy.

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.590
And when I yelled
out, the photographer

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.960
turned around and
got the picture.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.770
That's a great photographer
that you had, to capture that.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.440
Yeah.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.690
So the funny thing
is, when we went

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.470
to go look for a
photographer for the wedding,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.810
my only quality I
wanted in a photographer

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.240
was someone who could
capture candid pictures.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.320
Yeah, you got one.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.321
He got a candid picture.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:18.570
Not the one I was looking for.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.320
That's amazing.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.360
So, and now people are
calling you a hero.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.670
Do you feel like you're a hero?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.169
Is that--

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.664
No, I just see it as kind of--

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:27.330
I was at the right place, at the
right time, and the right thing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.600
to do.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.200
You know, it's something I
think anybody would have done.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.880
Anybody would have
done it, yeah.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.380
Yeah.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.170
That's the way I look at it.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.670
Well, I hope that anybody
would have done it.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.420
But it's a great--

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.300
especially someone
on their wedding day,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.550
taking pictures, you know,
going, wait a minute,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.340
I'm dressed up.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.980
But you--

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.610
That didn't even cross his mind.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.441
So you had a theme of your--
what was your wedding theme?

00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:44.940
Oh, yeah.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.990
It was Harry Potter.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.590
Harry Potter.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.020
Yeah, we're-- we're
big Harry Potter fans.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.520
Yeah.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.510
So we had the
Honeydukes candy bar.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.971
We had our drinks named
after Harry Potter things.

00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:57.470
Bouquets.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.510
My bouquet was made out of
pages of the Harry Potter books.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.740
Well, guess what we're
going to do right now?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.731
Like, right now.

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.230
Right now.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.580
Right now, I'm sending you both
to the Wizarding World of Harry

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.110
