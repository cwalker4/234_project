00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.140
The Lithium ion battery has made our modern
phones, laptops, and electric cars possible.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.630
The secret is its ability to cram a lot of
power into a tiny package, but for its inventor

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.400
John B Goodenough, that wasn’t good enough.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.609
Nearly 40 years after he helped create a battery
that would change the world, Goodenough and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.009
researchers at the University of Texas at
Austin have announced they’ve invented a

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.689
new battery that sounds too good to be true.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.439
Goodenough has a few issues with his old lithium
ion battery.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.039
It’s still too weak, too expensive, and
has the pesky habit of exploding from time

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.039
to time.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.730
If a battery is charged too quickly, lithium
tends to slowly build up through the liquid

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.690
electrolyte in long thin whiskers called dendrites.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.940
If the dendrites get long enough to connect
the positive and negative electrodes of the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.089
battery, they can cause a short and you’ve
got a surprise fireworks show in your pants.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.070
So for the last few years Goodenough has wanted
to make a battery with a solid electrolyte

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.670
instead of a liquid one.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.680
Two years ago he found the research of Portuguese
physicist Maria Helena Braga.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.539
Braga and a colleague had invented a glass
electrolyte, which means no dendrites, no

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.399
shorts, no pants on fire.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.439
Braga and Goodenough have been working together
in Austin ever since and the new battery they’ve

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.670
come up with is unlike anything anyone’s
seen before.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.180
Along with the new glass electrolyte, the
electrodes -that is the positive and negative

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.860
ends of the battery- are something entirely
different.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.570
In a lithium ion battery the positive electrode
is made of a lithium metal oxide and the negative

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.880
side is made of a porous carbon.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.360
When you charge it, lithium ions grab electrons
and move through the electrolyte to the carbon.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.299
When you discharge it, the lithium ions shuffle
back, but the electrons they had don’t make

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.450
the return trip.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.200
They flow through your device instead, providing
power.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.479
But this new battery doesn’t rely on storing
ions in a lattice on one side, instead the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.270
metal from the negative side travels across
the electrolyte and coats the positive side,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.520
creating a thin layer on top.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.289
And that’s got some people scratching their
heads.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.830
According to our understanding of conventional
batteries, it’s important that the two electrodes

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.680
are different materials, that’s where the
voltage comes from.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.950
Remember the old potato batteries you made
as a kid?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.580
Stick a piece of copper in one side, and zinc
in the other, and you’ve got a battery because

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.409
electrons flow from the zinc to the copper
through your clock or GLaDOS or whatever.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.110
If you stuck zinc and zinc, or copper and
copper, nothing would happen.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.940
Likewise with this new battery, once the positive
side is coated with metal from the negative

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760
side, the voltage should drop to zero.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.970
So the fact that this battery even works is
confusing other top battery experts.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.020
It seems to be generating something from nothing,
which is a big no no according to the laws

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.580
of thermodynamics.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.140
But according to Goodenough, it doesn’t
just work, it works spectacularly well.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.030
Compared to current batteries it can hold
3 to 10 times the charge, can be recharged

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.890
in minutes instead of hours, has a lifespan
of over a thousand cycles, and doesn’t go

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.090
boom in your back pocket.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.520
It can be cheaper to make since it works with
low cost sodium as well as lithium, and can

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.910
operate in temperatures from -20 degrees celsius
up to 60 degrees.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.050
This is exactly the sort of battery that would
make an electric car a true replacement for

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.420
a gasoline powered one.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.950
It’s the sort of thing that would be hailed
as a monumental achievement.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.060
Or a hoax.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.560
But it’s hard to argue with Goodenough’s
credibility, I mean, this is the guy who helped

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.820
invent the modern lithium ion battery powered
world, he’s effectively the Li-ion King.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.290
His colleagues don’t believe he and Braga
are pulling a fast one, heck they’ve even

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.700
applied for a patent.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.470
And I checked and the paper wasn’t published
on April 1st.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.020
So maybe this crazy battery works for some
other reason we have yet to figure out.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.090
Or maybe Goodenough’s explanation that the
plating is too thin to drop the voltage is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.090
correct.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.830
For something this promising with this kind
of name behind it, more research is definitely

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.830
needed.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.350
So do you think the new battery is the real
deal or Goodenough is having one over on us?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.820
All I know is a battery that lasts 3 times
longer and takes minutes to charge sounds

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.690
amazing, but if I had practical wireless charging
I wouldn’t actually need it.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.430

here.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.430
