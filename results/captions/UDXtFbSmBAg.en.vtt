Reviewer: Queenie Lee

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:14.175
Thank you for giving me the opportunity

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.105
to talk about something
I'm really passionate about:

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:18.475
happiness.

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:21.957
I lead a research team
at the University of British Columbia

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:24.355
that studies the science of happiness.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:27.206
Lead a research team,

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:28.568
how arrogant is that?

00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:30.186
Let me tell you what I really do.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:33.635
What I really do is I work
with really bright undergraduates,

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:35.871
graduate students, and professors

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:40.525
who do just terrific work
that I shamelessly take credit for.

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:42.388
And that's I am going to do now,

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:44.525
just another example of it.

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:46.805
And I've been doing this
for the last ten years.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.149
In the last ten years,
I've identified three words.

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:55.929
Three words that will change your life
by increasing your happiness.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.859
But, like a timeshare talk,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:58.950
(Laughter)

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.914
you've got to wait till the very end
before you get the reward,

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:03.784
which is the three words.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.360
(Laughter)

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.898
When I found out
the theme of this talk was

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.691
"What I want to be when I grow up,"

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.371
I thought it was
a perfect fit, a lovely fit.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.601
Because for most of us
near the top of the list,

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.561
at the top of the list:

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.571
we want to be happy.

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:22.441
And it reminded me of a story -
a story by John Lennon,

00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.407
a former member of the Beatles.

00:01:24.407 --> 00:01:25.683
John Lennon said,

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:30.291
that when he was a young boy, growing up,

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.601
his mum said to him,

00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:34.341
"John, the most important thing in life,

00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:37.193
the most important thing is to be happy."

00:01:37.193 --> 00:01:39.033
So, when John was in grade school,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.292
the teacher assigned a task to the class

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:44.881
and asked each child a question.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.919
And the question was:

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:49.569
"What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.764
And John Lennon said,
"I want to be happy!"

00:01:52.764 --> 00:01:54.884
And the teacher said, "No, John.

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:57.685
You don't understand the question."

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.571
And John Lennon said,
"No, you don't understand life."

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:04.094
(Laughter)

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:08.323
And I think that criticism
that John Lennon levelled at his teacher

00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:10.314
is a criticism that can be levelled

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:15.048
at health researchers
and health care practitioners.

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:16.949
It can be levelled at people like me.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.371
Because we kind of missed out
on what life is about,

00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.576
about happiness.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.371
Let me demonstrate that
in the following quote.

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.525
"Much has been gained if we succeed
in taking your hysterical misery

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:35.117
and turning it into common unhappiness."

00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:37.163
Really!?

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:39.037
I hate this quote.

00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:42.862
And the reason I dislike this quote
so much is first off: it is wrong.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.480
We've now measured happiness

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.957
in thousands and thousands and thousands
of children, adolescents, and adults.

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:52.187
We've measured happiness in people

00:02:52.187 --> 00:02:54.195
from Zambia to New Delhi,

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:57.644
from Dubai to Western Canada.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.487
And what we find,
it's happiness that's common,

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:02.105
not unhappiness.

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:05.008
And the second reason I dislike this quote

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:07.909
is because it sets the bar so low for us.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.109
It says we are successful
if we take people from the emotional dregs

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.138
and raise them up
a smidgen to unhappiness.

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:17.700
Really?

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:20.089
We can do more than that,

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.633
and we can do better than that.

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:23.609
And part of doing more and better

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.298
are the three words
that can change your life.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.518
Well, this is actually a quote
by Sigmund Freud,

00:03:30.518 --> 00:03:32.973
the father of psychoanalytic theory,

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:35.469
and tells us about the roots of psychology

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.707
through such a negative lens,

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:43.030
and it's not just the roots of psychology,
it's current psychology.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.228
In my office, I've got a dictionary.

00:03:45.228 --> 00:03:49.790
It's a great, big, fat dictionary
of all the words psychologists use.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.971
So I took that dictionary, and I looked up
the word "depression" in it,

00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.411
and there are 18 different
definitions of depression.

00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:01.285
We know a lot about depression.

00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:03.711
So then I looked up "happiness,"

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:06.030
18 definitions of depression,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.190
happiness?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.790
It wasn't in it.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.073
It's like it's not in the vocabulary
of current psychologists,

00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:15.619
and it's not just
a criticism of psychology.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.370
Psychology, medicine, psychiatry,
and neuroscience,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.403
they've all traditionally focused on

00:04:22.403 --> 00:04:25.422
what's wrong with you
and how do we fix it.

00:04:25.422 --> 00:04:28.835
They are about deficits,
disease, and dysfunction.

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:31.281
And that is a really good thing.

00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:32.423
It's a good thing.

00:04:32.423 --> 00:04:37.346
Because of it, we've got new approaches,
and ways of identifying and helping people

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:39.999
with mental health
and physical health challenges.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.542
It's a really good thing.

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:45.930
I just don't believe it's the only thing.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.928
And again, we can do more than this,

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:50.833
and we can do better than this.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:55.783
And one way of doing more and better
is a newly emerging field of psychology -

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:58.834
a field called positive psychology.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:00.311
Positive psychology

00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.338
isn't about what's wrong with you
and how do we fix it.

00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:04.744
Positive psychology

00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:07.596
is about what's right with you
and how do we promote it.

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:09.344
What's right with you -

00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:14.165
what's right with you is your ability
to love and be loved by others.

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:17.066
It's your kindness. It's your gratitude.

00:05:17.076 --> 00:05:20.184
It's your strength,
your courage, your bravery.

00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:23.849
It's about what contributes
to your thriving and flourishing.

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.614
It's what makes life worth living

00:05:27.274 --> 00:05:29.405
and of course, that includes
your happiness.

00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:34.237
One of the things that the research
in positive psychology has shown us

00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:36.286
over the last 20 years

00:05:36.286 --> 00:05:40.397
is there's no one-size-fits-all
model for happiness.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:44.438
What makes me happy is quite likely
different from what makes you happy.

00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:45.844
And what makes you happy now

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:50.765
is different from what made you happy
ten years ago or 20 years in the future.

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:54.957
There's no single recipe
that will increase your happiness

00:05:54.957 --> 00:05:57.756
at all times and for all people.

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:02.417
But the other thing
positive psychology has taught us

00:06:02.427 --> 00:06:05.788
is that happy people
share one thing in common.

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:10.641
They have strong high quality
personal relationships.

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.013
It's really difficult
to find somebody who is happy,

00:06:14.013 --> 00:06:16.980
who doesn't have good personal friendships

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.114
and/or are engaged in a satisfying
romantic relationship.

00:06:23.694 --> 00:06:27.294
So, who benefits
from these personal relationships?

00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:29.849
Well, the literature and science

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.610
is full of examples
of how adults are happier

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.050
if they have personal relationships.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.270
In our own work,
we've looked at children,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.060
and we find that children are happy

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.300
if they've got friendships
and friends they see regularly.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.190
In fact, even imaginary friends help.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.622
Children with imaginary
friends are happier.

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:57.025
They laugh more; they smile more;

00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.175
they are happier.

00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:01.342
And it's not just people
from the general population.

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:04.591
We've also looked at people
in vulnerable populations.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.424
For example, we've looked at people
with acquired brain injury,

00:07:08.424 --> 00:07:13.119
people that have brain damage
from a car accident or from a stroke.

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:15.622
And they're not as happy.

00:07:16.032 --> 00:07:18.470
Not all of them, some of them stay happy.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.352
And those that stay happy
with brain injuries,

00:07:21.352 --> 00:07:25.314
those that are sort of
buffered or immunized

00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:29.933
against the deficits
or the problems of a brain injury,

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:33.156
are those with high quality
social relationships;

00:07:33.156 --> 00:07:35.305
they protect them from unhappiness.

00:07:35.305 --> 00:07:38.442
We've looked at people
with emotional processing disorders.

00:07:39.162 --> 00:07:40.990
One of them is alexithymia.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.162
Alexithymia is a disorder

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:45.372
where people have difficulty

00:07:45.372 --> 00:07:50.435
identifying and communicating
the emotions of their own and others.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:53.724
If you were on a date
with somebody with alexithymia,

00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:56.133
and you said, "How are you feeling?"

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:59.835
They would say,
"I'm going to the store later today."

00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:02.345
And you go, "It doesn't seem quite right."

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:06.579
So you say, "What? No, no. I mean inside!
Inside, how are you really feeling?"

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:09.613
And they might say,
"Well, I'm a little hungry."

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:14.686
They don't get the emotional world
and they're unhappy.

00:08:14.686 --> 00:08:19.916
And their unhappiness is explained in part
by their poor social relationships.

00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:23.843
And we look at psychopathy and happiness.

00:08:24.343 --> 00:08:28.125
Psychopaths are Ted Bundys
of the societies.

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.866
They're not nice people.

00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:31.543
They manipulate. They cheat.

00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:34.063
They use others. They feel no remorse.

00:08:35.284 --> 00:08:38.423
They feel no empathy. They use people.

00:08:38.813 --> 00:08:42.177
And I thought maybe people
that are psychopaths

00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:43.357
would be really happy.

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.562
After all, they get what they want.

00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:49.827
And they don't feel badly about it,
in terms of using others.

00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:52.598
On the other hand,
I thought maybe they're really unhappy.

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:56.647
After all, they've got really
poor social relationships

00:08:56.647 --> 00:09:00.348
that are characterized
by manipulating others.

00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:04.839
Well, it turns out psychopaths
are really unhappy,

00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:09.989
and their unhappiness is explained
by their poor social relationships.

00:09:11.109 --> 00:09:12.829
So this is how we normally see it.

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:16.274
We see that personal relationships
make us happy.

00:09:16.274 --> 00:09:19.694
And yes, this is what
the research literature tells us.

00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:26.583
And it's the opposite too,
that happiness improves our relationship.

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:28.249
So given the tight connection

00:09:28.249 --> 00:09:31.701
between our personal relationships
and our happiness,

00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:36.059
we should be looking at happiness
when we're developing relationships.

00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:39.489
If you're courting somebody,
if you're wooing somebody,

00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:41.199
if you're online dating,

00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:43.937
and you see a profile
of an attractive person,

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:47.257
and you go "Wow! Add to cart."

00:09:47.257 --> 00:09:49.802
(Laughter)

00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:54.370
When you do these things,
we need to take into account happiness.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.130
So, a survey was done of undergraduates,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.198
and they were asked,

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:01.683
"What do you look for
in your relationship with a partner,

00:10:01.683 --> 00:10:05.903
a romantic partner,
a long-lasting enduring romantic partner?"

00:10:05.903 --> 00:10:07.931
Well, these are undergraduates.

00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:09.601
So you have to explain it to them.

00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:10.842
You say -

00:10:11.842 --> 00:10:17.071
The undergraduates will say,
"A long-term romantic relationship?

00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:20.022
Do you mean like for the entire weekend?"

00:10:20.022 --> 00:10:21.972
And that's not what we really mean here,

00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:24.672
we mean a long-term relationship

00:10:24.672 --> 00:10:27.670
where you think about
may be having children with the person,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.693
spending the rest of your life with them."

00:10:29.693 --> 00:10:33.041
And this is what the undergraduates
would say when they get it:

00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:39.783
53% of them say love is important.
32% say companionship is important.

00:10:39.783 --> 00:10:45.456
4% recognize romance,
2% recognize financial security,

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:49.565
and 1% - just 1% of them say sex.

00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:52.814
And these results
are important for two reasons.

00:10:52.814 --> 00:10:55.533
The first thing it shows us

00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:58.685
is that only 1%
of the undergraduates are honest.

00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:03.068
(Laughter)

00:11:03.068 --> 00:11:06.659
(Applause)

00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:10.566
Thank you.

00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:14.694
And the second thing
it shows us is we got it wrong.

00:11:15.444 --> 00:11:18.884
One of the single best predictors
of your happiness

00:11:18.884 --> 00:11:22.074
is the happiness of your romantic partner.

00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:24.726
Other people matter.

00:11:27.137 --> 00:11:29.756
So, I know what you're thinking right now.

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:33.074
I can actually read your minds -
comes with the psychology background.

00:11:33.914 --> 00:11:35.066
You are thinking:

00:11:35.066 --> 00:11:38.534
Yeah, relationships and happiness
are well interconnected.

00:11:38.534 --> 00:11:39.955
And you're golden.

00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:44.524
You're golden because you
have 6,318 Facebook friends.

00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:46.689
But that's not what we mean here.

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:50.777
It's the quality of your relationships
that count, not the quantity.

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:52.847
Think of the beautiful Scottish saying:

00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:56.425
You can count the true friends
in your entire lifetime

00:11:56.425 --> 00:12:00.415
on the fingers of just one hand.

00:12:00.415 --> 00:12:02.458
And that's what we're referring to.

00:12:02.978 --> 00:12:05.837
25 years ago, when people were asked:

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.379
List your friends,

00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:12.307
the friends you can go to
in case of a serious setback,

00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:14.721
like you had a mental health illness.

00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:16.478
Who could you go talk to?

00:12:16.888 --> 00:12:19.580
25 years ago, people listed three friends.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.287
But now it's different.

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:27.520
Now we have Facebook, we have SnapChat,
now we have Twitter, tweeting, and email.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.597
And it has gone, from 25 years ago,
from mere three friends,

00:12:31.597 --> 00:12:35.231
now it's gone all the way up
to one and a half friends.

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:38.714
We've gone in the wrong direction.

00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:42.598
You know that on Facebook
you post, on Twitter you tweet,

00:12:42.598 --> 00:12:44.829
and on eHarmony you lie.

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:47.479
(Laughter)

00:12:47.479 --> 00:12:50.240
But I don't think
it's too big a stretch for us

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.401
to recognize that the social platforms
can actually get in the way

00:12:56.401 --> 00:13:00.021
of our communication
which is essential for relationships,

00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:01.591
as illustrated here.

00:13:03.352 --> 00:13:06.462
(Laughter)

00:13:06.462 --> 00:13:09.572
So, given the importance
of personal relationships,

00:13:09.572 --> 00:13:11.159
what do we do to nurture them?

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:13.713
What has science told us about this?

00:13:13.713 --> 00:13:15.632
Well, finally ...

00:13:19.412 --> 00:13:23.543
This is where the three words
that will change your life come into play.

00:13:23.543 --> 00:13:27.993
These three words were developed
in interviews with people with chronic ...

00:13:29.853 --> 00:13:30.982
diabetes.

00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:32.552
These are hospital patients.

00:13:32.552 --> 00:13:34.731
The researchers
went to the hospital patients,

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.400
and by using three simple words,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.721
the patients felt much more connected,
much more attached,

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.469
much more bonded to the interviewers,
just with three simple words.

00:13:45.469 --> 00:13:49.133
And these three words are "Tell me more."

00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:52.548
When you're in a personal relationship
talking to somebody,

00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:55.465
and you lean forward,
and you look them in their eye,

00:13:55.465 --> 00:13:57.566
and you say, "Tell me more,"

00:13:57.566 --> 00:14:00.172
it means: I'm not going on
to my own story.

00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:03.155
I'm not interrupting you.

00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:05.834
Your story is valid.
It means something to me.

00:14:05.834 --> 00:14:07.155
Tell me more.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.794
And it comes from the value of listening.

00:14:11.794 --> 00:14:16.274
When I ask my undergraduates,
"Why do you listen in a conversation?"

00:14:16.274 --> 00:14:18.665
They talk about the value to the listener.

00:14:18.665 --> 00:14:22.053
They say we listen to somebody
to get information.

00:14:22.053 --> 00:14:24.226
And they're right. That's a good reason.

00:14:24.226 --> 00:14:27.269
But if that's the only reason you listen,

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:28.955
then once you know the information,

00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:31.618
once you think you know
what the person is going to say,

00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:33.918
you stop listening and you interrupt.

00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:38.194
But there's also value
to the speaker when we listen.

00:14:38.194 --> 00:14:40.397
When we listen to the speaker,

00:14:40.397 --> 00:14:44.284
it allows them a chance to express
their thoughts and their feelings.

00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:45.346
When we listen,

00:14:45.346 --> 00:14:50.387
it validates the speaker to tell them
that their story is important.

00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:51.509
When we listen,

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:55.907
it gives the speaker a chance
to find their solutions just by talking.

00:14:57.137 --> 00:15:02.168
When we listen, it allows us to celebrate
the success of the speaker

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:05.674
and allows us to console them
if they've had setbacks.

00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:08.959
Tell me more.

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:13.390
Tell me more is a way that you can
give the speaker all that value.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.710
And there are three bonus words.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.770
It's a good thing
you're here this afternoon

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.739
because we can't do this deal all day.

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:20.767
(Laughter)

00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:23.496
There are three additional words
that they used.

00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:25.547
What happened next?

00:15:25.547 --> 00:15:28.989
It's served the same purpose
validating the speaker.

00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:32.879
Tell me more. What happened next?

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:35.599
Two phrases, each with three simple words.

00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:38.450
Three simple words
that will change your life.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.778
It'll change your life
by improving your personal relationships.

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:47.570
It will change your life
by making you happier.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.139
Three simple words.

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:52.702
"Tell me more" and "What happened next?"

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.892
are three simple words

00:15:54.892 --> 00:15:58.132
that you can use to improve
your relationship with strangers,

00:15:58.132 --> 00:16:00.921
people who just aren't friends yet.

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:03.369
To improve your relationship
with your children,

00:16:03.369 --> 00:16:07.832
with your co-workers, with your family,
with your loved ones, with your friends.

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:09.280
Three simple words

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.790
that will improve your relationships,
increase your happiness.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.023
Three simple words you can do right now.

00:16:17.023 --> 00:16:18.512
So that you can do more,

00:16:18.922 --> 00:16:20.695
and you can do better.

00:16:20.695 --> 00:16:22.080
Thanks so much!

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.085
(Applause)
