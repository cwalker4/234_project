00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.270
I want you to think about this here.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.370
In your entire lifetime, how much money has
gone through your hands?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.370
How much?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.190
Let me explain to you what I mean by this.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.999
Maybe you made $73,000 last year, at 28-years-old.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.900
And the first time you got a check was 14
years old, it was $100.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.970
Add that whole thing up.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.020
You'll come out with a number.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.020
$493,000.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.510
Or $1.9 million or $6.3 million, depending
on who it is watching this video.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.750
The question is this.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.660
How much is left in your wallet?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.660
Truly.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.760
What is in your wallet?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.430
Not what's in your wallet with Capitol Choice.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.210
I'm talking about really, what's in your wallet?

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.530
What do you have left?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.230
How much savings do you have left?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.679
And if you're not too happy with this question,
it's very simple.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.920
The reason why you don't have a lot of money
left is because you don't know how to play

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.429
the money game.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.429
Simple as that.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.749
So today in this video I'm going to cover
with you 20 rules of money.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.089
These are rules of money that I've followed
and it's obviously from a lot of mistakes

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.089
I've made.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.870
Because there was a point in my life where
I made money and there was nothing left in

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.870
my pocket.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.949
So I'm telling you from experiences.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.360
But rule #1 is the most important one.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.410
And it's the one you have to buy into immediately.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.410
It's very simple.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.480
You can fight and say whatever you want to
do to it.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.550
It's a rule.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.620
And the rule is, it's a game.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.150
Money is a game.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.500
And the great thing about any game is the
following thing.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.700
No matter what game you play, the most eventually
get good at it.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.720
If I've never played chess, and I play you
and you've played 100 times chess, you're

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.420
probably going to beat me.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.670
If I have played Monopoly 1,000 times and
you've played three times, I'm probably going

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.250
to beat you, because it's a game.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.210
So the great thing about the money game is,
it can be learned.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.470
So many times people fight it and they have
problems with it.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.110
And they say, well, you know, that person
became rich because they're smart.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.110
This person.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.110
. . No, no.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.640
They learned the game, and you can also take
the time to learn the game.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.250
Rule #2, don't be a hater of money.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.751
If you hate money, you'll never get money.

00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.940
Because money doesn't like haters.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.900
So if you're a hater, and you constantly say
things like, well, money doesn't grow on trees.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.860
Money is this and money is that, and rich
people are this.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860
. . you're right.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.860
Money says, "you're right!"

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.300
I'm not turned on by you.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.660
It's almost as if going on a date with an
attractive girl and telling the girl that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.460
you don't like attractive girls who don't
know a lot about philosophy and all they care

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.800
about is their looks and doing makeup and
doing this and working out and going to the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
gym.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.890
And this girl's like, dude, I put makeup on,
I work out every day to stay in shape.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.140
But I also like other things in my life.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.140
But you know what?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
You're right.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.490
You're not attracted to me; I don't like you.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.190
She goes and finds another guy that says,
"I like a girl that takes care of her body.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.660
I like a girl that takes care of her skin.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.160
I like a girl that does makeup.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.200
I like a girl that works out five days a week."

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960
She's attracted to that guy.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.160
Keep that part in mind.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.620
Don't be a hater with money.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.980
#3, it's a doubles game.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.209
Listen.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.010
This should - you can stop watching the entire
video.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.040
You got the main things out of the way.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040
It's a double game.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.200
And by the way, at the end of the video I'm
going to give you a free PDF.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.410
It's a double game.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.630
What is a double game?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.230
The entire game of money is about doubling
your money.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.310
So what do you mean, Pat, double your money?

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.380
Let me explain it to you this way.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.450
If you right now have $1,000 in your bank
account, if you - you're watching this, and

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.130
you have $1,000 cash, you are 10 doubles away
from a million dollars.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.349
That's it.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.380
You're five doubles away from having $32,000.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.819
You're 13 doubles away from having $8.192
million.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.620
You're 14 doubles away from $16 million.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.930
It's a doubles game.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.090
So how soon can you double your money?

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.630
That's truly the game.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.110
Can you take that $1,000 and double it to
$2,000 in the next year, so the next thing

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.650
is, now it's $2,000 you have in your account,
now you nine steps away from a million dollars.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.380
You may say, "Pat, I already have $100,000
in my account."

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.380
Well guess what?

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.700
You're 4 doubles, three doubles away from
a million dollars.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.250
It's a doubles game.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.480
This is a piece of cake, when you learn it's
a doubles game.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.550
So the question becomes what?

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.680
How soon, this is the real game of doubles.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.209
It becomes two different things.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.069
Risk tolerance, because you've got to know
yourself when it comes to money.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.989
Your risk tolerance, depending on the age
you're at.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.910
If you're 65, your risk tolerance is going
to be lower than you being 22 years old, right?

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.599
So you have your risk tolerance, you need
to know you.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.319
Then the other part is time horizon.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.840
What is your time horizon?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.620
So the time horizon could be, I want to have
a million dollars by ten years from now.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620
Great.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.949
If it's 10 years, what do you have right now?

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.100
Then you have to play your doubles game.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.340
How many doubles do I have with this $17,000
to get to a million bucks?

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.680
It's a simple game!

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.940
That you can learn what to do, as long as
you know your risk tolerance, you know your

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.630
time horizon, what it is and what the amount
is, then you're playing the doubles game.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.919
#4, seduction.

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.720
Let me explain to you about seduction.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.720
Okay?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720
Listen.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.870
I use the analogy with ladies because it's
just how it is.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.870
Okay?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.580
Money likes to be seduced.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.940
Money's attracted to seducers.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.920
Just like a woman doesn't like a desperate
man, money doesn't like desperate people.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.022
Money's not attracted to desperate people
who want it so bad because they want to make

00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:05.370
this money and show it off to everybody.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.750
No, no.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.060
You need to seduce money.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.060
Seduce money.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.350
And all of a sudden money says, ooh, I like
this guy.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.680
I like this girl.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680
Oh my gosh!

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.420
I'm turned on to you.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.410
Don't let money seduce you.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.690
You seduce money.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.160
It's a seduction game.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.330
So whoever learns the seduction game with
money, all of a sudden money starts coming

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.920
from all over the place to you, because money
is turned on by people that know exactly what

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.120
they're doing.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.990
Money likes investors who know what they're
doing.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.990
Okay?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.490
A girl goes on a date with a guy that knows
what he's doing, she's most likely to come

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.670
back and then there's experience.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.510
So learn how to seduce money, once you learn
this whole thing you'll get better at this

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.400
game as well.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.860
Next, timing, when it comes down to money.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.860
Let me explain about timing.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.610
I'm not talking about timing like this is
the best time to invest into Snapchat or this

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.240
is the best time to buy the IPO of Facebook
and etc.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.190
I'm not talking that timing.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.930
Although that's a whole different conversation
with timing.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.310
Timing I'm talking about, running a business.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.310
I'll give you an idea.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.009
There was a time where logically I had to
cut down.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.009
Okay.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.030
In my business.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.259
And I had to get rid of two or three employees.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.860
Logically I had to cut down.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.310
But I knew what I was getting ready to do
and I had access to all the information.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.040
I decided to double down and that helped expand
the business to new areas, new territories.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.170
So, and then the other part is cutting down
expenses, you knowing, maybe numbers are looking

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.070
very good, but there's an area that needs
to be cut down that no one knows about the

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.070
information.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.520
You need to cut down because you have access
to all the information.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.040
So there's got to be a part where you need
to know.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.740
And this is the thing we can't teach you.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.669
This is not something I can teach you about.

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.350
But this is going to be a part of it, that
you're going to learn from experience with

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.400
timing.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.590
Timing with when you buy.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.610
Timing on when you invest.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.800
Timing on when you stay light.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.590
Timing on when you stay liquid.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.590
Timing on when you go.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.900
. . there's a timing aspect to all those decisions
you'll make.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900
#6, boredom.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.139
Let me explain what boredom means.

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:01.630
Money needs to be moved.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.630
Okay?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.190
Again, if a girl is bored with you, she leaves
you, because you're too boring.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.190
Same with men.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.820
If a man is bored with a girl, they're going
to leave.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.370
Because it's boring.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.720
Money doesn't like to be bored.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.810
What do I mean?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.520
If money stays in a checking account, money's
going to somebody else who knows how to use

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.850
that money.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.940
If money is just staying somewhere, and it's
not working, it's too boring, it goes to somebody

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.990
else that knows what to do with money.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.460
So you've got to make sure money's always
moving.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.800
Money's always moving for you.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800
Always moving for you.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.430
Always moving for you.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.490
Always working for you.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.390
Always out there doing something to create
more money for you.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.789
Next, secret account.

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:40.820
You always have to have a secret account.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.280
Let me tell you what a secret account is.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.280
It's an account that no one knows about - your
wife, your husband, your boyfriend, girlfriend,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.979
mom, dad, brother, sister - no one knows about
this account.

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.300
What is this account?

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.539
It's a crisis account.

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:54.229
A crisis account could be cash.

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.690
A crisis account could be somewhere sitting
down that no one knows.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.319
But I know you may say Pat, you talked about
boredom.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.090
Two completely different stories.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.900
You've got to have a crisis account, that's
not your emergency fund.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.530
I'm not talking emergency fund that this is
the right thing to do.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.660
I'm talking a crisis account.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.759
What saved the business when we were going
through a difficult times, and our company's

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:15.139
checking account went to $13,000.

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:18.730
I had payroll, commissions, everything, $13,000.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.950
We were about to shut down the company.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.950
It was this close.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.290
We're about to shut down the company.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.440
What saved us was the crisis account that
I had.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.880
No one knew about it.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.569
That money showed up, put it back into the
business, saved us, we lasted, we made it

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:34.729
through the tough times, and now we're here
where we are today.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:38.039
But it's because I had a secret crisis account
no one else knew about.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.290
You need to always have a secret crisis account.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.610
#8, don't fly first class until you have $10
million in the bank account.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.260
I see so many people spending two grand on
a flight where they can spend $400.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.080
Listen, I'm 6'4", 6'5", 240, and do you know
how many times till today I've paid first

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080
class?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.080
Zero!

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080
I don't pay first class.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.910
Other people pay for my first class, but I
don't pay first class.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.350
I've been paid first class, flown first class
many, many times because I have the miles

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.050
or people pay for my flight.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.760
I don't pay first class.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760
And why is that?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.760
Here's how I did the math.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.050
Now obviously, I can afford to do it, no problem.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.410
But here's how I did the math.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.520
You're trying to tell me that $2,000 for a
first class flight and I can get $500 for

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:22.580
the same flight, that $1500 times nine flights
in a month, that's 9 x $1500, is $13500, some

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.480
number like that.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.180
You know what I can do with that number?

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.880
That's four employees.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880
That's marketing.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.040
That's expansion.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.820
Over a year that's $200,000, $180,000.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.910
Why am I going to waste that money?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.730
That's an executive I can bring in.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.920
That's two incredible employees I can bring
in.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.370
I don't pay first class.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.370
Other people pay first class.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.860
Once you get 10 million bucks and you want
to do it, that's great.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.529
At that point you may want to get yourself
a private jet, but don't fly first class.

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:47.860
Next, comp plan.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.860
Let me explain to you what I mean by comp
plan.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.220
So, no matter what country you live in, okay,
I get emails from 100 plus countries around

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.240
the world and some of you guys and I talk
through your communistic system, how you're

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.650
upset and you ask me what to do and I tell
you if it's not going to change, you have

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.650
to leave.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.670
You have to leave a communistic regime you're
part of.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.960
Some of you are in socialistic places, France,
taxes, Spain.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.820
You're upset with the taxes being where they're
at, and I tell you, if you don't see the horizon

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.820
changing, you need to adjust.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.890
But regardless of where you're at, rule #1
about your comp plan, your comp plan at whatever

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.010
country you live in is your taxes.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.170
Study how you get taxed, because that's your
comp plan.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.060
And let me explain to you why the comp plan
in America does so well.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.269
A lot of people say things like this, they'll
say, "you know what?

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:35.490
I can't believe the tax structure in America
benefits business owners and you know why

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.490
is it that they benefit business owners?"

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.910
Because business owners create jobs.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.880
If you created jobs, we'd give you a tax benefit.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.240
If there wasn't a tax benefit, and incentive
for business owners, then who's going to create

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.050
jobs for all these millions of people that
need jobs?

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.970
So you may say, "Well, Pat, if the incentives
are for business owners, shouldn't I be a

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.100
business owner?"

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.100
Yes!

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.529
Every single episode's about you becoming
an entrepreneur.

00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:58.529
Yes.

00:10:58.529 --> 00:10:59.529
You ought to be a business owner.

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:00.950
You ought to be an entrepreneur.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.670
Because it benefits you in your comp plan.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.550
It benefits you in your comp plan.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.080
And position yourself properly by knowing
what your comp plan is.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.160
Rule #10, end of the world mentality.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.550
Listen, CNN, MSNBC, Fox, Suze Orman, Dave
Ramsey, whatever these names you want to go

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.610
through, all of these names put them all together.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.200
You know what they get paid to do?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:29.660
They get paid to sell crisis, because if it
happens, you've got to be ready for it.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.660
Okay?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.300
And so what happens a lot of times is people
get afraid.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.490
And they think it's the end of the world.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.330
And like when in 2008 the market crisis took
place, the market went all the way down to

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.560
6000 something, Dow Jones did, everybody started
pulling their money out.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.920
It's at 21,000 points today.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.720
Imagine if you left the money in.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.220
How much compounding money was lost, simply
because you thought it was the end of the

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.300
world?

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.800
Simply because you thought there was a nuclear
war that was going to happen all over the

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800
world.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.750
By the way, let me explain to you, if truly
a nuclear war's going to happen, do you really

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.399
think your money matters?

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.399
C'mon.

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:04.090
We're not going to exist.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.480
So you've got to act as if there's no nuclear
war that's going to take place and panic so

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.769
much when everybody tells you everything,
and you've got to learn how to manage those

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:17.800
times when 90% of the world thinks it's the
end of the world, you've got to be ready.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800
So how do you do that?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800
Let me explain.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.839
I was part of the community that said it's
always the end of the world, until I realized

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:27.480
how you become wealthy is during this time.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.740
During this time when it's the end of the
world, you know who wins?

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.170
Those who have cash.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.600
This is why it's important to have cash set
aside.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.459
And I'm not talking boredom money.

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:41.140
I'm talking cash set aside when it's the end
of the world for you to buy stuff.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.710
Every time crisis takes place, a lot of people
become wealthy.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.300
A LOT of people become wealthy.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.890
Because everything's on sale.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.330
Everything's on sale when there's crisis.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.600
People sell their exotics because they can't
afford it.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.769
People sell their art work for 1/5 of the
price.

00:12:57.769 --> 00:13:00.440
Homes sell for 1/2 of the price.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.940
Investments, all these things are for sale
during the time when there's the end of the

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.829
world type of mentality.

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:09.089
So you've got to have a strategy for this
time.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:12.029
Some say markets about to tank again, in the
next two to three years.

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:13.980
I don't know if it is going to tank in the
next two to three years.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.980
Here's what I do know.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.470
It's going to tank in the next 20 years.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.529
And I'm ready for it.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:19.209
And I have to be ready for it.

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:20.740
Because there's going to be opportunities.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.510
You also got to be ready for it.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.170
#11, study your politicians, especially your
president.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.750
Let me explain to you why.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.620
You've got to know what your politicians in
your local community are going to do and what

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.149
their philosophies are.

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:33.149
Here's why you need to know their philosophies.

00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:39.210
If their philosophy is to do heavy duty taxing
on you, you need to adjust accordingly.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.240
If their philosophy is cut down taxes, you
need to adjust accordingly.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.300
People ask me, Pat, what am I going to do
with Trump?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.300
Start a business!

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.300
Taxes are being cut.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.649
Go make your millions of dollars in the next
four years.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:51.440
And if it's eight years, go make your money.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.440
Adjust.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440
Everything's about adjustment.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.230
But you can't not know what their philosophies
are.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.589
You need to know the philosophies of the politicians
in your community.

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:01.460
#12, study smart investors but don't be too
religious about them.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.380
Like for instance, you ought to read everything
Warren Buffett's got.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.200
Read every single thing Warren Buffett's got.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.360
Every single thing.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.700
Read any of the books he's got, go read them.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.709
Because what he's going to teach you is his
way of thinking.

00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:12.709
His mindset.

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:13.899
He's going to teach you the way he thinks.

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:18.750
Like some people ask, "Why did Warren Buffett
spend $35 million to buy silver six years

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.220
ago and why did he. . . and why does not do
any technology and stays away from it?

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.279
You know, why does he. . . these are philosophies.

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:28.639
The thing you've got to respect about Warren
Buffett is when he says, "I don't do technology,"

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.459
he didn't do technology.

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:33.910
So he stuck to a philosophy long enough until
it worked.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.600
Study smart investors.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.940
#13, play your game.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.940
Don't compare.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.940
Let me explain.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.560
This is extremely problematic to a lot of
people because let's just say on this doubles

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.420
game, you're here [$8,000].

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.139
And let's just say your cousin is here [$4,096,000].

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.420
Why are you comparing yourself to him?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.600
You need to play your doubles game.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.889
Let's say you're here [$8,000].

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:57.440
Let's say your best friend is here [$128,000].

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.630
It's not the same game.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.490
He's four doubles ahead of you.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.490
It's not the same game.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.890
You've just got to make sure to play your
game.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.521
You can't say, "I'm going to play my game
at the level with the other guys," because

00:15:06.521 --> 00:15:10.480
when you do that way, you make reckless decisions
and you lose a double.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.320
You don't want to lose doubles.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.040
You want to gain doubles.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.900
I hope I'm making sense to you.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.373
You don't want to go backwards and any time
you focus on this guy [people ahead of you],

00:15:19.373 --> 00:15:20.580
you sometimes go backwards.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.510
So focus on your game.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.810
Focus on your strategies.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.200
Focus on your time horizon.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.670
Focus on your risk tolerance, and play according
to that game.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.420
Your vision may not be to be a billionaire.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.550
Your vision may not be to go out there and
do something very big.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.459
Your vision may not be to be a person that's
got $150 million bucks.

00:15:37.459 --> 00:15:39.329
Your vision may not be to be a deca-millionaire.

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:41.589
Your vision may be, I want to one day have
$2 million.

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:42.880
That's all good.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.910
Play to that game.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.350
And put a plan next to it.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.350
Play to that game.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.220
But don't constantly compare yourself to other
people.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.280
Next, index.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.040
A lot of people say, "Well, as long as you
beat the index."

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.940
Okay, as long as you beat the index.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.000
I am more concerned of beating my goals than
I am about beating the index.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.570
I'm not worried about beating the index.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.920
I'm worried about beating my goal.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920
What is my goal?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920
What is the deadline?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920
I want to beat that number.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.920
Because it's mine.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920
That's what I'm committed to.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920
What is my deadline?

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920
And I'm committed to this.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.950
I'm not committed to the index.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:12.959
I'm committed to this.

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.149
Maybe I need to do a lot more than what the
index is doing.

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:16.839
Because this is why I'm in business.

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:19.980
In business I can control the amount of growth
I'm going to have in my income.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.630
I can't control if I'm studying just the index
and the index is going 11.9%, and I beat it

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.660
2.3%, but that's going to take me a long time
to get over here [bottom of doubles].

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.660
No, no.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.660
Play your game.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.670
Beat your goals instead of trying to beat
the index only.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.950
#15 - befriend money makers.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.720
I'll tell you why befriend money makers that
you trust.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.690
If you're around other people that know how
to make money, you're going to make money.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.480
That's just kind of how things work out.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.699
If you're around people that know how to make
money, you're generally going to make money.

00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:49.860
If you're around people that don't even know
how to make money, or don't even make a lot

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.050
of money, you're not going to make a lot of
money.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.740
You know, so know who you're going into business
with, know who you're doing things with.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.709
Sometimes things seem too sweet or sexy and
all this stuff, but you don't know the person.

00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:01.410
I don't touch any of that stuff.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.370
It's important for me to know who I'm going
to be doing business with.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.410
I hire very slowly.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.410
Very slowly.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.410
I fire very fast.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.109
The moment I'm done with somebody [snap],
boom, gone.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.679
Four people we fire in a day, no problem.

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:15.559
I can't do this, the tolerance is not in the
right place, we can't do this, we need to

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:16.559
move on.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.559
But I hire slowly.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:21.110
Especially the higher up it is, the more I
travel with the person to get to know them.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.100
Same exact thing when it comes down to here.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.239
Whoever you're going to do business with,
befriend them.

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:26.239
Travel with them.

00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:28.620
If somebody's extremely wealthy, go to dinner
with them.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.620
Get to know their wife.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.620
See how they are around their kids.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.620
Kind of see their standards of living, see
their discipline, see their behavior and then

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.690
say, "I like this person.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.149
I like what their friends say about them.

00:17:37.149 --> 00:17:38.589
I like how his.

00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:41.019
. ." This is the person I can do business
with.

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:44.539
#16: Diversification is for absolute sissies.

00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:45.539
Okay?

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:48.009
So if you're a sissy, and your risk tolerance
is very low, it's okay.

00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:49.009
It's okay to be a sissy.

00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:51.049
A lot of people are sissies.

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:54.619
But if you truly want to create your wealth,
and you're wondering why in your lifetime

00:17:54.619 --> 00:18:00.780
you work for 17 years and you don't have a
single penny, and you've made $617,000, yet

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.679
you only have $6,000 to show for it, there's
a problem there.

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:05.679
There's a problem there.

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:07.470
What is the problem?

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:13.289
Diversification is a great concept to sell
for these expert financial advisers that are

00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:16.399
playing every single thing safe and all these
other things, yes.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:20.640
Now, for those of you that are watching this
and you're 73 years old, diversification may

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.850
be good for you, if you already have hit your
goal of $6 million and you're where you're

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.850
at.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:28.590
You're 62 years old, and I respect the fact
that you already hit your numbers are solid.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.100
Risk tolerance is lower, time horizon lower.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.809
Okay, you're playing a different game.

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:37.580
I'm talking mainly to the people that are
in the offensive mode of their lives.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.092
That you're trying to get here [near the bottom].

00:18:39.092 --> 00:18:40.750
Maybe you're around this market [middle].

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.820
I'm not talking to the people that are here
[at the bottom].

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.690
I'm talking to the people that are here [between
the front and middle].

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.149
You're trying to get your doubles to go quickly,
faster.

00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:52.859
If you just rely on diversification, 20, 30,
40 years, well, you just got to know that's

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:55.249
going to take 40 years, it's going to take
30 years.

00:18:55.249 --> 00:18:56.249
Maybe.

00:18:56.249 --> 00:18:57.750
That's if everything goes the way it's supposed
to be going.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.010
So I don't recommend just relying on diversification
to take you to where you want to get to.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.210
17, the game is about leverage.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.210
Everything is leverage.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.210
Now let me explain what leverage means.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.330
I'm not saying leverage go into debt with
everything.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.529
I'm not talking about leverage like that.

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:11.720
I'm talking about leverage, period.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.019
What could leverage be?

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:14.019
Leverage your business.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:16.499
How can you grow your business if you're running
a business?

00:19:16.499 --> 00:19:18.299
How can you leverage to have more support?

00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:19.710
How can you leverage to sell more?

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.850
How can you leverage to expand more?

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.000
How can you leverage to increase the volume
of business more?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.330
How can you leverage to market yourself more?

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.190
How can you leverage to get to the customer
faster?

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.090
How can you leverage to increase the speed
of growth of your business?

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.320
How can you leverage to get certain things
going?

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.539
How can you leverage?

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:37.010
Everything is a leverage game.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.119
Everything is a leverage game.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:42.210
And the more you study the concept of leverage
and the game how it works, the better it is

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.210
for your wealth.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.210
#18, positioning.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.289
Positioning has to do with, for instance,
I'll tell you what positioning is.

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:51.530
We could do a whole thing on positioning,
but I'm just going to give it to you in a

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.720
shorter sentence.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720
Positioning.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.259
If I'm going to go work at a company and I'm
going to have a piece of the equity, and I'm

00:19:56.259 --> 00:19:59.289
going to position myself to own a piece of
that company, and it's going to go public,

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:00.840
that's smart positioning.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.450
That's very, very smart positioning.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:08.529
Tom over here who's our president, Tom created
his wealth by positioning.

00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:11.639
He went and positioned himself in certain
places and participated in the victory by

00:20:11.639 --> 00:20:14.529
owning a piece and he positioned himself.

00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:16.039
Sometimes it's positioning.

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.210
Sometimes it's who you're running with.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.720
A lot of times it goes like, "I'm making great
income with this company I'm at."

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.549
Yeah, but you haven't positioned yourself
yet because there's no backing on the equity.

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:25.729
So it's positioning.

00:20:25.729 --> 00:20:29.480
You've got to also position yourself here
to make sure you're taking care of that part,

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480
right?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.940
Of course you've got to take care of your
credit, you've got a high income, savings,

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.039
investments, but you've got to make sure you're
positioning yourself properly as well.

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:39.419
#19, strategic partnerships.

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:40.659
Strategic partnerships.

00:20:40.659 --> 00:20:45.580
The more you can create an environment, it's
kind of similar to befriend money makers,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.179
but this is slightly different because it's
intentional.

00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:52.720
If you can figure like what we do at our company,
is we have strategic partnerships where a

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.519
lot of people make money.

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.519
Okay?

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:59.899
The more people make money, the more people
continue to do business with you, if there

00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:01.080
are strategic partnerships.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.369
I have strategic partnerships with $400 billion
companies, $200 billion companies, $60 billion

00:21:06.369 --> 00:21:07.369
companies.

00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:10.890
I have strategic partnerships with a lot of
different companies that benefits them.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.890
Okay?

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.480
Strategic partnerships increases the value
of making money because a lot more people

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.649
are making money with you when they go into
business with you.

00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:18.649
Last but not least, big check syndrome.

00:21:18.649 --> 00:21:20.529
Let me tell you what the big check syndrome
is.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:24.119
Oh my gosh, I've seen so many people screw
this whole thing up.

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:25.769
And I'll just explain to you what it is.

00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:33.609
So, for instance, say you are doing real estate,
hypothetically.

00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:34.609
Okay.

00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:38.419
And all of a sudden, you get this one client
wants you to sell their home.

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:39.450
It's a $3 million home.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.049
I'm just throwing numbers out there.

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:45.039
And you go and sell this $3 million home,
and the check is a hundred and some thousand

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.629
dollars that you get.

00:21:46.629 --> 00:21:51.509
And you say, "Oh my gosh, I made $100,000
and for two months, you live as if you made

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:52.729
$100,000 in a month.

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:58.879
What you don't realize is that $100,000 check
in a month, you need to look at it as an $8300

00:21:58.879 --> 00:22:00.700
a month income for that year.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.009
That's what that means.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:03.009
It's not $100,000.

00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:09.999
And I've seen so many people who treat this
as $100,000 in a month, and they get cocky,

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:11.849
arrogant, all this stuff.

00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:14.399
And then they go back to right here [beginning
of double].

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.679
And their double goes lower and lower and
lower.

00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:19.789
And they don't realize it's just a big payday.

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:20.919
Let me explain.

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:26.860
Would you rather have right now a half a million
dollar cash I give you.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.570
Watch this question, you're going to answer.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.489
Would you rather take a half a million dollars,
okay, given to you, up front, I'm going to

00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:39.590
give you a half a million dollars or would
you rather take an income stream, guaranteed

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.590
of $100,000 over 20 years?

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.690
Which one would you take?

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.849
Half a million up front, $100,000 over 20
years?

00:22:46.849 --> 00:22:49.279
Which one would you take?

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:53.289
Believe it or not, most people will say, well,
I think the right answer is $100,000.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.340
Most people would take a half a million.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.559
Let me tell you why the $100,000 allows you
to do more.

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:00.489
The 100,000 is two million bucks.

00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:02.539
The half a million dollars is a half a million
bucks.

00:23:02.539 --> 00:23:07.080
See, this gives me the opportunity to have
a stronger backing to make bigger decisions

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.639
to get bigger doubles.

00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:11.460
Now you may say, Pat, but half a million dollars?

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.629
That already puts me here [$512,000].

00:23:12.629 --> 00:23:14.529
It's irrelevant if you don't know how to play
the money game.

00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:17.389
It's irrelevant if you don't know how to play
the money game.

00:23:17.389 --> 00:23:19.269
I want high income as well.

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:25.080
I want income coming in that feeds my game
so I can increase my net worth.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.840
This [income] is a very, very important game,
so don't get too crazy about big check syndrome

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.359
and all of a sudden fall for it and lose everything
that you got because it can totally mess up

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:37.879
your net worth and you work all the way back
to your double.

00:23:37.879 --> 00:23:40.610
So with that being said, this is what I want
to do to you.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.269
This episode is obviously an episode that
people would want to look at on a PDF.

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:46.690
So we're going to give you a free PDF.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.120
But this is what you need to do.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.220
You need to visit PatrickBetDavid.com, we'll
put the link on the bottom of the YouTube

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.360
video as well so you can see it, but if you're
not here and you're seeing this video on a

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.460
completely different place, because videos
nowadays are being shared everywhere, you

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.239
can go to PatrickBetDavid.com, okay.

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:04.469
When you go to the website, the link for this
is going to be there.

00:24:04.469 --> 00:24:05.570
Look for the link.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.110
And if you don't see it anywhere, just go
on the search on the bottom of my website,

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.470
Paul, show exactly where the search would
be.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.129
Type in "money," and this will come up.

00:24:13.129 --> 00:24:15.629
Rules of money, this will come up and get
the free PDF.

00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:19.840
Print it out, and look at it and start studying
which of those 20 rules you follow and you

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.159
do very well at, and which you don't, and
start adjusting to it, and study the areas

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:25.299
that you need to improve in those games.

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:29.870
So with that being said, if you have any questions,
any thoughts, any comments, comment on the

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.969
bottom.

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.239
And thanks for watching everybody.

00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:33.239
Take care.

00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:34.239
Bye bye.

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.239
Hey, thanks for watching this video.

00:24:35.239 --> 00:24:38.249
Let me make a case for you why I believe you
need to subscribe to Valuetainment and also

00:24:38.249 --> 00:24:39.820
join the notification squad.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.769
Look, there's two ways you can learn about
business.

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:42.859
One of the ways is go to college.

00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:47.820
Learn a bunch of theories by professors who
have probably never ran a business before

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.779
or you can watch Valuetainment, ran by entrepreneurs
who have built and sold businesses and you

00:24:52.779 --> 00:24:56.010
can learn from our mistakes and what we do
right.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:01.919
And by the way, I'm willing to bet anybody
who goes and takes this boring route vs. watches

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:05.499
Valuetainment, I'm putting my money on this
person who watches Valuetainment is going

00:25:05.499 --> 00:25:07.460
to beat the person who goes to college.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.460
You don't believe me?

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.570
Test me on this.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:15.080
This is why I'm so certain you need to subscribe
to Valuetainment and learn the content so

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.669
you can also be a successful entrepreneur.
