00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.749
PLEASE WELCOME OUR GOOD FRIEND
PROFESSOR THE LORD ROBERT

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.982 align:start size:88% position:13%
WINSTON.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.751
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO SEE
US.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:18.952 size:88% position:56%
WE LOVE IT WHEN YOU STOP BY.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.224
SO ROBERT, WE ARE READY, WE'RE
IN THE ZONE.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.558
LET'S GET OUR SCIENCE ON.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.128
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE DOING
FIRST.

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.129
&gt;&gt; LET'S START WITH THE THING AT
THE END.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.230 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; James: WITH THIS.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.597 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; COME AROUND.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: OKAY.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.201 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; SO BASICALLY YOU HAVE GOT
QUITE A SMART WHITE COAT ON.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:40.940 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: YES, I'M A
SCIENTIST.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.341 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IT'S TOO SMART.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:41.708 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: WHAT?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:41.941 align:start size:88% position:13%
ROBERT.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.342 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT IS.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:48.548
&gt;&gt; LOOK, YOU ARE A BIT BLUER.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.517
THAT SUIT ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING,
IS IT?

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:55.655 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: WELL, IT'S WORTH A
LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.757 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A SOLUTION TO DRY
CLEANING.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:58.725 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; James: RIGHT.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.294 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS ALKALI.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:05.031
AND IT IS BLUE BECAUSE IT HAS A
BLUE DIE IN IT AND WE ARE GOING

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:07.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
TO SKIRT YOU WITH ACID TO
NEUTRALIZE IT.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.935 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; James: HANG ON.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:13.907 size:78% position:39%
WHAT DO YOU MEAN.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start size:88% position:13%
LOOK AT THAT?

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:15.408 align:start size:88% position:13%
LOOK.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.976 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND THEN IT.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:17.944 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; IT'S RUBBISH.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:22.649
THIS IS CARBON DIE OXIDE, SO
CARBONIC ACID IS ACTUALLY MUCH

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.216 align:start size:88% position:13%
MORE EFFECTIVE.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.585 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: OKAY.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:32.959
LET ME STAND WELL BACK.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.630
NOW WAIT FOR THE REACTION.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.666 size:84% position:42%
LOOK, ALMOST CLEAN.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:45.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
(APPLAUSE).

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.842 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; James: RIGHT, I FEEL LIKE
THIS ISN'T EVEN A SCIENCE THING,

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:52.212
YOU'VE JUST COME UP WITH SOME
WAY TO DO THAT TO ME.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.047
THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.282 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:56.649 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S JUST GONE.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.552 align:start size:88% position:13%
I MEAN IT'S FREEZING COLD, I
WILL GIVE IT THAT.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.654
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOTS FOR US,
WHAT ELSE.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.590
&gt;&gt; LET ME SEE, WE'VE GOT THIS.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.325
&gt;&gt; James: WHAT IS THAT?

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:10.663
&gt;&gt; THAT IS LACAPODIUM POWDER.
AND ST QUITE EXPLOSIVE.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.366
SO YOU CAN-- DO YOU WANT TO TRY
LIGHTING IT.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.301 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: NO.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:15.668 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; GO ON.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:19.806 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; James: WHEN YOU SAY QUITE
EXPLOSIVE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.409
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN, HOW
EXPLOSIVE IS THIS.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.744 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; SEVEN.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:25.044 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER).

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.779
&gt;&gt; James: THAT FEELS A LOT.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:26.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
RIGHT.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.885
WHAT AM I DOING, JUST LIGHTING
THIS.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.854
&gt;&gt; THESE ARE EXCEPTIONALLY FINE
PARTICLES THEY ARE ABOUT

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:35.822
1,000th MILL MEETER ACROSS.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:36.556 size:88% position:44%
ALL PACKED TOGETHER.

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.827
THEY COME FROM A PLANT CALLED
LACAPODIUM.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:47.467
AND IT'S A MOSS AND IT'S USED BY
ALL SORTS OF HOMEOPO, THIS IS TO

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:54.507
CURE DIARRHEA, SUPPOSED TO BE AN
APHRODISIA BUT IT ALSO IS

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:54.774 align:start size:88% position:13%
EXPLOSIVE.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:58.211
&gt;&gt; James: IT CURES DIARRHEA
AND IS ALSO AN APHRODISIAC.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.047
&gt;&gt; IT IS HOMOPATHIC SO IT
PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.250
&gt;&gt; James: SO WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN I LIGHT THIS.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.722
&gt;&gt; LET'S JUST HAVE A LOOK.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.791
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE, IS
IT?

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: WELL, I MEAN, IS
THAT IT?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.329 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S A VERY FINE
POWDER.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.730
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW FINE IT IS.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.869
IF WE PUT IT IN THIS WATER.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.037
&gt;&gt; James: YEAH, PUT IT ON
WATER, THAT WILL SET IT ON FIRE,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:24.270 align:start size:88% position:13%
ROBERT.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.139 size:88% position:56%
I MEAN WHO IS THE SCIENTIST.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.508 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; IT'S HIDE DRO PHOBIC NOW.

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.745 align:end position:100%
THIS ISN'T TERRIBLY POISONOUS SO
PUT YOUR FINGER THROUGH THAT

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:32.946 align:start size:88% position:13%
DUST.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:36.216
&gt;&gt; James: WHEN YOU SAY
TERRIBLY POISONOUS, I WANT IT TO

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:41.921
BE NOT POISONOUS OR POISONNIST
ONCE PUT YOUR PING-- FINGER IN.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.057 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: REALLY, ARE YOU
SURE.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:44.424 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.058 align:start size:88% position:13%
GENTLY.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.628
NO, NO, THROUGH THE POWDER, NOT
IN THE WATER.

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.663
&gt;&gt; James: WHAT DO YOU MEAN.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.331 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; LIKE THAT.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.467 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; James: OH, LOOK, OH, WOW.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.202
&gt;&gt; SO BASICALLY IT IS COMPLETELY
DRY.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:56.970 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: YEAH.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.006
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT IS PROTECTING MY
FINGER AGAINST THE WATER BECAUSE

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:00.940
OF THE SURFACE TENSION.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.976 size:88% position:56%
NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:07.847
WE WILL MAKE SOMETHING A LITTLE
BIT MORE CHALLENGING.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:08.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: OKAY.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.582
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT SOME OF THE POWDER
IN THIS SHOE.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.185
AND I WANT YOU TO BE ABSOLUTELY,
YOU MUST PROMISE ME.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.686 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: YES.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:17.557
&gt;&gt; THAT YOU WILL BLOW INTO THIS
SHOE AND NOT SUCK IT.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:18.691 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; James: SURE, YES.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.792
&gt;&gt; HOLD IT LIKE THAT.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:24.030
&gt;&gt; James: I HAVE DONE THIS AT
THE SIDE OF THE ROW BEFORE.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.332
&gt;&gt; James: PUT YOUR GOGGLES ON.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:26.566 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.967 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; James: ALL RIGHT.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.335 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING IT LIGHT THIS
THING.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.069 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: YEAH.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.540
&gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW, NOT
TOO HARD, FAIRLY CONTINUOUSLY

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.478
GENTLY AND I AM GOING TO TRY AND
SET THE WHOLE THEATER UPON FIRE.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.281
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, DON'T DO IT
UNTIL I TELL YOU.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:47.587
&gt;&gt; James: DON'T WORRY, I'M IN
NO RUSH.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.722 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; GO.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:57.497
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; SO BASICALLY THAT WORKS CUZ

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:00.166
THOSE PARTICLES, THOSE LITTLE
SEEDS ARE FULL OF FAT.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.534 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: YEAH.

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:05.104
&gt;&gt; AND THAT FAT IGNITES AND WHEN
THE PARTICLES ARE MIXING WITH

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:08.441
OXYGEN AND SEPARATED FROM EACH
OTHER THEY CAN OXIDIZE, THEY CAN

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:08.641 align:start size:88% position:13%
BURN.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:09.542
&gt;&gt; James: THAT'S AMAZING.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.812
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US NOW,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:13.346
&gt;&gt; COME ON THE FRONT.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.480 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: OKAY.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL RIGHT.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.084
&gt;&gt; WATCH THESE TWO BA BE LOOS.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.286 align:start size:88% position:13%
ONE HAS BEEN BLOWN UP WITH
ORDINARY AIR.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.821
&gt;&gt; James: WHAT IS IN THAT ONE.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:22.855 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; THAT ONE IS REALLY HEAVY.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:23.856 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; James: YES STRKS.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:24.524 size:78% position:39%
WHAT IS IN THERE.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:30.697
&gt;&gt; PICK IT UP AND SEE T IS
SULFUR HEXO FLOUR IDENTIFY WHICH

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.866
IS ONE THE HEAVIEST GASES
AVAILABLE, ABOUT SIX TIMES

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.468
HEAVIER THAN ATMOSPHERIC AIR.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.269 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; James: RIGHT.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.605
&gt;&gt; WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO BECAUSE
IT IS A VERY, VERY DENSE GAS BUT

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:40.740
NOT UNTIL I TELL YOU.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.641 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: OKAY.

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:47.180
&gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO INHALE IT, AND
THEN-- .

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.382 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; James: I DON'T THINK IT'S
THAT SORT OF BALLOON, REG.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.083 align:start size:88% position:13%
GO ON.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.551
YOU WANT ME TO INHALE IT.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.555
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO YOU INHALE IT BUT
YOU MUSTANT INHALE TOO MUCH OF

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:58.825 size:88% position:56%
IT BECAUSE IT WILL FILL YOUR
LUNGS AND DISPLACE ALL THE

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:01.294
OXYGEN AND THAT MIGHT BE A BIT
SAD, REALLY.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:06.499 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
HANG ON.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.900 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt;S THAT A ENOUGH.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: OKAY.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.337 align:start size:88% position:13%
OH MY GOD.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:16.909 align:start size:88% position:13%
OARKSZ MY GOD.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:17.343 size:84% position:42%
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.478
I'M NOT EVEN PUTTING A VOICE ON
MY VOICE.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:25.585
IS I SOUND LIKE THE STAR OF THE
RUN SO HARD.

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:25.952 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; PLEASE CUFF.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:29.122
&gt;&gt; James: HOW LONG WILL IT
STAY LIKE THIS, HOW LONG WILL IT

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:29.789 align:start size:88% position:13%
STAY LIKE THIS.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.457 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHEN DOES IT.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:31.758 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; BREATHE.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:32.925 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; James: WHEN WILL IT COME
BACK.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.094
&gt;&gt; GIVE IT TO REGGIE, HIS VOICE
IS-- .

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:37.730
