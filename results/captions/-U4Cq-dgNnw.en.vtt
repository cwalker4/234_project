00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:19.545
In the late '60s, early '70s,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:23.705
there was a movement
that took place primarily in California,

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:26.251
called the Jesus Movement,

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.590
where ex-hippies grew up
a little bit, had some kids

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.864
and decided to channel all of that
anti-establishment angst into religion.

00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:42.323
My father was one such ex-hippie
and together with my grandfather,

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:46.744
he started a small cult
called the Assembly.

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.123
Yeah, this is a super light-hearted story.

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:52.943
(Laughter)

00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.990
So, I find myself at five years old.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.761
I'm standing on a street corner
in my favorite conservative dress,

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.698
the pink one with the white pinstripes.

00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:08.982
And I have my favorite white purse
slung over my shoulder

00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:11.545
because I love purses,

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.435
almost more than I love Christ himself.

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:15.832
(Laughter)

00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:20.322
And my dad is yelling the gospel
at people as they walk by

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:26.013
because he believes that's a sure-fire way
to win people to Christ.

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:30.493
I'm terrified because I'm a quiet kid,

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:35.533
and I'm shy and I avoid
confrontation at all costs.

00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:38.823
And even in my brief five years of living,

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:40.223
I have learned

00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:45.104
that yelling the gospel can be interpreted
by some as confrontational.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.619
(Chuckling)

00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:53.162
But I've been taught that I could be
the only thing standing between a soul

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:57.637
and the burning, fiery furnaces of hell.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.439
So, there I am.

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:05.459
It's at that moment that I see her.

00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:11.401
She's an older woman
and she's got this gray flyaway hair.

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:14.584
And she's not wearing any nail polish,

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:19.322
and I don't understand how anybody
outside of the group I'm in

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:22.167
would go one day without nail polish,

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:24.552
because I love nail polish,

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.882
almost as much as I love Christ himself.

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:28.293
(Laughter)

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:30.493
But it's totally forbidden.

00:02:32.212 --> 00:02:36.493
She locks eyes with me
and she walks up to me,

00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:40.820
and she gets down
on one knee and she says,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.829
"One day, you will grow up

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:50.207
and you will realize
you can leave all of this."

00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:56.410
All of us have had to grow up
and leave something,

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.121
probably not a cult.

00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:04.723
It might have been an unhealthy
relationship, or a drug habit.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.197
Maybe you just have
a really strong sweet tooth.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:13.653
Leaving is incredibly difficult,

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:17.949
but it is also completely life-changing.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.284
A fun fact that all cults share

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:27.365
is that they reject the label "cult."

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:30.991
Even now, 16 years since I left,

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:37.319
my parents will give me a list of reasons
why the Assembly was not a cult.

00:03:38.312 --> 00:03:39.748
So, fine.

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.141
It wasn't a cult.

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:46.671
It was an evangelical, fundamentalist,

00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.794
non-denominational,
religious, fringe group -

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:52.053
(Laughter)

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:55.944
whose charismatic leader
could do whatever he wanted.

00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:58.342
But it wasn't a cult.

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:01.904
Sure, we had some
strange religious beliefs.

00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:04.440
You might even call them extreme.

00:04:04.963 --> 00:04:08.248
And we did live
in communal homes together.

00:04:08.713 --> 00:04:12.613
Maybe we didn't exactly
integrate into society

00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:15.776
with silly things like demanding careers.

00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:20.953
But it wasn't a cult because we had
mainstream religious beliefs,

00:04:20.953 --> 00:04:24.283
like "God is all-present,"
"God is all-knowing,"

00:04:24.283 --> 00:04:26.432
and "women can't pierce their ears."

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.350
(Laughter)

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:33.557
We wanted to return to the simple life
of the early Christians.

00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:37.957
Not sure we knew exactly
how early we were talking.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.562
We didn't want to be
literally thrown to the lions,

00:04:41.562 --> 00:04:45.924
but also, "do women really need equality"?

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:51.764
So, I guess post-Augustine,
but pre-feminist early Christians.

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:52.961
(Chuckling)

00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:57.631
My grandparents George
and Betty were in charge.

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.894
George was a fantastic public speaker,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.217
a charismatic leader

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:09.055
and an abusive, narcissistic,
pathological liar.

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:14.022
My father was an elder
and my mother was -

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:16.719
his wife.

00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:19.950
But it wasn't a cult

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.491
because women could go
to the beach just like anybody,

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.983
as long as we were fully clothed,

00:05:27.983 --> 00:05:31.832
because nothing derails
the will of an almighty god

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.762
like a woman in a one-piece.

00:05:33.762 --> 00:05:35.449
(Chuckling)

00:05:36.013 --> 00:05:39.304
The Assembly targeted college-aged kids,

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:42.889
vulnerable because they're
on their own for the first time,

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.152
and they're looking for a community,

00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:48.571
a place where they can connect
with other people.

00:05:49.263 --> 00:05:53.631
Every summer, my dad would pack up,
my mom, my sister and I,

00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:58.882
and we would drive to another state
to build the Assembly throughout the US.

00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:02.793
These trips are some
of my favorite childhood memories.

00:06:02.793 --> 00:06:04.713
We had good times together

00:06:04.713 --> 00:06:09.183
and we thought we were doing
"the work of the Lord."

00:06:10.382 --> 00:06:11.901
But as I grew up,

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:17.287
I started to realize the work
of the Lord has a lot of rules.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.314
If you're wondering
what this life looks like,

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:24.555
here is a list of things
that were forbidden:

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:29.786
dating, television, science,

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:32.476
ambitious females.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.513
Those things are so dangerous.

00:06:34.513 --> 00:06:35.614
(Laughter)

00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:38.155
Clapping loudly after a performance.

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:41.882
God only gets the glory
with the soft clap.

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:47.254
Also forbidden: psychiatry,
dancing, happiness, freedom,

00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:48.992
adorable baby puppies.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.260
(Laughter)

00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:57.053
But don't worry, there was still so much
in the Assembly that we could enjoy,

00:06:57.053 --> 00:06:58.435
like -

00:06:58.914 --> 00:07:00.163
kale.

00:07:00.413 --> 00:07:01.595
(Laughter)

00:07:03.463 --> 00:07:05.005
Creepy men.

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:06.104
(Laughter)

00:07:06.624 --> 00:07:08.751
Climate change denial.

00:07:09.432 --> 00:07:12.283
Pyramid schemes were a big thing.

00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:13.974
Weird diets.

00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:18.420
Also enjoyable: anxiety,
sorrow, depression.

00:07:19.692 --> 00:07:23.576
Untreated, okay? Because
psychiatry is for unbelievers.

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:27.929
Cults don't want to be defined as a cult

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:32.674
because it empowers its members
to take a critical look at it.

00:07:33.064 --> 00:07:37.460
Language in cults is controlled
because language is powerful.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.468
This happens in the real world, too.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:45.045
Despite what 98%
of our world's scientists say,

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.155
let's not call it climate change.

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.732
When I was five years old,

00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:54.854
my mom was trying to recruit
this hairdresser into our group,

00:07:54.854 --> 00:07:57.131
so she sent me for a haircut.

00:07:58.291 --> 00:08:03.290
I told her that my secret hero was
Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic gymnast,

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.025
and she tried to cut my hair like hers.

00:08:06.454 --> 00:08:08.285
Basically, I came out of there

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:11.487
looking like Javier Bardem
in No Country for Old Men.

00:08:11.487 --> 00:08:13.283
(Laughter)

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:16.080
Maybe a little less murdery.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.493
I was ecstatic.

00:08:18.493 --> 00:08:21.162
My parents were appalled.

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:25.099
Short hair was God's plan for men only.

00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:28.923
At five years old, I had already
foiled the almighty God

00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:34.874
in his somewhat specific
and kind of fragile plan for my hair.

00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:36.661
(Laughter)

00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:40.061
The Assembly had a school
for all of the kids to go to,

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.655
through eighth grade.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:44.955
My mom was the principal
for about two seconds,

00:08:44.955 --> 00:08:48.793
until the elders realized they had
mistakenly put a woman in charge!

00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:50.534
(Laughter)

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:53.904
Women were never encouraged
to be in the workplace,

00:08:53.904 --> 00:08:58.257
but if they had to be,
they should not be in charge of men.

00:08:58.257 --> 00:09:00.144
That wasn't biblical.

00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:03.893
But remember, it wasn't a cult.

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:07.998
It was a wonderful place
to be a young woman.

00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:13.033
We didn't have the burden
of forming our own opinions.

00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:15.586
The men got to do that heavy lifting.

00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:18.536
It's so luxurious
to be told what to think,

00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:22.313
especially by wonderfully
power-hungry men,

00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:24.205
like elder Earl.

00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:29.082
Sure, he didn't see the wisdom
in a good stick of deodorant.

00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:30.313
(Laughter)

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:37.826
But when I was 15 and I had the gall
to wear lipstick to a church meeting,

00:09:38.386 --> 00:09:40.033
he had the wisdom to tell me

00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:44.345
I had distracted him
the entire two-hour meeting,

00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:48.284
because my lips were on my face.

00:09:48.284 --> 00:09:49.455
(Laughter)

00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:54.095
Revlon's light lip blush number 666 -

00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:55.304
(Laughter)

00:09:57.163 --> 00:10:01.349
had kept this poor servant of God
from hearing God's voice.

00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:05.272
That was my bad. I needed to apologize.

00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:12.095
Because the Assembly did target colleges,
I was allowed to go to college.

00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:15.767
And this was the biggest break of my life.

00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:20.334
I had to start a Bible study
on campus at UC, Irvine,

00:10:20.334 --> 00:10:24.151
and I had to live
in a training home in Fullerton.

00:10:25.134 --> 00:10:28.234
Training homes were the Assembly's
communal living homes

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:33.215
where groups of people would live
with an elder, his wife and kids.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:39.512
Basically, it was a super fun way
of making sure that we had no free time.

00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:42.645
Cults are all-consuming.

00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:48.582
They don't allow their members
to invest in a life outside of the group.

00:10:49.653 --> 00:10:53.381
But college became a refuge for me.

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.592
It was the first time in my life

00:10:55.592 --> 00:11:01.804
I could spend hours of my day
without seeing anybody from the Assembly.

00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:06.234
And at the same time,
I was getting an education.

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:12.517
This world that I had been taught was dark
was actually amazing.

00:11:13.001 --> 00:11:14.317
Get this:

00:11:15.294 --> 00:11:17.069
women in the arts,

00:11:17.648 --> 00:11:19.644
women in science.

00:11:20.518 --> 00:11:24.093
There was a place
for me there if I wanted it.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.366
I started to see how small
my worldview really was.

00:11:31.366 --> 00:11:35.075
I could have left the Assembly
by then, I was over 18,

00:11:35.476 --> 00:11:40.049
but in a cult, when you leave,
you're shunned.

00:11:40.052 --> 00:11:44.540
And I wasn't ready
to lose my family and my friends.

00:11:46.223 --> 00:11:51.939
Women, children and people of color were
second-class citizens in the Assembly,

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:53.757
to put it mildly.

00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:58.212
There was emotional
and psychological abuse,

00:11:58.692 --> 00:12:01.168
but there was also physical abuse.

00:12:01.585 --> 00:12:06.062
When I was a young girl,
I saw my uncle abusing my cousins,

00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:09.002
and I told my dad what I had seen.

00:12:09.002 --> 00:12:11.976
He told me he would take care of it.

00:12:12.573 --> 00:12:14.392
And the Assembly did,

00:12:14.392 --> 00:12:16.404
by covering it up.

00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:19.246
Shortly after I graduated from college,

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:24.544
I found out that my uncle's abuse
had just continued the entire time.

00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:28.533
My grandparents had
systematically covered it up,

00:12:28.913 --> 00:12:33.334
and my own parents
and the leadership in the Assembly

00:12:33.334 --> 00:12:38.855
had maintained a code of silence,
"trusting the Lord,"

00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:42.143
when nothing of substance had changed.

00:12:44.624 --> 00:12:48.313
Cults view professional help
from anybody outside of their group

00:12:48.313 --> 00:12:51.041
as a threat to their way of life.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.564
Women were never to leave their husbands,

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:57.193
and we did not believe
divorce was biblical.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:02.344
So, my aunt and cousins had
no safe place to go in the Assembly.

00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:06.255
It was time for me to leave.

00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:11.125
I could not be in a group
that sacrificed women and children

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:14.251
so that a few men could stay in charge.

00:13:14.685 --> 00:13:18.750
Staunch loyalty to any group is wrong

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:25.520
if it means supporting an abusive,
narcissistic, pathological liar.

00:13:27.302 --> 00:13:28.550
Thank you.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.002
(Applause)

00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:43.261
Because that abuse and that pathology,
it doesn't stay up with the leader.

00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:45.865
It trickles down in the group,

00:13:45.865 --> 00:13:49.904
and good people end up
doing really bad things.

00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:54.292
My sister and I left
the Assembly together.

00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:58.294
We confronted our grandparents
with what we had found out,

00:13:58.294 --> 00:14:00.782
and George kicked us out of the house.

00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:06.442
I have never seen my grandparents
since the day I left the Assembly,

00:14:06.442 --> 00:14:11.047
and my relationship
with my parents is complicated.

00:14:13.683 --> 00:14:18.094
It takes a lot of work
to unlearn behaviors

00:14:18.094 --> 00:14:21.052
after you leave something like that.

00:14:21.052 --> 00:14:26.063
There was a lot of questioning
the paradigm I had been raised to believe,

00:14:26.063 --> 00:14:27.873
and it was hard.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.583
But I can tell you that even
the hardest day of freedom

00:14:33.583 --> 00:14:36.966
was better than the best day in a cult.

00:14:38.358 --> 00:14:43.378
So, what does a young woman do once
she's left the cult she was raised in,

00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:46.163
besides a lot of therapy?

00:14:46.163 --> 00:14:47.333
(Laughter)

00:14:47.663 --> 00:14:50.036
I went crazy, you guys!

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:51.803
Crazy.

00:14:51.803 --> 00:14:54.663
I watched every rated-R movie -

00:14:54.663 --> 00:14:55.773
(Laughter)

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.645
that had ever been produced
since the dawn of time, OK?

00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:01.994
I don't regret a minute of it.

00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:06.932
I cut my hair short,
painted my nails Satan-red,

00:15:07.694 --> 00:15:09.433
pierced my ears.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:11.252
More importantly,

00:15:11.252 --> 00:15:13.893
I admitted, "I want to have a career.

00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:17.107
I'm going to be one of those
scary independent women.

00:15:17.544 --> 00:15:22.770
I believe that I'm a feminist
because women are humans."

00:15:23.934 --> 00:15:25.233
I started writing comedy

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:31.542
because comedy for me is the absolute
best way to take ownership of my past.

00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:34.674
Laughing is powerful.

00:15:36.401 --> 00:15:39.622
A few years after I had left the Assembly,

00:15:40.012 --> 00:15:44.523
the romance of short hair
and nail polish had kind of worn off.

00:15:44.523 --> 00:15:47.381
I was walking down the street in LA,

00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:50.012
when I saw her,

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:55.450
a young girl, in a conservative dress.

00:15:56.702 --> 00:16:00.633
She was standing on this street
corner next to a man,

00:16:02.413 --> 00:16:06.915
who was yelling the gospel
at people as they walked by.

00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:14.009
I walked up to her

00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:17.042
and I knelt down in front of her

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.133
and I looked her in the eye

00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:21.153
and I said,

00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:25.383
"One day, you will grow up

00:16:25.713 --> 00:16:30.284
and you will realize
you can leave all of this."

00:16:31.152 --> 00:16:32.493
Thank you.

00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:33.753
(Applause)
