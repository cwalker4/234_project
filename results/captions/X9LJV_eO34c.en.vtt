00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.769
It seems like President Trump
is freaking out

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.670
about the Democrats
running for president.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.273

it's time for "A Closer Look."

Trump spoke this morning
to religious leaders

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.814
at the National
Prayer Breakfast.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.083
It's always
a slightly awkward situation

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.185
for a president
who's been married three times,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.553
paid hush money to a porn star,

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:25.058

skimmed the Bible.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.461
"And as you all know,
God set a fire to a bush

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.296
so he could collect
the insurance money

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.065
and build a casino.

It was smart.
It was a smart move."

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.938
For example, Trump mentioned the
problem of human trafficking,

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:41.640
and here is his expert diagnosis
on what's causing it.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.943
-Together we will
end the "scorj"

that nobody can believe.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:58.758
The Internet came along,
and some good things happened,

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.993
but some very bad things
happened.

That's your expert opinion?

One of the good things
about the Internet

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.674
is you can Google how to
pronounce the word "scourge."

is his thesis statement
for America,

the thing that makes
our country great.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.919
Reagan called it
the shining city on a hill,

America is a place

where you can write
your own destiny.

President Trump's thoughts

on what makes America great.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.830
-America's potential
is unlimited

because our extraordinary people

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.472

that is number one.

-Soaring words.
Just soaring words.

getting lines fed to him

Trump was trying to live up
to the theme of unity

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:13.966
he set out in his State of
the Union address Tuesday.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.302
As we all know,
he's incapable of that.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.270
Trump always needs something
to scare people about,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.406
and in his speech on Tuesday,
he landed on a new target,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.042
warning that Democrats
would turn America
into a socialist country,

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.210
and it prompted
a few scattered reactions

in the audience.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:31.117

stopped socialism by booing it.

Ronald Reagan's famous line --

"Mr. Gorbachev, boo this wall."

of self-described Democratic
socialist Bernie Sanders

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:11.224

in an interview on CNBC,

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin
doubled down on Trump's line

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.260
about socialism,
although the way he said it

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.361

to socialism.

he's probably referring

a high-powered sports agent.

he left the White House,

about socialism in public,

Trump was also claiming
in private that he had predicted

her primary upset last year.

had "it," meaning star power.

Oh, really? You predicted
that one of the most charismatic

at spotting star power

because he thinks
he has star power,

"it," that's not what they mean.

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:01.573
And, by the way, lest you think

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.809
Fox sought out the opinion
of a regular guy,

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:06.311
Hillbilly Gandalf here
reportedly has a net worth

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:08.380
of $15 million,

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.784
plus an extra 38 cents
if he ever combs out his beard.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.919
"Ooh!"

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.855
[ Laughter ]

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.223
And yet somehow the fever dream
got weirder from there

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:20.726
because Robertson went on to
claim that people don't need

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:23.162
healthcare at all
and that he was living proof.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:27.733
-I'm telling her, I have eternal
healthcare, and it's free.

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:31.036
Doctors can give you
a little temporary reprieve,

00:09:31.036 --> 00:09:34.006
but they cannot save you
from physical death.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:37.309
The doctors who treat you,
they die, too. Jesus --

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:39.144
-But you're not dismissing
that we need --

00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:41.346
people need healthcare, right?

00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:42.548
It's just who pays --

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.082
-I didn't have healthcare
for 50 years.

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:46.419
-Well, you look great.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.420
[ Laughter ]

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.260
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.528
The reason they're all freaking
out about Medicare for all

00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:58.864
is because they know it
makes basic sense to people.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.199
Most people don't care
whether it's called socialism

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:02.635
or capitalism or whatever.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.604
They just know it's inherently
unfair for mega-billionaires

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:08.840
to hoard their wealth
while millions of Americans
don't even have healthcare.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.510
Ocasio-Cortez made that point
in an interview recently,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.445
and a Fox News guest
mocked her for it.

00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:17.015
-A system that allows
billionaires to exist

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:20.686
when there are parts of Alabama

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:23.121
where people
are still getting ringworm

00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:26.858
because they don't have access
to public health is wrong.

00:10:26.858 --> 00:10:29.695
-She's saying, Mark,
that basically

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.597
she doesn't want
the kind of poverty

00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:34.433
that leads to lack of healthcare
to exist...

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:37.002
when people are, you know,
allowed to have

00:10:37.002 --> 00:10:39.538
billions of dollars
and be fat cats, essentially.

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:43.108
-Well, first of all, I mean the
fact is ringworm isn't deadly.

00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:46.445
I mean, people get ringworm --
It's like foot fungus.

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:50.749
-"We know ringworm isn't deadly.
For some people, it's jewelry."

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:52.017
[ Laughter ]

00:10:52.017 --> 00:10:55.520
"Will you take this ring
and be my swamp bride?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.923
I'm never gonna die.

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:00.860
You can be on my health
insurance. I get it from Jesus!"

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.695
[ Laughter ]

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:05.064
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.466
Now, there is a reason, a reason

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:11.336
these guys are freaking out
about Medicare for all

00:11:11.336 --> 00:11:13.572
and why most Democrats running
for President are for it.

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:16.809
It makes basic sense to people.
Everyone deserves healthcare.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:19.045
For one very simple reason,
and that is...

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:21.680
-People get sick on Earth
in human form.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.916
-This has been "A Closer Look."
