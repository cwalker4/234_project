00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.481
About a hundred years ago, our understanding
of the fundamental governing rules of the

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.130
universe changed in a radical way.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.330
Rather than the simple and relatively intuitive
world of pendulums and pulleys, Newton's law

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.160
of gravity and Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism,
the discovery of quantum mechanics and Einstein's

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.790
theory of relativity showed us that, at its
core, the universe behaves in rather unexpected

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.820
and non-intuitive ways.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.350
We learned that moving and stationary clocks
tick at different rates and that Schroedinger's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.950
cat was simultaneously dead and alive.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.780
These ideas, and others like them, have bothered
scientists both professional and amateur,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.430
for nearly a century.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.010
In fact, it's unusual that a week goes by
when I don't receive an email or letter from

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.310
some curious soul who thinks they have found
a fatal flaw in the theories of quantum mechanics

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.500
and relativity.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.700
It is very rare that these communications
include an idea that wasn't asked and answered

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.010
years ago.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.061
The simple fact is that, while these theories
are counter-intuitive for most people, they

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.530
also agree remarkably well with measurements.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.820
Like it or not, they're here to stay.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.110
Special relativity was developed in 1905 and
it was in the 1920s in which a cadre of physicists

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.390
worked out the rules of quantum mechanics.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.770
Initially, these two theories were invented
independently, but if they were both true,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.010
then the two ideas needed to be blended together
into a theory that is now called relativistic

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.650
quantum mechanics.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.439
In 1928, British physicist Paul Dirac began
that process.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.560
His equations predicted a new form of matter
existed, what we now call antimatter.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.290
I talked about antimatter in another video,
but the upshot is that the discovery of antimatter

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.649
in 1932 by Carl Anderson gave physicists considerable
reason to not only believe in quantum mechanics

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.040
and relativity separately, but also to believe
that Dirac had combined them properly.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.060
The 1940s brought with them a fuller understanding
of the quantum realm.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.030
Physicists Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger
and Sin Itiro Tomonaga developed what we now

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.480
call Quantum Electrodynamics or QED.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.180
QED is not only a fully relativistic quantum
theory; it also "quantized" the electric field.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.780
In much the same way that early quantum mechanics
showed that matter came in discrete packets,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.040
QED showed that the electric field also came
in packets that we now call photons.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.650
If you feel that quantum mechanics and relativity
have made unsettling claims about reality,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.830
Quantum Mechanics will give you an ulcer.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.110
QED describes two electrons scattering from
one another as one electron emitting a photon,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.110
while the other absorbs it.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.890
That's not so hard to imagine.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.520
However, the exchanged photons differ from
the familiar massless photons of ordinary

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520
light.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.739
For one thing, the photons of QED can actually
have a large mass.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.780
This is not a problem in the quantum world,
which is governed by, among other things,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.780
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.120
Boiled down to its essence, this principle
says that extra energy can simply "just appear"

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.720
for a brief moment, as long it disappears
quickly.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.900
The bigger amount of energy that appears,
the shorter amount of time it can exist.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.510
Although the idea of massive photons already
sounds pretty crazy, QED isn't done yet.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.450
If you follow that idea a little further,
you find out that QED predicts that nothing

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.740
is really something.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.770
I'll wait while you process that last sentence.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.290
Nothing is really something.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.849
So let's see what that means.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.290
We'll start by taking this box, which is filled
with air.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.820
The next step is to take all the air out of
it and shield it so there are no external

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.909
energy fields seeping into it.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.269
With nothing inside, surely it's empty.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.269
Right?

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.269
Well let's start zooming in.

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.780
Maestro, can you zoom a bit?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.030
Nope... not seeing anything.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.199
Maybe a little more?

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.600
This isn't getting us anywhere.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.550
Time to pull out the big guns.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.910
Maestro, can you do the quantum zoom?

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.699
The image youï¿½re seeing gives you an idea
of the smallest quantum reality.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.759
The flickering colors represent the constant
creation and destruction of matter and antimatter.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.379
Electrons and antimatter electrons, quarks
and antimatter quarks... they are created

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.770
from nothing and disappear back into nothingness.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.860
We can see that when we look at what is going
on at the smallest and most quantum of scales

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.469
that empty space is actually extremely busy.

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.199
Scientists have a name for these effervescent
subatomic objects.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.819
They are called virtual particles.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.509
There are lots of other ways to visualize
this, but one way is to think of the foam

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.310
on a particularly fizzy root beer.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.159
If you look closely, you can see bubbles appearing
and disappearing in an ever-changing way.

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.470
For this reason, some scientists call these
virtual particles "quantum foam."

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.030
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.559
This just sounds entirely impossible.

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.330
So, how do we know it is true?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.809
There are lots of reasons, but we can talk
about two that are really totally cool.

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:35.030
The first one is what we call the Casimir
effect, first predicted by Hendrick Casimir.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.189
This effect is pretty easy to understand.

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.449
The way it works is the following.

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.470
Start by assuming that virtual particles exist
everywhere in space.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.159
Now take two metal plates and put them near
one another.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.690
Let's think about what is going on.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.080
You've heard that in quantum mechanics that
particles have both particle and wave properties

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.080
and this is true of virtual particles as well.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.119
These virtual particles have both long wavelengths
and short ones and everything in between.

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.770
Furthermore, they occur everywhere.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.169
However, the plates introduce a new factor
to the situation.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.349
Outside the plates, both long and short wavelength
particles can exist.

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.249
However, between the plates, long wavelength
particles can't fit.

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.840
Thus there are more virtual particles outside
the plates and the imbalance causes the plates

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.319
to move together.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.400
So, what do we see?

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.550
Well, when we do the experiment, we see exactly
what Casimir predicted.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.149
This is considered very strong evidence for
the existence of virtual particles.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.719
There is another measurement that supports
the virtual particle idea.

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.849
This has to do with the strength of the magnet
formed by individual electrons.

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.059
Electrons have electric charge and they also
act as if they spin.

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:57.120
Just as in the classical world, a rotating
charged object becomes a magnet.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.999
And, because we know the electron's charge
and spin, we can predict the strength of the

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.800
magnet each should electron should be.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.960
When the prediction and measured strength
of the magnet formed by an electron were compared,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.629
there was a tiny discrepancy.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.940
They disagreed by 0.1%- one part in a thousand.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.909
A small effect to be sure, but a disagreement
nonetheless.

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:25.969
However, when the simple calculation was replaced
by one using quantum electrodynamics and virtual

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:29.539
particles, the agreement between data and
theory was restored.

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:32.860
And the restoration was better than anyone
had dreamed.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.259
The two numbers now agree to 12 digits.

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.729
This is the most accurate measurement mankind
has ever made.

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.729
This incredible level of agreement is believed
to be definitive evidence of the existence

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:46.550
of the quantum foam.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.030
Now, let me whet your appetite for something
interesting.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.270
When we make a similar measurement of the
magnetic strength of the muon, which is a

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:00.020
cousin of the electron, the agreement is still
good - it goes out to 8 places - but a disagreement

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.559
appears in the 9th digit.

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:07.051
While this discrepancy could be because of
a faulty calculation or measurement, scientists

00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:10.360
are pretty confident that the disagreement
is real.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.399
It could be the first sign that our theories
are breaking down.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:19.740
Scientists are so intrigued that they have
embarked on a new experimental program to

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.249
better measure the magnetic strength of the
muon.

00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:28.539
The g-2 experiment studied the muon for many
years at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:33.409
Limitations in the existing accelerator complex
led scientists to move portions of the accelerator

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:38.630
and detector to Fermilab, which has the ability
to make more muons and thereby study this

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.240
phenomenon more precisely.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.740
The g-2 experiment is expected to begin operations
in 2016 or so.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.370
We scientists are incredibly interested in
the outcome of this experiment, as it may

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.110
lead to a new and better understanding of
the universe.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.480
However, even with this exciting discrepancy,
we must not lose sight of the fact that the

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.750
agreement between the predicted and measured
strength of these subatomic magnets is spectacularly

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.010
good.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:13.440
This agreement, combined with the observed
Casimir effect, gives incredible confidence

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.250
in the quantum foam.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.910
And the idea of quantum foam leads to an entirely
new paradigm- a completely different way of

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.980
thinking about space.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.480
Empty space isn't empty.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.889
It's a bubbling, writhing, frantic place,
with energy converting to matter and back

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:29.030
to energy again.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.870
I understand if the claim sounds hard to believe.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.530
But this new view of the subatomic world is
real and scientists can prove it.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:55.089
You may never look at foam 
the same way again.
