00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
The world is full of peculiarities

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.600
and science really has its work cut out to explain them.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.875
In most cases the wonder of such phenomenal ancient artifacts can be

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.935
attributed to the human races brilliance and innovation

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:13.745
throughout our 150,000 year existence

00:00:13.745 --> 00:00:16.315
but in some cases the origins

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.075
and purposes of some artifacts are still disputed

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:21.605
 

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.645
No.10 weird antenna on the sea floor

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.585
In the height of cold war paranoia

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.435
an oceanographic ship named USNS Eltanin

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:33.125
made a rather peculiar discovery while scanning

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.905
the Antarctic sea floor.  The strange

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:38.865
sighting resembled an antenna. It was tall straight and had

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.945
arms evenly spaced at 90 degrees angles pertruding from its shaft.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:44.860
Many theories developed quickly in response to the image

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.540
Some pertained to man-made origins, perhaps Soviet,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.060
and others pertained to the unexplainable. Could it be an alien relic?

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.940
13,500 thousand feet beneath the waves in Antarctica is a pretty inhospitable

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.835
location for any construction, and the likely hood that this antenna

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:01.255
was of human origin seemed minuscule.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.180
This extraterrestrial form was scrutinized

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.240
Until it was identified as Cladorhiza Concrescens.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.975
which is a type of sea sponge, which resides in deep waters.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.100
Modern day images of this sponge really

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.275
do look like the alten in antenna

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
but they are few and far between, and many

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.940
people have called for a revisit to this peculiar deep sea object

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.280
to determine how it has changed since its discovery.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.200
No. 9 Wofsegg Iron.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.620
The first impression you may have of this cube

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.600
is that it looks unimpressive

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.995
and it is hardly a cube at all. It is loosely cuboid

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
and given its metallic composition

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.280
and theorized age of 20 million years or more

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.620
it suddenly becomes a very strange artifact

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.685
worthy of serious respect.  It was discovered after a miner broke open a coal at an iron foundry.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.545
and at first scientist believed the chunk of metal to be of

00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:49.025
meteoric origin, but that was ruled out through analysis.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.055
It was more likely a chunk of cast iron.

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.385
then begged the question

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:56.935
How has cast iron found itself encased in 20 million year old coa,

00:01:56.935 --> 00:01:59.735
when humans have only existed for roughly 200 thousand years?

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.035
This was puzzling for a time

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:04.935
before researchers generally began to accept that the miner

00:02:04.935 --> 00:02:07.635
could not have liberated this

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.175
from very old untouched coal after all

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.995
and that it was probably a piece of machinery that had fallen into the coal

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.915
pit more recently. Still many remained skeptical

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.100
as this piece of iron has not been subjected to modern research techniques

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.440
no.8

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.580
The Nazca Lines and Atacama Skeleton

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.120
The Nazca Lines, found in the Nazca desert in Southern Peru.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.120
really are some of the most stunning geoglyphs on Earth.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.805
Geoglyphs are icons carved into the face of the Earth.

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:35.345
The Nazca lines are an amazing marker

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:38.325
of an ancient civilization and date back around 2,000 years.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.125
They are tremendously complex and there are over

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.580
30 of them through the desert environment making them the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.300
most interesting collection of ancient geoglyphs on Earth.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.100
It is thought that these geoglyphs were created as a means of communicating with the gods

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.840
above Earth to pray for rain and it has naturally inspired every manner of theory revolving around alien contact.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.015
although it is plausible they were

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.785
created with simple tools by the Nazca culture

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:03.700
what has raised the most eyebrows are the arrays of strange figures

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:05.680
that were created from orcas to astronauts

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.375
adding to this mystery is the Atacama Skeleton

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.465
another South American oddity that was also found in Southern Peru.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.365
Its a humanoid skeleton that really is minuscule.

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:17.105
At no longer than 15 cm in length

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.780
which is the size of a pen. Despite its size

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.320
it is clearly not a fetus

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.295
as it has developed anatomy including hands and hard teeth.

00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:27.975
The most striking thing is its oddly shaped head

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.055
perfectly fitting with traditional visions of aliens

00:03:30.055 --> 00:03:32.975
This peculiar skeleton was tested using modern

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:36.035
day methodology by professors at Stanford University

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:38.565
and was indeed found to be human and of local descent.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:41.180
It was also aged between 6-8 years old

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.400
upon death which is remarkable for a human of that tiny size

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.395
The genetic mutation which lead to its strange forms

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.445
are not clear and so far nobody has been able to explain exactly

00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:52.480
what it is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.980
no. 7

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.660
The London hammer

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.235
This hammer was a chance find

00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:02.205
 

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.725
 

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.715
 

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.525
 

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:13.165
 

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:16.095
 

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:18.705
 

00:04:18.705 --> 00:04:21.645
 

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:24.395
 

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.735

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.715
 

00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:39.645
 

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:42.565
