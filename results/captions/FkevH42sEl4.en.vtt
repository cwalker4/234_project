00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:08.917
&gt;&gt; Melissa: A TWITTER WAR

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:10.351
BREAKS OUT BETWEEN TWO

00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:11.352
PROMINENT VOICES ON THE LEFT

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:13.254
AND THE RIGHT IT ALL STARTED

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:14.155
WITH ROSIE O'DONNELL'S

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:15.356
SUGGESTION THAT SHE WOULD

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:16.491
BRIBE LAWMAKERS TO VOTE

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:18.660
AGAINST THE TAX BILL.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.796
FEDERAL LAW.

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:24.299
FROM THERE, THINGS GOT

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.600
INCREASINGLY, WELL,

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:26.301
PERSONAL.

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:28.236
WITH O'DONNELL TELLING

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.237
SHAPIRO TO DO THINGS THAT WE

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.339
CAN'T SAY HERE ON

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.774
TELEVISION, PROMPTING

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:33.808
SHAPIRO TO SEND OUT THIS

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.643
TWEET TODAY.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:37.212
JUST REPORTED ROSY FOR

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:37.946
TARGETED HARASSMENT JUST TO

00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:39.847
SEE IF TWITTER DOES HAVE A

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:40.648
DOUBLE STANDARD.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.553
EVERYONE KNOWS IF ROSY WAS

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:46.521
CONSERVATIVE TWITTER WOULD

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.823
SUSPEND HER IN A HOT SECOND.

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:49.857
SO TWITTER PUT YOUR MONEY

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:51.759
WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS, ME TOO.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.362
OH BEN, ALL VICTIMS DESERVE

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:54.896
TO BE BELIEVED.

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:56.464
THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:00.168
JOINING US NOW IN EXCLUSIVE

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.868
EDITOR DAILY WIRE.

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.670
I KNOW YOU JUST HEARD FROM

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:08.776
IS UP TO TWEET.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.212
HER ORIGINAL TWEET WHERE SHE

00:01:11.213 --> 00:01:11.913
SAYS $2 MILLION TO SENATOR

00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:13.281
SUSAN COLLINS, SENATOR JEFF

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:14.582
FLAKE IF THEY VOTE NO.

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:15.950
NO, I WILL NOT KILL

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:17.252
AMERICANS, THAT'S WHAT SHE

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:17.585
TWEETED.

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:18.586
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS

00:01:18.587 --> 00:01:19.287
KILLING AMERICANS.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.355
THAT'S OKAY.

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.290
FOR THE SOUR RICH, I THINK

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.758
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:26.894
WHILE DOING THIS PROBABLY

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:28.896
WITH HER FINGERS, YOU

00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:31.332
RESPONDED THAT IF TRUMP

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.500
ORDERS SESSIONS TO

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.135
INVESTIGATE ROSY HE WILL BE

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.703
CARVED INTO RUSH MORE BY

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:37.138
FRIDAY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.139
PRETTY GOOD BURN.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.741
WHAT INSPIRED TO YOU PILE ON

00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:40.908
THIS MESS BECAUSE IT WAS

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:41.676
ALREADY OUT OF CONTROL.

00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:43.511
&gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, IT WAS

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:44.712
OBVIOUS THAT SHE HAD

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:47.749
ACTUALLY VIOLATED AT LEAST

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.419
FORMALLY 18 U.S. C 210, 201,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.356
ONE OF THE PROVISIONS.

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:57.225
&gt;&gt; SPECIFIC PROVISION OF THE

00:01:57.226 --> 00:01:57.692
U.S. CODE.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:59.694
IN DOING SO SHE HAD DONE

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:00.662
THIS ON TWITTER.

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:01.829
I PILED ON A LITTLE BIT.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:07.468
ANATOMICAL ACT ON HER THAT

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.170
CERTAINLY WOULD FALL UNDER

00:02:11.273 --> 00:02:13.274
SHE TOLD ME TO PERFORM IT ON

00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:15.510
A MALE APPENDAGE OF HERS.

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.345
THAT WAS WEIRD.

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:17.979
&gt;&gt; Melissa: LET'S NOT GET

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.615
NOW.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:21.616
&gt;&gt; THAT'S PROBABLY SMART.

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:22.784
I RESPONDED BY ESSENTIALLY

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:23.885
SAYING THAT SHE WAS ALREADY

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:24.385
A FELON.

00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:25.820
THERE WAS NO NEED TO MAKE

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.557
HERSELF INTO A HOMOPHOBIC

00:02:29.558 --> 00:02:31.492
SEXUAL HARASSER AS WELL.

00:02:31.493 --> 00:02:32.794
THINGS DEGENERATED FROM

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:33.161
THERE.

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:33.761
&gt;&gt; Melissa: ABSOLUTELY.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:34.762
THE SERIOUS PART OF THIS IS

00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:36.597
SHE TOLD YOU TO DO THINGS TO

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:38.533
HER THAT OF COURSE HARVEY

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:39.400
WEINSTEIN AND LOTS OF PEOPLE

00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:40.768
ARE IN TROUBLE FOR TRYING TO

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.270
GET PEOPLE TO DO TO THEM.

00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:43.738
I MEAN, IF A MAN SAID THIS

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.374
TO A WOMAN, YOU SAY

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.142
CONSERVATIVE VERSUS LIBERAL,

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:54.782
RECOIL IN HORROR AND JUST

00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:55.817
WOULD REALLY BE ON YOUR

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:56.150
SIDE.

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:56.918
NOT THIS TIME.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:57.852
&gt;&gt; NO QUESTION.

00:02:57.853 --> 00:02:59.253
I MEAN, IF I HAD SAID

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:00.621
EXACTLY THE SAME WORDS TO

00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:01.255
ROSIE O'DONNELL THAT SHE

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.191
SAID TO ME ON TWITTER.

00:03:03.192 --> 00:03:04.125
VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT I

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:05.860
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED OR

00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.261
EXPELLED FROM TWITTER FOR

00:03:07.262 --> 00:03:08.396
TARGETED HARASSMENT OR ABUSE

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:09.130
UNDER THE RULES.

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.732
SO I DECIDED TO FIND OUT

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.200
EXACTLY HOW TWITTER OPERATED

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:14.135
AND SO I REPORTED HER FOR

00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:17.171
AND THEN I HAVE NOW RECEIVED

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:19.874
BACK THEIR NOTICE THAT

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:20.641
APEARKTLY THERE WAS NO

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:21.542
VIOLATION OF THE TWITTER

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:27.749
SHE DID NOT PERFORM BEHAVIOR

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.950
WHICH CROSSES THE LINE INTO

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:29.250
ABUSE.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:30.618
I TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:31.786
WE CAN'T READ THESE TWEETS

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:32.854
ON AIR BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:33.921
OBSCENE AND ABUSIVE.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:34.956
THAT'S WHY TWITTER PROBABLY

00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:35.790
SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING

00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:36.958
IF THEY CARED ABOUT

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.992
ENFORCING THEIR OWN RULES.

00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:39.127
I ACTUALLY DON'T WANT ROSIE

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:40.194
O'DONNELL TOSSED OFF

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:40.528
TWITTER.

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.764
I FIND HER FAR TOO AMUSING

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:43.998
AND SAD SHE BLOCKED ME

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.298
TODAY.

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.299
THAT SAID, I THINK THE

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.534
TWITTER SHOULD BE HELD A

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:47.935
COUNT FOR ITS OWN

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:48.770
ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES.

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:51.372
IT'S WILDLY INCONSISTENT.

00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:52.240
&gt;&gt; Melissa: WE ARE LOOKING

00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:04.118
YOU.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.653
SHE HAS A LONG TWITTER

00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:05.987
HISTORY.

00:04:05.988 --> 00:04:07.722
SOME OF HER BEST TIMES WERE

00:04:10.392 --> 00:04:11.426
TYPES OF NAMES COMPARING HIM

00:04:11.427 --> 00:04:12.860
TO BODY PARTS, SAYING HOW

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:13.461
ORANGE HE WAS.

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:14.962
TALKING ABOUT HIS

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:15.630
APPEARANCE.

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.698
AGAIN, TALKING ABOUT THINGS

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.300
IF TWEETED AT A WOMAN OR

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:19.967
TWEETED AT HILLARY CLINTON

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.503
ABOUT HER APPEARANCE PEOPLE

00:04:22.504 --> 00:04:24.172
WOULD BE ALL UP IN ARMS.

00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:25.206
THIS IS WHAT SHE WAS DOING

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:25.740
TO DONALD TRUMP.

00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:27.975
SHE SAID HE WAS LIKE THE

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:28.943
SNAKE -- LITTLE HOUSE ON THE

00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:29.977
PRAIRIE WHICH I KIND OF

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.279
LIKED FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.547
BUT, ALL THESE THINGS GOING

00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:34.649
ON, SHE IS ON TWITTER BUT,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.450
TWITTER DOES NOTHING ABOUT

00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.952
IT WHEN SHE ATTACKS SOMEONE

00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:41.522
WITH WHAT SHOULD BE SEXUAL

00:04:41.523 --> 00:04:41.923
HARASSMENT.

00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:42.723
DO THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD

00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:44.258
OF BANNING OTHER PEOPLE FOR

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:44.959
SAYING THINGS LIKE THIS

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.293
THOUGH.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:46.294
&gt;&gt; THEY DO HAVE A TRACK

00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:48.229
RECORD OF AT LEAST BLOCKING

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.398
PEOPLE'S TWEETS FOR

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.799
CONSIDERED ABUSIVE OR

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.600
SUSPENDING PEOPLE ABUSIVE.

00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:53.701
THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF

00:04:53.702 --> 00:04:54.635
GOING AFTER PEOPLE FOR

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:58.306
SERVICE SUGGEST THAT YOU ARE

00:04:58.307 --> 00:04:59.574
NOT ALLOWED TO ISSUE TWEETS

00:04:59.575 --> 00:04:59.941
LIKE THIS.

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:02.109
BUT THEY HAVE A RATHER

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.810
ARBITRARY STANDARD OBVIOUSLY

00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:03.678
FOR WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:05.246
ENFORCE OR NOT ENFORCE.

00:05:05.247 --> 00:05:06.280
MY QUESTIONS THEY DIDN'T

00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.381
WANT TO OPEN THE CAN OF

00:05:07.382 --> 00:05:08.749
WORMS THAT WOULD HAVE

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.350
NECESSITATED OPENING IN

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.351
ORDER TO TAKE ANY ACTION

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:15.690
THINGS TO HER WHICH IS

00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:19.327
HORRIFYING IN CONTEMPLATION.

00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:20.394
&gt;&gt; Melissa: SHE SEEMED VERY

00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:21.896
SINCERE WHEN SHE WENT ON AND

00:05:21.897 --> 00:05:23.231
TWEETED LONG TWEETS ABOUT

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:24.165
EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY SHE

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:25.733
WANTED TO GIVE TO

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:26.334
THEM-TO-VOTE NO.

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:27.668
SHE SOUNDED VERY SERIOUS.

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:28.236
SO, I DON'T KNOW.

00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:29.403
THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE

00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:30.171
RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHETHER OR

00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:32.707
SINCE IT WAS ON TWITTER.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.477
WE WILL SEE.
