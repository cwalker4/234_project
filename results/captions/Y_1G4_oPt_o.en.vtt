PLEASE WELCOME, ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ!

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:31.297 align:start size:88% position:13%

( BAND PLAYING )

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.800 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME TO THE
SHOW.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.005
I WANT TO CONFESS THAT I DID NOT
KNOW YOUR NAME ON MONDAY.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:39.639
&gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.341 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT WHAT IS IT
LIKE FOR YOU?

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.543 align:start size:88% position:13%
BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR FIRST
ELECTION.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:43.777 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:48.248
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU UNSEATED A
TEN-TERM CONGRESSMAN, CROWLEY,

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:53.386
WHO MANY PEOPLE HAD THROWN OUT
HIS NAME AS THE POSSIBLE HEIR

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:58.525
APPARENT FOR NANC NANCY PELOSI.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.362
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION
THE POLLS SHOWED YOU 36 POINTS

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.798 align:start size:88% position:13%
BEHIND HIM AND YOU WON BY 15
POINTS.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:11.137 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S A 51 --

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:11.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:16.309
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE
A VERY CAPABLE, INTELLIGENT

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.676 align:start size:88% position:13%
PERSON.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:20.280
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE ABLE
TO SWING 51 POINTS IN THREE

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.516
WEEKS AND UNSEAT THIS MAN WHO
HAD BEEN THERE 20 YEARS?

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.319
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE FIRST THING TO
KIND OF MENTION IS I DON'T THINK

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.253
POLLING IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:31.357
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE LEARNED THAT IN
2016.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:36.029 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; POLLING -- HERE'S THE BIG
THING, POLLING -- PEOPLE TRY TO

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.065
IDENTIFY WHO'S THE MOST LIKELY
PERSON TO TURN OUT, AND WHAT WE

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:44.604
DID IS WE CHANGED WHO TURNS OUT,
AND THAT CHANGES THE WHOLE

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start size:88% position:13%
ELECTION.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.539
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, WHO DOESN'T

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.210
TURN OUT, ESPECIALLY FOR
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES, AND WHO

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.379
TURNED OUT FO FOR YOU?

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.482
WHO ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS?

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.451
&gt;&gt; WELL, I TELL YOU ONE THING,
WE WERE ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES TILL

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.555
THE POLLS WERE CLOSING AND I WAS
IN MY HOME NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:15.101
BRONX, AND THESE TWO YOUNG,
TEENAGE LOOKING KIDS CAME UP TO

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.570
ME AND SAID WE JUST VOTED FOR
YOU!

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.141 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND I WAS, LIKE, HOW OLD ARE
YOU?

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.475 size:88% position:44%
THEY WERE, LIKE, 19.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:29.015
I WAS, LIKE, 19 YEARS OLD VOTING
IN AN OFF-YEAR MIDTERM PRIMARY

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:29.582 align:start size:88% position:13%
ELECTION?

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.851
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT IS GOING

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:32.919 size:81% position:41%
THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.687
I'LL SHOW YOU THIS CLIP HERE.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.090
WE HAVE A CLIP OF THE MOMENT YOU
FOUND OUT YOU WON.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.626
WE DON'T HAVE THE SOUND ON THIS.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.326 align:start size:88% position:13%
THERE YOU ARE.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.095 size:78% position:39%
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.330
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND
AT THAT MOMENT?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.434
&gt;&gt; IT WAS SO CRAZY BECAUSE I HAD
NOT CHECKED ANY OF THE POLLS.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:52.772
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY TO THIS
PARTY TO THE WATCH PARTY, IT WAS

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.074
LIKE AN OLD BILL YARDS HALL TO
THE BRONX.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:58.378
I HADN'T CHECKED ANY OF THE
POLLS IN MY PHONE AND WE GET OUT

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:02.515
AND I GO, OH, MY GOD, OUTSIDE,
BECAUSE I SEE ALL OF THESE

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:09.622
REPORTERS, LIKE, RUNNING TO THE
WATCH PARTY AND, LIKE, NOBODY

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.123 align:start size:88% position:13%
WAS THERE.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:13.760
IT WAS OUR VOLUNTEERS AND
ORGANIZERS AND SUPPORTERS.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.029
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF YOU SEE
SUPPORTERS RUNNING TOWARD YOU,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.999
IT COULD BE VERY GOOD OR VERY
BAD.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:20.967 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.036
I'M RACING THE REPORTERS INTO
THE BILL YARDS HALL.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:27.907
I RUN INSIDE, RUN IN TO THE TV
SET, I LOOK UP, I SEE THE MARGIN

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:31.411
AND THE AMOUNT OF PRECINCTS
REPORTING AND THAT'S HOW I FOUND

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.713
OUT WE WON THE ELECTION RIGHT
THERE IN THAT MOMENT.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:37.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, YOU HAVE A
GOOD SHOT BECAUSE AS MAJORITY

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.987
DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT, SO THERE'S
A GOOD SHOT YOU WILL GO TO

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.388
CONGRESS, WHILE NOT GUARANTEED.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:45.792
YOU SAID BECAUSE YOU WERE IN
HOSPITALITY, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
TO GET PEOPLE TO BE ON BOARD
WITH YOUR AGENDA.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.863
WHAT IS YOUR AGENDA, BECAUSE YOU
DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:56.035
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST, AND THAT'S
NOT AN EASY TERM FOR A LOT OF

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:56.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
AMERICANS.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:58.638 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT DOES SOCIALIST MEAN FOR
YOU?

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:03.409
&gt;&gt; FOR ME, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM
IS ABOUT REALLY THE VALUE FOR ME

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:11.117 align:start size:88% position:13%
IS THAT I BELIEVE THAT, IN A
MODERN, MORAL AND WEALTHY

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:14.988
SOCIETY, NO PERSON IN AMERICA
SHOULD BE TOO POOR TO LIVE.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SEEMS SIMPLE.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:17.523 size:84% position:42%
EEMS PRETTY SIMPLE.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:25.832
SO WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS
HEALTH CARE AS A HUMAN RIGHT.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.401
( APPLAUSE )
IT MEANS EVERY CHILD, NO MATTER

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.304
WHERE YOU ARE BORN SHOULD HAVE
ACCESS TO A COLLEGE OR TRADE

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:37.410 align:start size:88% position:13%
SCHOOL EDUCATION IF THEY SO
CHOOSE.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
I THINK NO PERSON SHOULD BE

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.682
HOMELESS, IF WE CAN HAVE PUBLIC
STRUCTURES AND PUBLIC POLICIES

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:46.953
TO ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE
HOMES AND FOOD AND LEAD A

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
DIGNIFIED LIFE IN THE UNITED
STATES.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:53.626 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, THOSE ALL

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:57.930
SEEM LIKE VERY WORTHY GOALS, YOU
MAY GET A LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.968
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE SAID IN
ONE OF HIS TWEETS, HE SAID, WOW,

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.405
BIG TRUMP HATER CONGRESSMAN JOE
CROWLEY WHO MANY EXPECTED WAS

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:10.543 size:88% position:56%

PLACE JUST LOST HIS PRIMARY

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:17.150

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.417 align:start size:88% position:13%
HAPPENING.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.586
PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
NICER AND MORE RESPECTFUL TO HIS

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:20.853 align:start size:88% position:13%
PRESIDENT.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:25.692 align:start size:88% position:13%

OCASIO-CORTEZ --

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:25.925 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:29.362
&gt;&gt; Stephen: -- ARE YOU GOING
TO BE NICER TO THE PRESIDENT?

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.030
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT
IS FROM QUEENS AND WITH ALL DUE

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.398
RESPECT HALF OF MY CONSTITUENCY
IS FROM THE QUEENS.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:36.803
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS HOW TO
DEAL WITH A GIRL FROM THE BRONX.

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:41.174
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.577 align:start size:88% position:13%
