(acapella music)

00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.162
- [Narrator] Yelloww Productions presents:

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:07.380
- 10 things to know before
you go to Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.229
I'm Chris. This is Topher.

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.992
Together, we make Yelloww Productions.

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:12.455
We do travel guides that are fun,

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:13.983
informative, and entertaining.

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:15.847
And in this video, we're gonna tell you

00:00:15.847 --> 00:00:19.693
everything you need to know
before you come to this place.

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:20.909
Often, I think of it as

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.984
the entertainment capital of the world.

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:23.992
That's, I guess, L.A.,

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:26.613
but there is certainly a
lot of entertainment here.

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.595
So, the first thing we're gonna talk about

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.678
is that Las Vegas is big.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.751
Often, when people think of Las Vegas,

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.080
they think it's small.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.379
They think they can walk
to everything on the Strip.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.076
The Las Vegas Strip is four miles long.

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:44.337
And so, you really can't walk
to everything on the Strip.

00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:47.199
It will often take you 15 to 20 minutes

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.251
just to go from your hotel,

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.604
say if you're at Bally's,

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:53.005
to the next hotel, which is maybe Paris

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.064
or Planet Hollywood down there.

00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:57.552
Particularly, if your room
is at the back of the hotel,

00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:01.495
you'll be doing a lot of walking
when you come to Las Vegas.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:05.005
So, it's important to find
the shortcuts between hotels.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.117
For example, the two I just
mentioned, Bally's and Paris,

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:09.867
there's actually a
little shortcut that goes

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.378
between the two hotels
that you can walk through.

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:13.620
There's monorails that you can take

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.041
and lots of things that you can take

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.812
that you don't have to
always traverse the Strip.

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:19.834
Because you're gonna be
doing a lot of walking,

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.071
you should bring comfortable footwear.

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:23.894
I can't count the number of times,

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:27.039
after 10, 11, midnight,
that I see a lotta girls

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.616
in their heels taking them
off and walking barefoot

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:33.798
because they are too uncomfortable
to walk anymore in them.

00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:36.198
I also mention the
shortcuts between hotels.

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.081
In addition to pedestrian shortcuts,

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.620
there are also trams that go
between a number of the hotels.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.416
For example, there's a tram that goes

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:45.662
from The Luxor to the Excalibur Hotel.

00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:48.060
And there's also tram that
goes from the Monte Carlo

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.044
to the Bellagio and stops
at the Aria in the middle.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.868
So make good use of those trams.

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:54.824
There's also the Las Vegas monorail,

00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:57.070
which you can take as
well. That one isn't free.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.926
It costs you a little bit of money.

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.735
Something else to know
about Las Vegas being big

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:03.485
and transportation is that

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:07.713
taxis, you can't actually
hail a taxi on the Strip.

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:10.421
If you wanna catch a taxi,
you're gonna have to go

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.374
into the kinda hotel lobby area.

00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:13.606
There'll be a taxi rank,

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:16.519
and that's where you
can pick up a taxi from.

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.821
But be prepared to wait in line,

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.340
because taxis are pretty popular.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.101
Don't think you're
gonna get one instantly.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:25.163
Sometimes you can wait up to
20 minutes to get into a taxi.

00:02:25.163 --> 00:02:28.166
And the last thing to note
about Las Vegas being big

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.877
is it's a big city, and so,
traffic is really, really awful,

00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:34.607
particularly at 6:00 p.m.

00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:38.202
The Las Vegas Strip gets even
worse as the night goes on.

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:41.124
Maybe even midnight is the
worst time to be on the Strip.

00:02:41.124 --> 00:02:44.027
But, 6:00 p.m. is an awful
time to be on the I-15.

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:45.635
So, don't even think about driving that

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:47.224
at the evening rush hour.

00:02:47.224 --> 00:02:49.781
Okay! The second thing
to know about Las Vegas

00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.475
is about downtown Las Vegas.

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:55.723
And I am doing this about center-strip.

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:57.843
I'm standing at the Caesars Palace Hotel,

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:01.160
downtown Las Vegas. Again,
on the map it looks close,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.328
but it's really pretty far.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:06.717
It's maybe five, six miles to
downtown Las Vegas from here.

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:09.576
And that cab ride is gonna cost you $30,

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:12.222
if you take a taxi to go
to downtown Las Vegas.

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:13.980
So, if you're going, be prepared

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.070
for a little bit of
sticker shock on taxis,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.893
cuz taxis are not cheap in Vegas.

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:20.962
But, going to downtown
Vegas, I think is worth it,

00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:24.995
because the Fremont Street
Experience is really cool.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.294
They've got this lit-up LED screen

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:28.427
that runs over the street.

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:30.303
They've got night time entertainment.

00:03:30.303 --> 00:03:32.834
They've really glitzed up what used to be

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:35.334
kind of a crappy part of town.

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.304
But in addition to that
crappy part of town,

00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:40.127
it's kind of cool to see Old Las Vegas,

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:43.010
the Golden Nugget, and
these classic hotels

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.725
that you've heard of and
seen in lots of movies.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.480
But be prepared for them to be smoky,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.880
cuz the hotels are old.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.469
Their air conditioning isn't quite as good

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.427
as the Strip hotels,

00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:54.850
which I feel have a lot
fresher air in the casinos.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.753
And the other final thing to
know about downtown Las Vegas

00:03:57.753 --> 00:04:00.436
is people say that's where you can get

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:01.948
the best slot machine odds.

00:04:01.948 --> 00:04:03.529
So if you're playing the slot machines,

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:05.154
downtown Las Vegas is your place to play.

00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:07.686
And I will say, I've probably
won the most gambling

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.423
at the slot machines downtown.

00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:10.656
I don't gamble a whole lot,

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.786
but those have been pretty lucky for me.

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.109
Alright, the third thing to know

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.554
before you go to Las
Vegas, is about hotels.

00:04:17.554 --> 00:04:18.950
And the first thing I'll tell you,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.156
Las Vegas has a lot of cheap hotels.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:23.703
You can get $29 a night hotel rooms,

00:04:23.703 --> 00:04:27.413
but you probably won't want
those or won't like them.

00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:29.140
I've stayed in a lot of bad hotels,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.106
before I started picking
better hotels. And so,

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.481
again, if you pick that $29 a night rate,

00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.689
you will regret it.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.876
I did, when I picked those rates.

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:42.855
If you want to stay in
the middle of the Strip,

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.020
stay right around, kind of
where I'm standing, actually.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.958
Caesars Palace, really
center strip, so is Bally's,

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.804
Paris, Bellagio, The Flamingo.

00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:53.200
On this trip, I'm at The Venetian,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.676
which is just one block off the strip.

00:04:55.676 --> 00:04:57.436
But, this is really the
center of all the action.

00:04:57.436 --> 00:04:59.371
If you're staying here, you
probably don't need a car.

00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:02.887
You can walk, pretty much,
most places, or take a taxi.

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:03.959
And it's in the middle,

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:07.560
so you're not paying exorbitant fees.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.017
One thing to know about
hotels in Las Vegas, though,

00:05:10.017 --> 00:05:13.435
is they charge resort fees.
Oh God, I hate resort fees.

00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:16.583
Resort fees, I feel like,
started in resorts, in beaches,

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:20.281
and places like that,
where they have a room rate

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:22.845
and then they charge
you an extra nightly fee

00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:25.495
for all the things like
the beach and paddleboards

00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:26.888
and surfboards and swimming pools,

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:28.398
like stuff that you never use.

00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:30.972
In Vegas, most of the hotels on the Strip

00:05:30.972 --> 00:05:34.846
have started charging resort
fees of $20 to $25 a night.

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:38.329
So again, that $29 room might
actually be twice as much

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:41.975
because it might have resort
fee and taxes tacked on.

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:44.852
So, take a look at those
fees before you book.

00:05:44.852 --> 00:05:47.727
And many of the Strip hotels are starting

00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:50.422
to charge for parking now, so take a look

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:52.481
and see if your hotel charges for parking.

00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:53.812
Again, the Weston, which I'm at,

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.905
which is just one block off
the Strip, free parking.

00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:58.625
And so, I really like that.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.398
Weston does charge a resort fee.

00:06:01.398 --> 00:06:03.431
A number of The Marriotts
though, which I like to stay at,

00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:04.934
free parking and no resort fees.

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:08.095
So, that's where your often
gonna get a pretty good deal.

00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:11.567
So, if you like peace and quiet,

00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:12.791
then you might not wanna stay

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:14.042
in one of these big Strip hotels,

00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:16.321
because every one of
them has a big casino,

00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:19.106
lots of people. Things go 24/7.

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:22.457
So, if you like peace and quiet,
pick a hotel off the Strip.

00:06:22.457 --> 00:06:23.991
If you want the most peace and quiet,

00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.515
one of my favorite hotels, it's
a little far from the Strip,

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:29.256
is the J.W. Marriott Las Vegas.

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:30.964
It does have a casino,
but it's very quiet,

00:06:30.964 --> 00:06:33.180
reserved. It's on a golf course.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.404
It is a tranquil place
to stay in Las Vegas.

00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:39.330
The fourth thing to know
before you come to Las Vegas

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.830
is about gambling.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.837
And so, if you are coming
to gamble in Las Vegas,

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:47.220
you should learn the games.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.368
Don't play a game, if
you don't know the rules.

00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:50.595
Because if you don't know the rules,

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:54.022
chances are, you're just
throwing your money away.

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.665
But the cool thing
about learning the games

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.977
is lots of the casinos
actually have free classes

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:00.627
that you can learn the games in.

00:07:00.627 --> 00:07:01.927
They're usually not at night.

00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:04.179
They're usually early afternoon.

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:05.641
But check those classes out. They're free.

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:08.923
They'll teach you how to play craps,

00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:12.553
or a lot of games that maybe
you aren't familiar with.

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:15.585
Also, if you are gambling, you
should join the Players Club.

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:17.882
The two big Players Club: there's MGM

00:07:17.882 --> 00:07:19.066
and there's Caesars Palace.

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:20.818
They each have a rewards program.

00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:22.612
If you're gonna gamble,
you might as well gamble

00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:24.825
and get a few rewards
points while you're at it.

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.427
That might give you free
perks later, like free rooms,

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:29.239
easy entrance into the buffets,

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:31.655
maybe free parking at
some of the properties.

00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:35.404
So, don't miss out on that opportunity.

00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:38.585
The fifth thing to know,
before you go to Las Vegas,

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:40.717
is that Las Vegas is the desert.

00:07:40.717 --> 00:07:42.146
And being the desert,

00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:44.361
you should drink plenty of
water while you're here,

00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:46.446
because it's dry all the time.

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:48.975
It's dry in the summer.
It's dry in the winter.

00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:52.052
I mean, in the summer, it's
really, really hot but,

00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:55.104
in the winter, it can actually
get really, really cold.

00:07:55.104 --> 00:07:56.423
If you're coming in the winter,

00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:57.668
you should be bringing a jacket,

00:07:57.668 --> 00:08:01.860
because it can be cold and
windy with low temperatures.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.858
But being the desert and dry, you wanna be

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.898
drinking a lot of water,
whatever season you're here.

00:08:06.898 --> 00:08:08.581
And I will tell you, you
should buy your water

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:12.425
at a supermarket, or
Walgreens, or a drug store.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:15.573
Do not buy your water at these casinos.

00:08:15.573 --> 00:08:18.313
These casinos will charge
you an arm and a leg,

00:08:18.313 --> 00:08:21.000
and then maybe a second
leg for a bottle of water.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.457
Like, I was in one of these casinos

00:08:22.457 --> 00:08:24.438
and saw a bottle of water for $6.

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:26.377
You heard me right, $6.

00:08:26.377 --> 00:08:27.697
Now, if you're playing the slot machines

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:28.530
and you have the Players Club,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.110
you can get all the
alcoholic drinks for free

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.218
that you want to.

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:34.133
But that bottle of water
that's non-alcoholic,

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:35.300
that'll be $6.

00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:38.697
Also, if you're out and in the daytime,

00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:41.776
or you're by the swimming pool,
make sure to wear sunscreen.

00:08:41.776 --> 00:08:44.919
The sun is very strong here in the desert.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.890
And the casinos are
always super, super cold.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.598
They keep them air-conditioned.

00:08:50.598 --> 00:08:52.545
I think that they can store meat in there.

00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:56.290
But so, you may actually
want to bring a light jacket,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.476
not for the outside, but for the inside.

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:01.382
I often come to Las Vegas for conferences.

00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:03.797
And I'll be in the
conference meeting rooms

00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:05.490
for a couple hours, and
if I'm in the summer,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.173
I'll have to go outside to thaw out again,

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.338
so that I can warm up,

00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:12.296
cuz I get way too cold from being inside.

00:09:12.296 --> 00:09:13.862
Alright, the sixth thing to know,

00:09:13.862 --> 00:09:17.573
before you come to Las
Vegas, is about when to go.

00:09:17.573 --> 00:09:20.203
When should you go to Las Vegas?

00:09:20.203 --> 00:09:23.588
And there's not really a
time of year that's the best,

00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:25.363
but the best time to come to Vegas

00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:28.353
is when there is not a convention in town.

00:09:28.353 --> 00:09:30.879
Las Vegas, big convention town.

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:34.001
Conventions that draw over
a hundred thousand people.

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:35.646
CES is a big example of them,

00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.322
which is the big computer show every year.

00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:40.076
So, you wanna make sure you don't come

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:42.399
when one of those conventions are here.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.666
There are plenty of
convention calendars online

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:47.400
that you can check the
conventions that are in Vegas.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.216
It will behoove you to do that.

00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:51.095
If you come during a non-convention week,

00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:54.024
the rooms might be, you might
get good rooms for 80 bucks,

00:09:54.024 --> 00:09:55.942
and those same rooms
during a convention week

00:09:55.942 --> 00:09:57.775
could be $300 or $400.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.671
The couple times a year that are good

00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:04.267
is Christmas is typically a slow time.

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.512
After Thanksgiving is
also a pretty good time

00:10:06.512 --> 00:10:08.107
to come to Vegas.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.348
Also, mid-week is a good time,
like Monday to Wednesday,

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:13.144
is the least busy time in Vegas.

00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:15.838
The busiest is the weekend,
particularly, for all the people

00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:18.824
who can drive in from
Southern California, from L.A.

00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:20.944
They typically come Friday, Saturday,

00:10:20.944 --> 00:10:22.172
and then, drive back Sunday.

00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:25.926
So, if you are coming
from L.A. to Las Vegas,

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:28.187
don't drive back from Vegas

00:10:28.187 --> 00:10:31.145
on a Sunday afternoon to L.A.

00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:34.048
What's normally a four-hour
drive will take you seven hours

00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:35.175
with all the traffic of people

00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:37.475
going back to L.A. from Vegas.

00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:40.267
And, the other thing
to know is that Vegas,

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:41.554
it doesn't ever close.

00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:43.628
I mean, I know there are
holidays that most of us take

00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:45.780
in this country, but they don't in Vegas.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.753
Vegas is 24/7, 365 days a year.

00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:51.659
Everything here is pretty
much open all the time.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:54.715
I mean, that's a slight over-exaggeration.

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:57.854
Some of the stores, the
buffets, they do close at night,

00:10:57.854 --> 00:11:00.865
but they'll be open 365 days a year.

00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:03.274
Typically, even on
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

00:11:03.274 --> 00:11:06.130
you will find this a
fantastic place to be.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.632
Alright, the seventh thing to
know before you come to Vegas,

00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:10.865
is about food.

00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:14.230
And the food in Vegas is
awesome, without a doubt.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.191
I just finished eating
at The Bellagio buffet.

00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:19.241
Really good buffet.

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.808
Caesars Palace, where I'm
at, has the Bacchanal.

00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:24.270
I'm not sure how to pronounce it.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.616
It's rated the number one
buffet in all of Las Vegas.

00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:28.607
The buffets here will be hands down

00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:32.698
the best buffets you eat,
I'm gonna say, anywhere.

00:11:32.698 --> 00:11:35.254
But, in addition to all the great food,

00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:36.701
there's also lots of crappy food.

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:39.785
So, I read somebody that
was describing it and said,

00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:42.744
"You're never more than 100 feet away from

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.516
the best gourmet food of your life,

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:47.736
but you're also never
more than 100 feet away

00:11:47.736 --> 00:11:50.391
from the worst two-dollar
hot dog of your life."

00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:53.900
So, do your research,
because not all the food here

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.724
is the best. Some of it
really caters to tourists.

00:11:57.724 --> 00:12:01.298
And so, a lot of the
good ones, I will say,

00:12:01.298 --> 00:12:03.927
are the non-obvious ones. For example,

00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:06.514
there's a restaurant in The
Venetian called Bouchon.

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:10.315
It's this fancy French restaurant,
but in order to find it,

00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:12.267
you have to go up one of the elevators

00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:14.814
that's basically marked for guests only.

00:12:14.814 --> 00:12:17.378
You would never know how
to get to this restaurant,

00:12:17.378 --> 00:12:18.769
or that it was even there,

00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:23.549
unless you knew it was there,
and you knew to look for it.

00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:26.480
And also, if there's a famous
restaurant in the world

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.543
that you've wanted to eat at, chances are,

00:12:28.543 --> 00:12:31.450
it very well may have a
location in Las Vegas.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.185
For example, in Los Angeles,

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:35.867
there's a famous breakfast
place called Eggslut.

00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:37.526
You may have seen it if you've seen my

00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:41.105
"Los Angeles Cheap Eats" video,
or my "Food Hauls" video.

00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:43.580
Well, they have a location
here in Las Vegas.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.716
Also, the Hofbräuhaus from Munich

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:48.337
has a location here in Las Vegas.

00:12:48.337 --> 00:12:50.236
The Shake Shack, which is from New York,

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.110
has a location here in Las Vegas.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.751
There are a lot of
restaurants in Las Vegas

00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:56.160
that have their,
basically, second location

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.242
out of the original one here.

00:12:58.242 --> 00:13:01.421
So, do take a look for
some of those specialties.

00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:03.354
But the food, it can be expensive.

00:13:03.354 --> 00:13:05.201
Those great buffets that I talked about,

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.343
the one I had at The
Bellagio was $38 for dinner,

00:13:08.343 --> 00:13:09.470
so it wasn't cheap.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.279
But there are some that are cheap,

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.425
and if you're interested in those,

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:15.763
check out my video on the
"Best Cheap Eats" in Las Vegas.

00:13:15.763 --> 00:13:18.430
Link's in the description below.

00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:24.165
You can still find a
t-bone steak in Las Vegas

00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:27.659
for $4.95, if you know where to look.

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:30.166
The cheapest food is
typically not on the Strip.

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:33.440
The cheapest food is usually downtown.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.861
Chinatown has good eats too.

00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:37.902
And the other thing to know
is you can get breakfast

00:13:37.902 --> 00:13:41.164
pretty much 24/7 here, cuz
this town, again, never sleeps.

00:13:41.164 --> 00:13:43.764
People gamble til late at
night, wake up at odd hours,

00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:45.865
so if you want breakfast at 7:00 p.m.,

00:13:45.865 --> 00:13:48.030
you can usually find it.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.569
So now, in the food section,

00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:50.962
I've been talking a lot about buffets.

00:13:50.962 --> 00:13:53.911
I've got 7.1 to tell
you just about buffets.

00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:58.351
The buffets are great, but
just once a day, please.

00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:01.642
Caesars Palace has this
24-hour buffet pass

00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:02.899
that you can have all you can eat

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:05.562
from all of their buffets within 24 hours.

00:14:05.562 --> 00:14:07.955
That is just crazy, because
when I eat one buffet,

00:14:07.955 --> 00:14:10.408
I'm pretty much done
for the next 24 hours.

00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:12.914
If you try to eat two buffets in a day,

00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:15.671
you will pretty much gross
yourself out, I think.

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:18.516
I gross myself out when I do it.

00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:20.038
The best time to have a buffet

00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:23.379
is right at the end of
lunch, right before dinner.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:26.209
A lot of buffets are more
expensive during dinner,

00:14:26.209 --> 00:14:27.774
have better food during dinner,

00:14:27.774 --> 00:14:29.406
and if you time it just right,

00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:31.087
you can get to a lot of buffets

00:14:31.087 --> 00:14:35.789
and pay the lunch time prices,
but eat the dinner time food.

00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:38.927
But the lines for dinner on
weekends, things like that,

00:14:38.927 --> 00:14:40.395
they can be long.

00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:43.070
Think one, two, three hours.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.911
(loud car)

00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:47.048
That was a really loud
car. I was going to eat

00:14:47.048 --> 00:14:49.128
at the Caesars Palace buffet this evening,

00:14:49.128 --> 00:14:53.535
but the wait was 90 minutes
on a Tuesday at 6:15 p.m.

00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:56.384
So, prepare yourself for the wait.

00:14:56.384 --> 00:14:58.317
So if you want to avoid the rush,

00:14:58.317 --> 00:15:01.323
eat your dinner at 5:00 p.m. or 8:30 p.m.

00:15:01.323 --> 00:15:03.748
Pick early or pick late.

00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:07.790
7.2: This is in the food
section and it's about alcohol.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.201
And you can drink alcohol
anywhere in Las Vegas.

00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:12.770
You can drink alcohol in the casinos.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.725
You can drink alcohol on the street.

00:15:14.725 --> 00:15:17.728
You can drink alcohol crossing the street.

00:15:17.728 --> 00:15:20.933
But, you need to know that
you can only drink alcohol

00:15:20.933 --> 00:15:24.248
if it's in on the street,
if it's in a plastic cup.

00:15:24.248 --> 00:15:26.404
No glasses are allowed on the street.

00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:27.753
So if you're leaving a hotel

00:15:27.753 --> 00:15:29.568
and you have an alcoholic drink,

00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:31.001
ask for a to-go plastic cup.

00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:32.107
They'll be happy to give it to you

00:15:32.107 --> 00:15:34.668
and you can carry your drink as you go.

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:37.344
You'll often see tons of
people carrying these, like,

00:15:37.344 --> 00:15:40.935
foot-long margaritas with
them as they walk around,

00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:42.896
cuz, everybody knows, you
need a foot-long margarita

00:15:42.896 --> 00:15:45.969
everywhere you go. That makes
the vacation so much better.

00:15:45.969 --> 00:15:48.210
Alright, the eighth thing
to know about Las Vegas

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.635
is about ATMS. And it is that,

00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:53.905
ATMs are expensive.

00:15:53.905 --> 00:15:56.722
Almost every hotel has ATMs

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:59.336
as part of their, like,
bill-breaker machines,

00:15:59.336 --> 00:16:02.436
because the same machine that
you would use to cash out

00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:04.190
your ticket vouchers
from the slot machines,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.385
you can use, typically, as an ATM.

00:16:06.385 --> 00:16:09.470
But they are gonna charge
you a ridiculous surcharge

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.586
to get your money out. And
then, you lose your money

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:12.791
and give it to the casino anyway,

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.199
so I don't even know why they charge you

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:16.509
the ridiculous ATM fees, but they do.

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:18.940
If you're looking for a bank
ATM, like Bank of America,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.494
they're actually really hard to find.

00:16:20.494 --> 00:16:23.687
There's very few actual
bank ATMs on the Strip.

00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:25.982
You'll find them a few
blocks off the Strip,

00:16:25.982 --> 00:16:28.716
but if you don't have a car,
they are hard to come by.

00:16:28.716 --> 00:16:31.994
So, make sure that you prepare
ahead. Bring cash with you.

00:16:31.994 --> 00:16:34.129
Don't be planning to get
here and take out cash

00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:37.164
from the ATM, unless you
just want to give away

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.405
lots of your hard-earned money

00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:41.271
to the banks in the form of ATM fees.

00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:42.602
The ninth thing to know about Las Vegas,

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:46.170
this is the second to
last one, is smoking.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.443
Smoking seems to be allowed
almost everywhere here.

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:51.130
I'm not really a fan of smoking,

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.749
and so, it starts to bug me after a while.

00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:55.382
The Strip hotels are a lot better

00:16:55.382 --> 00:16:57.011
cuz they have a lot better ventilation,

00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:58.873
but if you're in downtown Las Vegas,

00:16:58.873 --> 00:17:03.711
you will really notice that
there is smoke everywhere.

00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:06.157
So, just be prepared for that.

00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:08.671
The tenth and final thing to know,

00:17:08.671 --> 00:17:11.158
before you come to Las
Vegas, is about tipping.

00:17:11.158 --> 00:17:13.891
Las Vegas is a city that runs on tips.

00:17:13.891 --> 00:17:16.929
And it seems like everyone here
is going to want your tips,

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:20.745
the waiter, the waitress,
the person in the buffet,

00:17:20.745 --> 00:17:22.860
the taxi driver, the bellboy,

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.867
the people that you take a
picture with on the street.

00:17:25.867 --> 00:17:28.665
There are these people that
dress like showgirls or Elmo,

00:17:28.665 --> 00:17:29.722
and of course, they'll be like,

00:17:29.722 --> 00:17:31.018
"Take a picture! Take a
picture! Take a picture!"

00:17:31.018 --> 00:17:32.547
And then as soon as you do
that, then they're like,

00:17:32.547 --> 00:17:34.650
"Gimme money! Gimme money! Gimme money!"

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.407
And I get that they have to make money,

00:17:36.407 --> 00:17:39.786
but it would be nice, I
feel, if they actually said,

00:17:39.786 --> 00:17:41.639
"Hey, take a picture for
a dollar!" instead of just

00:17:41.639 --> 00:17:43.367
"Take a picture! Take a
picture! Take a picture!"

00:17:43.367 --> 00:17:44.388
and now, "Give me money!"

00:17:44.388 --> 00:17:46.486
Cuz there's a lot of people
that aren't expecting that.

00:17:46.486 --> 00:17:48.381
If you're someone who
is not from the U.S.,

00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.461
or you're not familiar
with tipping guidelines,

00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:53.726
if you're going to a sit-down restaurant,

00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:56.006
the guidelines is typically,

00:17:56.006 --> 00:17:59.989
15-20% of your bill you
will leave as a tip.

00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:02.563
That's your bill before taxes.

00:18:02.563 --> 00:18:04.310
So, if your bill is $100,

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.702
you might leave a $15 tip.

00:18:07.702 --> 00:18:11.274
Taxis, you would probably
tip 10 to 15-20%,

00:18:11.274 --> 00:18:12.983
depending upon how good the ride is.

00:18:12.983 --> 00:18:15.763
In your hotel, you should
also tip the housekeeping,

00:18:15.763 --> 00:18:19.157
a couple dollars a
night is typically nice.

00:18:19.157 --> 00:18:21.779
And if people bring bags to your room,

00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:23.917
a dollar or two to help
them out with that.

00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:26.820
The valet, you might tip a dollar or two.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.750
There's guides you can look
up for tipping etiquette.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.124
But just be prepared to have
a lot of $1 bills for tips.

00:18:33.124 --> 00:18:35.515
When I come to Vegas,
the first thing I do,

00:18:35.515 --> 00:18:38.501
is I take my 20s and I go into
the bill-breaking machines

00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:39.803
in the casinos.

00:18:39.803 --> 00:18:41.740
I put the 20s in there and
get a whole bunch of ones,

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.469
so that I have a whole bunch of $1 bills

00:18:43.469 --> 00:18:45.192
for my stay for all the tips.

00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:46.958
And I know some of you might be thinking

00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.236
it's for strip clubs, but
it's not. It's for tips.

00:18:50.236 --> 00:18:52.214
And so, just a couple other
things you should know.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.155
These aren't part of the 10,
but there are a couple things

00:18:54.155 --> 00:18:56.036
that I just want to leave you with

00:18:56.036 --> 00:19:00.047
is to skip the time-share sales pitches.

00:19:00.047 --> 00:19:02.186
There's gonna be people
that'll try to lure you in

00:19:02.186 --> 00:19:04.702
to see free shows, or things like that.

00:19:04.702 --> 00:19:06.628
Generally, something
that's too good to be true

00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:07.726
is too good to be true.

00:19:07.726 --> 00:19:10.135
If you go to a time-share
to get a discount on a show,

00:19:10.135 --> 00:19:12.009
you're gonna waste a whole
bunch of time in there.

00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:14.078
And really it's not worth your time.

00:19:14.078 --> 00:19:15.453
Just enjoy your time in Vegas.

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:17.194
Pay for the things you want.

00:19:17.194 --> 00:19:19.891
And don't be doing that
too good to be true.

00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:22.066
Alright, well that wraps up this video.

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:24.025
Now you know everything you need to know

00:19:24.025 --> 00:19:25.654
to come to Las Vegas.
