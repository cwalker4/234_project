00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.760
This is the moment Estelle and I began to
question our sanity.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.700
There's definitely a promising cave down there.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.450
I don't know if it's a bear den or a mountain
lion den.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.990
We’re right about here just outside of Yellowstone
National Park.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.789
And we’re looking for a tiny box

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.570
about the size of a happy meal

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.099
that’s filled with over a million dollars
worth of treasure.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
We’re here because of a guy named Forrest
Fenn.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.480
You might have heard of him.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.730
Well you've likely heard of that Santa Fe
author Forrest Fenn.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.120
Forrest Fenn
On to this a Santa Fe art collector and author,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.410
Forrest Fenn.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.940
Fenn is one of those rare characters he's
like straight out of a wild west film.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.780
He served as a pilot in the Air Force, took
up a hobby as an amatuer archeologist, then

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.550
later moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and opened
an Art Gallery.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.660
Over the years, he amassed a collection of
artifacts worthy of the finest museums.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.450
He made a fortune selling his wares to US
Presidents and Hollywood tycoons.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.620
In 1988, Fenn was diagnosed with cancer.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.719
He fought it off — but it got him thinking
about his legacy.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.719
When faced with his own mortality, he decided
to do what any eccentric man might do to ensure

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.340
his spirit lived on after death.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789
He buried a treasure chest.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.159
Some time between 2009 and 2010, Forrest claims
that he trekked out into the Rocky Mountains

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.220
and hid a 12th century bronze chest containing
42 pounds of his finest treasures — gold

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.820
nuggets the size of chicken eggs, 16th-century
Spanish jewelry, and even a ming dynasty jade

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.960
sculpture.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.240
In 2010, Fenn self-published The Thrill of
the Chase, the memoir

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.789
And in the back of the book there’s a poem.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.670
That poem contains 9 clues that supposedly
lead to the treasure’s exact location.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.649
It goes a little something like this.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.119
As I have gone alone in there And with my
treasures bold, I can keep my secret where,

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.079
And hint of riches new and old.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.000
Begin it where warm waters halt And take it
in the canyon down, Not far, but too far to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
walk.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.009
Put in below the home of Brown.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.990
From there it’s no place for the meek,
The end is ever drawing nigh;

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.500
There’ll be no paddle up your creek,
Just heavy loads and water high.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.470
If you’ve been wise and found the blaze,
Look quickly down, your quest to cease,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.980
But tarry scant with marvel gaze,
Just take the chest and go in peace.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.470
So why is it that I must go
And leave my trove for all to seek?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.730
The answers I already know,
I’ve done it tired, and now I’m weak.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.290
So hear me all and listen good,
Your effort will be worth the cold.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.340
If you are brave and in the wood
I give you title to the gold.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.900
Ten years later, nobody’s found it — and
many have tried.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.400
But Forrest, who’s now a cult-like figure
in the treasure hunting world, has admitted

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.300
that four of the nine clues have been solved.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.580
And apparently, some people have gotten within
250 feet of the gold.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.640
Update this morning on a story we have been
telling you about for years a man who decided

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.650
to give away his fortune claimed to have buried
it somewhere out west several years ago.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.920
The treasure is real.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.689
The treasure story is real.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.560
The treasure is hidden where I left it and
the search goes on.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.840
In public and private Facebook groups, more
than 8,000 members rage in these deep philosophical

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.670
debates over the interpretation of the clues.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.859
The “FindingFennsGold” sub-Reddit boasts
1,600 regular contributors, who pose questions

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.862
like “What kind of hill can an 80 year-old
man climb?” and “Does anyone else here

00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:45.010
have dreams about the treasure?”

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.909
Over the past year, we talked to a lot of
these treasure hunters.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:49.989
Like Ricky and Greg.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.000
You can see big red behind me.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.310
We’re here in historic Natchez, Mississippi
today.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.180
They’re engineers on a steamboat.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.749
So this is a daily search for you?

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:01.870
Every night.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.209
Every night I'm looking.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.540
If you ask anybody that works with us on the
boat they will tell you that Greg, oh yeah,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.430
he's the one looking for Forrest Fenn's treasure.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.430
No I'm not this type of person at all.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:20.049
I do crossword puzzles I don't like camping
it was the extreme opposite of anything I've

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.280
ever done.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.280
So how did you first hear about Fenn's treasure.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.310
Well I've never heard of it before until this.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.060
There it is.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.900
Treasure hunter dies in search of writers
$2 million gold.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.080
In the morning I get this newspaper delivered
and by about 2 o'clock in the afternoon i

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.780
think I've solved it.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.370
I studied geography in college so I'm all
into maps.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.560
I spent hours upon hours just looking through
google maps at all the places he went.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.330
It's really easy to become obsessed with this
story.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.800
This is Josh and his Dad, they spent a week
traversing New Mexico for a family vacation.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.810
Just looking for the chest.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:09.470
I’d say about 8 weeks of really hard research,
google maps, little sleep, too excited to

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.020
sleep type of stuff

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.170
A lot of too excited to sleep for me.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.970
And that obsession?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.420
It happened to us too.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.610
I asked Zack if he wanted to help me find
the treasure.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.890
I said “absolutely yes.”

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.599
So we went to the Rocky Mountains with a foolproof
plan to find Forrest Fenn’s gold.

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.330
[Cow moo]

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.660
Come on buddy, please move.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.240
We are definitely in Wyoming.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.470
[Phone rings]

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.319
Hi it's Scott

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.550
Hey Scott?

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.780
It's Zack.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.320
So you're wondering Montana looking for treasure?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.160
Actually we're on the road right now we just
came from Bozeman and we're driving down toward

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Wyoming.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.190
We're pretty convinced the treasure's there.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.190
Wyoming?

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.190
Okay.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.830
Well Wyoming is the right state, no question.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.830
Oh yeah?

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.830
Really?

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.830
Absolutely.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.080
Have you been to your spot yet?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
I have.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.710
I made a mistake.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.090
You probably heard this story from multiple
people as well.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.470
It's what keeps me awake at night at the moment.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.470
But if you were to go back you know what the
mistake was?

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.870
Absolutely.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.020
You're scaring me I feel like we're going
to come back from this trip and just not sleep

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.020
for weeks.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.090
Is this your first time that you’ve been
out searching?

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.949
You’ll be out there and you’ll find what
everybody else finds.

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:46.860
Your reaction will be “wow we could spend
the next 10 years right here right where we

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.440
are and never stumble across a 10x10x6 chest.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.460
Dude I’m shocked he just said it’s in
Wyoming like I expected him to be really adamant

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.539
it’s in colorado

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:02.539
- yeah

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:09.720
and I feel pretty good right now that this
established esteemed treasure hunter thinks

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.412
that it's uh in the same general at least
the same state where we're going.

00:07:15.412 --> 00:07:21.540
At least we’re in the right state, Estelle.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.699
There's a weird unspoken dynamic with Fenn
treasure hunters.

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:29.090
We're a community and we're all collectively
scratching our heads trying to decipher what

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.409
Forrest Fenn is telling us.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:35.900
But we don't want to give away too much after
all we want to be the first ones to find that

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.430
treasure.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:43.539
In our research, we came across this map made
the amatuer cartographers.

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.050
Using geographic data from the clues they
were able to narrow down the original search

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.990
area from 27 million acres to 591,636 acres.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.180
That’s a 98% reduction in size.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.280
Even just in that area, we’re looking at
23,310 acres of wild land.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.840
We now think it's probably more towards Yellowstone.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.740
Where specifically did you go in Yellowstone?

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.820
I can't give you too many clues!

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.699
I haven't found the treasure yet.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:18.669
If I got it, it's more about being know as
the person that found it.

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:19.949
That's all I want.

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:23.229
Zack and I each spent week coming up with
our own theories.

00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:28.460
Zack spent an entire afternoon trying to convince
me that the longitude and latitude markers

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.180
on Fenn's map were a clue.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.350
Obviously that was crazy.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.380
He actually owns Sitting Bull's original peace
pipe.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.380
What?

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.200
It's worth $1.1 million dollars.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.380
That checks out.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.490
All the old men look like Forrest Fenn out
here.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.220
Every elderly gentleman I drive by I just
the first my first though is

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.220
- I'm like it's Forrest!

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.220
Yeah.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.700
What does that say about how obsessed we are.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.160
We reached out to Fenn early on in our research
with the same starry eyes that many treasure

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.220
hunters do.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.200
He denied our request to interview him.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.670
Yeah I wonder how many people he emails and
he's just like god damn why do I have to answer

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.920
another one of these emails.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:15.870
Maybe it's because he knew we were getting
close to the treasure.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.529
And with that, here is where I think the treasure
is.

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:22.570
So first you start with "Where warm waters
halt."

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.600
That's the Firehole River Falls right in the
heart of Yellowstone National park.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.029
Now the name of the river speaks for itself.

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.029
Oh okay.

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:31.029
There's the cave.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.029
There it is.

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:34.360
Oh man, that is not what I expected.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.940
Actually in 2007 water temperatures in the
falls rose to 82 degrees and it killed a bunch

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.460
of trout there, pretty much halting life.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:50.410
So coincidentally right above the falls there's
this canyon and it leads to the Madison River.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.470
Now if you take the Madison River straight
to Hebgen Lake that's "too far to walk."

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.290
So at this point we're right on the border
of Montana and Wyoming but it's a place Fenn

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.390
explored as a kid so that counts for something.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:09.910
Now above Hebgen Lake is grizzly bear territory
"Home of Brown" and Red canyon creek "No paddle

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.340
up your creek"

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.950
So in 1959 a massive earthquake shook this
region and the Hebgen Lake dam gave way creating

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.920
Quake lake along with a deadly landslide.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.910
That's heavy loads and water high.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.640
But Estelle, what's the blaze?

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.400
Honestly it could be anything.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.399
A lot of people think you'll only be able
to see it if you're standing in the exact

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.399
right spot.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:38.520
So all of that sounds really good to me but
the skeptic in me says "hold on Estelle" this

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.250
is a highly interpretive poem thousands of
people have come up with hundreds and hundreds

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.709
of different theories that seem to fit perfectly
like puzzle pieces.

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:51.040
Are you going to tell me that I'm wrong right
now?

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.730
I will not crush you in this moment.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:58.160
Forrest himself has acknowledged that this
treasure may very well be around for 10,000

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.100
years before someone finds it.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:11.400
At least one person has been within 200 feet
of the treasure and if that has happened

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.400
- someone was standing 200 feet away from
millions of dollars!

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.130
Yeah if that happened with six years of it
being hidden then how could it possibly last

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.130
1,000 years.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.950
radio: make the bears aware of your presence
and carry bear spray.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:25.649
Bear spray has been shown to be over 90% effective
in deterring bear attacks.

00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:29.870
So we realized very quickly that despite these
cute pictures of bears in yellowstone they

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:38.610
are very dangerous and we could very easily
get mauled by one today if we're not careful.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.750
So apparently this thing has 7 seconds of
spray in it.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:48.399
That's about enough to ward off one grizzly
bear.

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:54.660
Hopefully we won't need to use it today.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.250
Fenn's treasure has lured many unprepared
hunters into the wilderness.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.899
We talked with a park ranger actually who
said people had ventured into snow impacted

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:05.760
mountain ranges with just tennis shoes.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.550
This morning we're waiting on the office of
the medical investigator find out how a hiker

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.320
searching for Forrest Fenn's treasure died.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.200
In January 2016 Randy Bilyeu went missing
in search of the treasure six months later

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.350
he was found dead.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:30.930
Somewhere in this area which is a huge area
of land is the treasure.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:38.590
And it's just a matter of figuring out that
exact spot.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.320
We're a mile pass the trailhead and I think
we found something.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.470
It's a tiny little cave that you could easily
miss.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:54.570
Zack has now decided to climb up the entire
face of this cliff and try to get into a cave

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.680
that's about a couple hundred feet high.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.970
There was a time when I thought the Fenn treasure
could be in a cave because one thing he said

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:11.829
was that it's in a spot that you could come
back to in 10,000 years and it might hypothetically

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:13.089
still be there.

00:13:13.089 --> 00:13:20.130
A cave protects things from the elements so
I thought maybe that was a possibility

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.490
Definitely not in that cave though.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.680
We're wondering Wyoming constantly asking
ourselves.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.579
What would Fenn do?

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:34.279
Where would an adventurous fly fisherman who
loves history artifacts and practical jokes

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:37.330
hide a treasure chest?

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.116
Do you think Fenn's going to watch this and
think we're a bunch of idiots?

00:13:41.116 --> 00:13:47.110
I think Fenn is the kind of guy that thinks
a lot of people are idiots so

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.320
Look I just don't want him to think I'm an
idiot.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.149
I'd like to make a film that gains his respect
a little bit.

00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:56.180
Like I would like to think that Fenn is sitting
somewhere tipping his cowboy hat to us.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.980
It's really clear from every treasure hunter
we talked to that once you have a potential

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.540
solve it's really hard to entertain any other
theory, even if it makes total sense.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.290
Here it is six years later and I found the
spot.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.862
At the first opportunity he gets to go back
out there I think he'll find it.

00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:17.389
That's the beauty of it everyone knows where
it is one of us has got to be right.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:23.579
You could completely solve the poem and be
on totally the right trail and you still might

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:24.680
miss the treasure.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.500
There are some theories that this is all about
poop.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.500
Heavy loads.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.670
Oh my god.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.670
There's like

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.670
- Home of Brown, heavy loads

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.670
No paddle up your creek

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.139
I think that just proves how interpretive
this is.

00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:48.441
You could literally take every clue in that
poem and make it about a piece of crap.

00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:49.441
So where are we going?

00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:54.470
So today we are heading back into the heart
of Yellowstone park which is apparently the

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.530
oldest park in the United States.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:05.649
Actually last night I did a little sleuthing
and found out that Forrest is a board member

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:07.230
at Buffalo Bill center.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:13.199
Some hunters seem to think that Fenn hid the
treasure while up here on a trip for a board

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:17.639
members meeting and he just took off one morning,
hid the treasure and came back for his black

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:21.540
bow tie event in September of 2009.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.480
That theory would definitely correspond with
the Lamar Valley area and also with Fenn's

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.120
fascination of the Native American history
that this valley holds.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:37.470
We are going to drive all the way down highway
212 to a place called Icebox Canyon.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:45.110
In this canyon there's a creek called Soda
Butte creek.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:51.500
Soda Butte is this extinct geyser in the middle
of the Valley.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.140
Soda Butte.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.339
It's also along highway 212.

00:15:57.339 --> 00:16:01.980
212 being the temperature at which water boils.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.579
And it's right near Icebox Canyon.

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:07.920
There's no way this isn't the place "where
warm waters halt."

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.500
A bear completely mauled this area we're standing
in right now uh all the trees around us are

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.880
just completely scratched up.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.709
That's insane.

00:16:20.709 --> 00:16:25.209
Okay so that's just one clue Zack, where do
we go from there?

00:16:25.209 --> 00:16:27.150
The Lamar Ranger station.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:32.279
Now every hunter has a line from the poem
they obsess over

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:38.139
And the line that seems to get the most people's
attention is "put in below the home of Brown."

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:40.759
Everybody focuses on the home of Brown.

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:41.759
Everybody.

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:45.990
Any searcher you speak to they're going to
say "if we can find the home of Brown we can

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.990
find the treasure."

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.399
Like a lot of the poem, it’s pointing to
a specific location.

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:54.600
Have you talked to any treasure hunters what’s
the take on that Brown?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.470
Give me some insights.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.899
Looking at a map, there are literally hundreds
of locations it could refer to.

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:05.910
You've got all of America looking for house
of Brown

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:13.350
One of the things that led us to the brown
one is that the B is capitalized in “Brown.”

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:19.310
If you Google the Lamar Ranger Station it’s
clearly a hot spot for Fenn’s treasure hunters.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.260
It’s this old ranch in the historic district
of the park.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.630
And back in the day, there was a really well-known
ranger there named Gary Brown.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.010
Home of Brown.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:36.020
Well this is the home of Brown.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:43.190
Looks like the main facilities are closed
down and uh it's not open to the public besides

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.010
that I guess.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:54.420
Maybe they shut it down because so many treasure
hunters came through asking.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:04.210
If it's not clear on our faces our confidence
is completely shot right now.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:09.060
Every treasure hunter will tell you this you
start a hike with rose colored glasses and

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.890
by the end you realize that your task was
nearly impossible.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:20.690
You're trying to find a 10x10x6 inch chest
in 3,000 square miles of land if we're completely

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.440
wrong about Yellowstone that's 300,000 square
miles of land.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:36.200
We started all the way up here at icebox canyon
followed down soda butte creek all the way

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.680
down to the lamar ranger station which is
our home of brown and then from there all

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.540
we know is it's somewhere below the home of
Brown.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.970
It could be on anyone of these trails or ridges
or rivers or creeks.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:56.520
You should just point to random spot on the
map be like let's just go there.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.640
Alright.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.880
Fossil forrest.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:09.820
That would be 10 miles of walking for forrest
fenn and about 1200 to 1600 feet of elevation

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.820
gain.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:17.290
I'm sure forrest is an absolute beast on the
trails but how much does an 80 year old man

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.290
do?

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:26.530
I came to this with a limited amount of optimism
and I think most of that optimism is now gone.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:35.250
Fenn says that his poem specifically leads
to a very very concrete spot and I just don't

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.250
see it.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:42.720
The clues are so vague and interpretive that
I just can't possibly imagine them culminating

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.680
on an exact spot on a map.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.180
We really have become crazy about this

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.180
- yeah.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.310
I feel like this journey has changed me.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.980
Where are we going?

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.230
I don't know.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.570
After coming back and maybe going into this
convinced that you knew where the treasure

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:05.390
was like a lot of other hunters and then coming
back and realizing it wasn't there, did it

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.600
change your mind at all about maybe that there
is no treasure?

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.870
There was a time frame when we started to
wonder if it was real.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.520
He's gone through far too much trouble for
it to be a hoax.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.760
Why would he do it?

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.030
This is his legacy to the world.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.240
I think it's a great legacy.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.950
And I think he'll be happy if someone finds
it in his lifetime.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:28.710
One thing about Forrest is that he's genuine
about hiding this treasure.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:34.580
So if anybody that has that type of ability
to get that type of stuff has no issue in

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.160
my opinion putting together a box of the stuff
he said he had.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.620
It's certainly plausible that he'd be able
to do such a thing and i think he's eccentric

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.940
enough that he would.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.020
I feel like we're just taking random guesses
at this point you know?

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.540
I think really we're lost after the first
three or four clues.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:02.330
He probably put it in some secret Forrest
Fenn cave somewhere.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:14.630
Uh there's a huge herd of deer or something
crossing the street up there.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:20.730
Let's go check it out.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.390
What are they?

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.650
Those look like mountain goats.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.690
Those are mountain goats.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.690
Holy crap.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.690
Okay.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:33.690
Let's pause for a second.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.870
We thought for sure those were cute little
mountain goats but in our excitement we failed

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.660
to realize that these were big horned sheep.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.110
Nonetheless we lost our minds.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:53.890
Oh look at the rainbow in the background.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:22:01.230
Oh dude are you kidding me?

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.680
That's insane.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.400
The treasure at the end of the rainbow.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400
Unbelievable.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.520
The whole entire trip left a lasting impression
on me.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520
Take on this poem.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.670
I don't even know the right word for it.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.890
It's just a very cryptic poem, but it's a
fun poem.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:27.880
I'm starting to think about why Fenn planned
this and why he did it and I'm starting to

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.330
think that the treasure itself isn't so important.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.950
As hokey as that sounds.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.390
It's pretty hokey

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.440
It is pretty hokey.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.290
His story about surviving a terminal kidney
cancer diagnosis really helped me with my

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.700
own health struggles and just being able to
go out there and follow in his footsteps too.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.110
I'm so proud to be able to go out and do it.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:54.070
Is this sort of like a moment in your past
or do you think you're going to continually

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.380
think about it all the time.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.760
Oh no, oh my god no.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.130
The best is yet to come.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.230
Let me put it to you this way, in the end
everyone is going to be left with a smile

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.010
on their face.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:07.150
You're as ambiguous as Forrest is.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:13.680
We went down dozens of trails over the past
five days and we came up completely empty.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.510
We didn't find the treasure.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.820
We probably didn't even come close.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:53.030
But maybe we did and we'll just never know.
