00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:01.943
Mr. Rickles.

00:00:01.943 --> 00:00:03.394
I'm not ready for you yet.

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:04.379
[Laughing]

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:13.278
What a pleasure to meet you.

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:15.702
I've seen you many times.

00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:16.233
Is that right?

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.227
Yeah, when the Dodgers lost.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:21.306
And then you blamed it on me, essentially.

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:22.743
&gt;&gt; I get that all the time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:24.474
How long you been on, on the show?

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:28.256
I've been with, uh, national TV sports for 20 years now.

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.215
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:30.267
Twenty years.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:31.432
How long have you been a Dodger fan?

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:32.722
Since they didn't have uniforms.

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.741
[Laughing]

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.707
Well, I was a Giant fan in New York.

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:37.990
&gt;&gt; My folks lived in Brooklyn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.169
And they grew up Dodger fans, went to Ebbets Field.

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:46.463
Yeah, well, I started out as a Giants fan and then Tommy Lasorda became a good friend.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.574
Lasorda was the man.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:52.401
Here's our new entertainment coach,

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:53.874
Don Rickles.

00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:54.800
It's all in the jog.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.829
Uh, Tubs, would you get down on the end?

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.028
But Tommy, one time he had me put on the uniform,

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:04.611
and he said, “Go out and take the pitcher out of the game."

00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.551
And I walked out to the mound. "Well, you can't take me outta the game."

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:09.525
"You're not even a player."

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:10.193
"Who are you?"

00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:12.054
I said, "Don't be a smart-ass."

00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:13.444
"Just give me the ball."

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.002
"You're coming out of the game."

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.963
Vin was probably at the mic calling the game.

00:01:17.963 --> 00:01:18.529
Probably so.

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:19.203
I don't know.

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:21.197
“Here comes Tommy to the mound. Hold on a minute.”

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:22.213
“That's not Tommy.”

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:24.939
“That looks a lot like Don Rickles taking the pitcher out.”

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.707
With that Harry Wendelstedt, big umpire, great umpire.

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:28.597
Oh, I remember him.

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:31.500
He used to run out to the mound, ripped off the mask, and said,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.749
"What's going on here?"

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.244
And he saw me, he said, "Don, can you get me two tickets for ‘The Dean Martin Show’?”

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:38.208
[Laughing]

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:38.792
It's true.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.251
Did you ever go to a Super Bowl?

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:44.373
Oh, yeah, with the Philadelphia Eagles.

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:48.086
They got in a circle before the game in the locker room.

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:53.279
“Give us a break, let us win.”

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.956
They got all through with the service in the circle and I said, "What about the Jews?"

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:00.731
And I got in the middle of the circle and I put on a yarmulke

00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:02.700
and I went, “Baruch atah”

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.270
and I started making prayers.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.058
And all these guys were on their knees with, with this crap and...

00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:09.685
Is that why they lost the Super Bowl do you think?

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:10.515
I don't know.

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:11.685
Leave me alone, Rich.

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:12.681
[Laughing]

00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:13.995
I'm a Jew.

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:15.045
&gt;&gt; Are you Jewish?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:15.994
Sit here.

00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:18.089
[Laughing]

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.136
What college you go to?

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:20.752
I went to Michigan, University of Michigan.

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:22.167
Oh, yeah, good school.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.009
Born in Brooklyn, raised in Staten Island.

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.825
Oh, so your father must be a gangster.

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:28.220
[Laughing]

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.668
Well, uh, New York City public school educator, retired.

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:33.119
Same with my mom.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.904
And we always watched you.

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:37.865
&gt;&gt; Really? Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yes, always.

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.275
I've said no to women before.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:43.715
[Laughing]

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:47.227
You, you learn how to do that when you've got a body like mine.

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.450
[Laughing]

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.656
That was a big hit in the Eisen household.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:53.696
Big hit in your house, but the rest of America wasn't watching.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.801
As an actor and, you know, as a sports person, you can't please everybody.

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.009
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; But I would say 100 percent of America loved me.

00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:04.159
How did you become friends with Frank?

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.833
I threw myself in front of his car.

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.776
[Laughing]

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:11.000
&gt;&gt; He was appearing at the, uh, Fontainebleau.
&gt;&gt; In Miami.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.517
Yeah, and I was working at a place called Murray Franklin's, a little joint.

00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:16.715
And my mother said, uh, she was very aggressive.

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:18.374
She said, "I'm gonna go see Dolly."

00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:19.413
That was Frank's mother.

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:20.956
“Get him to come and see you.”

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:23.143
I said, "Ma, don’t. “Just keep quiet."

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:23.813
"I'll handle it."

00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:29.095
She said, "Dolly, darling, if you could get Frank to come and see my sonny boy..."

00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:30.436
Done, done, done.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:34.641
Next thing you know, Frank walked in with three of his guys, all scientists.

00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:35.870
[Laughing]

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.600
They all came in and sat down and went, "What time does it go on?"

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.569
"What time?"

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.825
And we became friends.

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.537
What in the world is it like walking around Italy with Frank Sinatra?

00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:46.512
It was, it, he was great with the people.

00:03:46.512 --> 00:03:49.945
He was, you know. And I used to be the one that walked in front of him and said,

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:50.869
"Don't bother Frank."

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:54.053
"He's got a lot of money on him and he's pissed off if you bother him."

00:03:54.053 --> 00:03:54.553
You know...

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.189
I used to kid around. But he liked that.

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.472
Marco Monganonzo was hurt.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:04.340
[Laughing]

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.885
Marco Monganonzo?

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:08.045
Fambino Bambazzo...

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:10.921
two bullets in the head Thursday.

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:13.649
[Laughing]

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.690
We had some good times together, yeah.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.118
We did. I miss him.

00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:21.569
I sang “I’ve Got the World on a String" at my wedding.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:22.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, really?
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.733
Oh, so you know.

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:25.829
I've got, I've, I've, I've got it in me.

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:29.990
Not to take away from Frank, but the other day we were at, uh, Kirk Douglas' house

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.346
and he turned 100.

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:32.229
Yeah, right.

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.686
And Kirk and I go back maybe 40, 50 years.

00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:40.087
Every time I see him I go, "You know, Kirk, it's, it's great to be together."

00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:41.397
You know, and he laughs, you know.

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.353
And he, he's a great man, and 100 years old.

00:04:44.353 --> 00:04:45.215
A hundred.

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:46.640
Yeah, so I got up and spoke.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.932
Oh, people love when you speak, Don.

00:04:47.932 --> 00:04:49.218
You never heard me so, you know.

00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:51.727
I saw you at the Orleans a couple of times in Las Vegas.

00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:52.375
Oh, really?

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.034
I've seen, yes.

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:54.288
And you were tremendous.

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:55.475
But I'll tell you this,

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:56.977
That's the main thing.

00:04:56.977 --> 00:04:59.387
I know what people are, I swear to God.

00:04:59.387 --> 00:05:00.638
That's what I say from my heart.

00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:01.670
I know what people are.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.088
And you're German, right, my friend?

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:04.651
What is your heritage, my friend?

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:06.280
English? What? That's better?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.654
I'll tell you what.

00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:10.289
No, we need you people for the muffins.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.556
I'll tell you this.

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:13.911
How did you stay relevant so long?

00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:15.068
Being different.

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:18.813
What I do is very unusual.

00:05:18.813 --> 00:05:22.585
I mean, I don't think there's a comedian in the world that can do,

00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:26.503
and I don't say this egotistically, that can do what I do.

00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:29.624
Because there's a way of saying, "You sweater's ridiculous."

00:05:29.624 --> 00:05:31.527
Do you not like my sweater?

00:05:31.527 --> 00:05:35.223
I don't wanna say nothin', but have you ever thought of being a clown?

00:05:35.223 --> 00:05:37.076
[Laughing]

00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:38.030
It's got patches on it.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.843
I thought I'd make myself as presentable as possible for you.

00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:42.689
I could care less.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.754
[Laughing]

00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:46.496
Remember the words of a great negro.

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:47.938
I say that honestly.

00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:49.107
All peoples are alike.

00:05:49.107 --> 00:05:49.961
We are all working.

00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.242
You live in my neighborhood, I live in yours, right, Sam?

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:52.796
Right.

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:53.750
Are you crazy?

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.021
[Laughing]

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.825
Did you ever have to run for your life based off of something you said?

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:05.056
Oh, no, I was protected by Guido Mongananzo, Tony Tutututu.

00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:06.736
And they all said the same thing.

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:08.125
Anybody bothering ya?

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:11.064
No, I had some good friends in Brooklyn.

00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:15.733
Sirs, you save some room for desserts?

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:16.693
Now, where are you from?

00:06:16.693 --> 00:06:17.467
Milano.

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:19.951
Oh, my cousin was robbed there.

00:06:19.951 --> 00:06:22.057
[Laughing]
It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't me, I swear.

00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:23.211
That was the other...

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.163
Thank you, my friend.

00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:29.901
The big kick I got just recently, uh, in sports, Bob Arum is a friend of mine.

00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:30.771
&gt;&gt; You know Bob.
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.910
&gt;&gt; Boxing promoter.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.570
And he invited me to Manny Pacquiao's training camp.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.630
Oh, against Floyd Mayweather, that fight.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.373
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:38.853
I said, "Manny, it's good to see you."

00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:40.091
“I tell you something.”

00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:42.730
“You're gonna learn to fight and then why.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.003
“And you come box and that's good.”

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:46.274
“But learn how to box.”

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:48.875
And then I, like a schmuck, I went, "Yeah."

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.755
[Laughing]

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:51.919
“Yeah, Manny, you're right.”

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:53.401
Thank you so much.

00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:53.974
It's been a pleasure.

00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:55.034
Let me get this bill.

00:06:55.034 --> 00:06:55.915
OK.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:56.891
[Laughing]

00:06:56.891 --> 00:06:57.944
Who had the coffee?

00:06:57.944 --> 00:06:59.897
Well, honored to meet you.

00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:00.844
It's a pleasure.

00:07:00.844 --> 00:07:02.042
Big fan of all, of all these years.

00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:03.769
And I hope we see each other again real soon.

00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:04.254
I hope so too.

00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:04.850
You are the man.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.386
I love you.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:06.254
You're very sweet.

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:06.978
Thanks so much.

00:07:06.978 --> 00:07:07.667
You bet.

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.935
Don is a legend.

00:07:10.935 --> 00:07:14.219
I mean, growing up I would watch him and just laugh,

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.611
and just having a conversation with him about the difference between

00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:21.530
making fun of somebody and having fun with somebody, that's the difference.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.022
The insult comic as he might be known, he always would finish his act

00:07:26.022 --> 00:07:31.486
with a, a heartfelt thank-you and a, a reminder that he was just kidding

00:07:31.486 --> 00:07:32.699
and it's all in good fun.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.167
In this day and age, you just don't get that anymore.

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:36.571
He's not just a throwback.

00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:40.237
He is a break-the-mold-type figure.

00:07:40.237 --> 00:07:46.065
Pop culture, comedically, just as an American, uh, entertainer.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.632
It's just great to be around him.

00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:52.416
The fact that he actually insulted my sweater is something I'll never forget.

00:07:52.416 --> 00:07:54.023
That's, that's great.

00:07:54.883 --> 00:07:59.668
I mean, everybody wishes they'd have at least one moment of their lives

00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:01.712
to be on the business end of a Don Rickles insult.

00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:02.620
It's fantastic.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.005
What it do?

00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:12.210
It's your boy, big Snoop Dogg.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.419
And I need y'all to go subscribe right now to the AARP Channel.

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:16.057
You know what I'm talking about?

00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:19.015
So you can see Don Rickles and see his right-hand man,

00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:22.302
no, his left-hand man, Snoop Dogg, live and direct.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:23.141
Go subscribe right now.

00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:23.848
What you waitin' on?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.649
What did he say?

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:27.949
[Laughing]
