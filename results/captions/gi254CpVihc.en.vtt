00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:01.710
We're back with Octavia Spencer.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.585
We're going to play one
of my favorite games.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.010
It's called "5-Second Rule."

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.680
And it's very simple.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.560
tWitch is going to name
three things in five seconds.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.060
You say them, and
then you hit that,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.770
and we'll see how much
time is left on the clock.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.269
OK.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.292
And we shall play.

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.250
I will start, so you know
what we're doing, OK.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.865
All right.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.940
Ellen, three lies
you've told recently.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.020
I don't lie, so
I'll make things up.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.920
Hey, you're ugly.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.000
Why did I do that?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.500
I--

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.050
[BUZZER]

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.905
--um speeding.

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.563
You're ugly.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:35.160
I don't-- I don't
know how to tell lies.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.656
So I just thought--

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:37.760
I love it.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.085
I love it.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:40.075
That's good.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:41.461
All right, all right.

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:41.960
OK, Octavia.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.430
Yeah, wait, wait, let
me get the rules right.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.830
OK.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.621
I press that first?

00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:45.270
No, no.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.770
No, OK.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.220
No, that's what stops the clock.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.720
Oh, OK.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.040
And you have to say
them in five seconds.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.600
OK, I got to say them
and then OK, OK, OK.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.410
So you only have five seconds.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.100
It goes fast.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.880
It goes real fast.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.720
So you name the three
things, then hit that.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.120
Then I hit it.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.440
OK, three things
and then I hit it.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.060
Yeah, OK, ready?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.560
OK.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.818
She's pretty but not so fast.

00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:00.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.620
Three things you're
really thinking

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.431
when you lose an Oscar.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:04.930
[DING]

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.668
I should've won.

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:06.168
Oh.

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.156
God.

00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:13.138
[CHEERING]

00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:13.638
God.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:21.108
I'm having a hard
time with this button.

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:23.100
I'm having a hard
time, I'm telling you.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm nervous.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.801
Oh, man.

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:27.170
All right, can I do over?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.810
You're not helping
yourself get a man.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.517
I know.

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:31.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.040
Gosh, OK, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.500
No, I say it, and
then I press it.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.000
Yeah.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.341
[LAUGHS]

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:38.682
OK.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:39.576
OK.

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:42.890
Ellen, three things an
old-timey reporter would say.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.659
Yeah, see, OK,
nothing to see here.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.450
Everybody get back.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.949
[DING]

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:48.258
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:48.995
I got you.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:49.900
I got you.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.400
I got you.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.120
I'm ready.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.470
I'm ready.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.340
Oh, man.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.777
OK.

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:56.110
Thank you for clapping for that.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.651
That was bad.

00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:57.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.996 --> 00:02:01.130
OK, Octavia, do three
facial expressions

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.410
you make when you're excited.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.404
[TICKING]

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:04.398
[DING]

00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:05.889
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:06.839
There you go.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:07.380
There you go.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.368
I did it.

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:10.859
That's it.

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:11.735
She did three?

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:12.860
I did three really quickly.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.360
I saw two.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.886
That's my--

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:14.760
All right, all right.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.860
All right.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.410
OK, Ellen, three pickup lines.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.340
Look at you.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.090
Hey, come over here.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:24.740
[DING]

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:36.148
[CHEERING]

00:02:36.148 --> 00:02:37.636
Look at you.

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:39.620
Look at you.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.108
Look at you.

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:42.596
Look at you.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.084
Look at you.

00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:45.572
[LAUGHS]

00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:47.060
Come over here?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.548
I love it.

00:02:48.548 --> 00:02:50.036
I love it.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.524
Look at you.

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.508
Look at you.

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:54.570
OK, Octavia.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.730
Yes.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.245
Three things you'd
like to touch.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.452
[TICKING]

00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:01.404
I just thought of them.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:02.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.820
I thought of them real fast.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.772
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:09.230
That doesn't count, does it?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.320
Do you know you haven't
answered one round?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.112
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:14.010
Not one.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.450
But this is happening
so fast in my mind.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.510
[BELL RINGING]

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.220
Oh my god, we're out of time.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.400
I'm literally-- I'm like, oh
my god, I can't say that on TV.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.651
Yes you can.

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:30.070
All right, I want everybody
at home, everyone--

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.072
I'm sorry, not everyone.

00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:33.530
Everyone in the audience is
going home with a 5-Second Rule

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.330
board game.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.276
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:39.731
You're not going
home empty handed.

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.204
You're getting a toaster oven.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:42.177
Yes!

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:42.677
Yeah.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.810
That's for her.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.280
Don't-- everybody
got so excited.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.220
That's for her.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.130
Anyway, Instant Family opens
everywhere on November 16.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.950
We'll be back.
