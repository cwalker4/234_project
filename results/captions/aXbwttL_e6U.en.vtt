00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.564
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:10.498
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE SUCH AN

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.467
IMPORTANT PART OF THE

00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:16.137
NOMINATION PROCESS, THE DEBATES

00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:18.106
AND TRUST THEM TO FOLKS WHO AT

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:18.840
THE TOP LEVELS ARE CONSULTING

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.143
DONALD TRUMP BEFORE THEY DO

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:29.451
ANYTHING.CHRIS: THAT IS DNC

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:30.385
CHAIR TOM PEREZ MAKING IT

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:31.719
OFFICIAL, FOX NEWS IS OUTCOME

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.420
EXCLUDED FROM POSTING ANY OF

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:33.388
THE 12 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.721
DEBATES.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:34.556
OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND WE ARE

00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:36.458
BACK NOW WITH A PANEL.

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:37.792
WE ARE PREPARING FOR THIS AND I

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:38.493
REALIZE THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:39.794
ONE HERE WHO HAS NO TIES EITHER

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:45.066
TO FOX NEWS OR TO THEM SO I

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:50.572
WILL LET YOU START.

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:51.306
--

00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:52.040
YOUR BUST AUSTRALIAN.

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.576
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE DNC

00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:56.244
MOVE BOTH AS PRACTICAL POLITICS

00:00:56.245 --> 00:01:00.582
AND I SERIOUSLY, SAY WHAT YOU

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:00.882
THINK.

00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:02.017
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HURTING HER

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:02.584
FEELINGS.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:08.223
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WASN'T SURPRISED BY

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:08.690
IT.

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:09.324
IT SHOWED TO ME THAT HE,

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:09.958
EXPECTED THAT HE MIGHT DO

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:18.100
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:18.600
CHRIS: TOM PEREZ.

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.234
&gt;&gt; YES THE DNC CHAIRMAN.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:20.335
SINCE IT'S A 2016 ELECTION THE

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.636
DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS AND

00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:22.104
PRIMARY VOTERS.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:25.407
IT'S NOT JUST FOX, THEY RALLIED

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:26.074
AGAINST THE NEW YORK TIMES

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:26.775
REPUBLISHING HILLARY EMAILS.

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:28.043
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GETTING BLAMED

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:34.783
FOR DONALD TRUMP, WE SAW THE

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:37.553
BACKLASH WHEN THEY HIRED --

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:38.387
FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

00:01:38.388 --> 00:01:39.755
THE DECISION DID NOT SURPRISE

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:40.022
ME.

00:01:40.023 --> 00:01:41.023
WHAT IF THAT WAS DISINGENUOUS

00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:42.658
WAS THE EXPLANATION THAT SAID

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.392
YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO SEE IF WE

00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:46.562
COULD EXPAND YOU KNOW WE WANT

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:47.930
TO REACH OUT BUT THEN HE SAID

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.365
THIS NEW YORKER STORY CAME OUT

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.032
AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:53.902
THE IDEA THAT IT WAS A SECRET

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:54.636
THAT IT'S ON YOUR NETWORK, SEAN

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:58.774
HANNITY WOULD BE ONE.

00:01:58.775 --> 00:01:59.808
CLOSE TO THE PRESENT THEY WOULD

00:01:59.809 --> 00:02:08.283
SAY WENT ON STAGE YOU CAN SAY

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:09.051
SINCE TENSION OF THE

00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:09.585
ADMINISTRATION.

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:10.519
THIS WAS NOT CHANGE, NO

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.854
MATERIAL FACTS IN THE NEW

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:12.488
YORKER STORY THAT CHANGED

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.122
ANYTHING WE ALREADY KNEW.

00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:14.290
AND SEAN HANNITY IS NOT

00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:15.057
MODERATING THE DEBATE.

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:16.325
WAS IT POLITICAL DECISION THAT

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:16.859
HE MADE TO SATISFY.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.397
CHRIS: WE ASKED YOU ABOUT THE

00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:22.731
DECISION TO EXCLUDE FOX FROM

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:26.569
DEBATES, WITHOUT THIS ON

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.670
TWITTER FROM -- WHAT MESSAGE

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:28.504
SHOULD THIS SENT TO THE PUBLIC

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:29.739
AT LARGE WHEN THE NUMBER ONE

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.043
LEADING NEWS NETWORK BY FAR,

00:02:34.044 --> 00:02:35.311
FOR QUITE SOME TIME, IS DENIED

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:37.380
A DEBATE BY AN ENTIRE POLITICAL

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.147
PARTY BECAUSE THE PARTY

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:42.418
BELIEVES IT CANNOT BE TREATED

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:43.586
FAIRLY BY THAT NETWORK?

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:45.354
WHAT DOES THAT SAY AND SPEAK

00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:45.821
TO?

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:50.025
A PRETTY GOOD QUESTION, JUAN,

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:50.493
WHAT ARE ANSWER?

00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:51.260
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:58.201
WITH IS WHERE LIVING IN A TIME

00:02:58.202 --> 00:02:58.835
WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUMP

00:02:58.836 --> 00:02:59.535
SUPPORTERS TEND TO WATCH FOX.

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:00.470
PEOPLE WHO ARE ANTAGONISTS TO

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.604
THE PRESENT TEND TO WATCH CNN

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:01.971
OR MSNBC.

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:04.107
THE AUDIENCE IS UNDIVIDED.

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:05.174
I THINK THE BASE, THE

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:05.908
DEMOCRATIC BASE WANTS NOTHING

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.744
TO DO WITH FOX BECAUSE OF THE

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:09.378
PRO-TRUMP VOICES IN THE

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.846
PRIMETIME HOUR.

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:14.217
BUT YOU KNOW, I WILL ANSWERS

00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:15.518
VERY PERSONALLY AND I THINK YOU

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.420
COULD AS WELL.I'M A DEMOCRAT

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:18.154
AND I WORK AT FOX 23 YEARS.

00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:19.522
I THINK NOBODY TELLS ME WHAT TO

00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:20.089
SAY HERE.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.492
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:26.762
THAT DEMOCRATS PENETRATE THE

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:30.166
BUBBLE IF YOU WILL ON THE

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:30.466
RIGHT.

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:31.200
AND SPEAK TRUTH AS WELL AS IT

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:31.868
CAN BE SPOKEN.

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.804
I THINK THE DEBATE TO PICK UP

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:36.005
ON JONATHAN'S POINT WOULD BE

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.609
MODERATED BY REAL JOURNALISTS.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.410
YOU'RE MY FRIEND BUT I'M NOT

00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:41.277
SAYING THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE MY

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:41.844
FRIEND.

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:42.612
I THINK YOU'RE A REAL

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:43.012
JOURNALIST.

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:44.280
I THINK MARTHA MACCALLUM, I

00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:50.553
THINK DANA PERINO, BRETT BAIER,

00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:51.788
THOSE ARE PEOPLE I THINK WILL

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:52.555
CONDUCT A FAIR DEBATE.

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:53.390
NEWT GINGRICH IS SITTING HERE

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:54.057
WITH ME.

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:54.758
WE HAVE BEEN IN A DEBATE AND

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.894
HE'S ATTACKED ME AND I HAVE

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:01.231
GONE AT NEWT GINGRICH.

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:01.965
YOU CAN DO THIS BUT KEEP IN

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.033
MIND THAT FOX IS THE

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:03.800
MOST-WATCHED CABLE CHANNEL.

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:11.141
SO WE WILL REACH A LOT OF

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:11.908
INDEPENDENCE, WHAT I CALL

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:12.742
REAGAN DEMOCRATS IN THE RUST

00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:13.043
BELT.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.144
WHY THING MIGHT RESPOND TO THE

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:15.378
DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE I THINK IT

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.979
WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.646
&gt;&gt; ONLY PICK ON THIS WITH

00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:18.214
SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH.

00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:23.186
AS A MATTER OF PRACTICAL

00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:24.054
POLITICS, DID TOM PEREZ, THE

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.322
DNC CHAIR, MAKE A SMART MOVE IF

00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:26.022
ONLY BECAUSE HE IS BOWING TO

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:32.562
THE WILL OF A LARGE AND PERHAPS

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.530
MOST VOCAL PART OF HIS BASE?

00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:38.702
QUICKLY POINT OUT, EVEN THOUGH

00:04:38.703 --> 00:04:39.636
I WORKED THERE I GOT HAMMERED

00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:40.771
BY BOTH OF YOU GUYS.

00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:41.171
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:42.940
CHRIS: DO WE REALLY WANT TO GO

00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.241
BACK AND HOW YOU WENT AFTER ME?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.209
&gt;&gt; I CAN ATTEST THAT YOU GUYS

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.911
WILL BE PROFESSIONAL.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.279
AND WILL GO AFTER ANY WEAKNESS

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.980
IN EITHER PARTY.

00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:52.583
BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE IS,

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.517
IT IS THE NUMBER ONE CABLE NEWS

00:04:53.518 --> 00:04:53.850
CHANNEL.

00:04:53.851 --> 00:05:01.792
THE REACH IS BIGGER THAN THE

00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:02.125
OTHERS.

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:02.726
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:03.961
COMPETITIVE, LET'S TAKE SOME

00:05:03.962 --> 00:05:04.528
EXAMPLES.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:05.462
WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, OHIO,

00:05:05.463 --> 00:05:06.330
PENNSYLVANIA, AND YOU DON'T

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:07.197
WANT TO BE ON FOX, YOU CAN ONLY

00:05:07.198 --> 00:05:07.931
GO SO FAR WITH THE BLUE STATES

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.734
ON THE COAST ON MSNBC I THINK

00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:12.035
IS A MAJOR MISTAKE TO SAY THAT

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:15.606
WE ARE GOING TO SHRINK AS A

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.507
PARTY BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID TO

00:05:16.508 --> 00:05:17.708
BE ON FOX.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:24.148
CHRIS: I'M GOING TO SWITCH.

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:26.584
I WANT TO TURN TO THE

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:29.019
CONTROVERSY OF CONGRESSWOMAN

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.788
OMAR.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.123
HER STATEMENTS ABOUT WHY PEOPLE

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:39.430
IN THIS COUNTRY -- THIS

00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:40.598
CONSUMED A LOT OF OXYGEN ON

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:41.198
CAPITOL HILL THIS WEEK.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:41.665
TAKE A LOOK.

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:46.570
&gt;&gt; I FEEL CONFIDENT HER WORDS

00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:47.204
NOT BASED ON ANTI-SEMITIC

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:47.905
ATTITUDE BUT THAT SHE DIDN'T

00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:50.674
HAVE A FULL APPRECIATION OF HOW

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.476
THEY LANDED ON OTHER PEOPLE

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.578
WHERE THESE WORDS HAVE A

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:54.912
HISTORY.

00:05:54.913 --> 00:05:56.747
&gt;&gt; SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IS NOT

00:05:56.748 --> 00:05:58.816
ABOUT THE BENJAMIN.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.285
IT'S ABOUT THE HEARTS AND MINDS

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:02.620
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:10.628
CHRIS: I ASKED CONGRESSWOMAN

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:11.896
HILL ABOUT THE SPIRIT HOW

00:06:11.897 --> 00:06:12.730
DISRUPTIVE DO YOU THINK THIS

00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:13.931
FIGHT WITH OMAR, WITH RASHIDA

00:06:13.932 --> 00:06:18.903
TLAIB, OCASIO-CORTEZ, HOW

00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:19.704
DISRUPTIVE IS THIS FRUIT HAS

00:06:19.705 --> 00:06:20.171
DEMOCRATS?

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:21.139
&gt;&gt; MAJOR DESTRUCTION FOR THEM.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.110
CERTAINLY, WE HAD A LOT OF NOT

00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:27.345
JUST NANCY PELOSI BUT

00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:28.079
CANDIDATES WERE ASKED ABOUT

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.047
THIS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

00:06:29.048 --> 00:06:29.814
THESE ARE NOT QUESTIONS THEY

00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:30.648
WANT TO BE ANSWERING AT THIS

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.948
POINT.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:31.649
DEMOCRATS WANTED TO FOCUS ON

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.687
THE BIG CAMPAIGN FINANCING THEY

00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:36.354
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO DO

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:36.654
THAT.

00:06:36.655 --> 00:06:37.388
IT SUCKED ALL THE OXYGEN OUT OF

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:38.189
THE ROOM BUT I THINK AT THE END

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.090
OF THE DAY, WHEN THE RESOLUTION

00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:49.834
PASSED, IT CONDEMNED ALL HATE.

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:50.702
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE

00:06:50.703 --> 00:06:51.469
BECAUSE IT ALLOWED

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.870
CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR TO CLAIM

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:53.204
VICTORY.

00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:54.138
SHE WENT OUT ON TWITTER AND

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:54.739
SAID IT'S A GREAT DAY,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.340
ISLAMOPHOBIA HAS BEEN

00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:55.707
CONDEMNED.

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:56.641
THIS IS A GREAT STEP, GREAT

00:06:56.642 --> 00:06:57.141
PROGRESS.

00:06:57.142 --> 00:06:58.109
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.843
RESOLUTION SEEMS TO BACKFIRE A

00:06:58.844 --> 00:06:59.744
LITTLE BECAUSE WHAT THEY WANTED

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:00.545
TO CONDEMN WAS ULTIMATELY

00:07:00.546 --> 00:07:01.346
CELEBRATED BY THE PERSON WHO

00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:02.380
MADE THE COMMENTS.

00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:03.381
CHRIS: SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH,

00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:04.749
YOU EARNED THIS JOB AS SPEAKER.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.953
DID YOU HAVE TIMES, TRYING TO

00:07:07.954 --> 00:07:09.387
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKER,

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:16.995
WHERE YOU HAD MEMBERS GO OFF ON

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:18.130
THEIR OWN AND DISRUPT?

00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:18.630
&gt;&gt; OCCASIONALLY.

00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:19.831
CHRIS: HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH

00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:20.599
IT?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.567
&gt;&gt; NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY.

00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:24.970
ELECTED MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO

00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:25.570
THE MEDIA, THEY CAN BE

00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:26.571
IMPORTANT IN THEIR OWN WAY.

00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:27.939
WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT ERA.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.442
BUT I WILL SAY, WHAT HAPPENED

00:07:30.443 --> 00:07:31.109
THIS WEEK NOT ON THIS BUT A

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.848
RANGE OF ISSUES, YOU HAVE THE

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:37.616
THREE TOP DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE ARE

00:07:37.617 --> 00:07:38.316
GRANDPARENTS.THESE FOLKS ARE

00:07:38.317 --> 00:07:39.418
ALL ALMOST 80 YEARS OLD.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.219
NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.455
TWINS COMING LOOKING AROUND

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:44.389
SAYING YOU ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.956
FAILED.

00:07:44.957 --> 00:07:46.124
I THINK NANCY PELOSI WILL HAVE

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:46.858
A VERY HARD TIME GETTING MORAL

00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:49.529
