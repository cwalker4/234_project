00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.230
GUEST: The story is that Pancho Villa killed
a man in Mexico City and took the watch off

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.910
of him.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:16.690
Then... he ended up in Alpine, Texas, where
he traded this watch to Mr. Kasner for a brand-new

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.300
Buick automobile.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.020
Mr. Kasner sold it to a Dr. Middlebrook from
Del Rio, Texas.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.090
My father told the doctor, "If you ever want
to sell that watch, please give me first chance

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.150
at it."

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.530
Dr. Middlebrook died several years later,
and his widow called my father, and my father

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.530
bought the watch.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
And he never would tell anybody what he paid
for it.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.079
(chuckles) Now, I-I cannot, uh, I cannot prove
any of this, and believe me, I've tried.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
GUEST: I understand.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.539
APPRAISER: Well, let's take a look at the
watch

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.539
GUEST: All right.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.499
APPRAISER: and talk a little bit about what
could be true about the story.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:57.039
Um, if you examine the watch, on the dial,
it does have the name of a jewelry store in

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.039
Mexico City.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.039
La Esmeralda.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.530
It is from the era that it could actually
be-- the story could be true.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.530
GUEST: Right, right.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.970
APPRAISER: The watch is from before the turn
of the century.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.470
La Esmeralda is closed up.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.070
I had a friend in Mexico City check that out.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.070
The initials of the original owner are mounted
on the case, which is 18-karat gold, in rose

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.530
diamonds.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.020
And then there's a watch fob charm in 18-karat
gold that matches that opens as a locket.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990
There are no pictures left in it, which is
too bad.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.990
GUEST: No.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.750
APPRAISER: Pancho Villa probably took them
out.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.611
There are diamonds all the way down the chain,
which is in two colors of gold.

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:41.210
The case work is French or Swiss, and the
watch movement is a Swiss chronograph, which

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.590
means it has four separate dials on the front.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.450
It does moon phase, it counts off the days
of the month, it has a stopwatch function

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.000
that works by pushing this here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.409
The lever here is to make it chime, which
is sometimes called blind man's function.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.280
People who couldn't see could tell the time
by pushing this lever and counting the chimes.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.120
GUEST: Oh, how interesting.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.960
APPRAISER: Um, let me...

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.750
It is a separate little spring that makes
it ding. (quiet chiming) Faintly, faintly

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.750
hear it.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.750
GUEST: I love to hear that.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.730
APPRAISER: It's considered a very, very complicated
watch, because each dial has to have a separate

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.090
part of the watch movement.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.170
Uh, it's enhanced by the fact that the materials
in it are very, very high quality and that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.660
the chain and-and fob match the watch and
are original to it.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.483
Uh, would you have a guess as to how much
this watch might be worth in today's market?

00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:35.483
GUEST: No idea.

00:02:35.483 --> 00:02:37.370
That's-that's, uh, that's what I'm doing here.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.490
APPRAISER: Uh, somewhere between $30,000 and
$50,000.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.490
It's magnificent.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.670
GUEST: Would it be worth more if I could prove
the story?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.730
APPRAISER: Definitely, definitely.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.500
GUEST: That's what I thought.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500
I've tried.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.820
APPRAISER: But it is possible from the serial
number of the watch to find out for whom it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.000
was originally ordered and then trace the
story back that way.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.780
GUEST: Well, that'll be a nice job for you,
Fred.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.780
APPRAISER: Take some time.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
GUEST: (chuckles): Yeah.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.350
APPRAISER: Thank you very much for coming
to show it to us.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.350
It's a fabulous watch.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.350
GUEST: Thank you.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.350
Thank you, everybody.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.350
Thank you, everybody.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.610
It was fun.
