MEANWHILE, I DON'T KNOW-- I
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
STILL RECOVERING FROM THE
ELECTION

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:08.574 align:start position:0%
OF 2016.

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:15.381 align:start position:0%
BUT THERE WAS ALSO--
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.284 align:start position:0%
BUT THERE WAS ALSO AN ELECTION
LAST NIGHT.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:21.020 align:start position:0%
DEMOCRATS TOOK CONTROL OF THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.323 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT-- 27, 37?

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:24.657 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.331 align:start position:0%
MILD WAVE.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:36.002 align:start position:0%
BUT IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE
"USA TODAY," TRUMP SAID THIS WAS

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.337 align:start position:0%
GREAT FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND SO
DID TRUMP.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.810
&gt;&gt; WE SAW THE CANDIDATES THAT I
SUPPORTED ACHIEVE TREMENDOUS

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.411 align:start position:0%
SUCCESS LAST NIGHT.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:49.182 align:start position:0%
MIA LOVE GAVE ME NO LOVE, AND
SHE LOST.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.251 align:start position:0%
BARBARA COMSTOCK WAS ANOTHER
ONE.

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.787
I MEAN, I THINK SHE COULD HAVE
WON THAT RACE, BUT SHE DIDN'T

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.156 size:78% position:39%
WANT TO HAVE ANY EMBRACE.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.158 align:start position:0%
PETER ROSKAM DIDN'T WANT THE
EMBRACE.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.794 align:start position:0%
ERIC PAULSEN DIDN'T WANT THE
EMBRACE.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:05.498 size:88% position:44%
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE
THAT, YOU KNOW, DECIDED FOR

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:09.035
THEIR OWN REASON NOT TO EMBRACE.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:13.106 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M-- I GOTTA SAY,
I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.942
STOPPED HIM BECAUSE HE IS NOT
KNOWN FOR ASKING PERMISSION

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:16.976 align:start position:0%
BEFORE HE EMBRACES.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.516 align:start position:0%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
I MEAN, JUST LOOK WHAT HE DID TO

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.584 align:start position:0%
THAT POOR FLAG.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.687 align:start position:0%
I MEAN...

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.658 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
NOW, LIKELY NEW SPEAKER PELOSI

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.662
HAS PROMISED TO WORK WITH THE
PRESIDENT, AND HE THINKS THAT'S

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.731 align:start position:0%
A GREAT IDEA.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.333 align:start position:0%
BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT COULD
MAKE THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.601
&gt;&gt; IF THEY START INVESTIGATING
YOU, CAN YOU COMPARTMENTALIZE

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.637
THAT AND STILL CONTINUE TO WORK
WITH THEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.673 align:start position:0%
REST OF THE COUNTRY, OR ARE ALL
BETS OFF?

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.243
&gt;&gt; NO, IF THEY DO THAT, THEN
IT'S JUST-- ALL OF IT IS-- IS A

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:54.413 align:start position:0%
WAR-LIKE POSTURE.

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.715
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND, OF COURSE, WE
KNOW TRUMP'S WAR-LIKE POSTURE:

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.584 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"LOOK, NANCY... OW, BONE SPURS!

00:01:58.617 --> 00:01:59.986 align:start position:0%
BONE SPURS!

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.187 align:start position:0%
BONE SPURS.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.924 align:start position:0%
I GOT-- OW, OW, OW!

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:06.158 align:start position:0%
OH!

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.962
I HAVE TO-- I'M SORRY, I LEFT--
I HAVE-- I'M HAVING A VIETNAM

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:10.896 align:start position:0%
FLASHBACK.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.034 align:start position:0%
I GOTTA STAY HOME AND HAVE SEX
WITH MODELS."

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:18.504 align:start position:0%
THEN I HAVE JEFF SESSIONS ON MY
SHOE NOW.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.774 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
THAT'S-- THAT'S-- THIS IS WHAT--

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.410 size:84% position:42%
THIS IS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY IS DOING WITH JEFF

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.278 align:start position:0%
SESSIONS RIGHT NOW.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE JUST... JUST SCRAPING
HIM OFF.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:28.514 align:start position:0%
JUST-- THERE YOU GO.

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:30.016 align:start position:0%
THERE YOU GO.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.488 align:start position:0%
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.658 align:start position:0%
THEN THE QUESTIONS GOT A LITTLE
MORE SPECIFIC.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.561 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; POINT BLANK, DEMOCRATS GO
AFTER YOUR TAX RETURNS.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.731 align:start position:0%
WILL YOU TRY TO BLOCK THAT, OR
WILL YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:46.965 align:start position:0%
THEM?

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.469
&gt;&gt; LOOK, AS I'VE TOLD YOU, THEY
ARE UNDER AUDIT AND HAVE BEEN

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.103 align:start position:0%
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:51.804 size:84% position:42%
THEY ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:52.604
PEOPLE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THEM.

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:53.872 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND TAX
RETURNS.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.842
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX INSTRUMENT,
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:58.044 align:start position:0%
UNDERSTAND IT.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:06.152 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"OR AT LEAST, I HOPE THEY

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:06.786 align:start position:0%
WOULDN'T.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.820 size:88% position:44%
OTHERWISE, I AM SO SCREWED."

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:12.391 align:start position:0%
HERE'S THE THING-- THEY ARE,
THEY ARE.

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:14.727 align:start position:0%
AND TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS ARE
COMPLICATED.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.365 align:start position:0%
WE'VE OBTAINED ONE PAGE, AND YOU
CAN SEE THE COMPLEXITY.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:22.568 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
TRUMP-- I CAN'T FIG THAT YOU ARE

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.135 align:start position:0%
OUT.

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:24.637 size:75% position:38%
I CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.905 align:start position:0%
WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:31.110 align:start position:0%
TRUMP SEEMED A BIT SUBDUED,
THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING'S PRESS

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:35.414
CONFERENCE, UNTIL HE SAW ONE OF
HIS FAVORITE CHEW TOYS, CNN'S

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.950 align:start position:0%
JIM ACOSTA.

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.184 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THAT YOU
DEMONIZED IMMIGRANTS?

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.286
&gt;&gt; I WANT THEM TO COME INTO THE
COUNTRY, BUT THEY HAVE TO COME

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.187 align:start position:0%
IN LEGALLY.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.422 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE HUNDREDS OF MILES
AWAY, THOUGH.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.790 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
MILES AWAY.

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
THAT'S NOT AN INVASION.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:48.861
&gt;&gt; HONESTLY, I THINK YOU SHOULD
LET ME RUN THE COUNTRY, AND YOU

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:50.196 align:start position:0%
RUN CNN, AND IF YOU DID IT WELL,
YOUR RATINGS WOULD BE BETTER.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.364 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IF I MAY ASK ONE OTHER
QUESTION--

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.698 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:56.002 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MR. QUESTION, IF I MAY ASK
ONE OTHER QUESTION--

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.136 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.972 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I WAS GOING TO
ASK-- PARDON ME, MA'AM.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.276 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.213 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT?

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.848 align:start position:0%
WHAT A DICK.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:13.753 align:start position:0%
DID YOU SEE THAT WOMAN TRY TO
GRAB JIM ACOSTA'S MIC?

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:18.557 align:start position:0%
SHE TRIED TO SNATCH IT RIGHT OUT
OF HIS HAND.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.825 size:88% position:44%
SHE LOOKED LIKE THE WEDDING
DEEJAY WHO JUST REALIZED THE

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:21.994 align:start position:0%

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:24.764 align:start position:0%

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:34.307 size:88% position:44%

TRUMP GOT MORE HOSTILE WHEN

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.414 align:start position:0%
ASKED ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN
RHETORIC.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.283 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THRSH SOME PEOPLE THAT SAY
NOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS SEEN

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:46.652 align:start position:0%
AS SUPPORTING WHITE NATIONALISTS
BECAUSE OF YOUR RHETORIC.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:47.586 size:75% position:38%

WHY DO I HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.364
THAT'S SUCH A RACIST QUESTION.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:03.102 align:start position:0%
LET ME TELL YOU-- THAT'S A
RACIST QUESTION.

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:06.238 align:start position:0%
