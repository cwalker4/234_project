Welcome to the Electricity
of Life, brought to you

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.090
by The Thunderbolts Projectâ„¢

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.790
What is the role of electromagnetic
fields in health and healing?

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.490
Today, various electromagnetic therapies have
gained unprecedented acceptance and use, and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.090
scientific studies continue to affirm the
influence of electromagnetic fields on life.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.950
In Western medicine, the tradition
is for various specialists

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.090
to treat supposedly
disconnected parts and organs.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.640
But the leading proponents of
electromagnetic healing propose

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.090
a new way of seeing the human
body and all living organisms.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.610
One of the leading pioneers in this rapidly growing field
has been Dr. Jerry Tennant, an ophthalmologist whose book

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.090
series 'Healing is Voltage' describes his groundbreaking
research into the electrical circuitry of the human body.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.280
Today, in part 1 of this two-part
presentation, Dr. Tennant begins by sharing

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.890
his own remarkable challenges which
catalyzed his scientific journey.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330
I always begin my discussions
with the disclaimer

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.590
that I'm not speaking
with my Texas MD license.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
I'm speaking with my Arizona MDH license.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.120
Arizona and Nevada have special
medical boards for Integrative

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.150
Medicine and homeopathic medicine
and I'm licensed under that Arizona

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.130
Board of Integrative and Homeopathic
medicine and that's the license

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.590
that I have this conversation
under and not my Texas license.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.150
Well, I'm trained as an
ophthalmologist and did traditional

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.190
ophthalmology with a focus on
cataract surgery for 30 years or so.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.750
I had a lot of fun being an
ophthalmologist, I was able to do a lot

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.190
of things that changed the way off
the ophtalmology is practiced.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.860
I had a great deal to do
with bringing intraocular

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.190
lenses into this country,
and the use of them.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.380
When I was trained, we would
simply take the lens out of the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.590
eye and people would end up
wearing really big thick glasses.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.440
Of course, those allowed you to see but they
were fairly disabling because everything

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.090
looked 30% too big and 30% too close and
it was hard to walk or drive or whatever.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.500
So I was one of the early people
that put lenses in eyes after

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.260
cataract surgery and then there were
some problems with the European

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.790
lenses that we used in the beginning,
so I modified those and got

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.590
lenses to work better and then began
to teach others how to do that.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.090
So that was one of the fun things I did.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.410
When I was trained, we kept patients in the hospital for
two weeks with both eyes blinded, and of course the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.090
elderly tend to become disoriented and even psychotic if
you keep them in bed and blind them for a couple of weeks.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.280
So I developed a way to make a watertight incision so
that they didn't have to stay in bed and we could

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.490
actually get them up and walk them immediately from the
surgery table and that changed a lot of things as well.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.890
And also we had a problem with people,
the elderly going into the hospitals.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.760
You know, elderly people have a tendency to get a
particular pattern of living, they eat certain

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.090
things that agree with them and that keep their
digestive and urinary processes working.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.560
There are foods that upset
them and so you put

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.690
them in a hospital and
change all of that.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.710
They commonly get sick just
from being outside their

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.690
normal environment and often
fall and hurt themselves.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.990
One of the things we began then to
work on was outpatient surgery.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.450
So being able to operate
on cataract and then have

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.590
people go immediately
home was a great benefit.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.180
And we helped, along with my
anesthesiologist and internists

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.790
developed the techniques for
that and taught how to do that.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.240
And I guess, the next thing I did in
ophthalmology that was kind of fun is, I

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.590
did the majority of the research for the
laser that's used in LASIK surgery.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.890
So I did about 90% of that research
for the company called VISX.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.030
But during that process of
doing the laser surgery,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.190
we didn't know that the laser
wouldn't kill viruses.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.950
And so I was using the laser
to carve the scar off of

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.590
the cornea of a fellow from
India that had leukemia.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.990
And it carved the scar off well enough but
it also released viruses from his cornea.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.090
And that went into my nose and into
my brain and I got encephalitis.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.380
And so I got to where I could see
a patient, know what was wrong

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.490
with him but I couldn't remember
how to write a prescription.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.380
I also developed spastic
movements, so I'd be sitting

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.290
there and all of a sudden
I'd do something like that.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.990
Which doesn't work really well if you're
operating inside somebody's eyeball.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.490
And I had overwhelming fatigue.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.290
And so for all those reasons, I
had to quit work at the end of

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.220
November of 1995 and so I slept
16 hours a day, had two or three

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.220
hours a day in which I could
understand a newspaper and then like

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.090
a light switch, it'd go off and I
couldn't understand it anymore.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.580
I went to the best doctors I could find in
Boston and New York etc, etc and they all said

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.090
well, you have three viruses in your brain,
we don't know what to do about it, good luck!

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.070
So during that two or three hours a
day I could think I had to figure

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.630
out how to get myself well and
so I began the journey of trying

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.700
to figure out how I might do that and
one of the things that resonated

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.190
with me was that every cell in
the body had the same hardware.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.330
Even though cells look quite different,
just like a laptop looks different

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.990
than a desktop computer, they still
have all the same basic parts.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.100
And I thought well, if I
can figure out how to

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.090
make one cell work I can
make them all work.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.300
And so I started down that road and I
bought a bunch of cellular biology

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.980
books which I hadn't read in 30
years and began to read through

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.010
them and one of the things that
resonated with me it said that cells

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.190
have to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.590
Well, I didn't really remember much about
pH except it was acid-base balance, but

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.790
as an eye surgeon I didn't really need
to know much about that for 30 years.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.200
And so, I began to study
pH and discovered that pH

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.490
is simply the measurement
of voltage in a liquid.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.410
If you think about a copper wire used to turn the
switch on and electrons flow; you turn the switch

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:41.290
off and they stop, but in a liquid it can either
be an electron donor or an electron stealer.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.950
And by convention, if a
liquid is an electron

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.190
stealer, you put a plus sign
in front of the voltage.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.190
And if it's electron donor, you put a
minus sign in front of the voltage.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.450
By convention also, you take
the voltage and you convert

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.390
it to a logarithmic scale from
zero to 14 and call it pH.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:08.140
So plus 400 millivolts of electrons
stealer is the same as a pH of 0

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.990
and minus 400 millivolts of electron
donor is the same as a pH of 14.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.810
When you read then that cells have
to run at a pH of 7.35 to 7.45,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.590
that's a synonym of -22 to -25 millivolts
give or take a millivolt.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.190
So I said oh, cells have to have
voltage to work, that makes sense.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:36.990
And so all of a sudden, this new way of
thinking about things was obvious to me.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.290
The next issue was how do you measure it.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:48.210
Well of course, if you take a standard pH
meter, it has a switch on it, you can switch

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.660
it from pH or millivolts, whichever one
you want to to have it read out and you

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:57.400
simply stick the probe in a liquid and it'll
tell you what the pH is or

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.990
what the millivolts is and/or convert it
to the logarithmic scale of pH for you.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.980
So I said well, how do you measure it in the body,
and I found that a chap named Nakatani was the

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:14.990
first person to use modern electronics to measure
acupuncture circuits and published it in 1951.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.350
So I got his rather rudimentary equipment,
started measuring and where my brain should be

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.090
running at -25 millivolts, I found it was
running between  -2 to -4 millivolts.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.990
So then I knew why it didn't work,
it didn't have the juice to do it.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.990
So the next issue is well, what
am I going to do about it?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:39.410
So I began to do some more reading and
found that a Russian chap had figured out

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.690
the waveform that would more efficiently
transfer electrons to cell membranes.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.880
I began to try to learn about
that and discovered that there

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.490
was a Russian pediatrician
named Zulia Valeyeva-Frost.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.990
Zulia Veleyeva married the chap from
London named Frost and moved to London.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.070
And she was in the process
of teaching people how to

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.090
use this Russian device to
transfer energy to cells.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.090
So I called her and I said hey, I'm
interested in what you're doing.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.750
And she said well, as luck
would have it, I'm teaching

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.090
my first seminar in San
Francisco in three days.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.490
I said, sign me up, I'll be there.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.770
So I went to that seminar and I got
the Russian device and began to

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.690
recharge my cells and in about six weeks
or so, things began to get better.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.690
The other thing that happened about
that time was that I was on an

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.090
airplane and there was a nurse sitting
next to me from the Dallas area.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.250
And she began to tell me that
she had lymphoma, had this big

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.090
tumor around her neck and
scattered throughout her body.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.550
And that she'd gone to Mexico and
in a matter of days the tumors

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.090
were gone, even though MD Anderson
had told her to go home and die.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:03.360
So I went down to visit with the docs that helped her
to see how in the world they did that and that was sort

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:10.790
of the beginning of my journey along with this other
business of the electronics to figure out how to get well.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.390
And one of the things they taught me
was that essentially all tumors are

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.890
associated with infection in your
teeth, particularly root canal teeth.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:26.310
And so she had gone down and they had
pulled her root canal tooth and cleaned

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.590
up the infection in her mouth and in a
matter of days her tumors were gone.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.710
And she sent me not only photographs but
she sent me her medical records from MD

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.790
Anderson when she came back and they
proved that her tumors had disappeared.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:52.990
So I had a root canal tooth here in what's called the
spleen stomach acupuncture circuit and so my Docs

00:10:53.020 --> 00:11:01.030
here in Dallas said there's nothing wrong with that
tooth but I had also developed a bleeding disorder

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:07.060
and so I went back down to Mexico and had the dentist,
that had operated on this nurse, work on me and

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:14.990
when she pulled that tooth, there was so much infection
in the bone, it splattered all over her mask.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.790
And yet I had no symptoms as far
as the tooth was concerned.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.500
But 48 hours after she pulled
the tooth, my bleeding

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.690
disorder was cured and
that was rather amazing.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.190
And then over the next six weeks or
so, my brain started to work again.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:40.790
And so that's how I started going down this road of
figuring out how the body really works and what the

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:46.490
role of voltage is in the body, because it's obviously
so different than what I was taught in medical school.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:52.990
One of the things that I was led
to try to understand was acupuncture.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:58.910
Actually, that was part of a bigger picture in
that I was sitting in my chair at home and I

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:04.990
said to myself well, obviously traditional medicine
that I was taught, told me go home and die.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.990
And so that obviously
wasn't working so well.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:14.430
But sometimes chiropractic works, sometimes
it doesn't. Sometimes acupuncture works,

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.590
sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes essential
oils work, sometimes they don't, etc etc.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.630
So there are all these
various medical models

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.290
that sometimes work
and sometimes don't.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.280
So my thinking was, if I could
figure out, there has to

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.290
be a common denominator that
goes through all of these.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.790
Otherwise, because I mean if things work,
there's, it's because it's following

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.790
some basic laws, some basic rules
of how things are supposed to work.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.350
If I could figure out what that common
denominator was running through

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.990
all of these different , then
I knew how to get myself well.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.890
And it began to become apparent
to me that the voltage

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.990
piece was the common denominator
for all of these things.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:05.030
Now, obviously it becomes very complicated when you start,
particularly someone like me who has no background

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:12.790
in electronics or even in physics, I had, you know,
freshman college physics and that was my background.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.530
The issue is how do you figure
out what the common denominator

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:22.340
here is and I began to go down a
different road in that, I began

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:27.060
to understand that there's no
such thing as a bunch of little

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.990
balls of electrons spinning around
a charged ball in the center.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.880
It's been known for probably
75 years or so that that's

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.790
really not what an atom is but
we still teach that.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:45.710
And so I began to read and talk to, I
fortunately was able to talk to some various

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.060
people who had gone down that road
before me and began to understand more

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.820
about what an atom is because if you
don't understand what energy is, what an

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:02.490
atom is, even how the universe works,
you can't understand how a cell works.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.640
And so I began to consider that
there were alternatives. So one

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:12.720
of the things that was a great
influence on me was the work of

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.010
Schauberger, the Swiss water
specialist who had figured out

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.890
how to make a flying saucer
that was fueled by water.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.340
And he was captured by Hitler as
you probably know and made to

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.890
make as, you know, work in there
that in industry for the Germans.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:39.170
He understood very well that
there are things that spin right and

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.450
concentrate into a point, concentrate
the energy into a point which of

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.560
course we call implosion and there's
something that spins left that

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.890
starts small and gets bigger and then
disappears we call an explosion.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.190
And that those are the two
basic kinds of energy.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.540
Schauberger's work with water
and energy was very influential

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.490
on my road down trying to
figure out how the body works.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.730
The other thing that was very
powerful was to read the

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.990
work that cells, I mean that
muscles are piezoelectric.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:19.390
And so I began to consider and
in a and I was initially wrong.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.770
I thought our muscles were wired up the way 12 volt
battery is, you know, you take the cover off of a

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.090
12 volt battery and there are a bunch of one-and-a-half
volt batteries all wired together in there.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.300
And I thought, that's the way our body
was wired up, that we had our muscles

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.090
were just one big battery that
provided power for the cells to work.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:41.440
But then I began to notice that there
were patients that had normal total body

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.890
voltage, as I measured it, but there would
be one circuit out or one organ out.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.490
And I said well, then I have to be
wrong about how we're wired up.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:56.020
And I began to consider that acupuncture
meridians were stacks of muscle

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:01.190
batteries wired together into one
single column that provided power.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:06.410
And I was talking with one of
my colleagues, Dr. Evans, about

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.890
this and he said well, have you read
Tom Myers's book Anatomy Trains?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.290
And I said no, I never heard of it,
and he said well you should read it.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.520
So I get Myers's book
and Myers is a massage

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.190
therapist who had
access to cadavers.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.210
And he would use blunt dissection and started
dissecting the fascia and discovered that it

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.130
would go all the way from the toe to the head
or all the way from your hands to the head

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:35.200
and surrounds muscle, a battery stacked one on
top of each other which is exactly what I had

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.090
come to the conclusion we had to have in the
body, but he'd already done the dissection.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.090
So I started with Myers's work.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.200
Now, unfortunately he stopped at
the neck and a lot of the stuff I

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.190
was interested in like the eye
was obviously above the neck.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:58.760
So, but I started with his work and I got anatomy apps
which fortunately allowed me to look at if on an

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:08.090
acupuncture 2D drawing, there's a line that goes from
here to here, what muscle goes from here to here?

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.090
And I could go to the app
and figure that out.

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:15.010
So what I was able to do was to
develop a road map, an atlas

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.850
of the muscle battery packs and
come to the conclusion that

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.700
acupuncture meridians are simply
stacks of muscle batteries

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.790
surrounded by a common sheath, or
as common stocking, of fascia.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:36.990
And the other thing that had been reported
is that fascia are simply semiconductors.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.750
So of course, you know better than I,
a semiconductor is a collection of

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.990
molecules that moves electrons at the
speed of light but only in one direction.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.150
So that made a lot of sense so then
the fascia that we have surrounding

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.990
our stacks of muscle batteries is
simply the body's wiring system.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.990
So now we have a battery system,
we have a wiring system.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:03.870
And that helped me begin to
understand why things that

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.690
didn't seem to make sense
actually made perfect sense.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.570
So for example when I was
sick, I felt like somebody

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.990
was sticking an ice pick
in my left big toe.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.990
My spleen was swollen and hurt,
my stomach hurt all the time.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:26.590
I lost the vision in my left eye, the
macula of my left eye and I couldn't think.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:32.380
Well, in any other form of Medicine you'd
never put all those things together, but it

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:38.190
turns out that that everything I just described
has the same power supply.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:43.810
Duh, all of a sudden things make
perfect sense and that same

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.990
circuit goes through, guess
what, this root canal tooth.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.700
So it became apparent that
dead teeth in a circuit act

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.290
like a circuit breaker and
just shut the circuit off.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.890
Root canal should never be done.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.070
The dentists are the only
physicians that think you

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.190
can get away with leaving
dead tissue in the body.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.890
No other doctor believes that.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.560
And that's what you do with a root canal,
you drill a hole on the tooth, you reach in

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.290
with an auger, turn it, rip out the
artery, rip out the nerve and kill the tooth.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.690
Then you stuff it full of putty and assume
that it's going to stay sterile.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.490
Well, that's nonsense.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:23.940
It's still attached to the blood supply and lymphatics
at the roots, so there's certainly a

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:30.290
way for bacteria to get in there and a root canal
tooth is no different than having your big toe die.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.390
If you leave it there, you die
of gangrene. Your appendix dies.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.990
You leave it there, you die of peritonitis.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.490
A root canal will kill you just
as certainly, it just takes longer.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:49.180
So the fellow that popularized root canal
procedure was a dentist named George Meinig

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.890
and I think he spent the last years of his life
trying to get dentists to quit doing them.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.470
He wrote this book called 'The Root
Canal Cover-Up' and even before Meinig

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.750
came along and wrote his book, Weston
Price would take in, pull teeth

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.400
from somebody who was sick, embed it
under the skin of a rabbit and within

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.990
the week the rabbit had the same illness
as a person who owned the tooth.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.990
And he did that hundreds of times.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:22.590
And so, the concept that dental infections
cause systemic disease has been known a

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.490
very long time but the dentists have done a
good job of trying to keep that covered up.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:32.370
There's actually a popular Netflix
movie that's running right now

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.800
called 'The Root Cause' and this
fellow catalogs his journey

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:43.210
of being an athlete and then
being disabled after he gets a

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.690
root canal and then doing all
this stuff trying to get well.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.360
None of it works until he goes and
gets rid of the root canal and

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.090
then he's back healthy again which
is exactly what happened to me.
