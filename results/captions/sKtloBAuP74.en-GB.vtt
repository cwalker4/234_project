00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.870
Could mathematics

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.020
ever be described

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.240
as beautiful?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.880
If you are a religious person

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.199
then perhaps the answer might be yes

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.920
because mathematics is the language

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.230
that allows us to describe, with utter precision,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.640
the intricate way in which God created his
universe.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.000
If you are a scientist,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.950
then perhaps you might think so too

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.600
because there are those formulae that link,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.840
most beautifully, two areas of knowledge

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.340
that may have seemed hitherto unrelated.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.100
The famous American physicist

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.340
Richard Feynman

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.140
seemed to think so about one formula in particular

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.680
which he called “our jewel”

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.120
and “the most remarkable formula in mathematics”.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.200
He was referring

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.270
to Euler’s identity

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.150
first expressed in 1748

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.370
by Leonhard Euler.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.239
Leonhard Euler

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.799
was born on the 15th of April 1707,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.000
in Basel, Switzerland.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.240
His father, Paul

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.850
was a Church minister

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.630
so religion was an important part

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600
of his formative years.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
His father was friendly

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.689
with the Bernoulli family

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.990
and it was Johann Bernoulli,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.479
one of the foremost mathematicians of his
time

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.479
who convinced Paul

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.299
that his son may have a greater future

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.360
in the field of mathematics.

00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:29.742
The Bernoulli family,

00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:32.670
a dynasty of famous mathematicians,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.499
has had a huge effect on the way we live our
lives today

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.450
as it was one of their number,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.450
Daniel,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.920
who would go on to describe what is now known

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.231
as the Bernoulli Effect,

00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:45.869
the principle that enables aircraft to fly.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.750
It was Daniel Bernoulli

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.729
who, in 1727,

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.549
secured Euler a post at the Imperial Russian
Academy of Sciences

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.939
in Saint Petersburg.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.639
Euler would eventually replace Bernoulli

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.759
as the head of the mathematics department,

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.259
but concerned about the continuing turmoil
in Russia,

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.819
Euler left St. Petersburg in 1741

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.090
to take up a post at the Berlin Academy.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.099
It was while Euler was in Berlin

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.099
that he published his

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.950
“Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite”

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890
in which he expressed what is now known

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.480
as Euler’s formula,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.580
a special case of which

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.060
led to Euler’s identity.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.060
Strangely enough,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.340
the special number “e”,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.200
known as Euler’s number

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.470
and used in Euler’s formula

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.300
was not actually discovered by Euler himself.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.560
It was discovered, instead

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.490
by another of the Bernoulli clan,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.760
Jacob Bernoulli

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390
who came across it whilst working on the principle

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.250
of compound interest.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.910
Jacob Bernoulli found

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.930
that if he deposited $1

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.440
at the beginning of the year

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.780
and awarded himself a total of 100% interest

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.920
over that year,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.080
no matter how many times he divided the interest
payments

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.460
throughout the year,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.400
he couldn’t get past a grand total of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.380
$2.72 by the end of the year.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.480
The exact number is actually:

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:19.980
2.718281828459045235360287471352662497757…

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.520
It was Euler who named this number “e”

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.890
after his own name

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.830
and that has been that symbol that has stuck.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.040
But how is “e” actually calculated?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.920
The humble calculator knows only 4 mathematical
operations:

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.580
addition,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.640
subtraction,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.700
multiplication

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.700
and division.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.900
The number “e”

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.460
can actually be calculated

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.420
by an infinite series

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.480
of additions,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.780
multiplications

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.780
and divisions

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.380
like this:

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.920
We start with 1.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920
To this

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920
we add

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.890
1 divided by 1 factorial.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.590
This gives us 2.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.360
We then add 1

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.300
divided by 1 x 2,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.700
otherwise known as 2 factorial.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.840
This gives us 2.5.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.970
We then add 1

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.220
divided by 1 x 2 x 3,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.730
or 3 factorial.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.150
This gives us 2. 666

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.800
We then add 1

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.020
divided by 4 factorial.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.600
This gives us 2.708

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.389
We then add 1

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.560
divided by 5 factorial.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.690
This gives us 2.716

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.310
As we add more and more terms

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.710
into the equation,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.740
we get closer and closer the precise value

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.470
of Euler’s number.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.349
The beautiful thing about this equation is

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.979
that it is very easy to predict what the next
term will be

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.610
as each time, the denominator factorial

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.250
is increasing by one.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.260
Now

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.940
e, as we have written it here,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.849
is like writing e to the power of 1.

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.870
If we wanted to make this more general

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.830
and raise e to the power of x,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.599
then the infinite series changes to:

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.809
1

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:21.240
plus x over 1 factorial

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.990
plus x-squared over 2 factorial

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.960
plus x-cubed over 3 factorial

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.279
plus x to the 4 over 4 factorial

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.499
and so on.

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:35.900
Now it just so happens

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.449
that e to the x

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.259
is not the only thing

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.199
that can be calculated by such an infinite
series.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.529
The trigonometric functions

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.159
Sine and Cosine

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.259
can also be calculated by infinite series.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.029
Sine of X is equal to:

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.020
X divided by 1 factorial

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.370
Minus x-cubed over 3 factorial

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.039
Plus x-to the 5 over 5 factorial

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.719
Minus x-to the 7 over 7 factorial

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:08.770
and so on.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.439
Again it is easy to predict the continuation
of this series

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.520
as each time the denominator is increasing
by 2

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.680
as is the power to which we are raising x.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.000
The sign of each term keeps alternating

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.300
between a plus and a minus.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.319
Something similar happens with the Cosine
of x too.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.900
1

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.300
Minus x-squared over 2 factorial

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.849
Plus x-to the 4 over 4 factorial

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.150
Minus x-to the 6 over 6 factorial

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.240
Plus x-to the 8 over 8 factorial

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.659
and so on.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:47.800
Again,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.520
like the Sine series,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.319
the denominator and power terms

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.711
increase by 2 each time only this time,

00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:56.150
only this time instead of starting from 1,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.300
they begin from 2.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.469
The infinite series for Cosine, Sine and e

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:04.680
look so similar to each other,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.479
that you might be forgiven for thinking

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.659
that there is a relationship between them.

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.770
If we were to add the Cosine and Sine series
together,

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.490
would that give us Euler’s number?

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.619
Well, unfortunately not.

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.060
There's a little problem.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.469
The problem is that the signs

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.089
between the terms in the Sine and Cosine series
keep changing

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:28.889
whereas in the series which calculates Euler’s
number,

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.030
they don’t.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.260
If only there was some way we could sort out
this series,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.419
some number we could multiply the x term by

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.699
to make the two equations equal each other.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.819
In order to make the equations equal,

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.369
the something we would need to multiply x
by

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:48.610
when it was squared,

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.550
would have to equal -1.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.789
The same would be true when

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:54.089
x was cubed,

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:56.879
again when x was raised to the power of 6

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:57.979
and 7

00:07:57.979 --> 00:07:59.710
and so on.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.759
The problem is, when we square a number,

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.749
the result is ALWAYS positive,

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:07.000
not negative.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.119
What we need is a number,

00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:09.729
that when squared,

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.469
is equal to -1.

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:13.879
The problem is,

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:17.710
such a number doesn’t exist.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.759
The brilliant thing about mathematicians

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:20.759
is that

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:23.949
when they are on their way to some wonderful
mathematical discovery,

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:26.339
they don’t let a little thing like

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.289
“numbers not existing”

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:29.289
stop them.

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:32.719
After all, mathematics is the science of numbers,

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:34.039
so if a number,

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.660
rather inconveniently,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.659
doesn’t exist…

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.310
well, they just jolly well go out and invent
one.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.740
As it happens,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.010
Euler’s identity

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.710
wasn’t the only place

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.100
where it would be useful

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.630
to have a squared number equaling -1.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.370
The same problem was happening all over mathematics.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.700
And so was born

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.040
the imaginary number “i”.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.510
“i”, is the only number that,

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.970
when squared,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.070
gives a negative result,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.690
namely: -1.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.690
By now,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.810
you might have tried plugging the number -1

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.000
into your calculator

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.460
and hit the square root button.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.650
Your calculator

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.440
unless it’s a very clever one

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.700
will have gallantly refused to give you an
answer.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.820
Maybe the word “Error” is currently showing
on its readout.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.520
That’s because your calculator

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.470
is a rational piece of electronics

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.590
and cannot deal with numbers which don’t
exist.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.750
However, in the eyes of a mathematician,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.410
just because a number doesn’t exist,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.870
doesn’t mean that it cannot be useful.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.800
What happens if we take Euler’s number

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.810
and raise it,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.150
not to the power of x,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.830
but to the power i

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.800
the square root of -1

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.850
times x?

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.850
This will give us:

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.490
1

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.940
plus ix

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.740
plus ix-squared over 2 factorial

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.680
plus ix-cubed over 3 factorial

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.660
plus ix-to the 4 over 4 factorial

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.170
and so on.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.900
but we just said that i

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.020
is the square root of -1.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.510
Therefore, if we square it

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.100
we'll just get -1.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.710
Just look at that term over there:

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.300
there we have i x squared

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.960
so we could rewrite those brackets

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.090
as minus x-squared.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.090
Now i-cubed

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.090
is the same as

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.160
i-squared times i,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.090
so that term could be written as i squared

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.940
which is equal to minus 1

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.230
times i times x-cubed.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.680
i-to the power 4

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.800
is the same as writing

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.620
i-squared times i-squared,

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.460
so -1 times -1 equals 1.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.660
So that term there

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.270
is just x-to the power 4.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.530
This is beginning

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.490
to look like the series we worked out before

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.680
for cos of x plus sin of x.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.490
Now we have some terms that are real

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.050
i.e. are not multiplied by i

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.090
and some terms that are imaginary

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.420
the terms that are multiplied by i.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.160
Let’s highlight the real terms in blue

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.780
and the imaginary terms in red.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.780
Now

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.530
let’s move everything around

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.410
so that we group the real and imaginary terms
together.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.270
All the imaginary terms are multiplied by
i

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.120
so we can factor i out.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.160
Now the real terms are the terms we

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.040
use to calculate cosine of x

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.480
And the imaginary terms

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.240
are the terms we used to calculate sine of
x.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.210
It’s just we’ve multiplied them all by
“i”.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.620
So there is a relationship

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.560
between Euler’s number

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.020
and cosine and sine,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.000
it’s just we have to raise e to the power
of i x

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.950
and multiply the sine term by i

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.080
in order to make the maths work.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.540
This is Euler’s formula

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.310
which we mentioned at the beginning of the
video.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.600
I said that a special case of Euler’s formula

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.480
led to Euler’s identity

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.890
which the physicist Richard Feynman found
so beautiful.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:24.030
The special case occurs when x is equal to
pi.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.780
Cosine of pi is equal to -1

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.550
and sine of pi is equal to zero,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:34.110
so e to the i pi is equal to -1.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.820
Rearranging this slightly

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.290
gives us Euler’s identity:

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.800
e to the i pi plus 1

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800
equals zero.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.320
What is so amazing about this little identity

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.530
is that it links together,

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.530
in one simple relationship,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.640
four completely different concepts

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.280
in mathematics.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.960
Euler’s number,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.180
Pi,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.000
The Cosine and Sine functions

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.570
and the imaginary number i.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.300
And THAT,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.500
in mathematical terms, is beautiful!

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.500
Filming is currently underway

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.790
on a special online video course

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.650
which explores the Fourier Transform

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.610
and how it works.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.480
This video forms part of the module

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.010
on Complex Numbers,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.760
