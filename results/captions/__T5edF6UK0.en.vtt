00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.470
Just last year a fantastic film called Loving
Vincent was released, detailing the death

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.370
of the legendary painter Vincent van Gogh.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.090
The experimental film raised doubts as to
whether his death was actually a suicide as

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.450
widely reported.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.119
This got us thinking: How many other artists
have died under suspicious circumstances?

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.700
The answer is quite surprising.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.940
Here are 10 artists and entertainers who died
under suspicious circumstances.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.460
10.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.879
Vincent van Gogh

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.160
While van Gogh has come to be known as the
ultimate tortured artist, taking his own life

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.140
to escape the world, his death may not have
been at his own hands.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.780
It is true that van Gogh was troubled, notably
cutting off his own ear after a confrontation

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.780
with his friend, Gauguin.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.770
He suffered from depression and spent time
in psychiatric hospitals before settling in

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.410
Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, where he came
under the care of doctor Paul Gachet.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.660
Many have suggested that Van Gogh took his
own life because of his brother’s suggestion

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.010
that he may not able to support him financially
as he did in the past.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.010
During his life, van Gogh only sold one painting
and was being funded solely because of his

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.630
brother’s belief and affinity for his work.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.120
However, what most don’t take into account
is the manner in which van Gogh died.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.290
He supposedly shot himself in the stomach
– an odd thing, for someone trying to end

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.290
their own life.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.180
Van Gogh then walked nearly two miles back
to his room, and died 30 hours later.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.950
Forensics expert Dr. Vincent Di Mateo has
stated, on record, that it’d highly unlikely

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.880
that van Gogh shot himself.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.450
He was interviewed by biographers Steven Naifeh
and Gregory White Smith, who in their book

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.830
argue that the artist had been most likely
shot by accident by a couple of boys.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.970
On his deathbed, van Gogh stated that only
he should be blamed for his death, and no

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.780
one else, leading the authors to believe he
had decided to protect them by accepting the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.780
blame.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.220
If true, his decision to take responsibility
and free the young boys of a lifetime of imprisonment

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.690
is even more profound than a tortured artist
who can’t live in this world.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.690
9.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.690
Kurt Cobain

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.640
Arguably one of the biggest (or at least one
of the most influential) rock stars of all

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.769
time, Kurt Cobain also met with a suspicious
end.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.889
Like many artists, Cobain was a kind and caring
individual but had his difficulties with drugs

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.540
and other demons.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.819
Before he was found dead in his Seattle home,
Cobain had checked himself out of a drug rehabilitation

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.180
clinic and was reported as suicidal by his
wife Courtney Love.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.989
On April 4, 1994, Police found Cobain dead
and forensic analysis determined that he had

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.989
killed himself.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.099
A shotgun lay across his body, and a head
wound along with a suicide note was found.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.459
Many believed that his was a clear cut case
of suicide but private investigator Tom Grant

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.599
found otherwise.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.080
Despite being hired by Cobain’s widow, Grant
would put forward a conspiracy of foul play

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.650
that implicated Love.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.230
Grant believed that the suicide note left
by Cobain did not suggest suicide but his

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.200
intention of leaving Love and the music industry.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.250
He believed the last section of the note was
the only implication of suicide, and was likely

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.250
forged.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.709
Additionally, Grant argues that the amount
of heroin in Cobain’s system makes it nearly

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.379
impossible for him to have had the capacity
to kill himself.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.769
As Grant’s theories gained more attention,
journalists and filmmakers began to study

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.959
Cobain’s death.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.840
In his own investigation, filmmaker Nick Broomfield
interviewed The Mentors’ bandleader Eldon

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.709
“El Duce” Hoke, who claimed that Love
had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.359
He would go on to say he didn’t do it, but
knew the man who did.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.150
Coincidentally, it was the last interview
Hoke would ever give.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.349
He died days later when he was struck by a
train in the middle of the night.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.349
8.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.349
Biggie and Tupac

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.389
There’s been so much written about the deaths
of these two music icons that it’s hard

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.739
to cover new ground.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.349
What can’t be overstated is the tremendous
loss they were to the hip-hop community and

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.349
music in general.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.359
The killers of Biggie and Tupac were never
arrested or charged but new revelations by

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.389
LAPD officer Greg Kading seem to put the story
to rest.

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.569
According to Kading, as a result of the growing
tensions between the two factions (East Coast

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.049
vs. West Coast, essentially), Sean “Puffy”
Combs offered a bounty on Tupac and Suge Knight.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.489
The jumping/altercation in the Vegas hotel
lobby was enough to prompt gang members Orlando

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.980
Anderson and Keffe D to try and collect on
the reward.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.190
Keffe D would later admit to being in the
car while the shootings took place, identifying

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.750
his nephew Orlando Anderson as the shooter.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.750
Anderson would die just two weeks later in
a gang shooting.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.570
The death of Biggie Smalls was retaliation
for the murder of Tupac.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.140
According to Kading, circumstantial evidence
including money transfers, the shooter’s

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.690
car, and statements by those working at Death
Row Records points to Wardell Fouse (aka Poochie)

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.370
as the killer of Biggie Smalls.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.130
The only silver lining in this tragic tale
is that Suge Knight is currently in jail,

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.980
serving time for murder in a hit and run case.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980
7.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.000
Jim Morrison

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.750
Probably one of the most eyebrow-raising cases
on our list is the death of The Doors frontman

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.750
Jim Morrison.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.000
What’s so startling about his demise is
how little is known.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.950
It happened almost in a flash.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.280
Like Cobain, Morrison was in a dark place
before his death.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.170
His voice was going as a result of all his
drinking, and he was struggling to write lyrics.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.070
Morrison decided to go to Paris to escape
it all with his girlfriend, Pamela Courson.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.311
To this day, the exact timetable leading to
his death is unknown.

00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:25.620
The commonly held notion is that Morrison
and Courson went to a theater and then returned

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.470
home to watch Super 8 films.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.660
Courson claims to have gone to bed, leaving
Morrison to stay up and listen to old records.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.550
After awhile, Morrison complained of being
sick, and Courson suggested they call a doctor.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.370
Instead, he drew a bath.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.500
The last thing Courson remembers hearing are
his calls: “Are you there, Pam?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.750
Pam, are you there?”

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.750
At 6 a.m., she woke up and found him in the
tub, submerged in water.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.750
He was dead.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.550
For some reason, Courson told the coroners
that he had no immediate family.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.550
A lie.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.880
She also purchased the cheapest casket available,
equivalent to $75, and within 72 hours a doctor

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.070
visited and a death certificate was signed.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.070
An autopsy wasn’t performed.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.940
The questions that we all should have was
put perfectly by Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.340
who asked, “How do you even know Jim was
in the coffin?

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.960
How do you know it wasn’t 150 pounds of
f***** sand?”

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960
6.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.110
Johnny Thunders

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.060
Like too many of the great artists on our
list, Johnny Thunders had a drug problem.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.800
The guitarist for the legendary hard rock
band the New York Dolls, along with The Heartbreakers,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.990
Johnny Thunders checked into the St. Peter’s
Guest House in New Orleans looking like a

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.020
ghost.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.110
According to the desk clerk on the the night
of April 22, 1991, Thunders was sweating and

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.650
looked like a Geisha girl when he entered
the hotel.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.090
The next day Thunders was found dead and methadone
and cocaine were uncovered in the room.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.270
However, according to Thunders’s manager,
the autopsy showed no traces of methadone

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.440
in his system.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.150
In addition, the manager also claimed that
the room appeared “wrecked” as if a violent

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.930
altercation had taken place.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.590
There are numerous theories on Thunders’s
death.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.450
Some believe that drug dealers had killed
Thunders, after he had scored some LSD from

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.930
them at a neighboring club.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.710
Others believe that it was actually an overdose
on another substance.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.150
Thunders’s sister dispelled some of these
theories, claiming that his autopsy showed

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.770
that he was in an advanced stage of leukemia.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.880
Was that what killed him?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
We’ll never know.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
5.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880
Paul Williams

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.330
A member of the iconic group The Temptations,
Paul Williams sang lead on several of their

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.780
hits including, “Your Wonderful Love.”

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.370
In addition to having drinking problems, Williams
had sickle cell anemia which only exacerbated

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.370
his health issues.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.500
Much of his health issues can be traced to
when he began his affair with Winnie Brown,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.730
the hair stylist for the Supremes.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.910
He was still devoted to his family, and was
torn apart by his inability to find peace

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.910
in his life.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.140
A man whose strongest drink used to consist
of milk, he took to drinking and the group

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.060
struggled to help him fight his alcoholism.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.530
Eventually, they were forced to employ a stand-in
just in case he was unable to perform.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.160
Although he had significant health issues,
Williams’s death was not health related.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.370
He was found in an alley, sitting in a car
after getting into an argument with another

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.370
girlfriend.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.250
Police found a gun near his body, and ruled
the death a suicide.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.639
However, Williams’s wound was on his left
temple, and the gunpowder remnants were found

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.480
on his right hand.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.760
To further raise suspicions, two bullets were
fired from the weapon, and only one found

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760
its mark.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760
4.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.760
Bobby Fuller

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.510
At the height of the counterculture movement,
Bobby Fuller knew he had a hit.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.520
He recorded “I Fought the Law” and just
months after the song became a hit he was

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
found dead.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.839
His body was doused in gasoline, and bruises
were found up and down his body.

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:40.350
Despite all this, his death was considered
a suicide.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.870
Police later amended their cause of death
and ruled it as accidental.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.750
Nobody knew what to make of it.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:51.070
Some suspected the mafia, others the Manson
Family, and of course some pointed their fingers

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.110
at the police.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.390
So what (or more specifically, who?) caused
Fuller’s death?

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.029
Unfortunately, we’ll almost certainly never
know.

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:01.029
3.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:02.029
Brian Jones

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:06.570
Some might not know this, but Brian Jones
was actually the founder of the Rolling Stones.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.750
He played everything from guitar, to harmonica,
to piano, and even marimba.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.820
Jones was behind some of the most daring decisions
that the group made, including the marimba

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.540
on “Under my Thumb.”

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.290
Despite his tremendous impact, he was pushed
out of the group, and only a month later,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.290
he was dead.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.770
Jones’s death was declared an accident,
labeled as “death by misadventure.”

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.940
He was found dead in his pool, and the coroner
suggested that both alcohol and drugs were

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.940
in his system.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.480
Despite the police report, UK journalist Scott
Jones contended that Jones was actually murdered

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.680
by Frank Thorogood – the last man to see
him alive.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.010
The Sussex police reviewed Jones’s claims
but decided not the re-open the case.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.540
According to reports, Thorogood admitted to
the murder to the Rolling Stones’ driver,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.540
Tom Keylock, but later denied it.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.390
Brian Jones was only 27-years-old.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.390
2.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.310
The lead tenor of the Coasters, the group
that brought us hits like “Yakety Yak”

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.760
and “Charlie Brown,” was shot dead in
his car in Vegas.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.800
He had been performing with the Coasters since
1957, but left the group a few years later.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.880
Gunter was beginning to regain some of his
fame, performing in Las Vegas with his new

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.920
group, Cornell Gunter and the Coasters, when
he was murdered in 1990.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.670
The 1987 inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame was allegedly heard getting into an

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.070
argument with a man at an intersection.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.040
Police found Gunter slumped over in his car
with two gunshot wounds in the chest.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.640
No charges were were ever filed and the case
remains unsolved.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.150
As a tribute to the singer, his group still
performs under the name The Original Cornell

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.690
Gunter’s Coasters Inc.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.750
1.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.810
Thomas Ince

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.460
Thomas Ince wasn’t a musician or artist,
but no one would argue that he wasn’t an

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.460
artist.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.440
A struggling actor who transformed himself
into a film producer, he revolutionized the

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.590
film industry by inventing the shooting script
along with creating the first movie studio

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.590
(Inceville).

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.370
After his film studio burned down, he created
another one in Culver City that would later

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.750
become MGM.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.440
Classic films like Gone with the Wind, King
Kong, and Citizen Kane were shot on his studio

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440
lot.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.050
Later, he’d sell the rights to the studio
and form another that eventually became Paramount

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.050
Pictures.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.810
After several failed projects, Ince was on
the brink of bankruptcy.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:21.350
In 1924 he boarded a yacht owned by newspaper
man William Randolph Hearst (the man who inspired

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.960
Citizen Kane).

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.470
Other passengers included Charlie Chaplin
and Hearst’s mistress Marion Davies.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:33.520
And that’s where things get weird, right
down to the fact that no one can even agree

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.050
exactly where he died, let alone how.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.060
There are several accounts of what occured
on the yacht.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.200
Some believe that Hearst, angered by his mistress’s
deceit, fired a shot at Davies or Chaplin

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.160
and accidentally shot Ince.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.460
A newspaper actually ran a story stating that
Ince had been shot on the yacht.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.980
However, his death certificate stated he died
of heart failure.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.620
Other accounts hold that Ince simply became
extremely ill on the ship and was taken ashore

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.080
by a water taxi.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.620
And yet witnesses claim to have seen Ince
bleeding from a bullet wound to the head as

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.920
he left the yacht.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.310
His wife was quickly ushered to Europe after
Ince was cremated and rumors continued to

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.950
swirl that Hearst paid off Ince’s wife to
keep her quiet.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:27.930
It seems will never know the truth about the
death 

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:44.980
of 
the film legend.
