00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.280
I recently completed an unsanctioned,
unsupervised psychological experiment

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.220
on my children,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.440
(Laughter)

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.360
the premise of which was
$10,000 in cash on the kitchen table

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.620
and a sign next to it
that said 'Don't touch the money yet!',

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.460
and before I dive into it,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.810
you should know that we
are a game-playing family.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.350
We play ball games, board games,
dice games, card games,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.420
all sorts of games,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.150
but the games that my children love
to play most are games like Monopoly,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.070
and when they play Monopoly,
they play marathon games of Monopoly

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.430
that last hours and hours
over days of play.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
Each of my kids has a unique strategy
and personality when they play Monopoly.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.350
My daughter, who is 11,
she is always the dog.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.670
She plays entirely for Chance
and Community Chest cards;

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.860
(Laughter)

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.560
you can say that she uses
the 'luck' strategy.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.740
My 9-year-old son is always the car -
a very strategic player.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.620
He buys all of the Railroads
and all of the Utilities

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.380
and then proceeds to put houses and hotels
on the most expensive properties -

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380
very savvy.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.310
And then his younger brother,
who is seven,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
he buys everything that he lands on
with no exception,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.540
which is fitting because he
is the wheelbarrow.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.200
Now, before I tell you
how my experiment unfolded,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.580
I have to share an observation
that led me to the creation of it.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.960
One Monopoly marathon, Saturday morning,
I was playing with my kids

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.320
and noticed that they were all playing
just outside of the rules of the game.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.860
So they were doing things
like buying each other out of jail

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.710
and lending each other money
to buy properties,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.750
and I found myself going, 'Guys,
this is not how this game is played!'

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.400
to which they'd say, 'Dad, it's fine!
We just want her on the board with us',

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.850
or, 'He can pay me back
at the end of the game,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.490
when he's flush with cash',

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.419
and I'm thinking again,
'What am I teaching these kids?'

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.950
So, I started watching
how they were playing -

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.900
listening to their banter, getting a feel
for how they were making decisions -

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.050
and I had this thought:

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.650
'What if they're playing this way
because the money isn't real?'

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.460
It's a concept I've been reading a lot
about, lately, 'Financial abstraction',

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.350
the notion that when money
becomes more and more of an idea,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.450
less tangible and therefore more abstract,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.000
it changes the way we interact with it
on a regular basis,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.130
and there's anecdotal evidence
of abstraction everywhere around us.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.810
All you have to do is listen carefully
to people who say,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.040
'I loaned my child
or grandchild the phone,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580
and a month later,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.310
all these errant in-app charges
showed up on my bill.'

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.330
In 2014, Apple reimbursed customers
for in-app purchases that were unapproved,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.180
mostly by children,
to the tune of $32.5 million.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.570
This is in a US FTC settlement.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.660
In the documentation,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.810
it said it was just too easy for kids
to make an in-app purchase.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.990
The Imagineers at Disney were charged
with making the parks 'frictionless' -

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.350
is what they called it -

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.100
so they invested a billion dollars
in a MagicBand.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.330
It's a wearable device that functions
as your room key, your park ticket,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.400
and your ID and wallet
when you're on park property.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.770
So if your child wants a set of ears
and a dessert in the Magic Kingdom,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.490
'bibbidi-bobbidi-boo' -

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.340
(Laughter)

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.670
your vacation just cost a whole lot more,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.670
magically.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.390
Magically.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.060
Lastly, I had a conversation
with some teenagers

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.810
who told me that $100,000 a year
really wasn't that much money.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.540
I said, 'Really?
Why do you think that?'

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.380
They said, 'Well, we both have $500,000
in our ATM machines on Grand Theft Auto',

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.400
(Laughter)

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.420
which is a very popular
and somewhat sketchy video game.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.510
So as I'm playing with my kids
and I'm watching them play,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.890
listening to them talk,

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.530
I thought, 'What if the money
were real on the table?

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.960
Would they play differently?'

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.630
And so I calculated quickly on the box,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.839
'How much would it take
in capital, in currency,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.290
to play a physical game
of Monopoly with my kids

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.810
so that they actually tangibly
got to feel the money in their hands?'

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.980
And I estimated, for four or five players,
it's about $10,000.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.210
So one Friday, I stopped at the bank,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.580
I got all the denominations of bills
on a Monopoly board

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.160
with the exception
of a $500 bill - hard to get -

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.170
and on Sunday, I rounded the family up
for a high-stakes game of Monopoly,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.120
(Laughter)

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.580
where the winner takes all.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.990
All of $20, by the way.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.130
All of $20.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.260
You have never seen kids' eyes
light up the way mine did

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.380
when I handed each of them
$1,500 in starter capital,

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.960
and you have never seen
anyone's eyes light up like my wife's

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.440
when I took it back on Monday.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.630
(Laughter)

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.630
All of it.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.810
Our marathon game
only lasted two and a half hours -

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.420
far shorter and more strategic
than most of the games they normally play.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.560
True to my hypothesis,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.930
two of my three kids
actually played differently;

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.880
my daughter still played the 'luck' card.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.950
She was the first one bankrupted,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.460
(Laughter)

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.350
and she happily retired
to the living room to read a book.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.740
My youngest son, the wheelbarrow,
did not buy everything he landed on;

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.850
instead, he carefully calculated

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.490
how many rolls away he was
from one of his brother's properties

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.020
and how much he would owe his brother
if he landed on said property,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.310
and made his decisions based on that.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.330
In effect, having real money on the table
and a cash prize at the end

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.820
made him more conservative.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.480
And my middle son - very strategic -

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.960
still bought all of the Railroads,
still bought all of the Utilities,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.040
but did not buy Boardwalk and Park Place
or Mayfair and Park Lane,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.460
but instead, he put hotels immediately
on Oriental and Baltic Avenue,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.940
or Coventry and Leicester Square
on the UK version.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.700
When I asked him why,
in his own words, he said,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.700
'Dad, they're just
more affordable properties.'

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.700
(Laughter)

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.910
At which point, I cried a tear of pride.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.100
(Laughter)

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.100
So he got it!

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.410
In the end, my son finished
with 28 properties,

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.490
more cash than he'd ever seen
and held in his entire life,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.730
and he now knows the meaning
of the phrase 'making it rain'.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.360
(Laughter)

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.850
Look how happy he is,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.480
(Laughter)

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.810
and how annoyed
his brother and sister are.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.220
In the confines of my experiment,
there is an idea worth spreading,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.220
and it is this:

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.280
I believe kids today

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.660
are being raised in a world
where money is no longer real;

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.030
it's actually an illusion,
but it has very real consequences.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.890
Peter Drucker, famed leadership guru,

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.880
said banking and finance industries today

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.590
are less about money
and more about information,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.240
and yet young people today
don't get that information;

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.220
they don't get the experiences
of money, early on.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.030
Three researchers from
the Centre for Creative Leadership,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.530
in a study done two decades ago
that's been replicated many, many times,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.650
they interviewed over 200 executives

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.890
in a report called
'Key events in executives' lives'.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.130
In this report, they found

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.660
that of the 200 top-level executives
who were the top of their game,

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.890
all of them had similar characteristics.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.400
One of them was
that early on in their career,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.730
they had been thrust
into a leadership role

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.450
that required them to make decisions
that had serious consequences.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.400
They also had a mentor in place
that helped them appreciate the lessons

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.880
they were supposed to learn
from those experiences.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.700
The study created a leadership framework
that said, in essence,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.390
that someone with potential,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.640
if given the opportunity to engage
in strategically relevant experiences

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.830
and given the ability to learn the lessons
from those experiences,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.800
would have a higher likelihood of success
in their career in a leadership capacity.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.670
Now if you took that study framework
and my $10,000 experiment

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.620
and looked at it
through the kaleidoscope,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.440
you would get a statement like this:

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.929
if kids are given financially-relevant
experiences in their life

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.830
and someone is there to help them
learn the lessons from those experiences,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.500
they have a higher likelihood

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.470
of achieving financial
success later in life,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.270
and in my humble opinion,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.300
they need to have them early,
and they need to have them often.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.710
We under this not-so-subtle societal shift
in the way that we pay each other, today.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.190
It's estimated there are trillions
of dollars circling the globe

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.570
in our global economy every single day,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.100
yet only four percent of that money
is actually in coin or currency.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.750
The rest is all digital, data packets,
ones and zeroes,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.020
and today's digital-native youth -

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.930
they don't see people paying
with cash or cheques.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.180
In fact, if ever you're in a line,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.850
and someone in front
pulls out their chequebook to pay,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.780
you are liable to say to yourself,
'Really, a chequebook?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.280
This is going to take forever.'

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.080
You're laughing because it's true.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.140
The currency of today is digital.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.050
Many of these kids equate spending
with credit and debit cards,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.780
with Google Wallet and Paypal and Zap.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.400
All of these are what they
equate spending to,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400
and by the way,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.640
I am not pooh-poohing
the technological advancements

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.050
in payment technology today -

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.050
far from it.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.130
I think tokenisation and randomisation
and biometrics are the wave of the future.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.100
The first time that I used Apple Pay,
it was like showing the caveman fire.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.420
It was amazing.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.620
But what snapped me back to reality
was hearing my son behind me say,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.070
'I sure wish I had a phone
so I could buy stuff.'

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.070
(Laughter)

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.640
You see, money, to a young person,
is somewhat abstract, anyway,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.540
and when we further the abstraction
by waving a MagicBand

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.550
or putting our phone over a sensor
and giving the thumbprint,

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.290
all it does is further the abstraction.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.780
It's a recipe for financial disaster
later in life to the uneducated

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.420
because, to a young person,
they see money as limitless

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.330
because they have no concept
of the backend

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.950
until it comes around
to bite them in the back end.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.540
I've seen this firsthand
in my work with university students -

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.920
young people who borrow
and spend untold amounts of money,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.760
having no concept or understanding
of the increase in payments,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.110
the decrease in lifestyle,
and the challenges they'll face later on.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.830
In the UK and the US,
student debt is ballooning problem.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.740
In the US, we're at $1.2 trillion
in student loan debt,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.890
second only to mortgage debt in the US.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.660
One in three students is delinquent.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.260
One in five is in default.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.070
It's a huge problem,

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.230
and the reason that this is concerning
for all of us as a global economy is this:

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.290
Dun &amp; Bradstreet found
that people spend 12 to 18 percent more

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.660
when using credit cards over cash.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.040
They have yet to do a study

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.700
how much more we'll spend
with a MagicBand or a phone,

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.830
but I can imagine
it would be 15 to 20 percent,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.890
or 18 to 25 percent,

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.510
and all you need to do
is read the headlines

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.640
in the newspapers and magazines
across the world today.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.640
Places like The Guardian,
The Washington Post, Fortune, Forbes -

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.410
these are the headlines we're seeing:

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.430
'New consumer debt reaching
a seven-year high' in the UK,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.780
'Consumer debt hitting an all-time high'
in the US, 'Choking on credit card debt',

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.660
'The credit card debt crisis:
the next economic domino'.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.990
It's what happens when people overspend

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.800
and get in over their head with money.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.080
Unfortunately, The Money Charity says
that in the UK right now,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.380
one person every five minutes
and three seconds

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.820
is either declared insolvent or bankrupt.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.650
To put this into perspective,
since I started speaking today,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.110
two people in this country
have declared bankruptcy.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.620
In the UK, Demos.org says
that Americans aged 25 to 34

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.210
have the second highest rate
of bankruptcy.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.560
25-year-olds.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.730
Everyone's question should be,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.880
'Why? Why is this happening?',

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.410
and in my simplistic view, it is this:

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.690
because the money they're spending
isn't real - it's an abstraction.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.820
So to stem this tide
with the next generation,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.740
we have to bring them up to understand
that they are living in a world

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.120
where they have to make
very real money decisions,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.420
in a world money is largely an illusion
but has very, very real consequences.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.690
Because I want your children and mine
to be super successful financially,

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.200
consider any of the following:

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.540
If you are going
to spend money on children,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.160
give them a set amount of money
and let them spend it.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.910
Let them tangibly feel the money
go through their hands.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.860
Let them succeed or fail
with minor consequences

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.310
so that later in life,
when they're making the major decisions,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.080
they understand there are
major consequences that go along.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.140
For older kids, it's this:

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.140
set a budgeted amount for school clothes,
supplies and what-have-you,

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.190
give them that amount,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.070
and when they are
done spending it, it's done.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.900
And here's the key; they get to spend it
with your subtle guidance,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.570
your subtle mentorship,
your subtle supervision,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.930
and whether you call it an allowance,
you call it commission for chores

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.570
or you call it a weekly stipend,

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.170
every single child,
from the age of five on up,

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.660
needs to be given some tangible amount
of money on a weekly basis

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.200
so that they understand how to function
in a cashless society someday.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.300
Better to teach the young
the habit of saving

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.370
when they have a little bit
of money to save

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.040
than try to teach savings
when they have no money

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.710
because they're in over their head.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.990
I met an American named José.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.660
He was a 20-year-old student
at an American university.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.100
He was the child
of two Cuban-born parents.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.010
At the age of 15, his parents told him,

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.670
'José, we will give you food,
we will give you shelter

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.660
and we will give you $50 a month,
but the rest is up to you.'

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.010
I asked him, 'What was that like?'

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:27.730
He said, 'Clothing, toiletries,
school supplies, entertainment, gas -

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:28.730
it was all on me.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.820
I resented my parents for a year.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.650
But you know what?

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.540
I realised it was the single best thing
they could have ever done for me.'

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.830
When I met José at 20,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.920
he was on a full-ride scholarship
at the university he attended.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.260
He had $20,000 saved in a savings account
from working part-time in high school,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:51.660
and this kid exuded financial prowess
and unmistakable leadership potential.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.080
At the heart of my message today is this:

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.730
it does not take a $10,000 board game

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.420
and it doesn't take cutting kids off
financially to make a difference.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.690
The first step is, honestly, quite easy.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.750
It's about educating the next generation
to make decisions in a world

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.440
where money is largely an illusion
but has very, very real consequences,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.890
and the reason it's so important for all
of us, as a global society, to do this

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.610
is this next generation coming up

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.100
will inherit the global economy
that we are handing to them,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.540
and we will precariously place it
on their shoulders.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.130
We owe it to them to set them up
for financial success.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.030
Thank you.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.450
(Applause)

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.450
Thanks.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.660
(Applause)
