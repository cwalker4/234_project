00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.758
You'll be one of the very first to know now let's talk about the top seven key toe tips you need

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.590
Okay number one is start now start right now start today. You don't have to prep for this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.009
You don't have to study up for this necessarily

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.230
There's going to be a learning curve with the ketogenic diet, but that's okay. You can still start today

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.770
It's as simple as

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.549
Trying to eat as few carbs as possible and trying to eat as much fat as you can in a day, okay

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.350
Don't worry about counting macros

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.189
Don't worry about buying a book just operate on those two principles starting today start right now as soon as this video is over

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.820
Share it on your social media, and then start your ketogenic diet

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.650
It's really that simple you can learn as you go along the ketogenic diet is very

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.519
Forgiving and so that's what makes it possible to do this number two is you're going to need to eat more salt

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.490
Okay

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.259
Salt has been demonized in Western medicine for what 50 60 70 years now

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.609
There's absolutely no recomment. No research and no science that backs this up

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.650
You can eat as much salt as you'd like

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.959
There's research that shows that if you just let people eat as much salt a day as they want to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.930
They average out somewhere between 3 &amp; 6 grams a day

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.220
And that's that's probably the healthy amount of salt you need

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.569
When you start a ketogenic diet? You're is one of the most?

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.009
anti-inflammatory diets

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.479
That there is on the planet ok so if you have any inflammation in your gut if you have inflammation in your joints

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.430
if you have inflammation in your skin that inflammation is going to get better and

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.538
Inflammation causes swelling right and so when swelling gets better the water that caused the swelling

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.730
That's what goes to the tissues and makes them swell up that water has to go somewhere

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.310
And you're just going to pee that out called

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.709
Diuresis and so most people notice on the ketogenic diet their face starts getting slimmer

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.399
And they lose 5 10 15 20 pounds within the first week or two that's not fat loss. I'm sorry

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.450
That's water loss, but that's still a good thing because that means that you are improving the inflammation all over your body

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.989
But as that water

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.989
Leaves your body it takes salt with it

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.399
And so you can this is part of the reason people have the keto flu they have cramps

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.230
They have other things when they're doing the ketogenic diet is because they're still afraid of salt

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.280
Stop being afraid of salt it is your friend. It is not your enemy

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.600
Okay, number. Three is get rid of the temptations in your house

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.350
And I know if you're if you a part of a large family that may be

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.730
Troublesome to throw away all the chips and all the crackers and all the bread

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.600
also, if funds are limited if you're on a limited budget that may hurt a lot and so refer back to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.079
Number one start now the ketogenic diet is very forgiving and therefore if you can't throw everything away

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.329
It's not the end of the world, but it sure makes it easier when you're having a bad day

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.660
emotionally, and you want to reach for that comfort food if it's not there if you have to get in the in your vehicle and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.949
Drive all the way to the grocery to get it you're not gonna do that but if it's right there in the cupboard

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.749
You might just grab it so if it's financially and socially feasible

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.459
Clean out your fridge and clean out your cabinets that makes it so much easier to stick to this diet

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.820
Number four eat until you're full

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.350
The ketogenic diet has nothing to do with decreasing your calorie intake it has nothing to do with

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.630
decreasing your portion size

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.899
That's the old way of thinking okay? That's the old way of thinking that basically for the last 50 years has caused

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.450
the obesity epidemic

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.159
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so stop cutting down on your portion size stop not going back for seconds

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.848
Stop worrying about your calorie counts all those things are irrelevant and have nothing to do with this when you eat enough fat

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.249
You're going to trigger the satiation hormones in your brain and your gut tell you how you dude?

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.679
You're full stop eating and when that happens you're done

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.180
You can't eat more fat unlike if you have a huge family size bag of Doritos

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.670
You can eat the whole bag, and you don't ever get that that hormonal trigger saying stop that you're full

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.399
So when you eat enough fat on this diet you're gonna be full, so don't worry about portions

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.150
Don't worry about any of that just drastically cut the carbs and increase the fat consumption and this diets going to work for you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.340
next is

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.059
Your initial weight loss is fluid loss. It's not fat loss so alive had I've had patients be like oh

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.560
I lost 15 pounds on the ketogenic diet in two weeks, and so I just quit cuz I've reached my goal

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.660
No, no no first of all the ketogenic diet is not a diet

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.880
It really should be called the ketogenic lifestyle because this is the way human beings are supposed to eat

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.420
This is the way I want you to eat for the rest of your life

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.070
Okay, this is not a short-term diet if you lose 5 10 15 20 pounds in the first week or two you haven't lost any

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.160
fat maybe a pound

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.760
But that that was water loss you haven't reached any goal whatsoever in the first week or two

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.890
With a ketogenic diet slash lifestyle, so don't let that trick you remember we talked about how the ketogenic diet is the most?

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.710
anti-inflammatory diet on the planet

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.130
And so you're going to have less swelling in your face you're gonna have less swelling in your gut less swelling in your joints

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.429
Swelling is caused by cells taking up extra water

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.149
When you get rid of that water you're going to pee off the water right and so that weight loss is water

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.919
Water loss not fat loss. So don't be tricked by the initial weight loss

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.270
next is

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.489
Learn to eat new things and I seem to have more trouble with my male patients on this than my female patients

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.419
Yeah, I understand you're used to eating chicken nuggets and ketchup, and that's your go-to and that's what you eat every meal

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.270
Ok that's dumb stop that okay

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.130
Part of being a mature grown-up part of being a man part of being a woman is is loving to try new things

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.549
Ok and so if you're if you don't love to try new things

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.230
You need to get over that because that's first of all all sign of immaturity

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.950
Second of all it's not going to help you on the ketogenic diets

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.509
You need to take a trip to the grocery and just walk around the produce section

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.679
and you need to look around and you need to find one or two or three new ketogenic vegetables that you've never tried and

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.740
Try them remember you can salt them as much as you want you can use as many spices and herbs and pepper as you want

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.200
Because those things are ketogenic they don't they don't mess up your your insulin level. They don't mess up your fast

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.130
They don't mess up your diet

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.249
You've got to try any veggies, okay?

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.490
You've got to go to the meat section

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.650
And you've got to look around and try new cuts of meat new kinds of meat you've never tried before

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.329
If you're not willing to do that then you're probably going to fail at this lifestyle because you have to be a mature adult

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.490
to do the ketogenic diet

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.459
There is new research just out that shows that the human palate is retraining

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.140
It's absolutely proven that you can learn to like new foods, so if you're a trick chicken strip and ketchup guy

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.869
Dude, stop that okay. You sound like a 12 year old get out there and try some new foods

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.880
I promise you'll like some of them, okay

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.330
I hope I didn't make you mad, but if I did you probably needed to hear it anyway now

00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:00.859
Number seven is if you cheat if you mess up if you do grab that family size bag of Doritos

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.989
What do I do most people's impulse is to just quit give up or for the rest of the day?

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.479
Well, I already did that I'll just eat crap the rest of the day

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.650
Another subset of people say. Oh my god. I just ate the whole bag of Doritos

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.470
I'm gonna go run ten miles and then go to the gym and work out then

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.010
I'm not gonna eat another thing for the rest of the day all those are

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.439
Understandable reactions, but they're inappropriate you don't have to do any of that just act like it never happened okay, just pick right up

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.940
Right right back up where you left off

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.609
The ketogenic diet is one of the most forgiving diets that you've ever tried if you just pick right back up

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.099
Where you left off? It'll be almost like nothing happens now. This is not giving you a license to cheat

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:45.889
This is just saying if and when you do cheat. Don't worry about it. Don't sweat. It. Don't feel guilty don't feel bad

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.250
Don't feel like a failure

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:54.559
Just remember the ketogenic diet is mirroring the diet that our ancestors used to eat hundreds of thousands of years

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:00.930
And so once every year or two they would find a honey tree right with where bees had, honey

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.849
What do you think they did they ate all of it right and they would lay around in a sugar coma?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:11.820
For days around the base of the tree until they finally burned all the carbs off then they'd get up and go about their business

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:15.029
Or once a year, and if you were

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.900
Outside the tropics of capricorn the cancer

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.550
Fruit gets ripe in the fall right and so that's why it's called the fallen fruit falls

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.789
And you eat all that fruit and gain five pounds right before the winter

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.309
That happens once a year though right and so it's okay to cheat every now

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.669
And then that's not a big deal because our ancestors did it every chance they got

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.409
If you had given them sugar and carbs every day. They would have eaten them every day, and they would be fat

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.350
Just like we are

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.190
But they didn't have access to that they found the honey tree once every year or two they found the fall fruit once a year

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.690
And for the rest of the year they ate the ketogenic diet, okay?

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.429
And that's why they were all healthy Lane and looked great in a bikini or a speedo

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.159
I don't think they had those back then but you know what I mean oh

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.830
I've got a couple of bonus

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.159
Ketogenic tips first is working out

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.130
Does not make it okay to cheat a lot of people because a lot of times the calorie counts

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.890
Remember refer back to calories being meaningless the calorie count on the treadmill or on the Stairmaster is black

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:23.429
You could work out really hard. Oh, I burned so many hundreds of calories first of all 99% of the time those counters are wrong

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:28.949
Yeah, don't no no that does not give you the right to have a cookie you haven't earned

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.080
The the pleasure of eating half of the cherry pie that's not how it works

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.460
Working out is great

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.420
if you want to gain muscle

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.070
But working out there as shown in multiple studies is a terrible way to lose weight

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.719
The calorie counting game does not work the calorie deficit game does not work

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.469
We've been trying that for 50 years, and we all just got fat doing it

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.469
Workout if you want to gain muscle workout if you want to keep your brain healthy and actually put off

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.440
Dementia working out is great for your body and hundreds of ways, but it does not help you lose weight

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.830
And it does not give you the right to eat a cheat meal. That's not how it works my last bonus tip is consider

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.520
Blending intermittent fasting with your ketogenic diet the two together

00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:19.059
I've had I've seen better weight loss and health improvement results in the patients in my clinic than any other diet

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.029
I've ever seen a recommended in my entire professional career

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:29.770
When you blend the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting you get you you you compound the benefits you

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.349
Multiply the benefits. They're not just additive

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.910
They're synergistic

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.440
They work, so hand-in-hand

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:42.369
And it also is kind of effortless to fast if you're on the ketogenic diet because the fat keeps you full right

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:48.639
