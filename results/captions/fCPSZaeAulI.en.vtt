IF YOU CAN.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:17.756 align:start position:0%
LOOK FOR THE

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:18.757 align:start position:0%
CHECK ONE RING.

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:19.925 align:start position:0%
IF YOU DON'T
FIND THE SOFT SPOT

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
CHECK THE OTHER RING.

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.594 align:start position:0%
WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND
THE SOFT SPOT

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:25.131 align:start position:0%
THEN GRAB THE RING

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.531 size:78% position:39%
TWIST, PULL AND SEPARATE.

00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:43.381
HOW DID YOU DO?

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:44.883
DID YOU GET THEM APART?

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.719 align:start size:63% position:38%
HUH? THEY'RE STILL

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:05.004
ISN'T THAT PRETTY?

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.277
THE FINALE.

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:16.782
WITH ONE-- I'VE BEEN IN TOUGHER
SPOTS THAN THIS.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:19.619
WITH ONE SIMPLE MOVE.

00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:33.065
MY MOM SAYS I'M SPECIAL.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:36.902

(<i> applause</i> )

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:52.317 align:start size:88% position:13%
I HAD LEARNED THE RINGS
BY THE TIME I TURNED NINE.

00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:55.053 align:start size:88% position:13%
I TRIED TO LEARN MAGIC
EVERYWHERE I COULD.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.055

00:10:57.122 --> 00:10:58.190
YEARS OF PRACTICE

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.393
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME.

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.997
BUT IT IS REMARKABLE...

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:08.333 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT A KID CAN PICK UP
HANGING AROUND A POOL HALL.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.303

LEARNING MAGIC IS FUN

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:28.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE
TO MAKE A LIVING.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.388
AND IT USED TO BE

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:32.258

IN CITIES LIKE NEW ORLEANS,
SAN FRANCISCO AND AUSTIN, TEXAS.

I DID MAGIC FOR YEARS
ON THE STREET.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.401
ACTUALLY, I PAID MY BILLS

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:45.036 size:88% position:56%
WITH A LITTLE GAMBLING GAME.

00:11:45.103 --> 00:11:46.839

THERE IS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE BALL IN THE GAME.

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:35.854 line:0%
ANOTHER RULE SAYS
THAT IF THAT BALL IS HERE

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.923 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
THEN IT REALLY SHOULDN'T
SHOW UP OVER HERE.

THERE'S ALSO A RULE

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.232 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
THAT SAYS THAT IF A BALL
GOES OUT OF THE GAME

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.835 line:0%
THEN THAT BALL SHOULD
STAY OUT OF THE GAME.

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:52.705 line:0%
THAT IS, OF COURSE,
A SUB-RULE TO THE BIG RULE
