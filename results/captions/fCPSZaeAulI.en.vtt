00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:18.757 align:start position:0%
CHECK ONE RING.

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:19.925 align:start position:0%
IF YOU DON'T

WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND
THE SOFT SPOT

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:25.131 align:start position:0%

BY THE TIME I TURNED NINE.

00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:55.053 align:start size:88% position:13%
I TRIED TO LEARN MAGIC

I DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME.

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.997
BUT IT IS REMARKABLE...

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:08.333 align:start size:88% position:13%

I DID MAGIC FOR YEARS

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.401
ACTUALLY, I PAID MY BILLS

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:45.036 size:88% position:56%

THERE IS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE BALL IN THE GAME.

THAT SAYS THAT IF A BALL
GOES OUT OF THE GAME

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.835 line:0%
THEN THAT BALL SHOULD
STAY OUT OF THE GAME.

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:52.705 line:0%
