00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.959
One of the things I like about particle physics
is its ability to describe the behavior of

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.520
matter under every experimental condition
we’ve ever investigated. We call our very

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.680
successful theory the Standard Model of Particle
physics. I made another video that describes

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.410
this incredible theory.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.830
While the Standard Model covers most of the
known fundamental forces, specifically electromagnetism,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.050
the strong and weak nuclear forces and the
Higgs field, this model says absolutely nothing

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.510
about the force that literally binds the universe
together – the force of gravity.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.710
The reason for this is simple. Gravity is
incredibly, ridiculously, weaker than the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.039
other known forces. On the size of, say…
about the size of the atomic nucleus, the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.350
other forces all have kinda sorta the same
strength, with the weak force being about

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.489
100,000 times weaker than the strong force.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.750
Now that last statement probably sounds kind
of silly, because 100,000 sounds like a big

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.789
difference, like comparing something, oh,
four inches tall to Mount Everest, but gravity

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:24.000
is unfathomably weaker still. It is about-
wait for it- a hundred, thousand, trillion,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.099
trillion, trillion times weaker than the strong
force. That’s like comparing the tiny proton

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.899
to the size of the visible universe. It’s
a huge difference.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.209
Since gravity is so weak in the quantum world,
there is no chance that we will ever see any

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:44.250
effect due to gravity in a particle physics
experiment. In fact, if all we had to go on

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.289
was the data from particle physics experiments,
we wouldn’t even know gravity existed. The

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.700
reason that we know of gravity is because
it has an infinite range and up to size scales

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.270
of the Milky Way or even clusters of galaxies
that we can see that it works basically like

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.000
Isaac Newton predicted 350 years ago. It takes
the mass of asteroids or planets or stars

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.640
to see gravity at all.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.450
But I don’t want to talk about the gravity
of the big, which is the domain of astronomy

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.610
or cosmology, but rather I want to talk about
the nature of gravity in the realm of the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.470
very small.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.460
But I just told you that at sizes comparable
to that of a proton, gravity is very weak.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.940
So what the heck am I talking about?

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.950
Well gravity, even if weak, must apply in
the microworld. That’s not a very profound

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.770
thought, but it’s true. And, since our best
theory of gravity is Einstein’s theory of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.810
general relativity, the most obvious thing
to do is to just apply that theory to the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.920
subatomic realm. As an illustrative example,
let’s imagine an electron orbiting a nucleus.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.700
If you do that, you find that Einstein’s
theory predicts that the electron would lose

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.150
energy by the emission of gravity waves and
then spiral down into the proton. A similar

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.450
prediction using classical electromagnetism
led to the invention of familiar, or at least

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.110
well-known, quantum mechanics. This same chain
of reasoning suggests that gravity must also

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.319
have some kind of quantum nature.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.900
Another reason to suspect that gravity must
have a quantum nature is because A, we definitely

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.910
have a quantum theory for the other forces,
and B, general relativity is a classical theory.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.940
It is impossible to seamlessly wed a quantum
and classical theory and this is taken as

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.010
additional evidence that there should exist
a theory of quantum gravity. Otherwise, we’ll

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.350
not be able to write a theory that accurately
describes everything in the world of the very

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.430
small.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.770
So if we accept the idea of quantum gravity,
what do we know? Well, there are some basic

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.550
conclusions we can make that are true for
all such theories. One such conclusion is

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.319
that there should be a particle called a graviton.
In just the same way that a quantum theory

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.319
of electromagnetism predicts that a photon
exists, quantum gravity predicts that a graviton

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.110
should exist.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.880
Now we’ve never seen a graviton, which means
that you shouldn’t believe in it. But, if

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.959
it exists, in order to agree with both Newton’s
and Einstein’s theory of gravity, the particle

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.090
must have certain properties. To have gravity’s
infinite range, the graviton must be massless.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.870
To be only an attractive force, the graviton
must have a quantum mechanical spin of 2,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.709
which is different from the electron’s spin
of 1/2 and the photon’s spin of 1. The graviton

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.270
must also be electrically neutral.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.630
So this all seems pretty simple. The theory
predicts a particle with very specific properties.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.530
So it would seem that the next step would
be to go out and find it. I mean, my colleagues

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.280
and I do that sort of thing all the time,
right?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.320
Of course, the problem is that gravity is
so weak. And, because it’s weak, it’s

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.320
essentially impossible to make a graviton
in a particle physics experiment. To all intents

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.230
and purposes, there is no chance that we’ll
ever find a graviton even using the accelerators

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.150
we might imagine building with the technology
of a hundred years from now.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.220
There is one small possibility we might see
a graviton someday soon, but that’s only

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.520
if the universe is much different than it
appears. If the universe has additional tiny

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.570
dimensions beyond the familiar three, it’s
possible that we might find gravitons and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.210
even possibly find massive gravitons as well.
But this possibility is dependent on these

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.900
small extra dimensions existing. Frankly,
while it’s possible, it’s a long shot.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.630
If you’re interested, take a look at my
video on the idea.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.550
So, getting back to the more basic idea of
quantum gravity, has there been any theoretical

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.030
progress on the subject? Well, yes, and no.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.290
There have been a couple quantum gravities
theories proposed that are kind of successful.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.389
And, by successful, I mean that they are still
possible. One is superstring theory, which

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.590
says that the very smallest building blocks
of matter are actually very tiny strings.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.550
This theory has been very popular for many
years, although some have criticized it for

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.120
not making testable predictions. If you’re
interested in the idea, check out my video

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.430
on the topic.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.000
Another idea that’s been floating around
for a while is called “loop quantum gravity.”

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.660
The mathematics of this theory is pretty complex
and goes by the confusing name of “spin

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.990
networks,” but the basic idea is that there
is a smallest quantum of space and time.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.880
Now, this is a pretty bizarre idea. It means
that unlike ordinary sizes, in which you can

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.780
cut an object a meter long into two objects
a half a meter long, when you get to a certain

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:39.790
size, you literally no longer can make smaller
objects.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.740
The physical dimensions of this smallest space
and time are too small to test in particle

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.710
physics experiments, although they might have
some testable consequences in observations

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.510
of very distant astronomical objects. The
jury is still out on these studies, but so

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.919
far there is no evidence that confirms these
ideas.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.759
So there is no confirmation of quantum gravity,
but if the idea is true, it has some real

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:07.290
consequences that will change how you think
about such cool things such as the center

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.470
of black holes and the universe right before
the Big Bang.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.940
If you have even a casual knowledge of physics,
you’ve no doubt heard that scientists think

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.820
that before the Big Bang all of the matter
of the universe existed in a single mathematical

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.210
point with zero size. Similarly, the center
of a black hole is said to hold all of its

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.370
mass of the parent star compressed to zero
size.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.210
These tiny concentrations of enormous mass
are called singularities. And singularities

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.139
are unphysical. They don’t exist. If a theory
predicts them, then this is a sign that the

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:45.130
theory has been pushed hard enough that it
is broken.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.449
Now I don’t- I do not- want you to think
that this means that black holes don’t exist

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:55.669
or that the Big Bang never happened. Nor do
I want you to think that huge concentrations

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:00.919
of matter in tiny, tiny, volumes aren’t
real. All of these things really exist. So

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.699
don’t send me some anti-relativity email.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:09.360
But what I am telling you is that as matter
gets compressed into smaller and smaller volumes

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.020
that gravity becomes more important and that
the theory of quantum gravity starts to dominate.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.490
Quantum gravity is what protects against a
singularity. And what this really means is

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.830
that we will never understand the details
of the beginning of the universe or the center

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:30.020
of a black hole until someone works out a
theory that blends gravity and quantum mechanics.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.459
So I hope that this conversation gives you
a sense of the complexities involved in a

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:38.329
quantum theory of gravity. Realistically,
solving this problem will take a long time,

00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:42.699
but it’s a fascinating topic and one that
we’ll need to solve before we finally have

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.700
a theory of everything.
