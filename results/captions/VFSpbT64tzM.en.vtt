In this episode of MarieTV, we do have some
adult language, so if you have little ones

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.450
around grab your headphones now.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:20.340
Hey, it’s Marie Forleo and you are watching
MarieTV, the place to be to create a business

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.720
and life you love.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.240
Now, today’s episode is adult in nature,
so if you’ve got little ones around or anybody

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.349
with sensitive ears now would be the time
to put on your headphones.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.129
The reason why is we’re going to be discussing
a new book that’s coming out and it’s

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.129
called Pussy.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.440
Now, I know that title may offend some, but
I have to tell you personally, I believe it’s

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.949
brave and courageous and this is a conversation
that we need to have.

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.969
Regena Thomashauer is an icon, teacher, author,
mother, and founder and CEO of the School

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.859
of Womanly Arts.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.469
She believes that women are the greatest untapped
natural resource on the planet and she teaches

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.760
them to create a life they love.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.829
The School of Womanly Arts began in Regena’s
living room in 1998 and has grown into a thriving

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.960
movement with thousands of graduates worldwide.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.420
Regena has written 4 popular books and has
appeared on The Today Show, Late Night with

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.210
Conan O’Brien, 20/20, and more.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.020
Her programs have been profiled in the New
York Times, Elle, and New York Magazine.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.020
Regena.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.020
Marie.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.380
Thank you so much for coming back on the show.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.999
I am so excited to have you on for this book.

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.219
So let’s dive right into it.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.990
This is a very provocative, brave title.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.409
What possessed you to do this?

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.409
To write this book?

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.979
And, of course, to name it what you named
it?

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.289
Do you think I wanted to write this book and
call it Pussy?

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.509
I wanted to do… have it be called anything
else but Pussy.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.719
You know that better than anyone.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.820
You’re the one that really gave me the courage
of my convictions and had me stand in my deepest

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.960
truth, which was to take this title.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.229
I mean, I have a momma that’s going to be
embarrassed.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.429
I have a teenage daughter that’s going to
be embarrassed.

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.290
But it was really, really important to me
to take this word and use it as a wake up

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.459
call, like any expletive.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.880
It is a smack upside the head to a culture
that requires waking up in this particular

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.290
area.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.209
So that word, you know, a lot of people use
it in a very demeaning way.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.890
We say it all the time and it’s pejorative…

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.890
Oh my gosh.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.090
Can you speak to that?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.010
Pussy is the worst insult across the boards.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.709
You know, if you call a man a pussy you’re
insulting his manhood and his masculinity.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.909
If you call a woman a pussy your intention
is to hurt her or humiliate her, fracture

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.209
her humanity, have her feel like a sexual
object.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.099
No one wants to be a pussy, much less have
a pussy.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:04.540
But, you know, we live in a world where women
right now are… there’s a huge piece of

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.420
cultural conditioning that is unconscious.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.610
We don't even pay attention to the fact that
our little girls, when they’re growing up,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.939
we don't even give them the name for that
which is most essentially feminine about themselves.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.650
There’s no language.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.810
Like, when I teach at the School of Womanly
Arts, a few hundred women, I’ll say, “What

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530
did your bits and pieces get called when you
were little?”

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:43.200
And I’ll get names like wiki, coo coo, pookie,
knish, Walter Winchell, princess, front bottom,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:52.790
pee pee, wee wee, like all these crazy colloquialisms
and no actual commonality of name.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.549
Some women will say, “Oh, it’s a vagina,”
but that’s actually physiologically incorrect.

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.930
It’s a vulva.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.959
The worst is that more than half of my students
will say that it got called nothing.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.760
And when you don't even give a little girl
the language to connect with that which is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.700
most essentially feminine about herself, you’re
disempowering her.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.440
And it’s not the same for little boys.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.950
When I have a room full of my guys for men’s
night and I say what did your bits and pieces

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.030
get called, they say, “It always got called
a penis.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.530
What’s your problem?”

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.320
So we perform this cultural clitoridectomy
on little girls and women and we’ll never

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.690
have access to our power until we can own
every bit of this gorgeous female body.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.790
I think it’s really important because I’ve
heard you, you know, we’re friends and we

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.440
go out together and I’ve heard you have
conversations with people when they use that

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.380
word and give them a schooling like they’ve
never had a schooling before.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.630
Gently, I hope.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.070
Yeah, I mean, sometimes you’re gentle but
you just go right in and that’s one of the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.410
things I appreciate about you.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.760
But let’s talk what this book is really
about.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.561
And I think you’re taking a stand for reclaiming
the values of the feminine, and you talk a

00:05:09.561 --> 00:05:14.970
lot about this inside the book, inside a patriarchal
culture driven by masculine values.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.020
Can you talk to what that means?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.020
Yeah.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.100
The world right now hates pussies and devalues
the feminine.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.040
I mean, if we open the newspaper we’re going
to see stories about unchecked violence, which

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.330
is what happens in a world when the feminine
withdraws.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.490
Women are actually withdrawn right now even
though we have so many freedoms that we never

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.690
had and so many opportunities that we never
had.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.710
There’s a way in which we are stuck and
shut down.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.840
And what am I seeing out there?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.460
I’m seeing one in four women are going to
experience depression in their lifetimes and

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.800
only one in five of those women are ever going
to seek treatment.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.240
And that’s twice as many cases of depression
as men have.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.850
Women are twice as likely.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.740
Right now heart disease is the number one
killer for women.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.580
Every 34 seconds a woman drops dead of heart
disease.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.310
And that’s in the area of health, but what
about the area of career or work?

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.930
Women right now, we make 79 cents on the dollar
that men make.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.190
For African American women it’s 63 cents
on the dollar and for Hispanic women it’s

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.210
53 cents on the dollar than men make.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.320
This is crazy.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.570
And in Hollywood last year, of all the top
grossing films, only 9% were directed by women.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.470
So we live in a time where the voice of woman
is not being heard, where she isn’t stepping

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.780
into that sense of herself or that sense of
her own power.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.000
And that… those are just the facts.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.870
What do you mean by patriarchal values specifically?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.220
How do we distinguish between patriarchal
and the feminine values?

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.170
Yeah, it’s a good question.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:13.180
A patriarchal value… right now in the world
there’s a, you know, patriarchy, masculine

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:20.700
and feminine, they’re both valuable but
the imbalance occurs when men and the masculine

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.940
are valued more than women and the feminine.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.680
So it would be like any imbalance.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.060
If you just ate pasta but no veggies, that’s
an imbalance.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.840
You wouldn’t be healthy.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.150
You know, if you just did aerobic training
and no weights, that’s not really healthy.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.890
So we have this imbalance where the masculine
has kind of taken over and women are trying

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:52.320
to man up instead of woman up and become,
you know, they’re valuing what’s male

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.290
and not even knowing what’s female about
themselves.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:03.750
So, for example, the values of the masculine
are… well, more like the patriarchy.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.900
The values of a patriarchal culture would
be something like no pain no gain.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.800
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.440
Don't pay attention to what you feel.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.420
Just go for the bottom line, for the profit.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.210
It’s not about the collective, it’s about
the individual winning and striving.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.760
And you don't… it doesn't matter what you
have to do to get to the top, but you have

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.340
to get to the top.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.470
That’s patriarchy.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:36.550
Whereas the values of the feminine are less
known and we feel kind of weird if we act

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.289
according to the values of the feminine.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:47.470
Those are things like we value interconnectedness,
we see the sacred in even mundane things,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.430
you know, like this beautiful bowl of flowers.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.000
There’s spirit in that.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.089
We have passionate feelings, a full, wide
range of passionate feelings.

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:05.199
We have deep intuitions that, when paid attention
to, oh my goodness, are so important.

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:12.170
The value of receiving or surrendering is
important for the feminine.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:18.110
So those are the things that are devalued
right now and I think everyone suffers on

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.110
account of that.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.120
I agree and I think we are coming into a new
time, but that’s why I was so excited to

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
have you on.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.540
And I’m so thrilled that you wrote this
book because we need to talk about it more

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.769
and we do need a wake up call around these
ideas.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:34.639
One of the things I found fascinating that
I’ve learned from you, you know, it wasn’t

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.139
always this way, was it?

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:37.939
In terms of a patriarchal society.

00:09:37.939 --> 00:09:41.180
It’s only been the last 5 thousand years
or so.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.180
I know.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.790
And that seems like a long time, but it’s
not a long time.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:52.180
Because if we went back, you know, 30 thousand
years prior to the patriarchy, pussies were

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.350
the bomb.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.300
They were everything.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.110
They’re like the star of the show.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.620
They were worshipped.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.209
Mother earth was revered.

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:07.769
Women, because we could give life, we were
thought to be sacred and considered sacred

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:12.209
vessels and portals between the human and
the divine.

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:15.520
The power of the feminine was called upon.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.449
All those aspects of ourselves were considered
so important for creativity and feeding the

00:10:22.449 --> 00:10:23.899
earth and the people.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:29.860
For example, let’s say we were… went back
in time to ancient Egypt and we went out the

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.269
very day that the crops were planted with
all the other ladies in ancient Egypt.

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:40.249
We would stand along the field with all of
our sisters and we would raise our skirts

00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:43.870
and flash our pussies at the field of wheat.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:50.430
And we would charge the earth and we would
say, “Wheat, may you grow as high as my

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.430
pussy.”

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.430
Right?

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.430
It’s kind of amazing.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.430
Kind of.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:11:01.399
There’s this pretty historic cave painting
and there’s a woman, a hunter, and then

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.399
his prey.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:07.420
He’s pulling back his arrow and about to
capture his prey, but where does the power

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.420
come?

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:14.290
There’s a line drawn from his woman’s
pussy through his arrow into the prey so that

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:21.279
there was a connection between the feminine
presence even in the action of her man, her

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:25.319
hunter, and how that community was fed.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:28.970
I think it’s so fascinating because most
of us don't know that much if you go back

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.269
to history that, that far.

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:33.620
That was another fascinating aspect to your
book.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.389
So you say that pleasure is the direct antidote
to the crisis of confidence and powerlessness

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:40.540
that women are experiencing right now.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.540
How so?

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.540
Oh, my.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.870
Well, you know as women we were never taught
to pleasure ourselves.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.360
We weren’t taught to pay attention to our
pleasure.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:57.220
We were taught to ignore our pleasure and
we were taught to kind of man up and work

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.040
really, really, really, really hard.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.870
I guess maybe one day we would get some pleasure
at the end of that, that was the theory.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:11.389
But what happens instead is women get stressed
and we live…

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:13.889
I don't know when women have been more stressed.

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:17.949
It’s like this just universal stress for
women right now.

00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:21.060
And to be clear, if anyone’s listening,
when you say women aren’t taught to pleasure

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.610
ourselves, while sure you could include masturbation
in this conversation that’s not really the

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.800
essence of what you’re talking about fully.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:37.120
I’m talking about something as simple as
it could be taking a moment to feel the sunshine

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.149
on your skin and connecting to the fact that
you're alive right now.

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:46.230
It could be, you know, the genius of flowers.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.540
Those are just… they cheer you up.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.920
If you really look at those, it’s like a
bowl of miracles right there.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920
Yes.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.910
But I’ll speak… so let me give voice for
any woman right now who may be like a little

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.759
bit like, “Uh, I don't know about this.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:04.529
I don't know if I’m buying into this,”
because when we are in our masculine, which

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:08.350
is, you know, we’ve talked about this before,
it’s a place and it’s the energy that

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.980
I live in very, very easily.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.980
Me too.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.029
The mind can always go to, “Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I don't have time for this.

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:19.390
Like, I don't have time to pleasure myself,”
you know, meaning sit there and get the flowers.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.790
I’ve got to get dinner ready, I’ve gotta
work, I’ve got to pay the bills.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.470
What do you say to those women who are like,
“Yeah, it sounds like a fantasy but I don't

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.550
know if I can make this happen.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.100
It’s literally not in reality”?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.100
Yeah.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.089
I say you have to listen to your little cells
which are screaming.

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:36.230
They’re saying, “Help.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.670
I’m so stressed right now.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.160
I’m being flooded with cortisol.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.499
Please do something.”

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:46.850
Because cortisol, it’s bad news.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.459
It not only makes us very irritated and…

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:50.740
Stressed out.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.860
Stressed out and short tempered.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.860
Right?

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.149
But it has health consequences.

00:13:55.149 --> 00:14:03.089
First of all, we feel depressed, we feel angry,
we feel lonely, we feel disconnected.

00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:09.999
And cortisol is supposedly the key to inflammation
in the body, which is one of the ways in which

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.740
diseases start, with inflammation.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.149
So it’s… it’s dangerous to be stressed.

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:17.149
Right?

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:22.290
And we as women have this access to pleasure
because we have 8 thousand nerve endings on

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.059
our bodies dedicated to pleasure.

00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:30.529
So what we can do is with the mere power of
our thought we can decide, ok, I am feeling

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:32.869
a profound amount of stress at the moment.

00:14:32.869 --> 00:14:35.009
I think it’s time for a pleasure break.

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:40.879
That could be throwing on your favorite song
and just boogying for 30 second.

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:44.529
It could be a hot, hot shower with your favorite
bath gel.

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:46.209
It could be an orgasm.

00:14:46.209 --> 00:14:51.199
It could be taking your tea in a real mug,
you know?

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:54.139
Like a real mug, not a paper cup.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:15:01.790
It’s those little tiny moments that actually
flood your body with all of this beautiful…

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.110
what happens is when you have a pleasurable
experience it turns on neurotransmitters such

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.759
as beta endorphin and prolactin.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:14.090
And what that does is flood your body with
a sense of health, a sense of joy, a sense

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.540
of connection, a sense of empowerment.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:24.360
It’s a way of stepping into your power through
pleasure and it absolutely shuts that cortisol

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.959
right down and then your little cells are
like, “Thank you.

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:29.130
I needed that.”

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.130
Yes.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.240
And I’m gonna give voice to this because
we’ve had this conversation many times privately

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.779
and I have it with many women that I know.

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:39.910
So for anyone who is listening and like, “I
still don't know,” here’s what I know

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:46.889
about running a business, that when I am more
grounded and able to stay in touch with my

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:52.439
sense of pleasure and ease and openness and
love, I’m a way better leader, I make much

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:57.429
better creative decisions, I take care of
everyone around me, and everything just seems

00:15:57.429 --> 00:16:01.499
to run with more ease and more fun and more
connection.

00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:07.560
And I know when I’ve gone too long in that
really hard driving mode, everything suffers.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.199
Not only how I feel about myself but the results
that I create.

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:15.569
So that’s actually been one of my little
tricks because when I can stay in that driving

00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:18.689
mode ain’t nothing gonna be like, “I ain’t
got time for the bath, momma.

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:20.050
I ain’t got time for it.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.050
Can’t happen.”

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.470
But then I start to use those tricks and it
really does work.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:30.529
I want to talk now about rupture because rupture
is really another important component of your

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:31.529
book.

00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:37.790
How do you define that for us women and what’s
the power in recognizing it?

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:49.519
Rupture is whenever your heart breaks, things
get busted up, it does not go your way.

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.779
It is a huge part of life.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:52.779
Huge.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:53.839
You cannot avoid rupture.

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.779
You cannot hide from rupture.

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:57.350
Rupture will find you.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:03.990
Just like autumn then winter comes, you can’t
stop it and you don't want to stop it because

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.459
if you do you won’t get spring.

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:13.950
So it’s an interesting and magnificent way
for us to access who we are as women and who

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.530
our power is.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:20.990
But the problem has been because the feminine
has been so devalued and we’ve been cut

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.600
off from our ability to feel and when…

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.100
I don't know about you, but weren’t you
brought up to be sugar and spice and everything

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100
nice?

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.100
Yeah.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.700
It wasn’t really… you don't really spend
that much time exploring those feelings of

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.750
anger or really deep sadness or grief or when
everything falls apart how do we deal?

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.760
How do we deal?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.150
We feel ashamed actually because what you’re
supposed to say when someone says, “How

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.150
are you?”

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.920
There’s only time to say fine.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.940
No one wants to… you know, anyone would
be shocked if you said, “You know, actually,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.940
I had…

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.220
I am in a state of heartbreak right now.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.780
Will you sit down and talk to me?”

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.790
We’re not taught to do that.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:08.670
But the nature of the feminine is like a piano
with 88 keys.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.030
How boring would a piano be if it had one
key?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.310
And mostly women behave like they have one
key, middle C, and they just are like, “I’m

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.310
fine.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.310
I’m fine.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.310
I’m fine.”

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:27.170
And to really live what it means to be a woman,
you want to be a virtuoso of every facet of

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.440
your emotional life.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:34.220
You want to experience the beautiful thrilling
little tinkling notes of joy and you want

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.850
that pounding beautiful dark sorrow.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:44.720
In fact, the degree to which you can own your
light is only the degree to which you can

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.210
own your darkness.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.740
They go hand in hand.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.630
So it’s a beautiful thing for a woman to
get to play every note that she has.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.540
That’s when you know you have a well lived
life.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.830
Yeah, it’s true.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.170
And I love some of the stories you told.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:03.721
I want to go now to the power of community
and sisterhood because I think that’s one

00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:07.580
of the things that I’ve learned so deeply
from you and I feel like we’ve been able

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.710
to develop together with our friendship and
I’ve seen you do it with your community

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.480
for a number of years now.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.260
How important is it to have that community
and to have that sisterhood?

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.310
And what does it mean for us women?

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.270
Sisterhood is everything, but we live in this
time of woman hating, you know, where we as

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.580
women have been taught to be suspicious of
other women, that she’s gonna want your

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.030
spot, she’s going to want to stab you in
the back, she’s gonna want to take your

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.170
man, she’s not your friend.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.930
Now, where do we get that from?

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:44.130
Well, we get it from living in a patriarchal
culture that devalues women, dishonours women,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.560
disparages women.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:51.410
So what happens is we take on the exterior
culture’s point of view and we think, “Oh,

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:59.100
we must be kind of hateable or not important
or maybe we’re not valuable.”

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:05.110
And so we internalize the patriarchal viewpoint
and then we start hating on ourselves.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.070
So when you hate on yourself you can’t love
a sister.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:16.290
It can only happen if you take that radical
and revolutionary step of standing for your

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.800
own pleasure, which leads to self love.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.360
Because if you decide that you are important
enough to have flowers by your side one day,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.860
then that… that is an act that takes so
much courage to say, “Ok, I know I have

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.730
no time, but I’m going to that flower store
and I’m putting flowers on my desk and I

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.050
am worth that.”

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.870
And then you do that and then suddenly you
are filled with a sense of self love.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:46.640
And as soon as you’re filled with love,
like feeling that way about yourself, you

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.480
want to tell another woman about it.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.630
You want her to have flowers on her desk.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:56.410
You want her to feel the consequences of her
paying attention to her joy as a value in

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.770
this world.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:06.190
And suddenly there is that sense of connection
begins to build and my standing for my pleasure

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:11.950
makes room for you to stand for yours and
it spreads rather than spreading this virulent

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:17.570
condition of self hate woman to woman, mother
to daughter all over this planet, which is

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.540
what happens currently.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:27.470
We have the potential now to spread the virulent
condition of self love by taking a stand for

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.590
our joy as the highest possible value right
now.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.910
And what happens this is then I need you.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:40.630
And I need you not in the old needy kind of
way that women used to be like, “Oh, without

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.010
you, I can’t.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.010
I’m nothing.”

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:53.350
But rather I need you to be as blazingly beautiful,
brave, articulate, powerful, and successful

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.670
as you can possibly be.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:56.670
Why?

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.431
Because you standing in that portal opens
that portal for me.

00:21:59.431 --> 00:22:09.330
And me choosing to be hot and fabulous and
bold and blazing as I can be opens that portal

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:16.370
for you to step into an even more powerful
part of yourself so that we together hold

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:23.650
open even more of the portal for more and
more women through the discipline of pleasure

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:29.440
to take sisterhood and take women to places
that we have never been before.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.010
And that’s why I’m so excited about this
book because I feel that women are ready to

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:41.800
step into a bold new frontier of standing
bravely for themselves, for their own pleasure,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.790
and that opens the portal where no matter
where we are in this world we will see sister

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.580
when we look into each other’s eyes and
we will take this entire planet higher as

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.100
a result of that.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.610
And that’s what you do for me, lady.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.050
That’s what you do for me.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.450
And I’m so grateful for that.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.740
And you do for so many, many, many millions
of women.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.740
Thank you so much.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.970
Well, I have to say congratulations on this
book.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.690
I remember when you were writing it.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.020
I remember all the angst.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.520
Anyone who writes knows it’s not easy to
put all of your heart and all of your soul

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.630
and your ideas and your philosophies into
a book and I just want to congratulate you

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.630
because I think it’s phenomenal.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.080
And for everyone watching, again, I completely
stand behind that title.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.080
I believe in it.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.310
I think you should all read it.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.230
But thank you again for coming on, Regena.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.850
This has been fantastic.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.850
Thank you.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.220

Thank you so much for watching and I’ll

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:15.030
This woman from the very… like, back when
I was so scared to write this book, like scared.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:19.970
Like probably as scared as I’ll be in September,
she was the house that I drove 45 minutes

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.440
to to get to her house because she is such
my friend that I was like, “Marie, I think

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.100
I have to call this book Pussy but I don't
know what to do and I’m so upset about it.”

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.470
And she’s like, “Come over and I’ll
do a muscle test on you.”
