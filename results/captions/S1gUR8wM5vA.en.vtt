00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.700
Venezuela was once the richest country in
Latin America.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.809
It has the largest known oil reserves in the
world.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.660
And its democratic government was once praised
world wide.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.880
But today, Venezuela’s democratic institutions
and its economy are in shambles.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.160
The country has the highest inflation in the
world, making food and medicine inaccessible

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.160
to most Venezuelans.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.760
Over the last four years, its GDP has fallen
35%, which is a sharper drop than the one

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.500
seen during the Great Depression in the US.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.020
The country’s murder rate has surpassed
that of the most dangerous cities in the world.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.369
These conditions have sparked months of protests
against the president, Nicolas Maduro.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.670
And it’s easy to see why: the country has
become measurably worse since his election

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.909
in 2013.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.560
A poll showed that about 80% of Venezuelans
want Maduro removed from office.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.819
But instead, the opposite has happened: Maduro
has consolidated his power bringing the country

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.280
closer to authoritarian rule.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.180
Maduro’s political ambition became evident
in December 2015.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.289
Two years after he became president, a coalition
of opposition parties called the Democratic

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.209
Unity Roundtable or MUD, won a two-thirds
majority in the National Assembly, putting

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.599
Maduro’s rule at risk.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.569
In response, Maduro quickly forced out several
Supreme Court justices and filled the positions

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.390
with cronies loyal to him.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.989
In March 2016, the court ruled to strip the
opposition-led National Assembly of its powers

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.009
-- a move that sparked massive protests across
the country.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.170
The ruling was reversed a few days later,
but the damage was done -- protests continued

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.040
to grow and have left about 100 dead and thousands
injured so far.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.590
Despite the violence and public outcry, Maduro
held a vote in July to elect a new governing

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.989
body called the National Constituent Assembly,
which would have the power to rewrite Venezuela’s

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.280
constitution and replace the National Assembly. And leave virtually non opposition to Maduro's rule.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.530
With Maduro's recent vote, Venezuelans didn’t have
a say in whether the assembly should exist.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.209
They only had the option to elect its members.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.540
But when Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez
proposed a constitutional rewrite in 1999,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.819
he first called for a referendum to propose
the election of the assembly.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.080
After most Venezuelans voted yes, they elected
a new National Constituent Assembly.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.540
See, unlike Maduro, Chavez was a charismatic
and beloved leader.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.890
In the 90s, he burst onto television sets
across the country.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.220
He blamed government corruption and Venezuela’s
elite for the economic inequality.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.939
His populist message resonated with the country’s
poor who eventually helped bring him to power.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.329
The key moment in his presidency came in 2004 when oil prices surged.

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.120
Venezuela’s petroleum- dependent economy started booming and Chavez went on to spend billions from the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.810
profits on social-welfare programs for the poor.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.510
He subsidized food, improved the educational
system, built an enviable healthcare system

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.950
and reduced poverty by more than half.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.239
These programs certainly helped the poor, but they served a purpose for Chavez as well.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.510
In order to be re-elected, he needed to keep
millions of poor Venezuelans happy.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.459
So he rigged the economy to do just that...

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.880
He didn’t scale back Venezuela’s dependence
on oil and his unrestrained spending led to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.330
a growing deficit.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.260
Which meant all these programs would be impossible
to sustain if oil prices fell.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.499
After Chavez’s death, when Maduro took office
as his handpicked successor, that’s exactly

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:14.430
what happened:
Oil prices plummeted in 2014 and Maduro failed

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.529
to adjust.

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:20.530
Hyperinflation has made medicines and food,
that was once subsidized, unaffordable for

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.280
Venezuela’s poor, who now make up about
82% of the population.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.960
Like Chavez, Maduro has also rigged the economy
to keep himself in power, but this time it’s

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.889
not benefitting the poor.
He’s exploited a complex currency system,

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.270
put in place by Chavez.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.650
Maduro’s set the official exchange rate
at 10 bolivars per US dollar.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.500
But only his friends and allies have access
to this rate.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.090
In reality, the venezuelan currency has become
basically worthless.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.280
Most Venezuelans get their dollars on the
black market, where the rate is about 12,000

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.950
bolivar per dollar.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.910
The military, which got complete control of
the food supply from Maduro in 2016, is reportedly

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.050
profiting off of this currency crisis.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.831
They import food at Maduro’s special currency
rate and sell it on the black market for a

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:06.580
massive profit.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.770
So military generals and political allies,
crisis has offered a lucrative opportunity

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.760
which has helped Maduro stay in power.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.080
But he can’t rely on that support alone...

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.680
...which brings us back to Maduro’s recent
power grab.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.410
The opposition boycotted the vote, but Maduro
held the vote for the new constitutional assembly

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.140
anyway, and won a majority.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.820
"Protests on the streets of Venezuela turned deadly after President Nicolas Maduro

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.520
declares victory.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.600
The violence on Sunday very real

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.520
The bomb went off near some motorcycle police wounding several.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.680
Election day clashes between protesters claiming at least 10 more lives.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.720
At least one candidate has been murdered, shot to death.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.220
Maduro's government is trying to create the illusion of public support.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.080
Thegovernment claimed about 8 million people,
or 40% of the country, voted.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.140
But experts put that number much lower, at
just 3 million people.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.280
The international community including Peru,
Canada, Spain, Mexico and Argentina condemned

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280
the election.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.080
The US imposed financial sanctions on Maduro
and members of his government.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.930
But Maduro’s assembly, filled with loyalists,
convened anyway and it swiftly removed attorney

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.360
general Luisa Ortega, leader of the opposition.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.300
Armed groups reportedly arrested several other
opposition leaders too.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.530
Whether the group will rewrite the constitution
or postpone the next presidential election

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.530
remains to be seen.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.320
For now, Maduro has unprecedented power over
a country that continues to spiral out of

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.440
control.
