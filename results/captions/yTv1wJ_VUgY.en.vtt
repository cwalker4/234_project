00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.330
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight, a visit with
comedian Dave Chappelle, and how he's returned

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.149
in a major way this past year.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.500
Jeffrey Brown has a look at how Chappelle's
stand-up shows on Netflix are getting lots

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.310
of attention, but are also the subject of
criticism in a way that is different from

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.830
the past.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.490
JEFFREY BROWN: Ask Dave Chappelle about the
job of being a comedian, he says this:

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.050
DAVE CHAPPELLE, Comedian: I don't think people
pay money to see a guy speak precisely and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.270
carefully.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.880
I don't think they want to pay to see somebody
worried about the repercussions of what they

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.880
say.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.610
They just want to see someone try to get at
something honest, or maybe something relatable,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.970
or have some fun with something.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.110
Don't you think it's like a suspicious, just
a little bit suspicious, that every dead black

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.300
person police find has crack sprinkled on
them?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.300
I mean, come on.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.300
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.480
JEFFREY BROWN: Beginning in the mid-'90s,
in TV specials...

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.620
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Good evening, and welcome
to the first, and maybe only, racial draft

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.620
here in New York City.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.070
JEFFREY BROWN: ... and his brilliant Comedy
Central "Chappelle Show," Dave Chappelle made

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.260
a name for himself as one of the smartest
and sharpest comedians around, always unpredictable,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.390
but alive to the craziness and contradictions
of American culture, especially the way it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.390
deals with race.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.790
DAVE CHAPPELLE: For shizzle.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.230
JEFFREY BROWN: He walked away from the limelight
for nearly a decade, making only occasional

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.230
appearances.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.990
DAVE CHAPPELLE: This is the age of spin.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.590
JEFFREY BROWN: But starting last fall, he
returned in a big way, releasing four Netflix

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.850
specials, winning a Grammy for best comedy
album, and touring the country with his stand-up.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.270
We talked recently before a show at San Francisco's
historic Fillmore Auditorium.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.540
DAVE CHAPPELLE: I started really young, so
you have got to think, like, this relationship

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.862
I have with an audience is one of the most
consistent relationships that I have in my

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:55.862
life at my age.

00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:56.862
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:01:56.862 --> 00:01:57.862
Yes.

00:01:57.862 --> 00:02:02.450
DAVE CHAPPELLE: This idea of talking to people
this way and them listening, and it means

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.400
a lot for people to be able to stand up somewhere
and say, this is what I think or this is how

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.619
I feel.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.859
I'm black, but I'm also Dave Chappelle.

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:12.859
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:18.349
JEFFREY BROWN: There's still plenty of side-splitting
humor, and Chappelle's continued to push buttons,

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.739
but now many are pushing back, critical of
his jokes involving transgender people, for

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.099
example, and parts of his routine that focus
on sexual misconduct charges against prominent

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.719
men, including fellow comedian Louis C.K.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.450
DAVE CHAPPELLE: This is, like, where it's
hard to be a man.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.189
One lady said, Louis C.K. masturbated in front
of me, ruined my comedy dreams.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.189
Word.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.189
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:52.590
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Well, then I dare say, madam,
you may have never had a dream.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.590
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.980
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Come on, man.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.349
That's a brittle spirit.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.349
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.419
JEFFREY BROWN: A regular theme for Chappelle
now, that Americans today are overly sensitive

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.810
about what can and cannot be said in public.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.599
I asked if he felt that way.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.279
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Yes and no.

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:14.969
Sometimes, I think that we're painfully desensitized,
because we're bombarded by so much information.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:21.620
And then other times, I think people -- it's
just -- there's a lot to be mad at, especially

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.599
when you know so much.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.330
So I think it's a challenging time.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.620
I think that, in a time like that, I, for
one, find solace in the arts.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.449
I don't have to agree with all the art I consume,
but it helps me understand how I actually

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.500
feel about it.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.519
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you surprised, though,
by the criticism that's come your way?

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.739
DAVE CHAPPELLE: No.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.430
And I don't mind that people get upset.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.980
Some of this criticism, like, it is helpful.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.260
I get educated by it.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.810
I don't necessarily agree with all of it,
but I learn about a lot of things just from

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.810
my critics.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.200
JEFFREY BROWN: One recent special, titled
"Bird Revelation," began with Chappelle thinking

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.980
aloud about humor's boundaries.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.219
DAVE CHAPPELLE: I say a lot of mean things,
but you guys got to remember, I'm not saying

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.279
it to be mean.

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.469
I'm saying it because it's funny.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:13.469
(LAUGHTER)

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.030
DAVE CHAPPELLE: And everything's funny until
it happens to you.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.030
(LAUGHTER)

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.110
JEFFREY BROWN: If bad things happen to someone
else, that's not necessarily funny.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.620
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Look at it this way.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.110
I grew up in the crack epidemic.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.980
I tell jokes about it, growing up in the crack
epidemic.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.500
And now there's the opioid epidemic.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.879
Are they treating the opioid epidemic the
way that they treated the crack epidemic?

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.300
No, this is a national health emergency.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.830
When we were coming up, we were policed by
the National Guard, addicts were criminals.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.009
Now they're saying addicts are sick people.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:57.639
And maybe it's because the demographic of
the opioid epidemic is not the same demographic

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.639
of the crack epidemic.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.639
JEFFREY BROWN: Racially.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.639
You're talking about race.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.639
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Right.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.639
Right.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.199
So now that your community is getting destroyed,
it's then a whole other ball game.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.080
And then you have -- it's a huge window of
empathy.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.380
oh, my God, we can see each other.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.840
We both went through similar pain.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.551
But I'm just saying, everything's funny until
it happens to you is more about empathy, there

00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.000
but for the grace of God.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.142
Scary being a white dude now, isn't it?

00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:27.500
A little bit, no?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.639
Well, you're not going to get MeToo-ed.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.949
It's funny for a black dude to see white people
go through this, because this is how it always

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.349
is for us.

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.020
All my heroes is either murdered by the government
or registered sex offenders.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.020
(LAUGHTER)

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.380
JEFFREY BROWN: In the MeToo moment, does that
change the line for you of what you feel you

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.659
can say or not say?

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.009
DAVE CHAPPELLE: Honestly speaking?

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.120
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.539
DAVE CHAPPELLE: I have no idea.

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:56.539
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:57.539
DAVE CHAPPELLE: I don't know.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.889
Like, we're all figuring this out, I think,
at the same time together.

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:02.800
This is a huge collective moment.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.000
But, as a comedian, that can be a very, very
difficult thing not to talk about.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.430
As a human, it's a very difficult thing not
to feel, to be indifferent to it.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.900
Everywhere you look in America, everyone's
pushing the line in one way or another.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.430
We got this president because some people
said, we have got to push the line.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.139
And we have this movement because people are
like, we have got to push the line.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.430
And we another movement -- this is a really
busy time.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.379
I don't know what the line is.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.770
But there's a lot of change.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.189
Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me.

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:44.430
JEFFREY BROWN: Chappelle often talks of Bill
Cosby in his routines.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.629
DAVE CHAPPELLE: My God, you can't imagine.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:54.590
It'd be as if you heard that chocolate ice
cream itself had raped 54 people.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.590
(LAUGHTER)

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:03.380
DAVE CHAPPELLE: You would say to yourself,
oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.139
I don't want it to rape.

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.139
(LAUGHTER)

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.919
JEFFREY BROWN: Our conversation took place
soon after Cosby's conviction, and Chappelle

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.280
spoke of watching one of his victims outside
the court.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.139
DAVE CHAPPELLE: I remember seeing her sobbing.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:28.009
And the emotional content of her crying, I
can't -- only she knows what that meant to

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:29.009
her.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.699
But justice was meted out for this woman.

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:33.409
And it didn't look gleeful.

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.199
You know what I mean?

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:45.939
Like, it's tough to see your heroes fall,
let alone be a villain.

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:55.370
I was explaining to some of my younger family
members, like, who he was at one point, juxtaposed

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.740
to what's happened now.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.120
It's astounding.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.960
And it's sad for everybody.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:10.639
It's very, very, very, very -- it felt like,
this is important.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:16.419
JEFFREY BROWN: Dave Chappelle says that, while
he walked away from all this once, he continues

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:18.669
to enjoy getting up on stage.

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:22.310
"Sometimes," he told me, "I have things to
say."

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.009
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jeffrey Brown
at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.680
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some sobering words.
