00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.660
Islam is often presented as a very simple
religion.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.020
It’s just submission to Allah.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.520
But if you dig a little deeper, you find out
in the Qur’an (Surah 4, verse 65) that submission

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.080
to Allah requires complete obedience to all
of Muhammad’s decisions.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.520
And that’s where Islam gets a lot more complicated,
because Muhammad’s decisions are spread

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680
across thousands of stories in the Hadith.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.460
Most Christians don’t have the time, or
the sources, or the desire to go through this

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.780
material and figure out what Islam teaches.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.280
No problem.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.010
That’s what we’re here for.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.300
We’re happy to serve that role in the body
of Christ.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.600
But we should all keep in mind that there
are more than 1.6 billion Muslims in the world,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.190
and that Islam places a strong emphasis on
preaching and winning converts.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.980
Chances are, we’re not going to be there
when your Muslim friends preach Islam to you,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.340
or when your children go off to college and
hear about how wonderful Islam is, not only

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.160
from their Muslim friends, but also from their
professors.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.920
It seems, then, that Christians in general
need to know something about Islam.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.290
Rather than throw everything at you at once,
I’m going to give you three simple verses.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.790
Now I would love to see Christians around the
world learn maybe a dozen or so Qur’an verses

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.300
that I think are very important.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.920
But if I were to narrow down the list to just
three verses, these would be the three.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.380
First, Surah 4, verse 157.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.430
By the way, Surahs are basically chapters.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.380
So, Chapter 4, verse 157.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.010
This verse gives you the Islamic view of Jesus’
crucifixion.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.370
Let’s read it:

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.640
They said (in boast) [“they” here are
the Jews] ... They said (in boast), “We

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.010
killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger
of Allah”—but they killed him not, nor

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.950
crucified him, but so it was made to appear
to them, and those who differ therein are

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.020
full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge,
but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.400
they killed him not.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.360
Notice that Jesus wasn’t killed.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.460
He wasn’t even crucified.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.760
Islam denies that the crucifixion of Jesus
ever took place.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.400
But if Jesus was never crucified, why do people
believe that he died on the cross?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.459
The Islamic view is that Allah miraculously
disguised someone to make him look like Jesus.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.060
And it was this other person who was crucified,
not Jesus.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.919
The reason you believe that Jesus died, according
to Islam, is that Allah did an excellent job

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.480
tricking everyone.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.499
It’s interesting to ponder the theological
depths false prophets will go to in order

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.900
to deny what Jesus did for us.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.760
Second, Surah 5, verse 47.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.529
Muslims often claim that the Bible has been
corrupted, but there are plenty of verses

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:01.670
in the Qur’an which show that, if the Bible
has been corrupted, Allah certainly doesn’t

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.540
know anything about it.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.879
5:47 is one of these verses.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.840
In 5:47, Allah commands Christians to judge
by the Gospel.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.580
He says,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.180
Let the People of the Gospel judge by what
Allah hath revealed therein.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.819
If any do fail to judge by (the light of)
what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.440
than) those who rebel.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.520
Allah commands us to judge by the Gospel,
and he says that we’re rebels if we don’t.

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.890
Clearly, we can only judge by the Gospel if
we actually have the Gospel.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.820
So the Qur’an assumes that we have reliable
scriptures.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.519
Of course, if we obey Allah, and we judge
by the Gospel, we have to judge that Islam

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.969
is false, because Islam contradicts the Gospel.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.769
The Gospel says that Jesus died on the cross;
the Qur’an (Surah 4, verse 157) says that

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.810
he didn’t; the Qur’an tells us to judge
by the Gospel; therefore, if we listen to

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.960
the Qur’an, we have to reject the Qur’an.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.069
Third, Surah 9, verse 29.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.459
If you’ve never understood why Christians
and other religious minorities are so horribly

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.809
mistreated in places like Iraq, and Egypt,
and Pakistan, the reason for the abuse is

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.340
found in the Qur’an.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.129
Allah commands Muslims, once they are in the
majority, to violently subjugate Christians

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.129
and Jews.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.120
Allah says in 9:29:

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.040
Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the
Last Day (notice it says “fight those who

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.210
do not believe,” not “fight in self
defense”; this is a command to fight people

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.840
based on their beliefs).

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.880
Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the
Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.980
been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger,
nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth, from

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.789
among the People of the Book (the People of
the Book are Jews and Christians), until they

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.840
pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and
feel themselves subdued.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.780
Muslims are commanded to fight us until we
pay tribute to them and feel ourselves subdued.

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.289
We have to acknowledge our inferiority and
accept our status as second-class citizens

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.240
who don’t have the same rights as Muslims.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.840
This command has probably led to more oppression
than any other command in history.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.120
If you watch my videos, you might already
be familiar with these three verses.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.699
But I would encourage you to pass this video
on to your friends.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.270
Islam’s most powerful asset in the West,
with the possible exception of political correctness,

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.729
is ignorance.

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.520
If people don’t know anything about Islam,
Muslim preachers, along with groups like CAIR

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.000
and ISNA, can say pretty much whatever they
want to say about Islam, and no one will know

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.639
any better.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.229
But if certain facts about Islam become common
knowledge, our discussions with our Muslim

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.200
friends will be much more productive.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.729
So, pass this video on, and if you’d like
