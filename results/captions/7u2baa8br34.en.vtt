00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.319
There's always a big flurry of interest
when a new spacecraft is launched like

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.599
the SpaceX Falcon 9 and the Dragon Crew
capsule a few days back but as they say

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.280
today's news is tomorrow's chip wrapper
so what happens to all the old

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.680
spacecraft, do they just hang around up
there in space and does the old adage of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.230
what goes up must come down still apply.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.690
We've been putting spacecraft into orbit
and beyond since the 4th of October

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.879
1957 with the launch of Sputnik
so far we've launched over 6500 but that

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.710
figure is debatable because it depends
on how we count them was Apollo 11 one

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.780
spacecraft two or even three but
whichever way we look at it that's still

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.250
an awful lot of things we've put into
space. The vast majority of these are

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.929
satellites for communications
meteorology and remote sensing the life

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:10.899
of a satellite can range from a few days
to decades and really depends upon where

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.670
they are placed and how long they can
maintain their orbit and age doesn't

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.440
necessarily mean that much when it comes
to this aspect. Sputnik only stayed

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.659
operation for 22 days and in orbit for
three months. America's first satellite

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.289
launched just after Sputnik Explorer 1
stayed in orbit for over 12 years but a

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.329
record for the oldest piece of space
hardware still in space goes to the

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:44.369
USA's second satellite Vanguard 1
launched on March 17th 1958 this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.600
grapefruit-sized satellite is still in
orbit along with its launcher. It was

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.680
the first used solar cells which enabled
it to transmit signals from Earth for seven

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.930
years although it is now
long dead it isn't expected to return to

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.679
Earth until 2198
if that remains true it will be a 240

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.440
year long orbital lifetime. The reason
why Sputnik came down after just three

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.570
months and Vanguard is expected to stay
there for 240 years his due to the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.690
distance of their orbit from Earth
Sputnik was 225 kilometers above the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.370
earth at its lowest orbital point or
perigee and his apogee or the farthest

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.519
point was 939 kilometers but that was
still 500 kilometers lower than where it

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.440
should have been. Vanguard on the other
hand has a perigee of 657 km

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.560
and an Apogee of
3840 kilometers. The father away from you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.900
Earth's atmosphere
the longer a satellite can stay in orbit.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.230
Even the ISS is close enough of 403
kilometers to encounter some small

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.069
amount of drag from the upper atmosphere
and if it weren't for a regular

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.080
repositioning it too would end up
crashing back to earth. This will be the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.130
ultimate fate for almost everything
that's orbiting the earth up to a few

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.620
thousand kilometers. Now the surface of
the earth is a very large area and even

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.310
the biggest satellites like the ISS
which is the size of a football field

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.220
are very small in comparison and during
reentry most of those satellites will

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.650
end up burning up in the atmosphere and
ending up as ash and dust but that still

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.540
leaves the biggest densest parts to fall
back to earth and possibly onto

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.660
populated areas. So to avoid this an area
in the South Pacific is designated as

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.930
this spacecraft cemetery the area which
is also known as "Point Nemo" or the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.049
Oceanic Point of Inaccessibility and is the
farthest point from any land and located

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.260
between Easter Island, Pitcairn Island
and Antarctica. Over 265 spacecraft are

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.700
somewhere in this patch of sea including
the International Space Station's

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.709
predecessor Mir and six other salyut
space stations as well as numerous

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.620
transfer and cargo craft used to
resupply the ISS. When it comes to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.109
finally decommission the ISS itself
what's left of it will end up there too.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.630
But this won't be the fate for the
highest satellites in geosynchronous in

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.840
geostationary orbits that's things like
communications and meteorological

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.610
satellites that stay over one place and
orbit some 35,786 kilometres above

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.979
the earth. There they are too far away to
be affected by the atmosphere instead

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.880
their orbits are influenced by the
gravitational effects of the Earth Moon

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.190
and Sun and even by the solar wind and
radiation pressure. The life of these

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.080
satellites is not determined by their
electronic lifetime but by how much

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.620
propellant they can carry to power the
small thrusters used

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.540
to keep them in their allocated
positions. Once that fuel runs out their

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.520
service life has come to an end even if
they are still working perfectly OK

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.120
otherwise.
Now just as spacecraft that come back to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.830
earth are directed to the spacecraft
Cemetery in the Pacific there is a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.840
corresponding place in space where the
satellites were just too high to be

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.910
brought back to earth safely can be
effectively dumped out of a way of other

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.240
functional craft. This is known as the
graveyard orbit and is about 300

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.710
kilometres higher than the
geosynchronous one. Just before they run

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.540
out of fuel they should be boosted to
this higher orbit, now I say should

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.240
because not all of them have been moved
though since 2002 anyone wanting a

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.520
license to operate telecommunication
services in the US as to commit to

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.060
moving their satellite to the graveyard
orbit at the end of its service lifetime.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.900
Once there they will stay out of the way
of a functional satellites below. In

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.760
theory they could stay there for
millions of years but in reality they

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.710
will be affected by gravitational forces
and even the solar wind so they may well

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.780
become a problem at some point in the
future but not for the next few thousand

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.220
years or so. Some satellites pose more of
a problem than others when they come

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.300
back those are ones which used nuclear
reactors to power their electrical

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.450
supply systems. The Soviet Union put 33
small reactor powered radar ocean

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.300
reconnaissance satellites into orbit
between 1967 and 1988. Although most of

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.830
them have ejected their radioactive
cores into higher orbit, four have

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.820
through various failures come back to
earth and spread radioactive material

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.970
over Canada's Northwest Territories, the
Northern Pacific and the South Atlantic.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.400
Only one U.S. craft were SNAP-10A
 launched in 1965 used a fission

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.870
reactor as a test but due to an
electronic failure unrelated to the

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.680
nuclear reactor it shut down after just
42 days. Since then it's been in a 1,300

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.860
kilometre orbit above the
but in 1979 it started shedding at least

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.860
50 large traceable pieces, maybe after a
collision with other space debris though

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.640
it's 1300 kilometer orbit
should keep it away from Earth for about

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.680
the next 4,000 years or so. Of course
there are some spacecraft that have

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.140
ended up much farther away and like the
earth are now in a heliocentric orbit

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.300
around the Sun including solar
observatories like Soho and others which

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.890
have ended up there by accident. Once in
orbit around the Sun they are like any

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.120
other small asteroid, they will stay
there until they either collide with

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.380
something else or they are affected by
the gravity of a larger body or planet.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.270
Over millions of years the charged
particles from the solar radiation will

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.110
gradually break down much of their
structure until they break up into

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:08.650
smaller and smaller pieces. In 1959
Pioneer 4 did  a lunar flyby passing

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:14.170
60,000 kilometers from the moon before
entering an heliocentric orbit and it was

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:22.570
still there as of 1969. The S-IVB third
stages of Apollo 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 have

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:28.180
all ended up in orbit around the Sun as
well as the Apollo 10 ascent stage also

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.690
known as Snoopy, the only once manned
spacecraft still to be in space. Many

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.280
others were lost on route to locations
like the moon Mars and Venus including

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.890
Ranger 3 and Ranger 5, Luna 1, Venera 1, Mars 1, Zond 2, Mars 4, Mars 7,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.940
Phobos 1, Mars Observer, Nozomi, Minvera mini lander and SHIN-EN.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.500
For some a very small corner of a
foreign planet will be forever Earth,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.390
these are the probes and Landers
primarily sent to Mars but also to Venus

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:07.180
Saturn's moon Titan and to a couple of
asteroids. As for the Martian Lander

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.580
38 attempts have been made but only 19
of succeeded but for some of those they

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.920
have lasted much longer than expected.
The Mars rover Opportunity has recently

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.629
been pronounced dead
fifteen years after it landed, it lost

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:27.699
contact with earth after being hit by a
large Martian dust storm. The 15 year

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:32.559
lifespan is all more amazing as it was
only ever built to last for three months.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:38.559
Its twin the Spirit rover lasted over
six years before being stuck in a sand

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:43.119
trap which limited its ability to
recharge its battery and led to his

00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:50.170
eventual demise in 2007. The Curiosity
rover landed in 2012 and was expected to

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.699
last for two years but has been active
now for 6-1/2  years and its

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:59.350
mission has now been extended
indefinitely effectively until it ceases

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:05.230
to function which could be many years
from now barring an unexpected event. But

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.730
the longest-lived craft are those which
we have sent to the farthest planets and

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.360
beyond. Currently there are five such spacecraft

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.259
pioneer 10 and 11 Voyager 1 and 2 and
New Horizons. There are also some of the

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:24.759
third stages of the launch vehicles and
De-spin weights which were attached to

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:29.589
the probes that were generally traveling
in the same direction as the probes

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:36.069
themselves. In deep space the sun's power
is too weak for solar cells so all of

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:41.170
these use radioisotope thermoelectric
generators basically the heat from a

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.949
radioactive source is turned into
electrical power for the spacecraft's

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:48.759
electrical systems and depending upon
the half-life of a radioactive material

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:53.199
these can last for decades.
Eventually though the power from the

00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:57.429
radioactive source and the degeneration
of the bimetallic thermocouples which

00:10:57.429 --> 00:11:01.689
convert the heat into electrical power
will drop to a point where they can no

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:06.429
longer power the craft but it's a
testament to the quality of these

00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:12.819
spacecraft and the electronic components
inside made in the 1970s with 1960s

00:11:12.819 --> 00:11:17.259
designs in some cases that they are
still working in the harsh conditions of

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:24.189
deep space over four decades later.
Pioneer 10 launched in 1972 and stopped

00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:29.980
transmitting due to a lack of power in
2003, it's currently about 18.1

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.870
billion kilometers from Earth and
in 12 kilometers a second in the general

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:40.650
direction of the star Aldebaran 68
light-years away. Pioneer 11 launched in

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:47.620
1973 and in 1995 due to a lack of power
it was shut down and its antenna moved

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:53.200
away from direction of Earth cutting any
further communications. It's now about 15

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.010
billion kilometers from Earth traveling
at 11.2 kilometers per

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.590
second and heading in the direction of
the constellation of Scutum.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.510
Voyager 1 launched in 1977 and is still
in contact with earth and expected to

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.700
carry on until the mid 2020s when it's
nuclear generators won't have enough

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.720
power to keep it running. It was the
first man-made object to reach

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:22.780
interstellar space in August 2012 and is
currently 21.6 billion kilometers from

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:28.420
Earth traveling at 16.9 kilometers per
second and heading towards a star called

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:37.750
AC 79 388 some 17.6 light-years
away. Voyager 2 launched in 1977, 16 days

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.950
before Voyager 1 but was on a slower
trajectory to Jupiter and Saturn and

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.450
then on to Uranus and Neptune. It's
expected to continue working until the

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:52.750
mid 2020s it - like Voyager 1 entered
interstellar space in November 2018 and

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.940
is currently 18 billion kilometers from
Earth traveling at 15.3

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.390
kilometres per second and heading
roughly in the direction of the star

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:07.200
Sirius 8.6 light-years away. And then
there's New Horizons launched in January

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.640
2006 the newest and fastest of these
far-flung Wanderers, though Voyager 1 is

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.780
still faster due to be gravitational
assist it gained from Jupiter and then

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.670
Saturn it's currently 6.8 billion
kilometers from Earth and traveling at

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.290
about 16.2 kilometers per second
providing nothing happens to it New

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.900
Horizons should reach interstellar space
by 2038 which is also the estimated life

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.090
of
nuclear power pack. All of these five

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:41.490
spacecraft barring any collision or
recovery by us or other intelligent life

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.170
at some point in the future will
continue out into our galaxy and

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:51.030
although they will be long dead they
could quite reasonably be expected to

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:57.360
outlive the human race and even the
earth itself not bad for a piece of late

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.580
20th century space hardware. So what do
you think of the old spacecraft still

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.440
floating around out there somewhere let
