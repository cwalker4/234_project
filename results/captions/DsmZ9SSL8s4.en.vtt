00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.819

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.539
OF JEREMY TAYLOR AND HIS DOG,
ALLY, WHO GOT STRANDED IN THE

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.542
SNOW IN HIS CAR FOR FIVE DAYS
AND SOMEHOW SURVIVED ON NOTHING

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.178 size:88% position:44%
BUT TACO BELL SAUCE PACKETS.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.781 align:start position:0%
WELL, IT WAS ALL WORTH IT,
BECAUSE "TACO BELL IS REWARDING

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:31.150
HIM WITH A YEAR OF FREE FOOD."

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:37.690 align:start position:0%
<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
SO NOW HE'S DEFINITELY GOING

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
TO DIE.

RACING!

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.916
THE IDITAROD, OF COURSE, IS AN
ALASKAN DOG-SLEDDING RACE OVER

1,000 MILES LONG.

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:11.591 align:start position:0%
52 TEAMS COMPETE TO SEE "WHO'S A
GOOD BOY?

OR A GOOD GIRL?

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.461
BECAUSE IN DOGSLEDDING, WOMEN
AND MEN COMPETE SIDE BY SIDE,

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:16.495 align:start position:0%
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start position:0%
NO, THERE ISN'T!"
THIS YEAR, THERE WAS SOME EXTRA

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.933
EXCITEMENT BECAUSE A STRAY DOG
JUMPED IN TO JOIN THE 2019 SLED

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.904 align:start position:0%
RACE.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start position:0%
THAT IS FLAGRANT DISREGARD OF
THE IDITAROD QUALIFIERS.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.779 align:start position:0%
DID THIS DOG EVEN PLACE IN THE

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.024 align:start position:0%
I DO NOT THINK SO-- OR KNOW WHAT
I JUST SAID.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
IT ALL STARTED WHEN "TWO RACERS
CAME UP TO THE FINGER LAKE

CHECKPOINT, WHERE THE DOG
LIVES," AND "HE DECIDED TO JUMP

RIGHT IN, RUNNING 30 MILES
OVERNIGHT."

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.669
TELL THAT TO YOUR DOG NEXT TIME
SHE PLOPS DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:03:56.702 --> 00:03:58.371 size:81% position:41%
HER WALK AROUND THE BLOCK.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.940 align:start position:0%
"GET UP!

YOU SLEEP ALL DAY ANYWAY!"
MEANWHILE, IN INVERTEBRATE ASS

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.486
NEWS, SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED
"A JELLYFISH-LIKE CREATURE WHOSE

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.825 align:start position:0%

<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
HEY, MOOCH!

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:38.177 align:start position:0%
THE SCIENTIST WHO DISCOVERED THE
JELLYFISH WAS AMAZED BY THIS

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.613
VAMOOSING CABOOSE, SAYING, "IT
IS NOT VISIBLE WHEN THE ANIMAL

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.381 align:start position:0%
IS NOT POOPING."

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:44.850 align:start position:0%
HE WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED IT
SOONER, BUT THE JELLYFISH SAID

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:48.020 align:start position:0%
IT'S REALLY HARD TO GO WHEN YOU
KNOW SOMEBODY'S WATCHING.

<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
THE EPHEMERAL EVACUATION HOLE

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.327 align:start position:0%
HAS A NAME, TOO.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:03.302
SCIENTISTS CALL IT "TRANSIENT
ANUS," WHICH MY RESEARCHER

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:07.039
HERER INSISTS IS THE ONLY REASON
WHY "TRANSIENT ANUS" SHOWS UP IN
