00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.855 align:start position:0%
IT'S JUST SALLY FIELD.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.456

THERE THAT SAME NIGHT.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.098 size:88% position:44%
WE HAD MET DURING THE TONY
AWARDS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:42.335
BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH NOMINATED
SO WE WERE AT THE SAME LUNCHEONS

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.202 align:start position:0%
AND THINGS.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.171 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE YOU AND SALLY

&gt;&gt; WE'RE PRETTY TIGHT.

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.415 size:75% position:38%
I GOT THAT PHONE NUMBER.

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:58.451 align:start position:0%

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.188 align:start position:0%
STEPHEN, WHAT DO YOU --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: RELATIONSHIP IS

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.190 align:start position:0%
GETTING SERIOUS NOW.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:08.094
YOU'VE GOT-- THIS IS EXCITING.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.328 align:start position:0%
UNEXPECTED.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.498
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL,
BUT THE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.567 align:start position:0%
I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO WRITE
A BOOK.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start position:0%
AND I WROTE IT!

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:19.272 size:84% position:42%
<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.676
THE AD CAMPAIGN FOR THE BOOK,
ISN'T IT:  "I SAID I WOULD DO

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.677 align:start position:0%
IT, AND I DID IT!"
&gt;&gt; I DID IT.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.548 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S CALLED "TOO
MUCH IS NOT ENOUGH."

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:32.151 align:start position:0%
A MEMOIR OF FUMBLING TOWARD
ADULTHOOD.

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:32.985 size:78% position:39%
YOU'RE STILL A YOUNG MAN.

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.086 align:start position:0%
WHY A MEMOIR?

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:38.257 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT, THIS
IS-- THESE ARE ESSAYS

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.759
SPECIFICALLY FROM MY CHILDHOOD.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.196 align:start position:0%
AND I MOVED TO NEW YORK IN 1997
AND I WAS CAST IN MY FIRST

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.666 align:start position:0%
BROADWAY SHOW, WHICH WAS
"HAIRSPRAY" IN 2005.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.234 align:start position:0%
SO I JUST DEAL WITH THAT PERIOD
OF TIME.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:52.071 align:start position:0%
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: PREFAMOUS.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.506 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; PREFAMOUS, SURE.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.944 align:start position:0%
BUT THAT WAS MY GOAL WAS TO BE
ON BROADWAY, RIGHT?

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.112 size:88% position:44%
THAT WAS MY NUMBER ONE GOAL.

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:04.317 align:start position:0%
I STOPPED THE BOOK AT THAT
POINT, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS CAST

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.355 size:84% position:42%
IN "HAIRSPRAY" AND WAS ON
BROADWAY, THAT'S ALL I EVER

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:10.356 align:start position:0%
DREAMED OF.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.591 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY DID YOU WRITE
A BOOK ABOUT THAT?

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:15.061
&gt;&gt; I FEEL THOSE ARE OFTEN THE
YEARS THAT ARE SKIPPED OVER.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:18.064
YOUR CAREER-- A LOT OF PEOPLE
THINK I WAS HATCHED OUT OF AN

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.733
EGG DURING "THE BOOK OF MORMON."

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:25.938 align:start position:0%
I WAS LIKE, I WAS KICKING AROUND
FOR A HFL A LONG TIME.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:27.773
AND THAT ALL GETS SKIPPED OVER.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:30.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE
SUFFERING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:31.978 size:84% position:42%
SUFFER AS AN ARTIST, RIGHT?

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.112 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SO MUCH SUFFERING.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.313 size:81% position:41%
THAT'S A LOT OF SUFFERING.

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:35.414 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: UH-HUH.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.883 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AND YOUR EARLY --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU DO THE

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:38.985 align:start position:0%
CLASSIC STUFF?

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.052 align:start position:0%
DID YOU WAIT TABLES?

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.488 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, I WAS TERRIBLE AT DAY
JOBS.

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.791 align:start position:0%
I WOULD WORK AT, LIKE, ONE PLACE
FOR A NIGHT.

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:46.592 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER ).</i>

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:47.126 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S NOT A GOOD
SIGN.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.327 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.097
I WORKED AT A RESTAURANT-- I
LIVED WITH MY BEST FRIEND UP BY

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.234 align:start position:0%
COLUMBIA, AND THERE'S A
RESTAURANT CALLED "NACHO MAMAS,"

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.837
AND I WORKED THERE FOR ONE DAY.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.108
I WENT, AND I TRAINED, AND THEY
WERE LIKE, "OH, HE'S GOING TO BE

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:02.942 align:start position:0%
FINE."

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:04.277 align:start position:0%
LIKE, I COULD BE A HOST, THAT'S
FINE.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.912
AND THEN I JUST NEVER WENT BACK.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:07.446 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER ).</i>

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.513 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT.

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:09.548 align:start position:0%
YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR-- YOU HAVE
BROTHERS AND SISTERS?

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.084 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:12.351 align:start position:0%
NO.

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.118 align:start position:0%
YES.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.787 align:start position:0%
I HAVE THREE SISTERS AND A
BROTHER.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.890 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE THEY OKAY WITH
YOU TELLING, LIKE, INTIMATE

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:19.258 align:start position:0%

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:20.326 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL?

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.227 align:start position:0%
ARE THEY OKAY?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.628 size:75% position:38%
NO, THEY ALL INTERESTED.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.463 align:start position:0%
THEY ALL READ IT.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:25.697 align:start position:0%
I THINK THEY'RE OKAY.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:28.467 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO MAKE A VERY
CONSCIOUS EFFORT WRITING THIS

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.306 align:start position:0%
THAT I WASN'T GOING TO TELL
ANYONE ELSE'S STORY.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.976 align:start position:0%
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE THE RANLES
FAMILY SPOKESPERSON.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.013 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO IS THE RANNELS
FAMILY SPOKESPERSON?

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.682 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MY MOM.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:43.750 align:start position:0%
CHARLOTTE.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.084 align:start position:0%
SO I TRIED TO KEEP IT AS
PERSONAL AS POSSIBLE, RATHER

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
THAN, LIKE, SPEAKING ON BEHALF
OF MY FAMILY.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.989 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE THEN IT GETS TRICK GLE
SURE.

&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:53.826 align:start position:0%

AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THEY

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.127 align:start position:0%
DON'T MIND BEING TOLD.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.464
&gt;&gt; WELL, I TALK ABOUT HAVING A
LOT OF SEX AND STUFF SO I DON'T

00:04:58.497 --> 00:04:59.832 align:start position:0%
THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
THAT.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:00.866 align:start position:0%
NOW THEY KNOW!

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.069

HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE BARN.
