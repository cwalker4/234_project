00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
It's quiet.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.520
The battle has died down for a moment and the men are relaxing in the trenches as much as they are able to.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.880
The captain walks over to you with a smile on his face and begins to tell you a funny story when he suddenly pauses.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.220
His face goes blank, and he crumples dead to the ground.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.600
Shot in the head by an enemy sniper.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.180
I'm Indy Neidell. Welcome to a great war special episode about snipers during the first world war.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.380
By the fall of 1914 the war of motion on the Western Front had degenerated into stalemate.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.500
And the individual battles could last for months.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.060
There were hours and even days of lulls between the surges and counter surges.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.980
And a main feature of these lulls was the single man silently observing the enemy trenches with his rifle.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Germany, Austria-Hungary and France went to war in July 1914 with JÃ¤ger or Chasseur units,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.960
light infantry with a long tradition of woodland combat who were skilled in camouflage, observation and patience.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:25.080
Russia and Britain on the other hand entered the war without doctrines for individual marksmanship and sharpshooters and without telescopic sights for their rifles.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160
And this soon was a big issue.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.580
The German Army issued a lot of commercial hunting rifles made by Walther and Mauser to the infantry in 1914.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.640
They were not of a high military standard and had an effective accuracy of only 300 meters (900 feet).

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.000
But they worked well enough for the moment, especially here the trenches were very close to each other.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.140
By the end of the year though, they had supplied over 15,000 Gewehr 98 rifles with telescopic sights and a range of a kilometer.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.420
3,000 feet. Well a little bit more but you could do the math yourselves.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.940
These were issued to the best marksmen of a battalion, who was often someone who had been a forest guard, hunter or policeman in civilian life.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.920
These men most often sniped alone, although they were allowed to work in pairs.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.820
They had no fixed location and could even go into no-man's land.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:26.260
Their sights and binoculars, made by world masters like Zeiss, Goerz, or Hensoldt, gave them a significant advantage over the British in trench warfare,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.020
who had pretty much none of these weapons at this time.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.720
On one day, in one trench segment early in 1915, the British lost 18 men to German Sniper fire.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.140
A single sniper could easily score 40 or more kills before he was dealt with.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.340
"Being dealt with" at that time usually meant shelling the area with field guns since there was no real counter sniping ability.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580
It wasn't just on the western front either.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.760
At Gallipoli, Turkish snipers though not often equipped with telescopic sights, were masters of camouflage,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.580
and shot from behind bushes, tall grass, or rock formations,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.900
making life hell, and inflicting heavy casualties on the ANZACs on the beaches and lower slopes below.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.460
The ANZACs for their part had an immensely gifted Sniper there in the person of Billy Sing a Chinese Australian marksman, nicknamed the Assassin.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.440
His official kill tally there was 150, but there are estimates as high as 300 men killed.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.220
One of the first British officers who determined to improve British sharp shooting was Major Hesketh Prichard of British intelligence.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:42.980
He was a big-game hunter and not only brought his own telescopic hunting rifles to the frontlines, but bought many others to outfit the troops.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.500
But you know, just giving a soldier a rifle with a telescope and saying use this was a death sentence.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.420
Amateurs were very quickly killed by the enemy.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.460
They had no training in camouflage and soon gave their positions away.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.840
Or just put their rifles over the top of the parapets exposing themselves to German snipers.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.220
Those German snipers by 1915 had a complex system of cover.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.480
They made their parapet deliberately uneven using sandbags and debris.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.040
They built metal shields with holes in them for firing through.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.360
They covered each other's flanks. They built concrete sniping posts.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.080
Hesketh Prichard would have to educate the British if they were to have any chance of competing.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.000
With the help of colonel Langford Lloyd, e established the first army sniping school and began taking recommended volunteers.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760
There he taught the essentials of sniping.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.880
One: before even thinking about shooting you must know your rifle far better than basic training taught.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.520
You couldn't just screw on a telescope and think you'll hit anything either.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.080
Sights were very sensitive and must be adjusted and corrected regularly.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.800
The focusing sleeve and object glass must be kept clean.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.640
And after six or seven hundred shots the wear on the rifle ruined accuracy

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:10.200
Also, German snipers kept their rifles; the British had to give theirs to an NCO after their shift. That had to go.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.080
Two: British Snipers would work in teams of two: one with a rifle and one with binoculars.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.640
In the trenches, speed was the key since a target only showed himself briefly.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:30.560
One bit of training was to have the man look through binocular for 15 seconds and then write down everything he could remember.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.320
You want to know how important this was?

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.800
Captured German snipers said they could identify British officers because they had skinnier legs than the enlisted men.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.840
"There are hundreds and hundreds of our officers lying dead in France whose death was solely due to the cut of their riding breeches."

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.720
The observers work was of immense value in the trenches.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.280
Three: they learned the basics of camouflaging themselves and their rifles.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.600
Rifles could be wrapped in sandbags and lenses shaded from reflection for example.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.720
Sniper lairs were effective, but once spotted they were huge targets.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:17.040
Four: the shooting itself. You could not call yourself a sniper unless you could get off a shot within two seconds of sighting the target.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.080
Even a rookie wouldn't stick up his head from more than that long.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.920
Judging the wind or the distance was not only difficult it was vital to success.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.840
And the smallest alteration to the ballistic could ruin the shot.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.280
On offense the sniper's job was to target enemy machine gunners or forward artillery observers.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.480
And when a trench was captured he was to pin the enemy into the next trench to deter counter-attacks

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.080
Hesketh Prichard was proud of his work and even wrote in his book Sniping in France:

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:57.540
"It was exactly as if a party of really capable sportsmen were shooting an area for big game, or better still, Scottish forest deer.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.060
Imagine these sportsmen replaced by careless and ignorant tourists.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:11.440
The ground would inevitably be maltreated. the wrong beasts shot, corries shot when the wind was unfavorable all the deer stampeded into the next forest.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.960
Of course in this case the deer did not stampede, but... shot back."

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.320
By mid nineteen sixteen, the British sniper was as skilled and experienced as his German counterpart.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.080
And German snipers consequently became more careful and shied away from what had earlier been without risk.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.740
Both sides now used lures and decoy dummy heads to pinpoint enemy sniper positions, and then take him out.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.460
The British even used elephant guns to shoot through the German metal sniper shields.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.680
It was a very dangerous game.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.880
If you're wondering, the sniper with the most kills in the war on all sides was the first nation soldier Francis Pegahmagabow who fought for Canada.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.480
He had 378 confirmed kills and captured over 300 more men during the war.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.840
I'm sure you noticed that most of the talk today was about British sniping development.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.380
The French and Germans had similar schools, but they're not so well documented and as to the Russians I got nothing.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:22.260
Other nations had their own doctrines, but material is either unavailable or in languages we do not understand, which is unfortunate, but that's how it is.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:28.480
If you know more about sniping on the Italian Front, for example, get in touch with Flo, our social media manager.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.100
Today was just a brief introduction to the world of the modern sniper,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:40.660
whose talent and patience have been vital to the conduct not only of this war, but pretty much all of them ever since.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.300
