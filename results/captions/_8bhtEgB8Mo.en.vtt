00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
JENNIFER: Thank you so much. I am going to open by saying that, I am a huge, huge fan of physics history;

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.600
I am well-aquainted with this famous room, and I am completely intimidated and unworthy.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.700
But we are all here for the same reason; because we love science, and I am especially honoured that

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.300
I get to give the first joint talk with my own husband, Sean Carroll.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.300
This is the kind of thing we talk about at home, and it's the first time that we've actually both talked about this topic.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.800
So, you are kind of in for a first.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.300
Ultimately, this is a story about Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob, for those of you who don't know,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.720
are kind of fixtures when it comes to thought experiments, particularly those involving information theory,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.440
cartography, and especially quantum information in cartography.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.800
It just seems a little more fun to play around with the ideas of these actual two characters, Bob and Alice,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.040
and the different adventures that they get into.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.300
The subject tonight, Black hole Firewalls, is another kind of thought experiment that physicists started to play around with,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.260
around the questions of what happens when that daredevil Alice, who the the more risk taking of the two,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.060
jumps into a black hole.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.120
You know, Bob kind of stays behind.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.100
Now, there's been a traditional way of thinking about this, sort of standard textbook, popular science, physics stuff for decades,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.440
that we thought we knew pretty well what happened,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.400
that she would be ripped to shreds by the power of gravity at the singularity,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.440
that point of infinite density at the black hole centre.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.000
But when the physicists started playing around, in the summer of 2012,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.080
with some of the big ideas of one of the other thought experiments that deals with information laws,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.200
they actually discovered a paradox. They discovered that it was possible that instead of being ripped to shreds by gravity,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.840
Alice might be burnt up alive in this enormous wall of radiation just in the event horizon. She never even gets the chance to be ripped apart to shreds.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
So this talk is about that. And we are going to start off easy and slow,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.960
but it's going to get mind-bending towards the end.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.780
The good news is, you have Sean Carroll doing the really mind-bending stuff and he is a tremendous communicator.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.500
So, a paradox, for those of you who want a definition: "a statement that apparently contradicts itself and yet might be true. "

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.700
In physics, they are quite commonly used; this is a maybe not that specific definition. It is more that they are revealed by though experiments,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.780
and they are used to eliminate certain counter-intuitive truths, to reveal flaws in the assumptions or in the logic behind some of the reasoning in physics.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.500
So there is a long tradition in this, and it goes all the way back to the Zeno's paradoxes, including Archilles and the tortoise,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.000
how the fleet Archilles can give the tortoise a head start, and although Archilles can run so much faster he never quite catches up.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.500
It became a foundation of calculus, figuring out what the limit was in calculus.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.000
Maxwell's daemon was used to illuminate thoughts on entropy and thermodynamics.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.660
In special relativity, Einstein came up with a Twin paradox: what happens when one twin stays behind on earth,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.400
and the other twin zips off into space, at speed of light. When that twin comes back, he will be much younger than the twin he left behind.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.000
That is a paradox, and it illuminates certain factors of special relativity.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.280
Tonight, we are going to focus on a lot of the quantum mechanical paradoxes. Sean will be telling you about the Schrodinger's cat paradox.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.400
He will be mentioning Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Central to this entire thing, is the Black hole information paradox.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.100
It is in fact, the thing out of which Black hole firewalls came.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.020
But first, a little bit on the history of Black holes. I'd like to do this because, as I said, I love physics history.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.400
And I also love this guy, John Michell.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.740
He was basically an English rector in the 18th century. Common descriptions of him at that time basically stated that

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.760
he was "short swarthy and fat".

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.100
But he was known as a brilliant thinker, and in fact, he was far more brilliant than his contemporaries realised,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.440
because he was literally 150 years ahead of his time.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.260
He was trying to figure out, one day, how you could calculate the mass of a star.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.120
And he came up with this method, you know, thinking that he could basically measure the reduction of the speed of light that was being emitted by it.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.620
And his thinking was very Newtonian. Remember, at this point in time, the debate over whether light was a particle, a wave was still going on.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.420
He very much described, in Newton's notion that, light was a particle, or a "core puzzle", as I think Newton called them.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.600
So he thought that gravity would slow down the light, and he could basically measure how much the light was slowing down;

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.280
he could use that to calculate the mass, through a series of calculation.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.980
He also had another insight: when he actually started doing the maths, he realised that at some some point,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.580
gravity would become so strong that the escape velocity would exceed the speed of light.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:10.300
The escape velocity is what happens ---- say when you fire a cannon, and it was a famous thought experiment by Newton to describe gravity - how objects orbit.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.980
They are basically in free fall, if you escape the earth's atmosphere, you'd go into near-earth orbit.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.840
An object, a space station, satellite are just constantly in free fall around the earth.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.660
But you need to be able to get beyond that; you'd need to be able to escape that part.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.820
So what happens if light can't escape? Then we wouldn't even be able to see the star.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.760
So he called it a "dark star", and he also had another key insight:

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.386
he thought: well maybe you couldn't see it directly, but it might have a twin star near it that was bright,

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:45.240
and you could look at that star, and kind of figure out that there was a dark star next to it.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:54.040
He was actually wrong about how to calculate the mass of a star, because as we now know, the speed of light is constant, that's thanks to Einstein.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.300
so there is no way you could have used that to calculate the mass of a star.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.020
But he was absolutely right about dark stars.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.580
Unfortunately, he dies in complete obscurity; nobody took him seriously - they thought he was crazy.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.880
This was so ahead of anything anyone had ever thought about, that they thought there's no way that he could possibly be right.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.000
He was not the only one, however. Pierre Simon LaPlace actually came to a similar conclusion a few years later,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.240
and he talked about it in his book: Exposition du Systeme du Monde, where he basically concluded that it is possible

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.760
that "the greatest luminous bodies in the universe are " on this account "invisible".

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.840
And again, he also was right.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.100
So it would basically take another 100 years, or over 100 years before we finally had Albert Einstein

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.400
re-envisioning space-time.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:51.440
Remember, in Newtonian days, they thought of space as three-dimensional, Euclidean geometry space,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.600
and it was static; it didn't move.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.600
Einstein kind of re-envisioned it.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.920
There were three dimensions of space, and the fourth of time, and they combine to give you space-time.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.840
It became dynamic.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.740
It could twist and warp, and the things that did the warping and twisting were the massive objects in space.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.190
And that is where gravity comes from. Gravity is less a force and more say,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.120
objects and light following the curvature of space.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.820
It was revolutionary; I don't think I need to tell any of you that.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:26.100
It changed everything, and among the lives it changed was a physicist named Karl Schwarzschild.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:34.240
At the age of forty, he enlisted to fight in World War One, even though he was much older than some of the men out there.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.500
And it was, as you might imagine, a dreadful time in the trenches, dodging bullets, bombs, bayonets, and the whole bit.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.440
And one of the ways that he escaped the horror of the war was to do physics.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:53.380
He came upon Einstein's theory of general relativity, general theory of relativity.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.000
And he became fascinated. In his spare time, he actually started working with some of the equations.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.200
He was basically trying to do something similar to what Newton did.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.720
Newton would measure the distance between the centre of mass of an object and another point in space.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.960
and as you got closer and closer, eventually you would get down to a point.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.220
Schwarzschild was trying to calculate the curvature of space. He hit a roadblock too, but it was well below zero.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.920
He basically hit a point where the equation just blew up.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.660
Nobody knew why. They didn't know what that point was.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.100
Today I think we would call it the event horizon of a black hole.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.260
What we think now is that there might be something beyond that point,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.660
even though the equations stop at that point.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.760
The good news is, John Wheeler dubbed these objects "Blacks holes" in 1968,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.180
and shortly after that, we found compelling evidence that in fact, they do exist.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.740
The first object that they discovered that could be a candidate black hole, was this X-ray binary star Cygnus X-1.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.180
They found it, or they determined it in 1971, that there was no way it could be a neutron star.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.420
It was far too dense, and it was probably going to be a Black hole.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.240
And we know it was a binary star system, so Michell was absolutely right.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.640
They could tell the Black hole was there based on its companion star and its behaviours.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:20.180
This lovely animation here is based on actual data Sean found on the internet, a beautiful place, the internet.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.280
This is the black hole, at the centre of our Milky Way  Galaxy.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.920
What they had done is basically extrapolate well advancing through time, into the future,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.600
to look at how the presence of the Black hole affects the movement of the bodies around it.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.320
So Black holes, they are real, they are out there, they are probably at the centre of most galaxies.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.520
So now, we get back to Alice.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.640
Because really this is all about Alice.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.600
Bob is kind of a smaller player on the side there.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.615
Black holes have some really interesting properties.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.660
We know that they have immense gravity, but what happens when she crosses the event horizon?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.040
The event horizon is what Schwarzschild unknowingly discovered.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.480
It's basically the point of no return; once you cross that point, you are done; you are not getting back.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.100
No light can escape, no information or anything can get out of that.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.580
Alice doesn't know it, because she isn't going to noticing anything unusual

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.220
as she crosses it, but she is pretty much doomed at that point.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.220
She just might not know it for a bit.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.180
Why is she doomed? Well, it's something that physicists like to call "no drama",

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.420
and it's based on Einstein's equivalence principle, this notion that gravity and acceleration are essentially the same thing.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:41.120
What that means is, an object in free fall, and Alice is in free fall, does not feel the effects of gravity.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.940
She's not going to notice any extreme effect. She is just going to be floating along, thinking that space is the same as it's always been.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.220
Until...

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.020
But first, that's from her perspective.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.380
Remember that we are taking about relativity, which means that frames of reference are important.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:04.720
Bob watches her slightly form a distance jumping into a Black hole, but what he sees is a bit different.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.160
He sees her getting slower and slower, because time slows down. Time dilates as you get closer to a black hole,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.120
because of the extreme effects of gravity,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.320
As she approaches the event horizon, she will seem to be moving slower and slower,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.860
and right at the end, she is just going to seem to be frozen in space to him.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:27.060
and that's where time ends for him, as far as Bob is concerned, and he doesn't really know what happens beyond that point.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.500
For Alice, it's bad news,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.080
because there is an evil singularity lurking there at the centre.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.280
She drifts along, and she drifts along; she is in free fall, and after a while she notices an uncomfortable tugging.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.780
that she's being stretched.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.740
That is because she is falling feet-first towards this singularity.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.120
At this point there is really only one way she could go, and it's towards her doom, towards the singularity.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.980
it's just sort of like a...That's the only way she can travel.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.760
The gravity on her feet becomes stronger and stronger, much much stronger than the gravity on her head.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.900
So it keeps pulling and pulling, and she gets longer and longer

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.300
until she's basically...I think Kip Thorne called it being spaghettified.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.240
Finally when she gets close enough to the singularity, she is just ripped to shreds,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.580
and there is nothing left of poor Alice.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.880
Again, poor Bob never knows the horror that awaited his partner.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.920
Of course, this is not the end of the story.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.280
This is a classical view of a Black hole according to Einstein's relativity.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.660
Things get really complicated with quantum mechanics, and quantum mechanics actually is relevant here,

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.220
because there are two different rule books for different size scales when it comes to physics.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:45.180
General relativity governs the macro-scale, the very large, the movement of the planet, things like that, you know, everyday physics.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.560
Quantum mechanics governs the world of subatomic particles and the very small.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.740
Those of you who are familiar with the discovery of Higgs boson will know that

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.640
that was the last piece in what's known as the standard model of particle physics.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.780
That model is now complete.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.760
Except for one bit: that model doesn't include gravity.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.000
Gravity and quantum mechanics just don't play well together,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.120
and physicists are yet to devise a quantum theory of gravity that works.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.785
Blackholes, because they are basically where relativity and quantum mechanics meet,

00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:18.680
that's why they are tremendously interesting to physicists.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.100
So surprise. this is something we find out when we start to apply quantum mechanics to black holes.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.540
Stephen Hawking, playing around with this in 1970s, came up with this idea of Hawking radiation.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.060
Turns out that Black holes are not completely black.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:42.140
That's partly because, empty space, when you are talking quantum mechanically, is not really empty.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.600
Space-time is really...you've got these virtual particles that are popping in and out of existence,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.060
antimatter and matter, Alice and Bob,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.760
and what happens when they meet is that they annihilate into energy almost instantaneously,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.120
so they don't violate the conservation of energy; they are not around long enough.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.300
Nonetheless, space-time at the quantum level is this kind of bubbly frothy foam, so to speak.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.860
So what happens when these virtual particle pairs, Alice and Bob,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.600
pop up into existence right at the event horizon of a Black hole?

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:16.220
Alice is just a little bit closer to it, and she falls in, and Bob doesn't?

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.340
What happens? What happens is, she basically disappears.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.780
It seems that the other particle Bob is light being emitted as radiation from the Black hole,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.220
and the Black hole will lose mass as a result.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:35.020
Black holes not only emit these very faint Hawking radiation, it evaporates over time.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.860
A physicist named Don Page, who is a very charming man,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.560
he's one of the people who just loves counting things.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.620
One of the things he counted was essentially what amounts to the half-life of a black hole.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:52.740
That point at which the black hole has radiated away exactly half its mass,  is called the Page time.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.160
It's kind of like the Mid-life Crisis for a black hole.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.600
It is relevant to the Firewalls debate.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:05.520
Hawking radiation has some very troubling implications when it comes to information theory.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.320
and specifically what happens to information that falls into a Black hole.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:17.200
This is where we get to the information paradox. Sean will talk more about this in depth as it pertains to Firewalls.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.680
I'm just going to give you a brief overview now.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.940
It is very simple. We know that nothing can escape a Black hole.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:30.520
So any information that falls into it, that Alice carries into it, should be lost.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.660
There is a problem though, because there is a key precept in quantum mechanics,

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.960
that says that information must be conserved.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.840
It cannot be lost.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.420
Stephen Hawking decided that this was wrong,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.400
and he put forward this very radical notion that information was lost.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:52.560
I think his famous quote is: "Not only does God play dice, but sometimes he confuses us by throwing them when they can't be seen. "

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.500
Kip Thorne, one of his colleagues, agreed with him.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.120
John Preskill, another physicist, did not, and they made a very very famous bet in 1990s,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.040
where Hawking and Thorne basically said information is destroyed.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.300
They said, OK technically you could say that it gets radiated out by Hawking radiation,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.040
but it's so scrambled that when the Black hole finally evaporates completely,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.280
there is just no way we could retrieve that information.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.960
Basically, you are throwing a book into a bonfire, and it gets burnt up into complete ashes,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.540
and then the ashes just integrate, and then there's nothing left.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.700
What do you do? That information is gone.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.740
Preskill just didn't like this, so he basically took the opposite side of the bed.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.900
He said that information could be recovered in principle,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.980
but he felt that physicists would need to devise a theory of quantum gravity

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.420
to really understand the mechanism by which this could occur.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.400
We don't have a theory of quantum gravity yet, as I mentioned.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.780
But Hawking did, in fact, concede the bet in July 2004.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.120
This was actually based on some work by string theorists, again Sean will talk bout it more in depth.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.360
It's called the holographic principle.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.040
They basically found a cheat.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:07.340
The cheat is, as long as Alice and Bob can see two different things or have their own little bits of information,

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.680
as long as they don't communicate with each other, it's OK.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:16.520
Also, the information gets encoded not necessarily in the Black hole itself, but along the event horizon.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.680
It's a question of volume, so 3D becomes 2D.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:27.780
and that's a little trick they used mathematically to show that it was possible for information to be conserved.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:37.240
What happened was Hawking presented Preskill with the eighth edition of Total Baseball: the ultimate baseball Encyclopaedia, "from which information can be retrieved at will".

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.360
And it was a big deal. Preskill was very happy.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.720
But Kip Thorne refused to concede.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.340
He basically said:  no there's more to the story. I don't think we have it.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.480
It turns out that Thorne may have been correct not to concede,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.720
because today we have a new paradox, and that is Black hole Firewalls.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.960
This is something, again a paper that Joe Polchinski, a string theorist in Santa Barbara and Don Marolf

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.380
and a couple of their students came up with in the summer of 2012.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.290
They were playing around with the information paradox,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.900
and Joe decided that he was going to try a little fun thought experiment,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.740
kind of run Hawking's thought experiments and a lot of thought processes backwards,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.380
just as a way to double-check, and make sure his logic was good.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.320
What he discovered was, there was an anomaly.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.760
It was basically a logic problem that physicist Raphael Bousso calls it "the Menu from Hell".

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.720
What it basically says is that, there are three fundamental precepts

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.220
that physicists know and love and hold dear.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.480
And what Polchinski at all found was that all of those three things cannot all be true.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.420
They simply can't. You've got to pick one to give up.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.120
One of those, which we already talked about, is "no drama". It's the equivalence principle,

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.060
the fact that Alice notices nothing unusual as she crosses the event horizon.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.180
We would really like to hang onto that,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.320
for reasons again which you will hear more of.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.300
The second one is that we want information to be conserved.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.880
We really want it to be conserved; it's a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.360
and if that's wrong, all hell breaks loose in quantum mechanics.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.440
The third thing is Locality, which is a little harder to describe,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:20.640
but essentially, if you picture dropping a pebble in a pond, and it starts to ripple and it ripples outwards.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.540
The basic activity of dropping a pebble happens locally;

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.120
it doesn't happen everywhere at once, and that it spreads out.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.820
That's locality.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.920
Locality is actually one of the foundations of physics.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:37.840
It's really really central. So central that it's hard to think of...certainly classical physics without it.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.920
Which one has to go? Nobody wants to give away any of these.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.500
I actually had the privilege of going to a Stanford workshop shortly after the Firewalls paper was published,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.760
the first Firewalls paper,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.380
and watching them fight it out.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.120
It was fascinating to watch, because nobody knew the answer.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.460
They still don't; they are still arguing about it.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.320
But the most obvious, easiest solution to it is to get rid of "no drama",

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.500
and when you sacrifice "no drama", you get a Firewall,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.280
a wall of radiation at the event horizon,

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.720
and poor Alice gets burnt alive.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.740
I personally would like to save poor Alice; I don't know how we are going to do that.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:22.320
I am hoping that my husband, Sean Carroll, can come up here, and take you through the next stage of the talk.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.900
Hopefully he can find a way to save Alice.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.940
SEAN: Yes, we'll see what we can do.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.660
The answer is "no", we will not be able to save Alice.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.660
This is not - sometimes I go around giving talks about the discovery of the Higgs boson,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.540
and it's a wonderful privilege to do that, because there is a climax.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.080
We discovered the Higgs boson.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.480
It is a triumphant event.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.660
There will be no climactic triumphal event at this talk.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.080
This is going to say "hey look, there is this puzzle. I don't know what the answer is.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.680
Maybe someone in the audience can help us out."

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.300
It all comes, as Jennifer said, from taking the idea of a Black hole, which is well established,

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.560
and which we understand in the context of classical mechanics, and applying quantum mechanics too.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.580
Classical mechanics is what was handed down to us from Newton through Maxwell and Einstein.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.440
It's the idea that you have a state of affairs in the universe,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.840
and it evolves predictably through time.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.420
Also, what you see is what there is.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.920
In classical mechanics, there just IS something and you can observe it.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.360
In quantum mechanics, that's not quite the case.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.380
So here is your one minute introduction to quantum mechanics.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.460
What you can observe is much less than what actually exists.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.420
That's really the essence of quantum mechanics and why it's difficult to understand,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:49.340
because nobody likes this. Nobody likes the fact that some fundamental deep facet of physics

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.560
is being expressed in terms of what human beings can observe.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.400
That can't be right.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.320
And this is called the ""measurement problem" of quantum mechanics.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.620
Surely we don't understand quantum mechanics well enough if we are reduced to making statements like this.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.520
And it turns out that we do understand quantum mechanics better than we used to.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.160
We know a little bit more about what qualifies as an observer and a measurement.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.460
We still don't know everything; we still don't have a complete picture that everyone agrees on,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.040
on the basic quantum mechanical reality.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.780
But we know how it works, in practice. How it works is, certain kinds of observations that you can make.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.360
They return results that we can predict - the probability of getting a result.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.320
But when you are not making those observations, when you are not looking at this system,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.980
all of the different possibilities can simultaneously be there.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.240
So here is a classical example - Jennifer mentioned:  The Schrodinger's cat.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.300
One of a long line of experiments, that are among the most violent thought experiments that physicists like to talk about,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.040
where we kill small helpless animals.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.060
In this case, well we kill half of the animal.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.760
We kill the animal at some branch of the wave function of the universe.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.540
In this case, you have a cat; it's in a box,

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.820
and what you want to do, is that you want to take advantage of the fact that in quantum mechanics,

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.260
systems can be in superpositions of different classical possibilities.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.320
So in the box, you hook up a Geiger counter to a radioactive source, a hammer that can fall,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.600
and break a vile that is filled with poisoned gas.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.760
It has to be a Geiger counter or something else that is sensitive to a quantum mechanical event,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.580
like the decay of an atom.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:34.220
So there's something fundamentally quantum mechanical; it happens with a certain probablity,

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.940
and you wait until that probability adds up to 50%.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.560
Then according to the rules of quantum mechanics, Schrodinger points out that, in this box,

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.940
there is no such thing as an alive cat or a dead cat.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:54.800
In this box, the reality of the situation is that there is a superposition of an alive cat and a dead cat.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.040
We are used to, in classical mechanics, having boxes that we don't know what's in there.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.020
You might say that there is a 50-50 chance that the cat is alive or dead.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.600
But in that way of talking, there is a reality, you just don't know what it is.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.380
it is a matter of our ignorance.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.940
In quantum mechanics, it's not just a matter of our ignorance.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.540
The truth of what's inside the box, is that it is both an alive cat and a dead cat,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.560
a superposition of both possibilities.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.800
And again, these days we know more about quantum mechanics than Schrodinger did,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.700
so we know that, you don'y need to open the box to create either the alive cat or the dead cat.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:36.500
There is an effective observation being made all the time by the air in the box, by the light in the box,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.060
by the cat walking around and so forth.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.420
Long before you open the box, the split has already happened.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.600
But the classical explanation of this thought experiment is that, before you open the box,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.640
there is a superposition of a live cat and a dead cat.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:56.860
When you open it and observe, you only ever see either the cat alive, or the cat dead.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:03.160
You never see a superposition of both possibilities, even though that's what quantum mechanics says is there

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.040
when you are not looking.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.560
And that's the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.020
The way that when you are not looking at something, it's in a superposition of all these different possibilities.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:19.080
That leads to something that's very important for the Firewall story, something called entanglement.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.020
This is not a picture of entanglement. This is just an excuse to put a cute cat on the slide.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:32.600
Entanglement is the idea that in quantum mechanics, the way that we describe the world is not piece by piece.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.680
it's all at once.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.320
So in classical mechanics, let's say you have two boxes, and you can't see inside,

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.000
and you have a red ball and a blue ball.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.560
You know that there is one of each, and each one is inside a box, but you don't know which one is in which box.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.400
Then you would say that there are two possibilities: either that the blue ball is in box one,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.240
and the red one is in box two;

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.540
OR the red one is in box one, and the blue one is in box two.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.380
One of those possibilities is true in classical mechanics, whether or not you know it.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:11.500
In quantum mechanics, inside the box you can have any superposition of maybe it's the red ball, maybe it's the blue ball.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.960
So in quantum mechanics, there can be entanglement.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:22.040
Not only that it can be true that in one box, a certain chance that the ball is blue,

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:31.660
but it can be the case that in the other box, whichever option is real depends on what's going on in the first box.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:36.160
If you open just one box, it might be 50-50, the ball is red, or the ball is blue.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.460
If you open the other box, likewise, 50-50, red versus blue.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:48.080
But if you open the first box and the ball is red, then you know with 100% certainty the other box is blue.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:54.760
That is quantum entanglement, and if you want to be a little more of a respectable particle physicist,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.560
you can think of particles spinning or moving in certain directions,

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.680
rather than balls being red or blue.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.800
But it's the same overall point,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.920
that quantum mechanics does not say there is a state of this box, and a state of this box.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.400
It says there is the state of the world.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.680
In this case, the world is either, red over here and blue over there,

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.160
OR blue over here, red over there.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.620
So this little picture is supposed to show not two balls in each box,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.280
but the balls are in superposition of red and blue, that it is entangled between those two boxes.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.620
This is another mystery of quantum mechanics. Forget about the measurement stuff.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:37.320
The fact that things that are separated from each other can nevertheless be entangled with each other

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.400
bugs us also.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.200
It certainly bugged Einstein.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.440
He wrote a paper in 1935 with his friends Podolsky and Rosen.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.120
He came up with one of the paradoxes that Jennifer mentioned.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.480
The paradox, the EPR paradox - The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, says,

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.540
look, this entanglement between two different particles,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.820
let's say a particle spinning clockwise, and a particle spinning counter-clockwise, or something like that,

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.680
or a ball being red or blue.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.320
You see, you have one particle over here that's in one state;

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.780
another particle in another state, and they are entangled with each other.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.400
That entanglement can persist no matter how far apart the particles are.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.220
You can have one particle that is entangled with the other,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.540
even though they can be separated by hundreds of thousands of light years.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.400
They are on separate sides of a galaxy.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.060
This is not a picture of our galaxy, by the way, we don't have any pictures of our galaxy.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.240
This is the Andromeda galaxy.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.480
But the principle is the same.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.280
In fact, we have done experiments like this,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.740
where two particles are entangled; they are separated by kilometres.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.880
They are not separated by hundreds of thousands of light years.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.080
But still kilometres are pretty good.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:49.200
According to the rules of quantum mechanics, if you observe this one and then see the ball if blue,

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.440
you instantly know that the ball on the other side of the galaxy is red.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.860
So this bugs us, because as Einstein pointed out,

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.620
nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:07.820
But the reality of which ball is in the box seems to be changing instantaneously all over the universe.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.320
That bothers us a great deal.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:16.800
However, it turns out that this kind of instantaneous change is relatively harmless.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.880
You can't use this to talk to anybody, on the other side of the galaxy.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.440
If you think about it, your friend over here, what do they know before you open the box?

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.500
They know that if they open their box, the ball could be red or it could be blue.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.520
So you open your box, and your find that the ball is red.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.980
You know that when they open the box, it is going to be blue,

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.880
with 100% probability.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.760
But they don't know that. They open the box and it is blue,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.840
and they go:"Well, that was one of the chances"

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.360
No information has travelled.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.740
You cannot send a telegraph using this kind of entanglement.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:57.440
So quantum mechanics manages to be non-local in a very subtle way.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.220
It bugged Einstein, but again, all he could do was say :"Look, this sounds weird"

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.080
and the rest of the community said: "Yes, that does sound weird, but it's true. "

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.260
You'll do the experiment and it's true. this is actually how nature works.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.720
The reason why I am going to such a great length talking about this here, is because

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:20.400
the particles that are emitted by Black holes are entangled in a very very specific way.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:26.080
Jennifer showed you some nice pictures of Black holes at one moment in time.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:32.580
The Black holes sitting there in space, just a black sphere with fun radiation and people falling onto it.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.680
I am the hard core quantitate of science, so I drew a little picture, in power point.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.100
This is a space-time diagram of a Black hole.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.420
The hole itself, the two-dimensional surface enclosing a three-dimensional volume

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.820
is here portrayed as a just a one-dimensional circle enclosing a two dimensional disc.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.200
This circle is the black hole at one moment in time.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.180
And the vertical axis is time evolving.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.300
The black hole is just sitting there, so nothing is actually happening in this picture,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.640
but we are going to make it a little bit more active in just a second.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:10.200
And inside you see the singularity, and the event horizon defines the boundary of a Black hole.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.440
For those of you that have been reading ahead, outside of class,

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:22.900
you will know that outside the event horizon time goes vertically, but inside, time heads into the singularity.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.280
Once you are inside the event horizon,

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:31.320
moving towards the singularity is precisely the same as moving forward in time.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.220
You can no more avoid heading towards the singularity than you can avoid heading tomorrow.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.060
That is why the singularity is so inevitable.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.920
Now what Stephen Hawking said is, out of this classical Black hole will come radiation,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.800
and one way to think about that is, near the event horizon, according to the "no drama" principle,

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.220
the principle of equivalence that Jennifer talked about,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.920
you are in, what physicists call, the vacuum state.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.120
You are in empty space, there is nothing there.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.120
You can pass through the event horizon with a little detector, looking for particles,

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:07.880
you don't see anything special; there's no sign posts, no "no escape after you meet this point"

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.760
or anything like that.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.420
But it's an empty space that obeys the rules of quantum mechanics

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.340
and in quantum mechanics, even empty space is kind of interesting.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:25.100
Empty space is actually a superposition of different ways that particles could be coming in and out of existence.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.600
Now, here in this room, space is empty, and space-time is fairly flat,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.760
because gravitational field is not that strong.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.500
if you look at empty space, you truly don't see anything.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.500
but in the vicinity of a Black Hole, what Hawking points out,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:45.740
is that the gravitational field of a Black hole can tear apart these virtual particles that are sitting in the quantum vacuum.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:52.880
So you can have one particle, Alice, falling into the Black hole, and another particle Bob escaping into infinity.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:57.540
So what was two particles sitting there quietly in empty space

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.500
becomes two real actual particles.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.040
That's very important; this one particle that goes out is what we call the Hawking radiation.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.900
That's what we see evaporating away from the Black hole.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:15.700
So it's important that whenever you make one Hawking particle, that escapes the Black hole,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.520
secretly, although you don't see it from out here, there is another particle that you also made

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.880
that falls into the Black hole.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:28.460
Given all the setup, you will not be surprised to hear that the two particles are entangled with each other.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.920
That makes sense, because these two particles are created essentially out of nothing,

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.780
out of empty space.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:41.580
Empty space does not have any electric charge, does not have any spin. It doesn't have any energy.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.720
It's empty space,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.780
But you've made particles out of it.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.940
Therefore the two particles that you pulled out of empty space

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.820
need to be equal but also opposite.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.840
If one of them has a positive electric charge, the other one has a negative electric charge.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.780
One of them is spinning clockwise; the other one is spinning counter-clockwise.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.260
If one of them has a positive amount of energy, the other one has a negative amount of energy.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:11.140
And indeed, any particle that escapes to infinity, to the outside world has a positive amount of energy.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.640
Therefore, as far as the outside observer is concerned,

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.960
Alice, the in-falling particle, has a negative amount of energy.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.020
That's why the Black holes eventually shrink and lose their masses

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.540
because essentially, inside the Black hole,

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:32.420
you see a constant drizzle of negative energy particles decreasing the mass of a Black hole.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.860
These two particles, Alice and Bob, that are created by Hawking radiation,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.480
are entangled with each other.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.380
if this one is spinning one way, this one is spinning the other way.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.820
Empty space separated into sets of particles, will necessarily give you particles that are always entangled.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.300
That's a consequence of the "no drama" principle.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.400
however, we want more than that.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:00.300
We want the information, having which we made the Black hole, to eventually escape

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.820
Once the whole Black hole has evaporated, we want to know exactly what it was made of.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.900
We know that you have two particles entangled;

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:13.760
we know that all the particles coming out are supposed to tell us what went in in the first place.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.960
But that's a puzzle, because Bob is entangled with Alice,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:25.100
and what that means is that some of Bob's information is being left behind in the Black hole.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:31.740
When Bob leaves, Bob is entangled, and we are not exactly sure how; therefore the information is not yet getting out.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.880
What you'd say to yourself, if you are trying to make sense of this,

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.520
if you are a physicist who believes that Black holes evaporate,

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.820
but also believes that information is conserved, is that:

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.420
That's OK, because later there is another particle named Carrie, and Bob will just be entangled with Carrie,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.920
in exactly the same way that he was entangled with Alice.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.900
So Bob is spinning clockwise; both Alice and Carrie are spinning counter-clockwise,

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.940
and vice versa.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:05.080
So maybe that's how the information gets out. This early radiation Bob, is entangled with the late radiation Carrie.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.380
Then of course, Carrie herself, if she is a virtual particle that was torn out of the quantum vacuum,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.440
she'll also be entangled with Dave, but Dave is just not going to be important to our story.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.280
Sorry Dave.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.420
Here is what we are trying to say.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.480
We are trying to say that Bob started life entangled with Alice

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.240
and eventually is entangled with Carrie.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.560
That's the only way that information can get out of Black holes, if there is "no drama" at the event horizon.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.260
The problem is, that cannot happen.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.240
Quantum entanglement does not work that way.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.640
Quantum entanglement does not let you mess around.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.140
Sorry

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.760
In fact, literally, the phrase this goes by is the "Monogamy of entanglement"

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.240
If you are a particle Bob, and you are maximumly entangled with another particle Alice,

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.900
(there is Alice and there is Bob),

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.980
you cannot possibly be entangled even a little bit with another particle called Carrie.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:05.920
The rules of quantum entanglement are more strict than the rules of "free love" in the 60s,

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.720
when this was first discusses.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:14.200
I got this slide, this picture, from John Preskill, who Jennifer already mentioned,

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.980
a colleague of mine in CalTech.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.400
John got in trouble for showing this slide, because it says on the top: Monogamy is frustrating!

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.820
As if poor bob is frustrated because he is stuck in this relationship with Alice,

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.160
and he can't get together with Carrie.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:33.040
So John started changing the labels and he made it Becky over here,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.080
who is entangled with Adam,

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.140
and cannot be entangled with Charlie.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.560
Then he got into trouble for that too, because people were saying:

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.460
"What are you saying about Beckie's morals anyway? Beckie is just sleeping around? Come on. "

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.580
So don't label your particles by people's names,

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.100
is the short lesson here that we should learn.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.680
But this is the big puzzle. This is it! This IS the puzzle that we are faced with,

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.120
if you believe everything on the previous slides.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.060
We have shown logically that the fact that the Hawking radiation comes from a region with "no drama",

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:09.280
flies through empty space, and eventually is going to bring all of its information back,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:10.660
can't happen.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.160
Not all of those things can all happen at the same time,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.920
because entanglement is monogamous. Bob cannot be entangled with both Alice and Carrie

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.100
Something has to go. This is the AMPS argument.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.500
AMPS are Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski and Sully

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.240
the Santa Barbarians who wrote this paper in 2012.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.320
And they went through the list. They went through the list that Jennifer mentioned,

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320
from Raphael Bousso, what could be going wrong?

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.800
They are all kind of pretty dramatic.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.960
One possibility is that information really is lost.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.460
Maybe if you take encyclopaedia and throw them in the Black holes,

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:51.380
the information in those books is truly lost forever, not just in practice, but even in principle.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.540
That would be a dramatic violation of everything we think is true about quantum mechanics.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.700
In some sense that's OK. Everything that we think is true about quantum mechanics

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.180
is a dramatic violation to what we thought about classical mechanics,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.000
and yet it turns out to be right.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.100
It might be true that quantum mechanics is not the final theory of everything.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.240
In fact , Stephen Hawking, who was the first to propose that this was true,

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.200
said very explicitly that he thought this was the right answer.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.200
This is why he made that bet that he eventually conceded, and is now having second thoughts about conceding.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:29.440
Despite the fact that it is a logical possibility that information is lost,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.680
what we would really like to see is a well defined theory of how information is lost,

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:40.380
where it goes, under what circumstances it is destroyed and conserved, and so forth.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.400
And nobody has been able to do that.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.580
So no one has been able to come up with a consistent coherent framework

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.700
in which information really is lost.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.680
That's not to say it's not true.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.140
It's just that it's not one of those ideas that falls into your lap and everything suddenly makes sense.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:01.640
It's an idea that is suggested; you think about it, and it just becomes more and more puzzling as time goes on.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.840
Another possibility is locality. This is a somewhat subtle concept,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:12.780
but it's basically the idea that things that happen in the world happen in different locations in the world.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:18.600
So a particle doesn't just pop out of existence here, and suddenly reappear over there.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.500
A particle propagates from here to there, obeying the laws of field theory,

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.480
of quantum field theory, in this case.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.500
This photon, or electron, or whatever it is that we labelled Bob,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:35.640
moves from the event horizon to very very far away, following the laws of particle physics,

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.880
which are local in space.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:42.860
Maybe that's not what happens; maybe the information contained in Bob doesn't obey those laws.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.360
That would be very dramatic and interesting.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.980
Finally there is the possibility that, there is in fact "drama"at the event horizon.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:56.780
This thought that we've had since the 1960s, that Alice could fall into the event horizon and never notice anything,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.560
is just not right.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:05.220
Instead, there is a tremendous amount of high energy radiation that Alice sees when she gets there.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.180
If you think about it, this Hawking radiation, it comes to you;

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.080
it's very faint, it's very cold, it's very long-wavelength.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:17.540
But when you leave a Black hole, a photon gets red-shifted; it loses energy.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.220
It suffers what we call the gravitational red-shift.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.300
So a photon out here, that is very low energy,

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.980
when we true it back in time, was very high energy, when it left.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:34.020
Usually we say: Well, that's OK. It was high energy, but it was invisible because it was part of a quantum vacuum.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:40.560
And this idea is saying actually no. It was just there as a super-duper high energy particle.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:46.560
And when Alice tries to cross an event horizon, she would be incinerated by this wall of fire,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.380
all of these high energy particles lurking near the event horizon.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:55.580
And I fact, if this were true, there wouldn't even be anything called inside a Black Hole.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:01.340
All the stuff that we think make up the Black hole would simply live on the event horizon.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.380
Now be a very dramatic difference from how we think about Black holes were narrowing.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.260
Sadly, neither Almheiri, Marold, Polchinski or Sully seemed to know that

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.380
the word Firewall is used in computer science,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.500
to be a good thing, to stop evil people from getting in where you wanna go.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.600
They used it as a bad thing, something that burns you to bits, as you fall into a black hole.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.660
So the smart money, among people who are my personal friends,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.800
is that locality is going to be the thing to go.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:36.980
It  is a very dramatic thing, but it seems to be a little bit easier to live with than the other two, going.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.920
So let me talk a little more about locality.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.140
As Jennifer mentioned, you can visualise what locality is by thinking about

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.140
what happens when you drop a pebble into a pond,

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.820
or when you make a sound, or when you flash a light , or anything like that.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.900
The effects of what you do

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.080
do not show up all throughout the universe instantaneously.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.520
They move at a certain rate - the speed of light,

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.520
the speed of sound, or the speed of waves in the water

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.620
They move from one place to the next to next to the next.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.160
That's a reflection of the fact that the way we talk about the world

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.620
is by talking about what's happening at every point in space.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.560
So this is space, if I were to tell you what's happening in some region of space,

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.680
I tell you what's happening there, or what's happening there, and so forth.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.220
If someone says: What's going on in this lecture hall?

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:30.140
I can tell them - the identity of every person and every seat in the lecture hall, and what they are doing.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.940
Separate information in every point in space.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.440
Now quantum mechanics complicates this a little bit,

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.540
because it says that there could be separate superpositions in classical realities.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.740
But each on elf those classical realities is local in space.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.380
There is a description of ... there are so many electrons over here, so many photons over there,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.180
Everything is defined by where it is in space.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.760
That is the principle of locality.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:01.060
Entanglement makes the concept of locality a little bit more problematic,

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.200
but it doesn't break it; it just makes it more interesting.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:09.900
The quantum state of these two particles that are very very far away from each other is not local.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000
However, the dynamics, how they actually change with time, how you can actually send a signal through space,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
is all perfectly local, even with quantum mechanics and entanglement.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.480
If you want something to happen, you just start it here

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.080
and you just travel through space to get anywhere else.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.300
Despite the fact that locality is very precious to us,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.840
it's probably not right.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:40.020
In fact, other thought experiments involving Black holes have already given us reasons to believe that,

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.900
when it comes to quantum gravity, just what we are doing here, after all,

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.800
quantising gravity itself, the fabric of space-time.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.060
When it comes to quantum gravity, locality is probably not an inviolable principle.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.580
The question is, how much violation with locality can we get away with?

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.900
To what extent is the universe not really described by what's happening here,

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.800
plus what's happening there, plus what's happening there?

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.240
So we have two clues that are given to us, by thinking about Black holes.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.860
One is called the holographic principle.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:18.560
This actually goes back to Stephen Hawking once again, and his radiation from Black holes.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.340
One of the implications of Hawking's discovery that Black holes radiate,

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.900
by the way, I should (because I'm in a venerable lecture hall), stop saying,

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.600
we have never seen a radiating Black hole.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.960
This is not data that we are talking about here.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.400
I'm sure that Black holes radiate; my confidence is very very high,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.120
but I could be wrong about that.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.540
It's cherished rules of physics that tell us that black holes radiate,

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.560
but it sure would be nice to have some experiments or some data that said the same thing.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.740
Alright. Thought to the experimental is now complete,

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.260
now we can go back to crazy theorists' land.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.740
Hawking showed that a Black hole actually has a lot of entropy.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:02.360
Entropy is a way of talking about the disorderliness, the chaoticness of an arrangement of stuff in the universe.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.340
When cream and coffee are all mixed together, they are high entropy;

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.480
when they are separated, they are low entropy.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.960
So ordinarily, if you want to quantify actually the amount of entropy in the air in this room,

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.200
you just talk about the numbers of ways you can rearrange the molecules that make up the air in this room.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:24.140
And the number of ways that you can rearrange the molecules just depends on the volume of space that we have in the room.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:31.500
So it is an absolute rock-solid feature of entropy in the ordinary experimental macroscopic world,

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.100
that entropy scales like the volume of the system that you are looking at.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.940
If you double the volume, you will double the available entropy.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.060
What Hawking showed is that for a Black hole,

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.940
the entropy of a black hole scales as the area of its event horizon.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:50.640
So a Black hole has a volume; there is a volume inside the event horizon.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.740
There is a three-dimensional volume enclosed by the event horizon.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.960
You might have guessed, that the entropy of a Black hole is proportional to that volume inside.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.560
That is not right.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:05.000
It is proportional to the area, some two-dimensional quantity,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.300
the area of the event horizon, not the three-dimensional quantity of the volume inside.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.980
People had known that for a long time;

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.620
It didn't really sink in seriously until the 1990s,

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.060
when , Huskin and others promoted this idea,

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.360
to not just a weird idosyncrasy of Black holes,

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.880
but a fundamental feature of nature.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.300
They proposed the holographic principle,

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:35.360
that says that basically any time, you think you had a three-dimension collection of stuff,

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.980
like us here in this room.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:43.880
All of the information needed to describe us can be compressed into one two-dimensional surface.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.820
In a black hole, it becomes frighteningly real.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.660
In a black hole, the two-dimensional event horizon really does contain all the information you need,

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.480
to talk about what's happening inside, according to the holographic principle.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.020
But it should be true even in this room, or the galaxy or the universe.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.840
And if that is true, locality is being dramatically violated,

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.460
because there is a lot less that can possibly happen in this room than you thought could.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.700
You thought that something could be happening here, and something could be happening there,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.400
and different things could be happening at every point.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.680
But the holographic principle says: No, that's not true.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.200
One of the arguments for it, is if you imagine all of the different possible things that could happen

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.860
most of them would have a lot of energy and would collapse to make a Black hole.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.440
So there is an upper limit on the number of things that could happen in this room,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:38.500
and the size of the upper limit is proportional to the area of the walls around this room.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:43.680
So there is this hypothesis that all of physics really lives in a world

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.020
that is one dimension lower than the world we actually see.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:53.000
And again, we are trying to make sense of this idea. We are making progress, but we are not completely there yet.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:00.980
The other idea that has come out of Black holes and argues against locality is called Black hole complementarity.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.380
Remember I said that, from the point of view of Bob from far away,

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:09.840
he sees radiation coming out of the Black hole, and he says: well if I trace it backwards,

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.680
it must have been very high energy radiation when it left the event horizon.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.160
Whereas Alice, in the conventional way of thinking about things,

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.320
passes through the event horizon and sees nothing there

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.700
just empty space.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.760
So they had incompatible ways of describing the same situation.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.380
Bob thinks the event horizon is bubbling with high-energy radiation;

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.940
Alice says there's nothing there.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.280
Black hole complementarity says: they are both correct.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.940
Black hole complementarity says they are different-sounding ways

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:48.480
of giving equivalent descriptions of the same fundamental underlying reality,

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:54.440
and that two things that are seen by two observers can look very very different,

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.420
as long as the observers can never get together to compare notes.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.640
So what happens is, if you give Bob enough time to collect the Hawking radiation,

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.260
and figure out what he thinks the horizon looks like,

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.220
and you give Alice enough time to fall into the horizon.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:16.160
If Bob then says: alright, I've got some data; I know what's coming out of the Black hole.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.360
I am going to fly into the Black hole and tell Alice what I saw.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.760
It is too late. She has been spaghettified and crushed into the singularity.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:30.020
So these two observers see a very different thing happening in the world, but hey can never talk about it.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:34.140
Only we - God-like physicists, looking at the whole thing from afar,

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.400
can give the bird's eye view on everything that is going on.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.760
That is the principle of Black hole complementarity.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.580
It's borrowed from the early days of quantum mechanics when Niels Bohr pointed out that

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:48.580
you are allowed to measure position, OR you are allowed to measure velocity.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.920
You are not allowed to measure both at the same time.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.800
That was quantum complementarity; this is Black hole complementarity.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.320
So again, it's a violation of locality in some sense.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.940
It says that the right way to describe the world isn't what's happening here, and what's happening there,

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.420
and what's happening there, and what's happening there, separately.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.035
What's happening right there can depend in a very dramatic way

00:51:11.035 --> 00:51:13.860
on who's looking at it and from what perspective.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.473
So somehow, all the information about what's going on in the world

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.580
is not simply located in individual points in space.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.280
It's encoded in some cryptic way that we don't yet understand,

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.180
and that's what we are trying to get at, by doing these thought experiments.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.620
The problem is, these two types of non-locality,

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.220
don't seem to be enough to solve the Firewall puzzle.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:43.260
Remember in the holographic principle, you say: OK, all the information is there on the horizon.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.640
That doesn't tell you anything at all about what you see, when you fall into the horizon.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:53.840
And in the complementarity, you explicitly say that Alice, when she falls in, doesn't see anything at the horizon

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.680
but it's just an assertion.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.980
You are not explaining how the entanglements can actually work.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.720
The force of the Black hole Firewall paradox,

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.860
as in the amount of non-locality you seem to need to make physics work,

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:14.280
is even worse than that given to us by the holographic principle or complementarity.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.300
So what could be going on, and again, nobody knows what's going on,

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.820
so we'll tell you two crazy-sounding ideas.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.600
The hope is that they are just crazy enough to be right.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:31.920
One idea is that, there really isn't any such thing as "inside the Black hole".

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.600
This idea is that, what you think of as "inside the Black hole",

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.580
is just a copy of certain things going on outside the Black hole.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.780
This is a little bit strange to get it straight, because in fact, in quantum mechanics,

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.160
there is a rule that says: you can't copy things.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:54.180
There is what's playfully called the no-Xerox theorem, or the no-cloning theorem.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.260
You have the quantum bit of information. You can move it，

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.860
and you can evolve it and so forth, but you can't just copy it without destroying it.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.440
But this is saying something more profound than that.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:09.080
It's not that you fall in and there is a copy of you that goes in and a copy of you that goes out.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:14.360
It is saying that the interior of a Black hole really is exactly the same thing,

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.040
as the exterior secretly,

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.120
secretly encoded in some weird way.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.660
So the difference is that if I can take a quantum mechanical object,

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:29.120
and clone it, then I could separately do things to this one and then do separate things to this one.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:33.980
But this is saying that literally everything that happens inside the event horizon,

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:40.120
is mirrored in some exactly equivalent way by things going on outside the event horizon.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.100
That is a set of words that we can say.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.520
Those are all English sentences that are more or less grammatical.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.880
We don't really have a quantitated theory about how this would work.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.720
It would in fact solve the Black hole Firewall puzzle,

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:59.420
because this thing that we thought was a photon falling in, labelled Alice,

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:02.620
was exactly Bob all along, or one of the other photons.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.140
It seems dramatic but it might actually be true.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.020
And then just to go one step weirder, we have what is playfully called ER=EPR.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.320
This is an idea of again Leonard Susskind and Juan Maldacena.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:23.560
EPR, we already mentioned - Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, are the ones who first took quantum entanglement

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.320
put it front-and-centre.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:32.500
ER was just Einstein ad Rosen; Podolsky didn't get involved, but it was a paper written I think the same year

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.280
as the EPR paper, but on a totally different subject,

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:42.300
about the idea that, given general relativity, given the idea that space can be curved and dynamical,

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.440
you could imagine building little bridges in space-time that we call wormholes.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.040
So Einstein and Rosen, what we call an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.720
is just a connection between two widely separated pieces of universe,

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.280
maybe that look like Black holes from the outside.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:04.520
The trick here is that, you think the distance between this Black hole and this Black hole is very large,

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:10.460
if you travel this way, but secretly it can be very short if you take the shortcut through the wormhole.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.520
This was the Einstein-Rosen suggestion.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.020
It was a little bit speculative,

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.120
but it went into the toolbox of theoretical physicists.

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.980
And it had nothing to do with entanglement or quantum mechanics,

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.200
and Maldacena and Susskind was saying is that, well actually maybe it does.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.680
Maybe when two particles are quantum entangled,

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.760
secretly, there is effectively a little tiny wormhole that is connecting them,

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.060
that for certain purposes,

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.560
you can think of quantum entanglement as being enforced by a little bridge in space-time,

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.260
that brings those two particles together.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.820
So the way that information can get out of a Black hole, in this idea,

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.920
is that Black hole is connected with by little virtual wormholes

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.560
to all the particles that are being emitted as Hawking radiation.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:05.480
Really, the importance of this suggestion is that space-time is not fundamental.

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.340
Space-time is an approximation

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:13.100
that comes out of thinking about quantum states and how they are entangled with each other.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:17.220
we live in space-time; we tend to think that space and time are kind of important.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.600
This point of view is saying: they are just good ideas.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.900
They are nothing absolutely fundamental; they are just a good approximation.

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:30.340
And finally of course, there is the other possibility that Firewalls are real.

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.820
That we've been wrong for the past 50 years

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:35.300
when we are thinking about what would happen when you fall into a Black hole.

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.280
It would not be painless until you got spaghettified.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.520
It would be painful long before then.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.340
This is the old picture of Black holes. You would just fall in and nothing would happen.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:50.340
And maybe that's completely wrong. Maybe in fact, there is a wall of ultra-high energy radiation

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.960
that incinerates you to bits long before you fall into the event horizon,

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.880
and would be spaghettified.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:00.460
Again, that seems weird to us,

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:06.180
because the horizon in classical general relativity, not only is nothing going on there,

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.320
but the gravitational field isn't even that strong.

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.000
We think of, if you are right next to a Black hole, the gravitational field better be pretty strong.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:19.900
But it's really just, it's so big that you don't notice.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.700
You would not be spaghettified at the event horizon.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.440
You are not spaghettified until you are well inside, an astrophysically large Black hole.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.880
So this idea is saying that, in a region of space-time, that should seem perfectly benign and happy,

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.180
something really dramatic is going on.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.420
That may be true; if so that would be a very important discovery.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.820
So to conclude: why is this important? Why does this matter?

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:50.004
And we could have started by telling you why it matters, but you are already here,

00:57:50.004 --> 00:57:51.540
so we figured that you'd go along.

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.140
The point is that trying to quantise gravity

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:59.420
is probably the most important outstanding puzzle in fundamental theoretical physics,

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:05.740
the ultimate description that we have of how nature works at a deep level.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.060
We have a very very good theory of particle physics, quantum mechanics, and space-time.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.840
The quantum mechanics part doesn't play well together with the space-time part

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.760
and that's the search for quantum gravity.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:21.220
But to get a theory of quantum gravity, we need to know what it is that we are quantising.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:28.060
We think that we understand classical gravity; Einstein told us what it is. it's the curvature of space-time,

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:35.400
but all of these ideas from Black holes, getting the information out, the holographic principle, complementarity, Firewalls;

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:40.680
all of them are telling us that space-time itself is not fundamental,

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:49.080
that when we talk about space-time, it's like talking about the air in this room as some kind of fluid,

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:55.080
that has a temperature, a pressure, and a velocity, and a speed of sound and so forth.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:01.140
But we know, and you and I know that if you look closely enough at the air in this room, it is no longer fluid,

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.560
it resolves into different atoms and molecules.

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:09.360
This kind of idea is saying, sure, space-time is a nice approximate way to talk about the world,

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.580
but when you really push it, it breaks down and needs to be replaced by something else.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.700
We have no idea what that something-else is. That's the problem.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:23.440
If quantum gravity is not a theory of space-time curvature being quantised,

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.400
it is a theory of something else being quantised,

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:32.740
something that is related to the space-time we observe every day in some mysterious, non-local way,

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.600
that we haven't fully understood.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:39.940
We are some provocative clues; we have some toy models, that seem to give us useful information,

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.600
but we are nowhere near the final answer yet.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.240
That is what makes it fun; that is why this is a fun thing to think about.

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.300
It is not going to cure cancer or build a better iPhone,

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.200
thinking about the holographic principle and Black hole Firewalls.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.620
All that it will help us do, is understand at a deeper level what the fundamental nature of reality is.

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.820
And I think that is something that is well worth thinking about.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.660
Thank you.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.480
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.400
So now we have plenty of time for questions. I am going to bring up my lovely wife again.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.680
We were told - I don't know if this is true -

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.720
we were told that the last time as husband-and-wife team spoke at the Royal Institution,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.460
it was Marie and Pierre Curie.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.580
And they didn't let her talk.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.100
Come a long way. Alright, way up, right in the middle.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.140
MAN: Thanks. I have a question about the human Alice and Bob, which is probably just misunderstanding.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.360
When Bob is watching Alice enter the Black hole,

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.920
she basically freezes in space, and he doesn't actually see her

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.540
well, and infinite amount of time would possibly pass before she enters the Black hole.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.480
When I was young, there were still ideas about the Big Crunch,

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.580
and I was thinking Alice can never get to the singularity,

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:13.780
because time is basically slowed down so much from the point of view of Bob and the rest of the universe

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.180
that the Big Crunch will happen before she ever gets there.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.280
Now obviously the Big Crunch might not happen because of dark energy,

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.180
but as the black hole evaporates,

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:28.660
would the evaporation of the Black hole not sort of overtake Alice reaching the singularity?

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:33.780
I don't really know if this is a question. It really is a request for evaporation.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.580
SEAN: And the question is: don't you agree?

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.000
I do agree, actually you are completely right.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:47.760
Your younger self was not right, because in a Black hole that would not have evaporated away,

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.720
from Alice's point of view,

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.580
the clock is still ticking in an absolutely normal way,

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.560
when she crosses the event horizon.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.520
There is a finite number of seconds before she hits the singularity.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.860
If the Black hole is one solar mass in size,

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:05.900
between the event horizon and the singularity, it takes about one millionth of a second from her point of view.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:12.700
But now with the Black hole evaporating, we honestly don't really have a very straight answer to that question.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.760
There's still going to be tremendous gravitational fields in there.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.700
You are probably still going to be spaghettified,

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:22.500
but there is probably not a singularity. That is probably an artefact of classical general relativity.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.000
So it's more like you all get mixed up, and somehow your information comes out again.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.040
MAN: Would the Black hole not evaporate?

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.520
From Bob's point of view, he's seen the Black hole evaporate, in external time.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.980
Alice is almost frozen from his point of view,

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.360
so why isn't it that the Black hole evaporates before anything happens to Alice?

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.340
It seems to tie in with your idea that

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:51.900
the event horizon, which is this massive radiation, there's actually nothing inside.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.840
SEAN: Well you know, Alice's point of view is also valid.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.520
And in her point of view, she enters the event horizon.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.140
The point is that, there is a tiny bit of exaggeration,

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.480
when we say that from Bob's point of view, Alice stops moving.

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:11.260
If you see somebody, that means they are giving off radiation.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.300
That means that time is passing.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.620
So even though Bob sees Alice move more and more slowly,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.460
Alice also appears redder and redder, and fainter and fainter

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.360
because she is embarrassed that she is falling into a Black hole,

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.980
and because the photons are being red-shifted.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.980
Bob only gets a finite mount of information, about what happened to Alice,

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.540
and that information is not complete.

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.620
The actual fact about Alice is that she enters into the Black hole.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:47.280
MAN: Is there any potential research, aims and instrumentation

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.580
that could give you evidence about what you are talking about?

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.400
JENNIFER: Don't you love the theory? The pureness of the theory?

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.420
SEAN: yeah the theory should be enough!

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.360
I think that the most we could possibly hope for is evidence of Hawking radiation.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.220
The evidence for Firewalls and crazy wormholes is a bit much to ask.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.040
If a Black hole is big, like if you make it from a star at the centre of a galaxy,

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.200
the weird thing about Black holes is that the bigger they are, the fainter they are,

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.340
the lower the temperature is.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:23.560
so for an astrophysical large Black hole, it's actually a lot colder than the surrounding space.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:29.220
And the amount of Hawking radiation given off is a lot fainter than anything else in the universe.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:34.120
The only hope is to find a really tiny Black hole, a primordial microscopic Black hole.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.480
and those could be exploding today.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.060
It's possible that we've been observing them in terms of gamma ray bursts or something like that.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.340
It would just be very hard to tell whether or not you are actually observing an exploding Black hole,

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.040
and probably there aren't any.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.600
But that would be the biggest hope to find something.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:57.640
Actually Jennifer is an expert on the actual experiments in the lab for the Bill Andrews Black holes.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.300
JENNIFER: Ohh. I am not an expert.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.140
Expert is a strong word.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:04.280
Yes, there has small analogs that Bill Andrews was doing,

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.400
using what's a little bit like water going down a drain.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:13.440
He is basically been able to create sonic analogs of Black holes, or with mechanical water waves

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.960
where you actually do get a kind of trapped effect similar to light not being able to escape,

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.580
suddenly sound can't escape.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.960
He's actually had a lot of very interesting hands-on experimental work with us.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.780
The maths isn't exactly the same as for a Black hole,

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:31.760
but it's essentially what amounts to a toy model with some experimental evidence.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.680
So the hope there is that through the small-scale experiments,

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.720
they can actually get some insights into the larger full Black hole equations.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.800
SEAN: Yes.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.700
MAN: I have two questions,

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.240
both unrelated and related depending on your point of view.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.500
The first question is that...SEAN: complementarity! MAN: Exactly.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:00.060
So normal Black holes, supermassive, and these theoretical micro ones,

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.820
are they different sized animals of the same species

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.540
at least from a behaviour perspective?

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.840
or is it different species? First question.

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.180
Second: in terms of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:21.000
As far as information transfer, is there 100% fidelity of the conservation of information,

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.120
or is there noise in the system?

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.240
SEAN: the first answer is that they are certainly the same species.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:34.600
They are the same animal; in fact, Black holes are arguably the simplest things in the universe.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.460
If you tell me what the mass of a Black hole is, what its electric charge is, and how fast it's spinning,

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.140
you have told me everything there is to know.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:46.320
It's not like a planet where you have to tell me the topography and what it's made of and all those things.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.820
Black holes are all very simple and basically identical to each other.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:58.660
The information laws, you know, again we think an absolutely iron-clad rule of physics,

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.520
that information is 100% super-duper conserved.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.000
It's like being a little bit pregnant, a little bit of information loss is very noticeable.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.980
We could be wrong about that, but that is the thought.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.840
That is the idea that we are working on.

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:18.980
JENNIFER: I think I would just add one thing, which is Black holes of different sizes actually radiate faster.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.140
If they are smaller they disappear almost instantaneously.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.100
If they are larger... So you know, the rate of which they evaporate is tied to their size,

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.580
and that's the only difference. I mean, they are pretty much the same species

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.100
but there are different size scales,

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.960
and the does affect the rate of which they evaporate away.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.080
SEAN: Someone right here had a question.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.200
BOY: Thanks. That was a wonderful lecture.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:53.520
Going back to the holographic effect, if you end that door there...yeah that one...

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.020
and there's no space between you and the door,

01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:01.940
what would happen to the information of the air between you and the door?

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:06.680
SEAN: Well it's not...that's a very good question, but you have to understand exactly what's being said.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.820
If you think about a hologram, have you seen a hologram? BOY: Yeah.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:15.900
So it's a two-dimensional piece of film that you shine light on and a three-dimensional image appears.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.480
So the holographic principle is saying that this room is like that.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.800
So it's not saying that there's no air or no space in between me and the door.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:31.400
What it's saying that all of the information needed to talk about the air in between me and the door,

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.420
is embedded in some secret invisible two-dimensional space.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.600
But it is all there.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.460
There are fewer ways that there could be air in between me and the door,

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.200
than you might have thought,

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.280
because there isn't as much room in the two-dimensional hologram to put them

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.200
as there would be in a three-dimensional space.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.980
BOY: Thanks.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:56.320
MAN: This follows on, actually from talking about this principle of two-dimensional space,

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.860
in which three-dimensional information is encoded.

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:03.720
I just wondered if you could talk about how this relates to the prediction of the string theory,

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.840
which predicts a lot more dimensions, I believe,

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:12.340
and what we actually mean by dimensions in both circumstances.

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.580
JENNIFER: That's on you. SEAN: Yeah, you would think that they would get their story straight,

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.620
and decide whether there are more or fewer dimensions than we thought there were.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.360
But it's actually quite compatible.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.820
In the string theory, there are supposed to be extra dimensions of space,

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.960
which are invisible to us for a completely different reason.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:36.880
Those dimensions are invisible to us because they are curled up, into a little tiny ball,

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.420
and we can't see them; they are much smaller than atoms,

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:46.420
OR we are stuck on some three-dimensional surface inside some bigger space and we just literally can't get there.

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:54.300
This is saying that, all of those descriptions are ways of talking about curved space-time,

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.000
but the right way to talk about the fundamental nature in curved space-time

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.960
is just to go one dimension less.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:06.620
So however many dimensions there really are, in the fundamental description of reality,

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:12.200
curved space-time with gravity always appears like it has one dimension more.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.320
That seems to be the principle that holography works on.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.360
So it might be that the real number of dimensions of space-time is eight,

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:26.260
and therefore gravity works in nine-dimensional space-time; that's one of the theories you can write about.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.880
MAN: is there any suggestion that there is a link

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.120
between quantum gravity and dark energy or dark matter?

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:40.980
SEAN: Any question that begins with "is there a suggestion", the answer is Yes.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.040
People have suggested that.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:51.120
Dark matter is probably quite parochial and conventional by these terms.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.580
It's probably just another particle that we haven't found yet.

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:58.920
People have tried more outlandish ideas: it' a modification of gravity; something holographic,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.360
something like that.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.720
Those ideas literally don't fit the data very well.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.840
Whereas the idea that dark matter is just another particle seems to fit the data very well.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.680
Dark energy, which is more subtle, it's something that is smoothly distributed throughout the universe,

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.160
and makes the universe accelerate.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.540
We have less idea where the origin of that is, so it's absolutely possible that when we do,

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.540
it will in some way involve ideas like holography,

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.140
but I really can't tell you precisely how.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.200
SEAN: Right there.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.240
MAN: Hi, you spoke already about how quantising gravity

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.240
was one of the greatest challenges in modern physics.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.500
Could you comment on how cosmic inflation helps explain that?

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.640
SEAN: Don't think it does, is the short answer.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.640
But it might help us learn something about what works.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.640
so inflation is this idea that in the first, a very very tiny fraction a second after the Big Bang,

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:58.340
the universe underwent a huge fast amount of expansion that smoothed everything out,

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.480
and left us with the universe we see today.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.000
The models that we have of inflation are basically classical,

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.300
are basically not involving quantum gravity.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.080
There is a little bit of quantum field theory in there, but gravity is still classical in that regime.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:17.720
So you don't need quantum gravity to make inflation work, nor does inflation rely on quantum gravity in any way.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.500
However, if inflation is real and we can get observational evidence about it,

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:29.760
it is a phenomenon that happens at an energy scale much closer to the energy scales of quantum gravity

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.380
than any other phenomenon that we have any way to observe in the universe today.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:39.720
So literally the difference in energy between the temperature of the air in this room,

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.000
and the protons that you smash together at the LHC, the Large Hadron Collider,

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:51.460
is less than the difference in energy between those large hadron collider protons and the inflation energy.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.220
So if we can make that leap up to inflation, which maybe we have with recent data about microwave background,

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:02.340
that's as much of a leap forward in energy as all of the previous rest of the history of physics.

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.820
SEAN: This side. Do we have any...ah good.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.020
MAN: Hi, thanks again for the talk. Fantastic.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.260
I wanted to ask, would you comment on what these paradoxes might mean

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:24.380
for our understanding of cosmology in the sense of the origin of the universe, and its future.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:31.900
In particular, I think I remember reading that holography may link what we think of eteranl inflation

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.120
and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.960
What we think are completely different things,

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.780
are somehow linked via holography, but no idea if I got that right,  or How.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.080
SEAN: Yeah, you do actually have that right.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.940
So, complementarity. The question is, what is this thing got to do with cosmology?

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.980
It's interesting, because as a cosmologist, my goal in choosing my career was

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:59.160
to go into the simplest possible area of science, cos the universe is actually very simple.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.660
You ignore all the details and just look at it on large scales.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.360
And yet, I went wrong, because Black hole are actually even simpler than the universe

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.720
So applying these ideas to cosmology is hard, cos the universe can do more things than a Black hole can do.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:18.000
It's like that question; Black holes just can't do many...there is just not that many possible Black holes.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:23.780
Having said that, let's imagine taking complementarity very very seriously.

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:29.920
Complementarity says that the point of view of someone outside the horizon is different than someone inside the horizon.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.040
So because our universe is accelerating out, because there is dark energy,

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:39.420
there is a different kind a horizon that we are inside.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:45.600
If distant galaxies move far enough away, they are accelerated away by the expansion of the universe

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.760
and we will never see them again.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.920
So they are outside the horizon.

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:55.000
So certain ambitious physicists have said, that maybe there is this certain complementarity

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.020
that works for cosmological horizons,

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.460
as well as Black hole horizons.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:04.620
And if that were to be true, what we will be saying is that, the entire description of the universe,

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.960
is our observable universe plus our horizon.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.000
Everything outside is secretly embedded on our horizon.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.800
So you don't need to talk about the entire universe outside of what we can see.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.480
It's all secretly encoded in this local bit.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.180
OK.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:25.580
And if that's true, then quantum mechanics says the universe is like any other quantum mechanical system,

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.560
it can be a superposition of different possibilities.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.320
So this observable bit of universe can be a superposition of different states of being.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.820
and that would be the cosmological multiverse.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:40.300
So the many-worlds in quantum mechanics and the cosmological multiverse would be brought together

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.200
in a happy relationship, and it's all completely speculative at this point.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.200
JENNIFER: Is there one up there?

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.840
SEAN: I haven't seen any up there but there are a couple of plucky folks over here.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.620
Is there anyone up there?

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:05.900
MAN: I just wanted to talk about dark energy and inflation.

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:13.100
If you imagine a speedboat going across water, and the speedboat itself is inflation,

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.500
the ripples behind it might be dark energy,

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:25.840
because dark energy says that things that are furthest away from us are moving further away fastest,

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.600
and those that are closest to us are moving away less quickly.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:34.300
So that would be the same thing with the speedboat, with the ripples coming out from the speedboat.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.560
As you get further away from the actual speedboat, the ripples themselves move slower.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.700
So are we looking for something that doesn't actually exist? It's just inflation.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:49.020
SEAN: So, my personal point of view is that the speedboat analogy is probably not the best one,

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:53.640
because inflation is not the movement of something through something else.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.260
It is literally the size of the universe changing with time.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:02.760
It is true that when we talk about the acceleration of the universe and dark energy,

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:08.580
distant galaxies are moving away from us faster than nearby galaxies.

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.420
But that's only because the universe is expanding.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:16.940
That was still true even before we knew about dark energy or the acceleration of the universe.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.000
Edwin Hubble's famous law says that the apparent velocity of a galaxy,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.280
is its distant times a constant called the Hubble's constant.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.720
So as the distant gets bigger, the apparent velocity gets bigger and bigger.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.260
That's really just explained by the fact that there is more space,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.280
in between you and the distant thing.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.880
So, it's a tricky thing, because we very naturally fall back on analogies,

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:46.020
that relate what the universe is doing to things that we are familiar with,

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.200
all of which are things inside the universe, doing things, subsets of the universe doing things.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.860
But in some ways, the universe is a unique kind of beast.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:59.840
I think that dark energy really needs to be some kind of energy.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.660
I don't think it's sort of automatic or anything like that.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:03.940
MAN: Sure.

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:12.240
MAN: Thank you. I'm still having a little trouble understanding what you were saying when...

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.240
SEAN: What?

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.220
Alright...

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:23.720
MAN: Back early on with you Alice photon falling into the Black hole, and your Bob photon being emitted.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:30.340
Why is it that Bob is emitted? Why can't he just hang around outside the event horizon for a little while,

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.540
and then follow Alice in just a little bit later?

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:36.720
And sort of following on from that,

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.860
I also don't quite see where this Firewall comes from.

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.180
Does that come from the same phenomenon as the original Hawking radiation?

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.100
Or is that just something else that would give us a similar prediction?

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:57.140
SEAN: So to the first question, why couldn't Bob just hang out?

01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.560
Have you ever tried hanging out right next to the event horizon of a Black hole?

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:09.280
I thinks as Jennifer mentioned, most of the virtual particles near the event horizon do just stay there.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.940
They get created and they get annihilated very quickly; they don't escape to infinity.

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:17.900
So when we draw these pictures, we are just picking out the plucky ones that manage to escape.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.220
So most of the virtual particles are just sitting there near the horizon.

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.360
The important thing about those particles is that,

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:29.780
if the combination of the states of all those particles looks like empty space,

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.500
it must be that all those particles are entangled with each other,

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.720
in a very intricate way, in a very intimate way I should say.

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.700
The Firewall paradox is just saying that,

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.260
if you want to get the information out

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:48.540
from Bob and all the other particles coming on later,

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.580
then it can't be true that Bob and Alice are entangled at the same time.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.640
If Bob is entangled with Alice, he is not entangled with anything else,

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.420
and therefore the information is getting lost every time  he leaves.

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:03.260
But as soon as you disentangle Alice and Bob down there,

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.780
it's no longer empty space.

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.980
It's a wall of high energy particles.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:11.280
That's the Firewall claim in a nutshell.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.920
JENNIFER: Finally someone back here.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:22.440
MAN: Yeah, sorry...OK so just another question relating vaguely to entanglement,

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:26.800
and I'm sorry if this was covered in the lecture and I maybe dropped off and missed it.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:31.340
It was very interesting. That could be the beer I had earlier.

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.380
So when you talk about entanglement,

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:44.380
in my mind, that is a way of you describing a supposition, which is a way of you saying that

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.480
something you observe infers the truth about something else.

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:54.140
So for example, if you observe that the ball is blue,

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.400
that implies that the other ball is red.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:01.900
But regardless of whether you observe one truth or another truth,

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:07.580
both of those truths still exist, whether you observe them or not.

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:11.180
so a ball is still blue and a ball is still red, somewhere.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:17.800
So as soon as you observe whether one ball is blue or red or whatever,

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:23.220
then that entanglement, in a way, does that cease to exist?

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:26.020
Because you observed that one ball is red,

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:29.000
the other ball becomes blue; they are entangled.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.720
But does that relationship maintain, so if you were able to change the ball you have observed to red,

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.080
does the other one become blue?

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.160
Or does that entanglement cease at some point of observation?

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:40.060
This is kind of my question.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.480
I don't know if that makes sense.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.400
SEAN: It is a perfectly good question, and there are two things.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:48.760
One is that, yes the entanglement does persist.

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:55.220
When you observe one box, or one ball, the entanglement that was there, stays there.

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:57.180
So one way to be entangled is,

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.260
this ball is definitely red, and this ball is definitely blue.

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.920
It's a kind of entanglement.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.260
More interestingly, there is a fraction of the superposition that is red and blue,

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.760
and the opposite that is blue and red over here.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.820
But the point is when you make an observation and make this one red,

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.520
that one instantly becomes blue.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.740
They are still entangled, just in a more trivial way.

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:21.100
And that is an experimental fact.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.740
That is not just a theory; we have done that experiment.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.360
We have put them in superpositions, move them apart and observe them,

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.300
and then checked, and it always works out exactly as we predicted.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:37.600
MAN: So can you then sort of reboot the supposition with the same two particles?

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.180
SEAN: You can...once have observed the particle and you have seen that it's red or blue,

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:47.120
it stays red or blue. So that is what's called collapse of the wave function, in quantum mechanics.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.820
and it's very mysterious, collapse of the wave function.

01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:52.180
Before you saw, it was in a superposition,

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.260
afterward, it's one or the other,

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.800
and that's what it's going to be from now on.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:01.640
You have come very close to inventing what is called many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics,

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.860
which says that, MAN: Thank you very much.

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.340
SEAN: when I...You are late!

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.640
MAN: I'll take that. I'll call or text my mom. She'd be very proud.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.500
JENNIFER: about a hundred years too late.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.540
SEAN: A little bit too late, and the guy who invented it kind of went crazy.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.640
Hugh Everett, who invented the many-worlds interpretation,

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:23.740
said look, when you talk about these experiments, you have to realise that

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:26.900
you, a human being are made of quantum mechanical particle,

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:28.540
so you obey the rules of quantum mechanics.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:32.660
You have a quantum state that can be in superposition.

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:35.340
When you open the box, and look to see if the box if red or blue,

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.780
it's not that you see it red, and the blueness disappears, or vice versa.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:47.860
It's that you evolve into a superposition of the ball was red and you saw it red,

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.040
plus the ball was blue and you saw it blue.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:55.360
There are now two different copies of the world in which you saw different things going on.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:00.800
They are both equally real, and they will never communicate with each other ever again.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.700
They are for all intensive purposes, separate worlds,

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.680
multiple worlds in reality.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.840
If you believe that, which I do actually, I think that it's probably true,

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:15.780
you should go to the APP store and download something called universe splitter.

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:20.500
It is an iPhone APP, where it gives you two options and you can say,

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:24.940
I would like to study physics in graduate school, or study philosophy in graduate school.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.060
It will send a signal to a lab that sends a photon and splits it then observe it,

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.600
and it comes back and tells you which branch of the wave function of the universe you are in,

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.280
and you should o study philosophy.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.660
And if you promise you'd do what the phone tells you to do,

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.920
there is another branch of reality in which you became a physicist.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.580
MAN: And when do I go on the X-factor... SEAN: That's right!

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.860
MAN: Thank you!

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:52.800
SEAN: One more question, good right in the middle right there. You can just move it right there.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:03.140
WOMAN: I read earlier this year that Stephen Hawking , I think, probably in connection with the Firewall,

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.160
wrote an issue, with saying something about maybe Black holes didn't exist,

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.780
as such as having an event horizon.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.960
and maybe had more of an apparent horizon instead.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.640
Can you sort of say a bit about that? Sort of explain it a bit, sort of how it adds to the debate?

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.360
JENNIFER: Well I can say something as a science writer, that the new covered was terrible of that.

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:27.020
That's actually not what he said.

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.760
The headlines and some of the covers of that were not very good, I think,

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.260
really hadn't looked very deeply into what Hawking was actually saying.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:40.900
If you ask Sean, Sean will tell you that he thinks Hawking is possibly not correct.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:44.060
I will let you elaborate. SEAN: It's one of the few times in my life,

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.440
where I thought to myself: of course Stephen Hawking.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.080
Because he wrote this paper, and it was really just a conference proceedings.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.380
He had given a talk, and he typed it up in his computer

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.500
And he ended it off. It was very short; there were no details, no equations.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.060
it was just like a suggestion.

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:02.640
But because his name is Stephen Hawking, and he's done amazingly wonderful things in the history of physics,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.980
and everyone pays attention to him,

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.880
people latched onto it, and there is this one sentence in his paper, which says that:

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:17.200
Therefore, Black holes do not exist in the sense that  blablabla. instead, they exist in this sense.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.740
And the headline in Nature the next day was

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.260
Stephen Hawking thinks that Black holes do not exist.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.920
So, if you go back the picture Jennifer showed of the centre of our galaxy,

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.700
remember, this is data.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.240
The orbits of these stars that are plotted here; it's done in a computer program,

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.900
but they are based on observations of the stars,

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.060
around a big plus sign.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.900
If you believe, it's a Black hole,

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.400
because it's enormously massive and enormously small and enormously dark.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.380
And Stephen Hawking, if you asked him: is there is Black hole in the centre of our galaxy? He would say yes.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.000
So I think that, he is gesturing in the direction of

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.040
a certain kind of resolution of the Black hole Firewalls problem,

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:08.560
to take the idea of an event horizon a little bit less seriously, given that Black holes eventually evaporate.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.620
But there is a long way to go before enough meat is put on those bones to call it even a proposal,

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.400
much less a theory.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:21.320
And I think I'm being told that we are out of space and time, so we will...

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.180
we have come to the end of space-time; thank you once again all for coming.

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:29.500
[APPLAUSE]
