SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN
COLBERT.

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.537 align:start size:88% position:13%
LET ME ASK YOU A PERSONAL
QUESTION.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.473
EVERYBODY FEELING GOOD?

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:06.940
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.211
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, CLEARLY,
CLEARLY YOU DO NOT WORK IN THE

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.946 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHITE HOUSE.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:16.583
BECAUSE IT IS WEDNESDAY, AND YOU
KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THAT AT THE

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.954
WHITE HOUSE, WE ARE SO HUMPED
DAY.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.288
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:25.125 align:start size:88% position:13%
LET ME REMIND YOU, RECAP THE
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.762
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA TO

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.198
INFLUENCE OR ELECTION AND THE
DIDN'T HAPPEN, DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.266
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:37.570
WELL, TURNS OUT IT DID, AND THEY
DO.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.276
BECAUSE YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP,
JR. RELEASED EMAILS EXPLICITLY

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:47.447
DETAILING AN INVITATION BY THE
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO COLLUDE,

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:54.454
AND HIS ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE,
QUOTE, I LOVE IT!

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:59.959
OH, OH DON, NOT AS MUCH AS I DO.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.934 align:start size:88% position:13%
YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.970
NOW LISTEN, JUST TO GIVE YOU,
OKAY, SO THAT WAS YESTERDAY,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.474
THAT WAS YESTERDAY, WE HAVE HAD
A FULL NEWS CYCLE TO GIVE YOU A

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:18.144
SENSE OF THE FALLOUT LET ME
PRESENT YOU WITH A BOUQUET OF

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.346
EARLY BLOOMING HEADLINES.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.749
THE WHITE HOUSE IS PARALYZED.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.754
AND I'M PRETTY SURE TRUMPCARE
DOES NOT COVER THAT.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.422
I SEE ANOTHER ONE, READY?

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
HERE WE GO.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:32.559
HERE'S ANOTHER HEADLINE.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:37.797 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE WHITE HOUSE IS FACING A
CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:40.266
AND REMEMBER REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTS HAVE A SPOTTY TRACK

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:44.737
RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING
WITH HURRICANES.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT, OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.876
THOSE WERE "THE WASHINGTON POST"
AND CNN.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:54.647
HOW ABOUT HEARING FROM SOMEONE
ON THEIR SIDE, TRY "THE NEW YORK

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.717
POST." DONALD TRUMP, JR. IS AN
IDIOT, YES.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.853 align:start size:88% position:13%
YES.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:03.957
(APPLAUSE)E
YES, KEEP IN MIND, KEEP THIS IN

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:08.728
MIND, AND I MEAN THIS, THEY ARE
DEFENDING HIM.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:12.665
BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO IDIOT
IS INMEAT AND IT'S HARD TO ARGUE

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:13.633 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT POINT.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.303 align:end position:100%
DONALD TRUMP, JR. IS QUICKLY
RISING TO THE RANKS OF AMERICA'S

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.039
MOST EMBARRASSING DONALD TRUMPS.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:25.845 align:end position:100%
THINGS ARE SO BAD, THINGS ARE SO
BAD, CHECK OUT THIS TWEET OF

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:29.382
STAFFERS AND WHITE HOUSE
VISITORS PLACING THEIR HANDS ON

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.552
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRAYING FOR
HIM TODAY.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:32.852 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER).

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.422
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, EITHER THAT,
EITHER THAT OR THEY ARE PLAYING

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.058
HANDS ON A SOFT BODY.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:44.564 size:88% position:56%
WHOEVER KEEPS THEIR HAND THE
LONGEST GETS TO FIRE ROBERT

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:44.797 align:start size:88% position:13%
MUELLER.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:49.936
SO WITH HIS AGENDA IN TATTERSES,
WITH HIS WHITE HOUSE PARALYZED,

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.506
IN TURMOIL, WITH HIS FAMILY IN
DISGRACE, THE PRESIDENT DID THE

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:57.010
RIGHT THING AND HEADED TO FRANCE
TONIGHT.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.848
FRANCE, AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE,
THAT IT'S SAYS SAFE SPACE, TRUMP

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:07.086
IS LIKE JERRY LEWIS OVER THERE
IN THAT HE SEEMS LIKE AN IDIOT,

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:11.991
BECAUSE THIS PROOF OF THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN'S COLLUSION MAY HAVE

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:15.461
COST THE PRESIDENT SOMETHING HE
LOVES EVEN MORE THAN HIS SON.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.166
IT WILL COST HIM HIS FAVORITE
CATCH PHRASE BECAUSE LAST NIGHT

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.835
ONE WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR ADMITTED
THE RUSSIA STORY WILL GET WORSE

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:31.044 align:end position:100%
AND WORSE AND YOU CAN'T JUST
REALLY SAY ANY MORE "FAKE NEWS."

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.647
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:35.815
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN'T.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.383
YOU CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.184 align:start size:88% position:13%
CAN'T SAY IT.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:43.356
I KNOW HOW DONALD TRUMP IS GOING
TO FEAL ABOUT THAT.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.791 align:start size:88% position:13%
SAD.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:52.532 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO TONIGHT WE BID A FOND
FAIRWELL.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.500 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WE ARE FIGHTING THE FAKE
NEWS.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.236
IT'S FAKE, PHONEY, FAKE.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:00.707
&gt;&gt; YOU NOTICE NOW THEY'RE USING,
EVERYBODY IS USING THE WORD FAKE

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:00.907 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEWS.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHERE DID YOU HEAR IT FIRST,
FOLKS.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.179
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL FAKE NEWS, IT'S
PHONEY STUFF T DIDN'T HAPPEN.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:13.720 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; FAKE NEWS, CNN.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
FAKE.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:21.894
WHAT, THE CAMERA JUST WENT OFF.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:31.304
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:36.976 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M CRYING FAKE
TEARS.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.978
(LAUGHTER)
SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AGREES,

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:41.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
TRUMP, JR. WAS DUMB TO TWEET
THIS STUFF.

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:45.184
AND THE SMART THING TO DO WOULD
BE JUST TO SHUT UP.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:48.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO LAST NIGHT HE WENT ON FOX
NEWS.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.990 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER)
AND EXPLAINED WHY HE IS NOT

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.859 size:88% position:56%
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THIS.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.160 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; SOMEONE SENT ME AN EMAIL.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.497
I CAN'T HELP WHAT SOMEONE SENDS
ME.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, HE CAN'T
HELP.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:03.136
HE HAS TO DO WHATEVER IT SAYS IN
AN EMAIL THAT IS WHY HIS

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.205
APARTMENT IS FULL OF NIGERIAN
PRINCES AND BONER PILLS.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.808
YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP
THEM APART.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:13.146
YOU ARE TBING TO WANT TO KEEP
THOSE TWO, KEEP THOSE TWO APART.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.947
PLUS THIS WAS WAY LAST SUMMER.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:18.951
IT WAS A TOTAL LEIGH DIFFERENT
TIME.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.722
&gt;&gt; THIS IS PREYOU WERE RUSSIA
REFER, PRERUSSIA MANIA, 13

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:26.025
MONTHS AGO BEFORE THE REST OF
THE WORLD WAS TALKING ABOUT

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:26.225 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.728
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, HE COLLUDED
WITH THE RUSSIA BEFORE PEOPLE

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:32.265 align:start size:88% position:13%
WERE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN
COLLUSION.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:37.136
THAT'S LIKE SAYING YEAH, I FIRED
A GUN AT THAT GUY BUT THAT WAS

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.639
BEFORE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING
ABOUT THIS WHOLE MURDER TRIAL,

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.206 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL RIGHT.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:43.142 align:start size:88% position:13%
HOW DID I KNOW.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:43.609

TO-- BESIDES, I MEAN, THE

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.618 size:84% position:42%
MEETING WAS A DUED.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.955
&gt;&gt; IT WAS LITERALLY JUST A
WASTED 20 MINUTES WHICH WAS A

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:56.155 align:start size:88% position:13%
SHAME.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:59.425
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, IT WAS ALL
ON HIS YELP REVIEW, ONE STAR,

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:04.564
DID NOT DELIVER TREASON TO
TABLE, WOULD NOT COLLUDE AGAIN.

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:07.266
AND, IT'S GOING TO BE HARSH FOR
HER BUSINESS.

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:10.470 align:start size:88% position:13%
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE
SHAKING THAT ONE OFF.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.173
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU, DON,
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR

SECRET RUSSIAN A INTEL DOESN'T
MEAN ARE YOU THE GOOD GUY HERE,

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:23.883
YOU NEVER HEARD THE PERVS SAY

GOING, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:36.162 align:start size:88% position:13%
(APPLAUSE)
BUT DON, JR. DID LEARN AN

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.997
IMPORTANT LESSON FROM ALL THIS.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.967 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; IN RETROSPECT, I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS A LITTLE

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:41.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
DIFFERENTLY.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.637
I KNOW MORE NOW BUT HINDSIGHT IS
ALWAYS 2020.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:49.075 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S RIGHT,
HINDSIGHT IS 20-20.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:56.015
AND I THINK A LOT OF VOTERS WILL
BE USING HINDSIGHT IN 2020.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:07:00.486

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:05.792

HUNT, FISH AND RUN HIS FAMILY'S
REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.971
YES, WHY DID WE FORCE HIM TO GET
INTO POLITICS.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:22.341

THIS KID IS A 39 YEAR OLD MAN.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:49.902

STICKING UP FOR YOU WANTS TO
REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

CLEARLY SHE'S A COLLUDE TEASE.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:30.977

SIR, YOU HAVE TO GET UP, IT'S
TIME TO GO TO BED.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:54.600

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.991

WE ARE FOCUSED ON FLYING,
LANDING AND MANY OTHER THINGS.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.267
&gt;&gt; I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME FOR
WATCHING TV.
