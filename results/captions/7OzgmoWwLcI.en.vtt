00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
the update if you're able to stay we'd
certainly encourage you to do so if you

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.540
need to leave God bless you have a great
week in the Lord and if we don't see on

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
Thursday night for our teaching through
the Psalms then we'll see you Lord willing

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:27.840
next week so for today's update I sense
that the Lord would have me to answer a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.930
question concerning the understanding of
the times in which we are living I think

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.300
you would agree with me when I say this
but doesn't it seem like the world is I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:56.840
mean upside down backwards and getting
worse seemingly with each passing day

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.600
would you agree with this that the times
in which we are living

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.580
evil is now seen as good and good is now
seen as evil I was thinking about this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.159
this last week in fact I was talking to
my wife about it we were reflecting back

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.030
on the 70s again you young people will
get right back to you just bear with us

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:38.189
even the 60s and we fast forwarded the
video of time to the present and it's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.119
pretty astonishing if you really think
about it how much has changed since that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:54.180
time the times that we're living in
today are so much worse than they were

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.040
even twenty years ago thirty years ago
things that you would never have

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.790
imagined are now considered to be the
norm

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:21.100
evil is now good and good is now evil as
one has noted evil is live backwards L I V E

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:36.220
E V I L lived is devil backwards now I
say that because everything's backwards

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:46.230
the evil is literally backwards it's
upside down in Isaiah chapter 5 verse 20

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:55.019
there is a curse that is pronounced woe
to those who call evil good and good

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:03.540
evil by the way this is not whoa no woe
is a curse okay I just wanted to clarify

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.189
that again for the benefit of you
younger people here today just so you

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.329
understand that in our day woe bad
curse okay

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.739
kind of reminds me I'm sorry I'm
digressing here but I can't resist I

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.769
can't help myself so my son it's a couple
years back came home from school one day

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.780
and he goes wow Baba that's really sick
I'm like whoa what you're sick no that's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.750
really sick let's see what do you mean
oh that no it's really cool I'm like what

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.519
sick means cool so now if I say
something is sick that means something

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.560
is cool Jesus is coming back
well when sick is cool Jesus is coming

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.099
back anyway just again I digress forgive
me

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:59.669
Isaiah chapter five verse 20 woe to
those who call evil good and good evil

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:07.169
who put darkness for light and light for
darkness who put bitter for sweet and

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:15.060
sweet for bitter would you again agree
with me that this would be an apt

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.389
description of the world today what we
see happening in the world today

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:32.070
specifically if I can be specific as it
relates to the United States and Israel

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:44.969
I hope you'll kindly indulge me as I
first propose for why questions then I

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.969
want to provide a biblical answer that I
believe will give us a much-needed

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:57.510
perspective prophetically and even
discernment when it comes to discerning

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.320
the times that we're living in the first
why question which we did talk about in

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:13.699
depth last week is this why is there a
movement to impeach a pro-israel

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:25.919
president and remove a strong Israel
Prime Minister simultaneously we again

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.960
talked about this last week this has I
believe profound prophetic implications

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.669
but as of today we're now only thirty
days away from the elections in Israel

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.000
which will take place on April 9th now
the significance of this is that the

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.060
Trump administration is planning to
unveil the long-anticipated

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.940
quote/unquote deal of the century
subsequent to the April 9th elections in

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:06.589
Israel second question why did the House
of Representatives antisemitism

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:17.419
resolution end up with this watered-down
inclusion of all bigotry all hate and

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:25.099
even Islamophobia it started off as an
anti-israel

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:31.399
anti-semitic resolution The Times of
Israel published a report on Friday

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:40.340
about the house voting 407 to 23 for
measures seen as a rebuke of this Illhan Ormar's

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.960
anti-semitic comments she's one
of two women elected to the House of

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:54.900
Representatives and this was after this
infighting within the Democratic Party

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.660
that actually ended up leading to the
inclusion of all of these other types of

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.620
hate including namely Islamophobia the
inclusion came under a section that

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:14.270
stated in the end and I quote this was
the resolution whereas listen white

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:21.139
supremacist in the United States white
supremacist in the United States have

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:27.840
exploited and continued to exploit
bigotry and weaponize hate for political

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.590
gain targeting traditionally persecuted
peoples including African Americans

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:46.020
Latinos Native Americans Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders and other people

00:07:46.020 --> 00:08:00.770
of color Jews Muslims Hindus Sikhs Jews
Hindus Muslims Sikhs the LGBTQ community

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:11.430
immigrants and others with verbal
attacks incitement and violence I'm not

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:17.510
going to say it I almost did it I
told the Lord I wouldn't so there okay

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:27.360
let me catch my breath third why
question why is it now acceptable in

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.849
states like New York to kill human
babies while at the same time protecting

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:41.279
non-human animal life CNS news on
Tuesday quoted my pillow CEO Mike

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:47.970
Lindell I like Mike I like his pillow
too I have one great too yeah right

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:58.320
yeah so I had to include some levity in
that one I think he spoke at a recent

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:06.680
CPAC conference and said quote I see a
party saving minnows in California and

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:18.990
killing babies in New York are you
kidding me fourth why question why is

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:25.830
the Christian Church in America in
decline and why are young people not

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:35.040
wanting anything to do with the church
in our day today on Thursday the

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.530
Christian Post published an article
about a new study from Exponential by

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:47.610
LifeWay Research that found a majority
of churches are in decline or flatlining

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:57.450
and have fewer than 100 people attending
services each Sunday in their book

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:05.250
Already Gone Ken Ham and Britt Beamer
answer the question of why America's

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:11.550
churches have lost an entire generation
of believers you might be shocked to

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:19.080
know this but it's not necessarily by
the time they get to college here's what

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:27.270
the study found we're losing our kids in
elementary middle school and high school

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:37.920
and the culprit as they refer to it is
the Sunday-school syndrome which they

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:45.990
say is contributing to the epidemic
rather than helping alleviate it okay

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:54.990
bear with me please I suppose the
question now becomes one of okay what

00:10:54.990 --> 00:11:01.020
can we do in light of our understanding
of

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.300
these perilous times in which we live we
shouldn't be surprised Paul writing to

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:13.709
Timothy said listed 19 things that would
mark the last days when perilous times

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:22.380
would come 19 things and they're horrific
they're unthinkable that would mark the

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:30.300
last days the end times the time of the
end in First Chronicles chapter 12 the

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:37.230
first part of verse 32 we're told that
the sons of Issachar had understanding

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:44.580
of the times and as such they knew what
Israel ought to do in other words when

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:50.910
we first understand and discern the
times and realize that the times we are

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:58.380
in are the end times the last days the
last moments of world history as we know

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:04.020
it because we've discerned the times we
understand the times I think of when

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:09.750
Jesus rebuked the religious leaders they
could interpret the weather the signs of

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.860
the weather the signs of the sky but
they could not discern the times that

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:22.459
they were in that was the Savior of the
world in front of them God becoming man

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:29.570
tabernacling amongst us and they didn't
understand it they didn't discern it and

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:37.010
thus they didn't know what to do it's
when we have this understanding this

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:45.630
discernment that we're then better
equipped to answer all of these why

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:57.450
questions why is the world upside down
why is evil good and good evil I hope

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:10.140
this doesn't sound too simplistic but I
think the answer is this Satan I don't

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.960
want to give him too much credit but
Satan has strategically

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:20.240
deceived the world and the world has
believed the Word of God and the God of

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:35.300
the Word cannot be trusted that's why
that's why not just the world sadly the

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:43.610
church many a pastor has lost confidence
in the infallibility of God's Word they

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:54.410
don't believe it no wonder our young
people don't want anything to do with

00:13:54.410 --> 00:14:02.930
church no wonder they're already gone
and there's nothing new under the Sun by

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:10.670
the way it started in Genesis 3:1 we're
told that the serpent was more cunning

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:16.339
than any beast of the field which the
Lord God had made and he said to the

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:24.620
woman listen has God indeed said you
shall not eat of every tree of the

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:38.569
garden question mark in other words did
God really create the heavens and the

00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:47.829
earth and the sea and all that in them
is in seven in six days six literal days

00:14:48.010 --> 00:15:02.060
did God really and see the attack is on the
book of Genesis because see if Satan can

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:11.750
get us to start questioning doubting the
book of Genesis he's got us then nothing

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:18.980
else can be relied upon if it if you
can't rely on the book of Genesis at the

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:27.440
very beginning then everything else
following is also unreliable

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:36.680
I would submit that one can find the
answers in Genesis as to why the world

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:45.290
is the way it is today I'll take it a
step further and suggest that Satan has

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:51.949
succeeded in large measure in deceiving
the world by attacking specifically the

00:15:51.949 --> 00:16:00.649
reliability of the Genesis account and
here's why think about this if Genesis

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:09.550
cannot be taken literally then marriage
isn't between one man and one woman

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:18.819
if Genesis cannot be taken literally
then maybe we did evolve from animals

00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:28.569
and if we did evolve from animals no
wonder that people act like animals

00:16:28.569 --> 00:16:40.910
should we be surprised do you see how
cunning and sssubtle SSSatan is did God

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:49.509
really question mark doubt oh ah

00:16:50.829 --> 00:17:07.069
maybe the earth is billions and billions
of years old I want to recommend Answers

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:14.780
in Genesis this is the Ministry of Ken
Ham it's an apologetics ministry that is

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:21.169
dedicated to enabling Christians to
defend their faith and to proclaim the

00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:25.939
Gospel of Jesus Christ effectively 
let me just parenthetically say this we

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:36.710
have to teach our children the truth of
Genesis so that when they're in school

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.480
whether it's middle school high school
or even college

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.970
and they have that professor as my son
who goes to California State University

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:54.399
in San Marcos California had that
basically was one of these guys that you

00:17:54.399 --> 00:18:03.669
know says there's no God
there's no God I love my Levi man he's

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:09.340
my loving Levi he's like okay okay really
yeah anyway that maybe that's another

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:15.970
topic for another time but he stood his
ground he stood his ground because he

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.769
was grounded they have to be able to
answer that

00:18:20.769 --> 00:18:25.570
oh the you think the world was oh the
Big Bang Theory

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.909
really that takes more faith than to
believe in creation it's like one said

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:38.830
it's like a tornado ripping through a
junkyard and it creates a 747 that takes

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:44.220
a lot of faith man I'm going to give you
that wow

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:52.750
Answers in Genesis focuses on providing
answers to questions surrounding the

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:59.230
book of Genesis because it is the most
attacked book in the Bible they also

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:04.090
desire to train others to develop a
biblical worldview and seek to expose

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:17.399
with I mean thoroughly documented proof
of a six-day creation a young earth.

00:19:17.399 --> 00:19:31.720
evolution is impossible dare I say that
Christians today don't know how to

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.899
answer the questions the world is asking
and they're asking questions and they're

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:44.159
intelligent questions and we don't have
the answer we cannot give them a

00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:53.960
biblical answer to their intelligent
question so when somebody challenges us

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.869
and I don't say this to beat up on
anybody I just I'll include myself in

00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:08.960
this when somebody challenges us
concerning things like evolution and an

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.159
earth billions and billions of years old
by the way when it comes to dinosaurs

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:24.619
there is proof there is archaeological
proof scientific proof that man walked

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:33.710
with Dinosaurs they were not created
billions of years ago and there is proof

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:42.700
that there was a flood exactly as God
said there was and it was a global flood

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:52.249
exactly as God said it was going to be well
First Peter chapter 3 the second part of

00:20:52.249 --> 00:21:01.039
verse 15 says always always be prepared
to give an answer to everyone who asks

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:08.779
you to give the reason for the hope that
you have hear me out on this real quick

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:18.409
I truly believe there are two questions
that the world is asking us and looking

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:22.340
to us for answers as Christians you know
what they are

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:28.850
number one is it real and number two
does it work

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:34.159
you want to know why because they want
it to be real and they want it to work

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:41.480
because if it's real and it works now
they can have hope and they're looking

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:49.639
for hope they need hope and we have the
answer and we can give the reason for

00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:52.480
the hope that we have

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:10.210
listen just bear with me for a second
here

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:31.230
our only hope is Jesus Christ it's not
just the Blessed hope it's our only hope

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:41.710
it's Jesus Christ Jesus is the answer He
is the answer to everything and to

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:49.620
everyone and that's the answer we need
to give always to everyone who asks

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.840
there's something different about you
there's something peculiar about you I

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.770
mean you're not going out of your mind
with what's going on in the world

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.400
there's something about you that's
different you know what that something

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:14.410
is it's the person of Jesus Christ it's
the hope of the soon return of Jesus

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:19.090
Christ that's the thing that keeps me
sane I've said this again not hyperbole

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:27.460
that were it not for the hope that any
day soon and very soon that trumpet can

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.290
sound and the dead in Christ rise first
and we who are alive and remain will be

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:39.550
caught up to be with the Lord forever
were it not for that hope I would

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:49.450
literally go out of my mind I would not
be sane I would lose my sanity if I

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:57.610
didn't have that hope that's what keeps
me going that's what gets me up in the

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:06.340
morning and allows me to put my head on
the pillow my pillow sorry it's a gift I

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.850
don't know what

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:23.440
pray for me so it's what allows me to
sleep at night it's also what constrains

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:34.170
me propels me to pronounce to declare to
share the gospel of Jesus Christ the

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:41.920
good news of Jesus Christ and the good
news is is that Jesus came into this

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:49.810
dying world to save the world He was
crucified He was buried and He rose

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:56.880
again on the third day and He's coming
back again one day that's the good news

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:06.340
that's the hope that we have the Blessed
hope that's why we do these prophecy

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:17.110
updates it's really to sound the alarm
that our redemption draws near that as

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:22.390
things are happening in the world
exactly as we were told in God's Word

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:27.550
that they would happen Jesus said in
luke 21:28 when you see these things

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.750
begin to come to pass look up and lift
up your heads because your redemption

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:38.410
draws nigh I forget who I was sharing
this with it might have been at a

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:45.580
previous update maybe it was second
service but just give me a few more

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:55.360
minutes I was thinking about how much of
an impact Bible prophecy has had on my

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:05.490
life personally it has really changed my
life how I live my life in this world

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:13.230
it's loosened my grip on the things of
this world I have a very light touch on

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:19.030
the things of this world and my accounts
are very short because I know not the

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:24.820
day or the hour that He's going to
but I do know it's close so I want to

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.620
get my affairs in order
you know how sometimes the question is

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:35.170
asked if you knew that Jesus was coming
back this afternoon what would you do

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:41.050
right now all kinds of things come to
mind right people you would call letters

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:53.410
you might write things you might do can
I say it this way get it done what do you

00:26:53.410 --> 00:27:04.929
mean what are you waiting for He could
come this afternoon that's how close we

00:27:04.929 --> 00:27:15.929
are that's why you need to be ready I
need to be ready

00:27:15.929 --> 00:27:28.720
well I want to share the ABCs of
salvation as we do every week and before

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.679
I do I have to ask you to forgive me for
last week because I totally messed up I

00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:42.340
actually had to go back and see what I
said I hate listening to myself that's

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.860
like torture you want to punish me make
me listen to my own voice that'll do it

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:53.470
so I had to go back and I realized that
I didn't say what I needed to say so I

00:27:53.470 --> 00:28:01.000
actually have notes this time so you see
an email address on the screen and for

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.290
the benefit of our online church this is
the email address that we want for you

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:15.150
to email us your files of the ABCs of
salvation many people have requested the

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:21.820
cards the ABCs of salvation cards so
like the different translations in the

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:27.700

I'd like to order a bunch of those ABCs

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.049
of salvation cards there's there's only
one problem with that we don't sell them

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:56.190
we didn't actually even have them until
I asked my son to design one and he did

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:02.160
kind of got me out of a jam so he
created a very simple ABCs of salvation

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.640
is it's a very small card that you can
hand out so we uploaded it to our

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.460
website we also uploaded a PDF file of
the template if you want to print them

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.660
out now for those of you who want to
have them professionally printed we're

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.100
working with the Masters Touch these are
dear friends of mine and our ministry

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.970
and we might be able to work something
out where you can have them

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:32.100
professionally printed whether they're
the cards or the bookmarks or the Flyers

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:40.620

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.860
cards that you design so we can share
them with everybody that wants them

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:53.760
alright real quick why do we end with
the ABCs of salvation because it's a

00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:01.049
simple explanation of salvation this is
how to be saved and it's child-like

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:06.390
simple Jesus said unless you become like
a little child you cannot enter the

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:13.049
kingdom of heaven the gospel is very
simple the good news is very simple it's

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:21.059
ABC simple this is the simplest way for
you and I to be saved there's not the only

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:29.010
way but it's a simple way the A is for
admit or acknowledge that you're a

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:34.980
sinner and that you need the Savior that
you've sinned and fallen short of the

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:42.330
glory of God Romans 3:10 says there is
no one righteous not even one Romans

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:49.620
3:23 says all of us have sinned
and fallen short of the glory of God we

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:55.770
were all born sinners which is why Jesus
said we must be born again in order to

00:30:55.770 --> 00:31:04.740
enter the kingdom of heaven Romans 6:23
says that the wages of sin is really the

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:10.170
death penalty so all have sinned and
because all have sinned all have been

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:16.860
sentenced to death that's the bad news
here's the good news Jesus came and went

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:23.820
to His death and took care of your death
penalty paying for all of your sins and

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:32.460
now offers you because it's paid in full
the free gift of eternal life in Christ

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:39.030
Jesus our Lord and the B it's for
believe in your heart that Jesus Christ

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:44.430
is Lord and that God raised Him from the
dead now you might be thinking to

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:50.010
yourself well this is really simple
please know that we don't wish in any

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:56.490
way with these ABCs of salvation to
insult anybody's intelligence only that

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.020
it is this simple well this is too good
to be true

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:07.050
ok well God is good and God is true so
in God's economy there's no such thing

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.460
as too good to be true if it's too good
to be true it's God

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:16.800
Romans 10:9 and 10 says if you believe
in your heart that God raised Jesus from

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:25.920
the dead you will be saved that's the B
here's the C lastly the C is for call

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:32.580
upon the name of the Lord or as Romans
10:9 and 10 also says confess with your

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:40.710
mouth if you confess with your mouth
that Jesus is Lord and believe in your

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:46.080
heart that God raised Him from the dead
you will be saved and here's how it

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.660
works
for it is with your heart that you

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:53.660
believe and are justified and it is with
your mouth that you confess

00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:00.080
and are saved in Romans 10:13 is how you
confess with your mouth by calling upon

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:09.310
the name of the Lord all who call upon
the name of the Lord will be saved

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:16.610
that's how to be saved it's that simple
it's ABC simple if you're here this

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:21.260
morning in this amazing and wonderful
church that I'm so privileged to pastor

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.420
and you've never called upon the name of
the Lord

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:29.990
I implore you today to make the most
important decision you will ever make in

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:36.680
your life for eternal life you might be
watching online from somewhere anywhere

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:41.180
in the world and you're not watching
this video by accident God has brought

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:47.210
you to this video that was suggested in
your YouTube feed I want to encourage

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:55.160
you I want to implore you to respond to
the invitation to the offer that is

00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:01.250
given you freely the free gift of
eternal life once you all stand and we'll

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:09.970
pray thank you for your patience by the
way Father in heaven I

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:23.639
we see what's happening in the world and
it is exactly as You said it would be

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:29.860
thank You for telling us in Your word
what's going to happen before it happens

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:40.480
so when we see it begin to happen it'll
wake us up so that we'll realize that

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.070
the time is at hand
that we would be like the men of

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:52.210
Issachar who discerned the times
understood the lateness of the hour that

00:34:52.210 --> 00:35:01.300
they were in and that it was time for
David to be king well Lord now the time

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:10.600
has come for You our greater than David
the son of David the King of kings to

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:18.840
come Lord come quickly
Maranatha in Jesus' name Amen
