00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.120
What would make someone want to
move from California to become

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.040
a middle school teacher
in one of the poorest

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.930
areas of Baltimore, Maryland?

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.785
Take a look.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:09.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.310
Go over to your worksheet now.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.961
Can you read that question up
at the top nice and loud for us?

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:14.460
Hi.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.615
My name is Wyatt Oroke,
but my kids call me Mr. O.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.990
And I'm the humanities teacher
at City Springs Elementary

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.560
Middle School in Baltimore.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.340
There are neighborhoods
within Baltimore

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.290
that have been under-resourced
and underserved

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.210
for centuries based on
political decisions made,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.930
be it segregated
housing or redlining

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.100
certain neighborhoods.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.830
And so what that has led
to is that our students

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.140
come from the highest poverty
rates out of any school

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.040
in Baltimore City.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.800
Since I've been
teaching, I've had

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.990
students who have been
homeless every single year.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.217
I lost a student
to gun violence.

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:47.300
I've had a couple students
give birth to children.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.140
One of them went into
labor in my classroom.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.680
And so for me, it's trying
to show as much empathy

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.570
as I can, and just
be a listening ear.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.220
A lot of times, what
our students like

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.737
is just someone to hear them.

00:00:57.737 --> 00:00:59.050
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.770
Growing up in Baltimore
has been very challenging.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.855
It just made me strong
and independent.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:07.170
And my mother always told
me to be independent.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.110
Baltimore has a lot of
people with big dreams.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
I want to graduate
college so that I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.480
can change a lot of things.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.140
Our principal, our school
staff, all our teachers really

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.460
love our students.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.900
And having them function from
that strong place of love

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.900
has meant that our students
get a lot of support

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.430
on a daily basis.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.890
I buy a lot of independent
reading books for my students.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.090
I believe that the smartest
people in the world

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.590
carry a book with
them at all times.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.100
And that's what I
tell my students.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.190
So anytime a kid asks me
if they can get a book,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.980
I'm always like, yeah, I
can go on Amazon right now

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.521
and order it.

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:39.840
That's important to me.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.416
There are so many times
where I wish I could do more.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:44.790
You know, I wish I could say
that all my middle schoolers

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.415
who graduated are
still in high school.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:47.490
That's not the case.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100
I wish I could say
every family that's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.640
asked me for help I've been
able to provide that help for.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.130
And that's not the case.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.750
I can't sleep a lot
at night because I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.540
think so much about my students
and what they're going through,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.820
and whether I did enough
for them that day.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.680
Teaching is an honor.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.040
I know that my community
here in Baltimore

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.690
has given me the responsibility
to educate their children.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.240
And that is something I
don't take lightly at all.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.450
I want to go to my dream
college, UCLA, and be a doctor.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.020
I want to become a
photographer and video editor.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.860
--to become a contractor.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.870
I want to be a
veterinarian so that I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.070
can give back to my city.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.695
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:26.380
I do what it takes.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.386
From Baltimore, Maryland,
please welcome Mr. O.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:54.350
You got me a mess already--

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.910
I know.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.280
Because we surprised you.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.196
You didn't know you were
gonna be on the show.

00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:00.670
I had no idea until minutes ago.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.325
And then they were
like oh, by the way,

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:03.700
you're going to
sit in that chair

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.991
that you're watching right now.

00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:05.866
I couldn't handle it.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:06.657
Couldn't handle it.

00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:07.550
Well, You're awesome.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.155
You're amazing.

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:08.580
Thank you.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.840
I mean--

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.503
The kids are amazing.

00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:09.976
--you're amazing.

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:10.559
It's the kids.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:11.395
It's all the kids.

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:13.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.220
So-- and you know,
I love teachers.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.070
And you say that teaching
there has changed you.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.540
How so?

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.370
I've been teaching
for five years now,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.070
and it has shaped the way
I view the entire world.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.320
It's shaped me as a person.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.240
It's helped me understand
patience and resilience.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.140
And the honor to teach
children every day

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.580
is something that is just
unbelievable that I've

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.790
been given that great honor.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.080
And how do you motivate them?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.854
So it's a 30% dropout
rate, is that right?

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:42.270
In the community
that I work with.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.240
Yeah, in the community.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.640
So how do you motivate them?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.350
How do you keep them interested?

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.849
It's all about opening
doors for our students

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.390
and giving them points of access
that they might not normally

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.764
have, whether it's meeting
someone they wouldn't normally

00:03:53.764 --> 00:03:55.260
get to meet, going
somewhere they

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.550
wouldn't normally get to go.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.610
I believe the more access points
we can give them the better

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.690
experience they'll have.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.300
So what are the
biggest challenges

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.970
facing you in City Springs?

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.440
Access to opportunities.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.370
You know, it's 2017
in America, and we

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.740
have kids who don't have
equal access to opportunities.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.100
And I get very emotional about
that because it's not fair.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.640
It's not fair that we aren't
able to always provide

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.410
enough access to resources,
enough books for our students,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.460
enough field trips
that they can go on.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.100
And so access to opportunities
is a huge challenge

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.070
that we face every day.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.230
And your goals for
your students are what?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.955
Well, my short-term goal is to
get them those opportunities,

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:39.820
be it meeting a city
councilman, the state's attorney

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.637
came in and visited
them, so meeting

00:04:41.637 --> 00:04:43.720
people who will change
their lives for the better.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.230
Mhm.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.247
And then long-term, it's to
have them give back to Baltimore

00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:48.580
in the way that suits them best.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.538
You know, Chantelle wants
to be a veterinarian,

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:52.935
and wants to open a veterinarian
hospital in Baltimore

00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:55.060
because she says there are
stray dogs and cats that

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.240
need my help here,
or the students who

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.700
want to become
lawyers or doctors,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.310
and they don't want to
do what across the world

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.851
or across the country, they want
to do it in their community.

00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:03.370
Yeah.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.120
And that's just amazing for me.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.049
We're back with Wyatt, or Mr. O.
And his mom's in the audience.

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:10.840
You didn't even know
she was gonna be here.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.590
I had no idea.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.540
So, yeah.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.320
What a great kid you raised.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.850
He's a good guy.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.500
All right, so when
you hear-- we just

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.440
watched the tape before you
came out about your students

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.630
and what they want to
be when they grow up.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.412
You know, it must make
you think, well, then I

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:28.120
have to continue to
do this, because they

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.120
have to actually-- she
has to become a vet.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.170
It's so true.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.300
What happens in classrooms
today impacts what

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.580
happens in the world tomorrow.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.150
Like, I honestly believe that.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.160
If you fill your
classroom with love today,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.550
you're gonna fill the
world with love tomorrow.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.820
Yep.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.508
And so--

00:05:43.898 --> 00:05:45.810
It's amazing.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.244
That's so great.

00:05:47.244 --> 00:05:49.430
And so true.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.970

guys what Mr. O means to you.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.320
So tell me what he means to you.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.030
To me, Mr. O is family.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.070
And I've been here
since kindergarten,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.700
and him and this
school really helped

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.830
me understand that what I do
now will impact my future.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.030
Mr. O to me is very trustworthy.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.940
I can trust him with all
my issues and challenges

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.140
that I go through at home.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.670
And he give such
great advice that I

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.838
don't have to go through
those challenges anymore.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.590
Yes.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.670
It means everything to me
that Mr. O has my back,

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.230
and he's always here.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.580
And Mr. O is helping
me achieve my big dream

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.810
and rewrite history
in our own way,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.050
and show that people--
there's more to Baltimore

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.080
than meets the eye.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.190
Mr. O, he's very important
to me because I don't have

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.662
the support system at home.

00:07:32.662 --> 00:07:34.370
Like when I come from
school and go home,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.036
I don't, like, really
have no one there.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:39.490
So to have, like, Mr. O there
at school in the morning,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.520
and like, it's just
very supportive.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.837
And it's like I
appreciate it a lot.

00:07:43.837 --> 00:07:45.920
And this is why we all
love him, because he's just

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.094
very supportive.

00:07:47.094 --> 00:07:49.514
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:50.950
I love them so much.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:51.450
All right.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.950
Well--

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.838
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.130
Shutterfly cares about
supporting schools in need,

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.000
and they want to give your
school a check for $25,000.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.400
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.900
I think they have it there.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.800
Oh my god.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.900
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.450
Oh, my god.
