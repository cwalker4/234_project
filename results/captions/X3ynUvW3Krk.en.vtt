BE POINTS BEFORE THIS WHERE YOU

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.960
SAID I'M GOING TO MAKE IT, THIS
IS THE MOMENT.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.397 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME A LITTLE
OVER TEN YEARS AGO WHERE I

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.068
THOUGHT IT WAS MY BIG BREAK AND
I AM SO THANKFUL THAT IT DIDN'T

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.471
HAPPEN BECAUSE IT DID HAPPEN,
THEY JUST NEVER SHOWED IT.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.175
I BOOKED A COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGN,
MEANING --

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:15.842
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NATIONAL?

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.544 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.812 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S A LOT OF
MONEY.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.713
&gt;&gt; WITH JARED FROM SUBWAY.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:30.523 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( AUDIENCE REACTS )

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.525 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S SO MUCH WORSE THAN YOU
THINK IT IS.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.295
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU ACTUALLY --
THEY EXIST.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.663 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEY'RE THERE.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.330 size:81% position:41%
SOMEBODY HAS THEM.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.365 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY WERE NEVER
BROADCAST.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.467
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE NEVER BROADCAST.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.734 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.169 size:84% position:42%
WHAT WAS THE THING?

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.505
&gt;&gt; OH, HERE WAS THE IDEA.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.641
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS WAS BEFORE IT
WAS A BAD THING.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:52.479
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS MORE THAN TEN YEARS
AGO.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.952
SO HE'S AT THE PEEK OF HIS
THING, PULLING UP PANTS, HE'S

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:04.524
SELLING SUBS, AND THEY REALIZE
THAT THEY CAN ONLY ADVERTISE

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:08.695 size:88% position:56%
HEALTHY SUBS WITH JARED, AND
THEY'RE, LIKE, WE NEED TO BE

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start size:88% position:13%
ABLE TO ADVERTISE UNHEALTHY
SUBS.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.769
( LAUGHTER )
SO WE NEED TO FIND SOMEONE THAT

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.408
PEOPLE WOULD BELIEVE EATS LIKE A
TRASH CAN.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:27.614
( LAUGHTER )
SO THE IDEA WAS THAT JARED WOULD

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.116 align:start size:88% position:13%
BE, LIKE, YOU SHOULD GET THE
TURKEY SUB!

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:35.989
AND I WOULD BE, LIKE, WHAT ABOUT
THE MEATBALL SUB?

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S GOOD!

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.125 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND YOU WOULD HAVE BOTH SUBS
BEING CONSUMED.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU HAVE A
NAME?

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.594 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OH, YES!

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.429
HERE'S THE BEST PART.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.230 size:84% position:42%
SUBWAY PREPARED ME.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.100
THEY SAID, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND -- HE WAS SO FAMOUS

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.634 align:start size:88% position:13%
AT THIS POINT.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.068
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BIG DEAL.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.904
JARED FOR PRESIDENT AND STUFF
LIKE THAT.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:54.541
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE, LIKE, YOU ARE GOING
TO BE SO WELL RECOGNIZED BECAUSE

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.911
THESE ARE GOING TO AIR ALL THE
TIME AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.047 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEW ONES ALL THE TIME AND WE
DON'T WANT YOU TO BE YOU,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:01.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
THOUGH.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.984 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE WANT THE CAMPAIGN IS THAT
YOU'RE JARED'S BROTHER.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.288
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
SO HE'S STRAIGHT-LACED JARED AND

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:13.026 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'RE HIS DEER LECT BROTHER
JEROME.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.561
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JARED AND JEROME.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.663
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; AND I MIGHT BE GOING OUT ON A

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:21.100
LIMB HERE, BUT I TOLD THEM, I
SAID, I'M SORRY TO BE

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.704
INSENSITIVE, I KIND OF THINK
JEROME IS A BLACK GUY'S NAME.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.674 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY WERE, LIKE,
REALLY?

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:33.313 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DOES THAT STRIKE
YOU AS A BLACK GUY'S NAME, JON?

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.015
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT COULD BE ANY GUY'S
NAME.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.585 align:start size:88% position:13%
A AN.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.752
&gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU HAVE TO RUIN THIS?

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:45.191
&gt;&gt; Jon: A BLACK MAN'S NAME IS
LIKE TYRONE.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.127 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S MY MIDDLE
NAME.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:54.701
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU COULD PUT IT IN A
SONG, VERY BLACK NAME.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:54.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
THANK YOU.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:55.635
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO, THANK YOU.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:59.539
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M AN EXPERT!

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.742
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; WELL, AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:03.009 align:start size:88% position:13%
KNOW HIM.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.645
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU THOUGHT JEROME
WAS A BLACK NAME.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:09.849
&gt;&gt; I HAD A CRAZY NOTION JEROME
WAS A BLACK GUY'S NAME.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.085 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO I TOLD THE ADVERTISING
EXECUTIVES THAT.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.120
THEY WERE, LIKE, REALLY?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.354 align:start size:88% position:13%

SHOT THE COMMERCIALS, THEY SAID,
WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND WE THINK

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.095 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:30.303
WE THINK IT IS, SO YOU HAVE A
NEW NAME, AND IT'S JERMAINE.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.673 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, THAT'S A BLACK
