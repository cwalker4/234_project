00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:13.279
Before I start talking
about antimatter physics,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.780
antimatter rockets,
going to other stars,

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:18.512
traveling interstellar,

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:21.353
I think it’s important
we ask ourselves a question.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.095
That is: Why explore space?

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:26.836
We have so many problems here on Earth,

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:30.606
we have global warming, hunger, war,

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:35.666
why should we spend time, money,
and effort going into space,

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.866
when we could be spending
that time and effort here on Earth?

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.511
I could list all
of the technological advances,

00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.911
the medical breakthroughs

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.351
of over four decades
of human space travel in space,

00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:52.571
but I think the real question is:

00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:54.598
Why explore?

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:57.962
I think simply the answer is:
It’s in our DNA.

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:00.306
We are the descendants of people

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:04.556
who were curious
and who explored their environment,

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:06.738
and I think we need
to continue doing that.

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:09.838
But there’s a problem,
there's a big problem,

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:12.548
and that is that rockets are too slow.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.076
In order to demonstrate that,

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:18.890
our fastest object
that humans have ever created

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.950
is the Voyager 1 spacecraft,
and that moves at 15 km/s.

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:27.455
That may seem like a fast speed,
but if you want to go to Mars with that,

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.884
at that speed, it would take
months to get there.

00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:31.996
If you wanted to go to Pluto -

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:33.297
which NASA just did,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.173
and they spent a billion dollars
in ten years to get there -

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.865
it just takes too long.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:41.256
The final example,
really the most important one is:

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.174
If we want to get to another star,

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:46.814
our closest star system Alpha Centauri,
as you see there,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.454
is about four light years away,
and that's 38 million million kilometers.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.906
It would take about 30,000 years
at 15 km/s to get there.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.328
and, you know,I don’t want
to wait around for that.

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.650
Luckily, human beings are actually
quite good at developing tools

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.971
that allow us to explore our environment.

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.956
In the 1700s, we built very accurate
measurements of time,

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:14.978
we built the chronometer
that allows us to travel the seas,

00:02:14.978 --> 00:02:18.318
and allowed for the Golden Age
of Exploration.

00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:20.881
In the 1900s, the Wright brothers
developed flight,

00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:23.461
and really allowed us to master the skies.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:28.003
If you really want to explore
beyond our Solar System,

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.168
we are going to have
to come up with a new tool.

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:34.799
Being an antimatter physicist,
I’m kind of partial to antimatter,

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:36.528
but it could be something else,

00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:40.818
it could be laser propulsion,
laser fusion, or solar cells.

00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:42.130
Some physicists even think

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.120
that we can bend space-time
and travel faster than light.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:51.444
But I think antimatter is actually
the nearest term and most realistic.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:54.714
A little bit about antimatter.

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:59.118
It was first predicted by Paul Dirac -
up there in the top-right corner.

00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:02.602
He was actually struggling
with two relatively new concepts,

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:04.787
one being special relativity,

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:08.597
which describes life
at really high speeds

00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:10.301
and the speed of light,

00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.721
and quantum mechanics,

00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:16.781
which describes the Earth
or the world of the very small,

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.803
atoms and molecules.

00:03:18.803 --> 00:03:21.803
So he was solving this relativistic
quantum mechanics equation,

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.863
and he came out with two answers:

00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:26.703
a positive energy and a negative energy
for these particles.

00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:29.585
How many times
you've been doing your homework,

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.452
and you come up with a negative answer,

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:32.852
and you say: "Chuck that,

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.225
just look at the positive
energy solutions,

00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:36.947
because that’s what makes sense."

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:40.775
But Paul Dirac was a genius, and he saw
these negative energy solutions,

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:45.225
and he said: "Wait a minute, maybe there’s
a whole new set of particles out there

00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:46.582
that we haven’t even seen."

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.965
Some people thought
he was crazy of course.

00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:51.081
But it was only three years later

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:55.164
that Carl Anderson at CalTech
saw this in his cloud chamber.

00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:59.569
He saw the track
of a particle going, curving,

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:02.352
and it had the same energy
and mass as an electron,

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:04.079
but it was curving the wrong way.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:08.004
It should have been curving to the right
if it was an electron.

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:11.611
So this is the first experimental
evidence of antimatter

00:04:11.631 --> 00:04:15.591
or an anti-electron,
which we like to call positrons.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.947
So antimatter I like to describe
as mirror matter.

00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:24.823
If there was an anti-you in a mirror,
it would look exactly like you,

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.079
except that everything would be flipped.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.690
The same is true at the subatomic level.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.897
Anti-electrons have
the same mass as electrons,

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.197
just positive charge rather
than negative charge.

00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:37.834
That’s why we call them positrons.

00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:43.062
An interesting characteristic
of antimatter is annihilation.

00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:45.745
It’s quite unique in that

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:49.839
if you have an antimatter particle
and a matter particle,

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:51.594
and they get close enough together,

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.049
they’ll both disappear
and turn into pure energy.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.518
Now this is the Universe’s most efficient
means of turning mass into energy,

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.503
and it’s quite powerful,

00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:06.396
and that’s what got me interested
in positron physics years ago.

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:09.381
What does that mean
in terms of energy density

00:05:09.387 --> 00:05:11.357
if you had a clump of antimatter?

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:14.625
Antimatter has about
90 megajoules per microgram.

00:05:16.318 --> 00:05:18.168
I know that doesn’t mean much to you,

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.335
but to put that in more familiar terms,

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:24.102
if you had a gram of antimatter,
or an M&amp;M-size piece of antimatter,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.590
then you have the same amount of energy
as about 80 kilotons of nuclear weapon,

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:32.971
or alternatively about 10 million liters
of liquid natural gas -

00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:34.715
about a full tanker load.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.821
So not only does antimatter
have incredible promises

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.682
as a fuel for spacecraft,

00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:43.641
but this has some pretty
significant applications

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.270
in the future of energy research,
energy production,

00:05:48.176 --> 00:05:52.086
especially in inertial confinement systems
and pulsed energy delivery.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.721
But I’m more interested
in the propulsion side of things,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.570
and so is my company.

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:01.165
The original concept
of antimatter propulsion,

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.210
it was actually developed
in the fifties by Eugen Sänger.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.032
And what he did was, he said:

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:11.099
"What if you had a clump of antimatter,
you took it out in your spacecraft,

00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:14.509
and then you annihilated it
in the rocket engine nozzle,

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:16.922
and you’re able
to direct that energy flow,

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:22.346
you’re able to direct those gamma rays
so that you have thrust in one direction."

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:25.779
This was cutting edge at that time,

00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.556
but there were really three problems,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.914
one of which was production.

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:32.257
You can’t create enough antimatter
to do this, unfortunately.

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:35.362
The other is that you
can’t trap the antimatter.

00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:39.860
Of course, that property of annihilation
which is good for the energy density

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.380
is really bad for being able to trap it.

00:06:42.822 --> 00:06:45.329
You need very high strength
magnetic fields,

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:47.717
and it just wasn’t feasible,
still isn't feasible,

00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:49.718
to trap large amounts of antimatter.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.528
The third problem
with the original concept

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:54.908
was directing that energy.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.055
Gamma rays are much higher
energy than x-rays.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.850
Of course, if you go through the TSA
in the airport, they x-ray your bag.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.410
X-rays tend to go through everything,
and gamma rays even more so.

00:07:06.597 --> 00:07:10.127
Reflecting gamma rays is something
that we can’t do right now.

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:15.404
So, I started thinking about
these problems in 2011,

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:17.643
finishing up my PhD in positron physics.

00:07:17.696 --> 00:07:22.805
I realized that the real issue,
the limiting factor,

00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:26.311
was when you went from hot positrons
to cold positrons.

00:07:26.595 --> 00:07:29.185
Now state of the art in 2011:

00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:35.582
You had your source of hot positrons,
and what you did, and still do, is

00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:37.928
to run it through
a solid piece of material.

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:40.878
What this does is, it's very thin,

00:07:40.886 --> 00:07:43.533
so that most of the positrons
just travel right through,

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.957
a very small number will actually stop
inside the material.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:51.169
Of course, a large number
of those will hit an electron

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:53.495
because our matter
is made of a lot of electrons,

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:55.514
and they will lose it.

00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:58.968
A very small number,
about one out of 1,000,

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:02.436
will make it to the surface
and be emitted as a cold positron.

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:06.341
So, you have to be able
to create cold positrons

00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.052
in order to work with them.

00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:11.752
They come out at a million times hotter
than the surface of the Sun,

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:13.806
so you have to be able to cool them down.

00:08:13.806 --> 00:08:15.876
This process was very inefficient,

00:08:15.876 --> 00:08:18.066
so we started thinking
of new ways to do this.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.994
My lab partner and I
discussed this for about a year.

00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.134
We came out with a napkin sketch
of an array moderator.

00:08:25.627 --> 00:08:28.556
Soon after that we made it
an actual patent,

00:08:29.113 --> 00:08:31.513
and then asked
for some money from a grant,

00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:33.748
and we were funded by the Steel Foundation

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.087
to do the initial proof of concept
on that moderator.

00:08:38.124 --> 00:08:42.482
This moderator now forms the heart
of all our propulsion concepts,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.510
and that little piece up there
is actually very tiny, it is about 3x3 mm,

00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:50.431
but it’s the source for all
of our antimatter concepts.

00:08:50.502 --> 00:08:54.470
When you are developing a concept,
you also have to develop a team.

00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:57.674
So back in 2012, I asked
some friends of mine

00:08:57.688 --> 00:09:01.073
whom I was working on another
rocket project there in the desert with.

00:09:01.077 --> 00:09:03.479
I said, "Well, let’s give up
this chemical stuff.

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:06.369
Why don't you guys come help me
build an antimatter rocket?"

00:09:06.385 --> 00:09:08.005
Who's going to say no to that?

00:09:08.021 --> 00:09:09.922
(Laughter)

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.285
So, we rented a little office,

00:09:12.288 --> 00:09:15.288
brought in a bunch
of nuclear science equipment.

00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:18.676
We quickly realized that the landlord
didn’t appreciate that,

00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:20.193
so we got kicked out of there.

00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:24.011
In the next year, we moved into
a little more appropriate facility,

00:09:24.036 --> 00:09:27.499
and then, last year, finally,
we made our way down

00:09:27.507 --> 00:09:30.033
to a nuclear fallout shelter
with a clean room.

00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:33.936
This new facility will allow us
to develop some of our concepts

00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:38.612
and integrate them into a CubeSat,
which is a very small satellite,

00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.941
very easy to launch, very easy
to demonstrate new concepts on.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.177
How do we get around those three issues:

00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:49.988
production, trapping and directing energy?

00:09:49.997 --> 00:09:52.572
The first two, production and trapping,

00:09:52.598 --> 00:09:55.768
are got around by having
a very efficient moderator.

00:09:56.271 --> 00:10:01.865
We use a radioisotope source of positrons
which continuously emits positrons.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:04.458
We run it through
our little tiny moderator,

00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.571
and we can create
a very high-intensity positron beam.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:12.639
The third challenge is directing
the annihilation energy.

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:14.616
In order to do that,

00:10:14.636 --> 00:10:18.566
we transfer the kinetic energy
of the gamma ray into a charged particle

00:10:18.628 --> 00:10:20.408
via fusion reactions.

00:10:20.408 --> 00:10:22.934
And now we have a charged particle
that's high energy

00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:24.086
rather than a gamma ray.

00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:25.263
And that's important

00:10:25.272 --> 00:10:28.284
because charged particles
like to follow magnetic field lines,

00:10:28.297 --> 00:10:31.273
as you know from the Aurora Borealis.

00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:34.365
So, we use magnets like
the one in the bottom right there,

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.140
to actually direct the energy
and produce thrust.

00:10:38.748 --> 00:10:41.926
In about two years, we were hoping
to put a demonstrator CubeSat -

00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:43.356
that little tiny spacecraft -

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:44.617
into orbit.

00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:46.047
Why is this useful?

00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:48.754
What is it that a really small
spacecraft can do for you?

00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.605
Well, it turns out,

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:53.936
that about 4 billion people
on the surface of the Earth

00:10:53.977 --> 00:10:56.666
don’t have access to Internet.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.788
So there's a lot of companies

00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:01.895
that want to launch
constellations of small satellites

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.962
into low Earth orbit.

00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:07.762
They will create a global network
of broadband Internets,

00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:09.953
so that anyone can
access that information.

00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:14.547
I think that would be
an incredible opening door for the Earth.

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:16.757
A little bit further down the road,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.045
what we want to do,
and what government agencies want to do,

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.308
and some private companies like SpaceX,

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.905
they want to send things out to Mars,

00:11:24.913 --> 00:11:27.245
and our technology
would allow them to do that

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.864
and cut the transit time significantly.

00:11:29.864 --> 00:11:34.309
And then, kind of a far-out application
for this, is asteroid mining.

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:36.966
I know you've probably never heard
of asteroid mining,

00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:40.822
but it turns out that very small asteroids
in our asteroid belt, metal rich,

00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:42.452
is worth a lot of money.

00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:45.382
With chemical rockets,
you can't just go out there and get it,

00:11:45.383 --> 00:11:48.193
you need something
like an antimatter system.

00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:54.655
In terms of extending this technology
into human space travel,

00:11:54.711 --> 00:11:57.611
that will require, of course,
a lot of work.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.740
It turns out that our squishy bodies

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.921
can only really handle
about 1g acceleration,

00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:11.109
and even so 1g, 9.8 m/s/s,
is actually pretty high acceleration.

00:12:11.716 --> 00:12:13.986
NASA took ten years
to get to the Pluto;

00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:17.581
if we go at 1g, we can get there
in about 3.5 weeks,

00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:19.299
which isn’t that bad.

00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:23.739
If we want to go to Alpha Centauri,
the story gets a little different,

00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:27.240
and we start bringing in
concepts of special relativity.

00:12:27.718 --> 00:12:30.574
If we want to go out there
at 4.3 light years,

00:12:30.578 --> 00:12:34.567
at 1g it would take about five years
going at about 85% the speed of light.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:40.199
Once we start getting toward a significant
fraction of the speed of light,

00:12:40.205 --> 00:12:42.395
we start getting time dilation,

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:44.554
which is an interesting phenomenon,

00:12:44.571 --> 00:12:48.551
but really it’s the thing that allows us
to travel out into the Universe.

00:12:48.948 --> 00:12:53.235
While five years
has elapsed on the spacecraft,

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:55.895
nine years has elapsed on the Earth.

00:12:55.903 --> 00:12:58.860
It's getting weird, but still feasible.

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:02.679
If we extend this out to Kepler-452b,

00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:08.126
Kepler-452b is an interesting place
because a lot of people call it Earth 2.0.

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:10.156
It’s a little bit bigger than Earth,

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.404
it’s in the habitable zone of its Sun.

00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.515
A lot of people
want to go there and see -

00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:16.704
maybe there's life.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:19.159
I think there is a good chance
that there might be,

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:21.121
although it is 1500 light years away.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:24.257
With our 1g spacecraft
we could get there in 12 years

00:13:24.257 --> 00:13:25.960
on the spacecraft.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.183
Unfortunately, 1,500 years
will have passed on Earth.

00:13:31.206 --> 00:13:33.326
So things are getting a little weirder.

00:13:35.137 --> 00:13:37.621
If we look at the ultimate
application of this,

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:42.969
exploring to the edges of our Universe,
13.5 billion light years away,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.734
at 1g we could make it there
in a human lifetime, 30 years.

00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:50.969
Now, we are going incredibly fast,
towards the speed of light,

00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:52.233
but the only problem is,

00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:55.554
that 13.5 billion years would have passed
here on the Earth.

00:13:55.694 --> 00:13:57.550
What I’m trying to say is that,

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.004
with the transformative
technology like this,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.188
we have to think seriously
about the consequences,

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.322
and new questions that arise.

00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:07.843
The first of which is:

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:13.311
If we want to really explore beyond
our Solar System into our galaxy,

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.489
we are going to have to do it ourselves:

00:14:15.507 --> 00:14:18.025
if we do send a probe or a robot,

00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:20.459
we will never hear back
from it, essentially.

00:14:21.044 --> 00:14:23.304
And then the second issue is:

00:14:23.306 --> 00:14:26.966
If we do want to go out beyond our galaxy,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.780
we're going to essentially
be saying goodbye to this.

00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:36.551
And you know human beings used
to be a nomadic species,

00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:39.648
and so one of the questions
I am asking you is:

00:14:39.668 --> 00:14:41.668
Do we want to become nomads again?

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:43.951
Thank you very much.

00:14:44.074 --> 00:14:48.074
(Applause)
