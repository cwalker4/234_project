&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:05.238
MY NEXT GUEST IS A PROFESSOR OF
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS AT

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.674 align:start position:0%
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, A
BESTSELLING AUTHOR, AND AN

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.942 size:75% position:38%
ALL-AROUND SMARTY PANTS.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.412
HE'S HERE TO TELL US ABOUT THE
DISCOVERY OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.414
AND WHY IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.983
PLEASE WELCOME OUR FRIEND, BRIAN
GREENE.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.251 align:start position:0%
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:22.922
YOU'RE CODIRECTOR OF COLUMBIA'S
INSTITUTE FOR STRINGS,

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.592 align:start position:0%
COSMOLOGY, AND ASTROPARTICLE
PHYSICS.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:25.992 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.228 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY
GOOD PICKUP LINE.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:32.899 align:start position:0%
SINCE LAST WE WERE TOGETHER,
SCIENTISTS DETECTED

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.333 align:start position:0%
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.603 align:start position:0%
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS SOMETHING
EINSTEIN PREDICTED.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.103 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:37.704 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW LONG AGO?

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.673 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; 100 YEARS AGO THIS YEAR, IN
1916.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:45.011 align:start position:0%
THIS IS A HUGE DISCOVERY, NOT
ONLY CONFIRMING EINSTEIN'S IDEAS

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.747
BUT OPENING A WHOLE NEW WAY OF
EXPLORING THE UNIVERSE.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:51.751
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DOES HE SEEM EVEN
SMARTER NOW THAN HE USED TO

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:51.951 align:start position:0%
SEEM?

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.821
&gt;&gt; HE'S, LIKE, SO UP THERE, THAT
THERE IS NO GETTING SMARTER.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:58.591
IT'S LIKE INFUNT, FURTHER NORTH
THAN THE NORTH POLE.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.494
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE SCIENTISTS ARE
STILL DOING HIS HOMEWORK FROM

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.862 align:start position:0%
100 YEARS AGO
( LAUGHTER ).

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.132 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE HAS GIVEN US AN
INCREDIBLY RICH LEGACY THAT WE

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:08.635 align:start position:0%
HAVE BEEN PURSUING, YEAH, FOR
100 YEARS.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.538
EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE IN MY
OWN CAREER REALLY HAS, IN SOME

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:15.141 size:84% position:42%
SENSE, BEEN TRYING TO PUSH
FORWARD ON THE PATH THAT HE

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:19.746 align:start position:0%
FIRST BLAZE GLD WHAT IS A
GRAVITATIONAL WAVE, AND WHY DOES

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:20.747
IT CHANGE EVERYTHING?

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.784
&gt;&gt; SO AIR, GRAVITATIONAL WAVE IS
ACTUALLY A RIPPLE IN THE FABRIC

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.252
OF SPACE.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.356
WE KNOW YOU THROW A PEBBLE INTO
A POND, THE WATER RIPPLES.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.425 align:start position:0%
NOW, THIS IS A RIPPLE, BUT NOT
WITH WATER.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.762 align:start position:0%
IT'S IN SPACE ITSELF.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.231 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU ARE BLOWING MY
MIND AGAIN.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.999 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
SO WHAT ARE WE LOOK AT HERE?

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:45.138
&gt;&gt; THIS IS EINSTEIN'S GENERAL
RELATIVITY WHICH HE DISCOVERED

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:51.044
IN 1915, A YEAR EARLIER, AND THE
KEY IDEA IS HE FOUND GRAVITY

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.880
COMES FROM THE WARPS AND CURVES
IN THE SPACE.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.750 size:84% position:42%
THE SUN WARPS THE SPACE AND
KEEPS THE EARTH IN ORBIT.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.786 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LIKE A BOWLING
BALL ON A TRAMPOLINE.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.688
&gt;&gt; TRAMPOLINE, EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.656
WHAT HAPPENED IS, THIS IS 1915.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.425
HE DISWNT JUST STOP.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:09.462
HE KEEPS GOING, AND A YEAR LATER
HE REALIZES IF SPACE IS LIKE A

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.233
TRAMPOLINE, THEN IMAGINE KIDS
RUNNING AROUND ON A TRAMPOLINE.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.535
THEY'RE GOING TO SEND RIPPLES ON
THE SURFACE.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.438
SO HE SAYS THE SAME SHOULD BE
TRUE OF THE FABRIC OF SPACE.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:22.775 align:start position:0%
IF YOU'VE QOT TWO RAPIDLY
ORBITING STARS, NEUTRON STARS OR

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.880
BLACK HOLES, HIS MATH PREDICTS
THAT THEY WILL GENERATE A STEADY

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.282
MARCH OF RIPPLES IN THE FABRIC
OF SPACE.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:34.454 align:start position:0%
THOSE ARE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
THAT HE PREDICTED

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:34.821 align:start position:0%
MATHEMATICALLY.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.389 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND NOW THEY HAVE
BEEN DETECTED.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:36.923 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.324 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED THAT
ALLOWED US TO DO THAT?

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:42.562
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SO HIS MATH ALSO SHOWS,
AS WE GO ON FROM HERE TO THE

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:46.132
NEXT SEQUENCE, HIS MATH SHOWS AS
A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE RIPPLES BY

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:49.636
ANYTHING, IT WILL STRETCH IT AND
COMPRESS IT.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.704 align:start position:0%
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING--
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LIKE THE EARTH.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.273
&gt;&gt; LIKE THE EARTH RIGHT HERE.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.475 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE WE'RE A
PART OF THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.778
YOU AND ME AND THE EARTH IS
STRETCHING AND COMPRESSING,

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.547
ALONG WITH THE RIPPLING OF SPACE
TIME.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:01.381 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.816 size:78% position:39%
THE ONE THING, IS THIS IS
EXAGGERATE GLD I HOPE SO.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.684 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HOPE SO, I HOPE
SO.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.756
&gt;&gt; THE RIPPLES WOULD ACTUALLY
CAUSE THE EARTH TO STRETCH AND

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:14.160
COMPRESS BY LESS THAN AN ATOMIC
DIAMETER.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.929 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW DO YOU-- HOW
DO YOU MEASURE THAT?

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.397 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU MEASURE THAT?

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.031 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:18.498 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHAT I SAID?

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.766 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.633 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER ).

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.870
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE--
THOUSANDS OF SCIENTISTS HAVE

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.472 align:start position:0%
BEEN WORKING ON FOR 40, 50
YEARS.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:32.512 align:start position:0%
THIS AMAZING TEAM OF
RESEARCHERS, LIGO, LASER

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.781 align:start position:0%
INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL
WAVE OBSERVATORY, JUST TWO WEEKS

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.117
AGO THEY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST
DETECTION OF THESE GRAVITATIONAL

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.652
WAVES USING A SPECTACULAR PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:43.256
THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO OF THEM,
ONE IN LOUISIANA AND THE ENERGY

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:43.656
WASHINGTON STATE.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.391 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND
THIS INVOLVES LASERS.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.092 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; LASERS.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:49.796
IN FACT WE SLAILGT MODEL VERSION
OF IT HERE IF YOU WANT TO CHECK

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.464
IT OUT.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.767
IN THIS DEVICE HERE-- IN FACT IF
WE BRING THE LIGHTS DOWN, IT

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:55.868 align:start position:0%
WILL BE EASIER TO SEE.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:04:00.373
WE HAVE A LASER, RIGHT HERE,
THAT'S SENDING OUT A BEAM THAT

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.075 align:start position:0%
THIS DEVICE HERE SPLITS INTO
TWO.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.445
AND YOU CAN SEE THEY GO THAT
DIRECTION TOWARD THE RIGHT, OUR

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.547
RIGHT, AND THIS UPSTAGE OVER
HERE.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:11.084 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AT WHAT POINT DO I
PUT ON THE PINK FLOYD?

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.685 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; LET'S DO IT NOW!

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:13.319
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ANOTHER ALL RIGHT.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.689
&gt;&gt; SO IN THE REAL EXPERIMENT, IT
HITS A MIRROR THAT'S TWO AND A

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.625 align:start position:0%
HALF MILES AWAY.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.694 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LIKE A
TWO-AND-A-HALF-MILE PIPE OR

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:22.228 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING?

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:25.932 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; A TWO-AND-A-HALF-MILE
EVACUATED PIPE, EXACTLY.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:32.472
WHEN THE LASER BOUNCES BACK IT
RECOMBINES, LIKE COMMINGLES, AND

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.141
WHEN THEY COMMINGLE THEY CREATE
A VERY INTERESTING PATTERN.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.443 align:start position:0%
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE
TRIGHT HERE.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.044 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE IT IS.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.512
THERE IS AN IDEA OF THE PATTERN.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:40.713
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BRIGHT AREAS.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.482 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHERE THE TWO BEAMS ARE
WORK TOGETHER.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:46.386
THE DARK AREAS ARE WHERE THE
BEAMS ARE CANCELLING EACH OTHER

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:46.552
OUT.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.888
AND THAT INTERFERENCE PATTERN IS
ABSOLUTELY KEY.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:52.025
NOW, LET ME JUST SHOW YOU, SO IF
YOU BLOCK ONE OF THESE BEAMS

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:55.295 align:start position:0%
RIGHT HERE, YOU SEE HOW THE
INTERFERENCE PATTERN GOES AWAY.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.629
THEY'RE NO LONGER COMMINGLING.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.232
IF I RELEASE IT, NOW YOU SEE
THAT THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
TO CREATE THAT PATTERN.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.234 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:05.271
&gt;&gt; BUT THE KEY THING IS THIS
PATTERN IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.574
THE DISTANCE THAT THE LASER BEAM
TRAVELS.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:12.612
SO IF A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ROLLS
BY AND STRETCHES ONE DISTANCE

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.682 align:start position:0%
RELATIVE TO ANOTHER --
&gt;&gt; EVEN JUST THE DISTANCE OF,

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.084
LIKE, THE-- NOT THE DIAMETER OF
AN ATOM.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:18.451 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SUCH AN
AMAZING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, THE

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.022
REAL ONE, OF COURSE, THAT'S OUT
THERE.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:26.659 align:start position:0%
THIS IS JUST A MOD GLEL ANY
MOVEMENT IN THIS BEAM MAKES THAT

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.160
PATTERN CHANGE.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.463
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DO IT HERE
WITH THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES BUT

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:35.868
WE CAN TRY IT, IF YOU'RE UP TO
TO, AN EXPERIMENT WITH SOUND

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:36.302 align:start position:0%
WAVES.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.838 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JUST YELL AT IT?

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.373 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; WE'LL SEE IF IT SHIFTS.

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:41.974 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SCIENCE!

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:42.208 align:start position:0%
SCIENCE!

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.144 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; WELL DONE, WELL DONE.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:45.645 size:75% position:38%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.714 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO, WHAT CAN WE
DO?

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE BENDING

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.222
SPACE TIME LIKE THIS, HOW CAN IT
LET US SEE THE UNIVERSE IN A

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:56.556 align:start position:0%
DIFFERENT WAY?

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.891 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW LIGHT CAN BE
BLOCKED, RIGHT?

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.894
IF I COVER MY FACE YOU DON'T SEE
ME ANY LONGER.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:05.665 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S VERY
FRIGHTENING.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.265 size:81% position:41%
MEAS PLOOEZ DON'T DO THAT.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.035 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; CAN'T BLOCK GRAVITY, WHICH
MEANS GRAVITY CAN GO INTO PLACES

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.437
IN THE UNIVERSE THAT LIGHT
CANNOT PENETRATE.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.972 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT!

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.908 size:78% position:39%
HOW DO YOU BLOCK GRAVITY?

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:20.680
YOU ALWAYS FEELS THE EARTH'S
GRAVITY NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.950
USING THE GRAVITATIONAL SUFFER
FASES WE MAY BE ABLE TO STUDY

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.953
HOW BLACK HOLES COMBINE AND WE
MAY BE ABLE TO STUDY THE BIG

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:27.553 align:start position:0%
BANG ITSELF.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.422
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE SAME WAY YOU
CAN SET OFF A BOMB ON ONE SIDE

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:34.527
OF THE EARTH ARE YOU CAN EASE A
SEISMOGRAPH TO ECHO MAP THE

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:39.332 align:start position:0%
INSIDE OF THE PLANET, CAN HELP
US MAP THINGS WE CAN'T SEE?

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.700 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.336
THE DEVICE IS ONLY SENSITIVE TO
WAVES THE GRAVITY.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.538 size:84% position:42%
IT'S SHIELDED FROM ORDINARY
ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WOW.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.509
&gt;&gt; AND IN FACT, YOU CAN ACTUALLY
IN IN SOME SENSE HEAR THE

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.777 align:start position:0%
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES.

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:53.880
THEY VIBRATE AT A FREQUENCY THAT
IF YOU TURN IT INTO SOUND, THE

HUMAN AIR CAN HEAR.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.950 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO LITERALLY,
THESE WAVES CAN BE TURNED INTO

SOUND.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:58.451 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.754 align:start position:0%
AND THESE ARE THE MOST
SPECTACULAR SOUNDS FROM THE

STANDPOINT OF THEY HERALD A
REVOLUTION IN OUR UNDERSTAND, OF

&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS ACTUALLY A
COMPUTER RENDERING OF

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:21.607
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES INTO SOUNDS.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.543
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A SIM LAIRKZ BUT THE
DATA AGREES WITH THE

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:23.976 align:start position:0%
SIMULATION.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:24.844 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS WHAT IT

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
WOULD SOUND LIKE.
