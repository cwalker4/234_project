00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:12.110
Twelve years to avoid catastrophe. That’s
the UN’s grim warning on climate change.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:21.320
We’re already pretty fucked. I like to say
we’re in deep shit and we need to dig ourselves

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.720
out.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.109
Governments are failing to cut emissions,
but could new technology be the shovel to

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.179
save us.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.300
We could basically find the thermostat of
the planet and say what would you like it

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.800
to be placed at?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.300
Tonight, we’re travelling the world to see
technology to change the climate. In Switzerland,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.030
giant fans that suck carbon from thin air.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.719
It is that simple.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.510
So this is a big vacuum tank.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.160
And at Harvard, a sulphur seeding project
to literally lower the entire earth’s temperature.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.730
Do you ever worry that this is playing God?

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.390
It may sound like science fiction to talk
about techno fixes to climate, but we have

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.030
to get really smart as a species and stop
doing things that are risking our future.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.920
So will brave new technology save the world?
Or could it just be an excuse to keep burning

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.880
the planet.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:00.290
Few places are as eager as Copenhagen to get
power from wind, and even in this weather,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:12.790
from sun. Nowhere has been keener to ditch
cars for bikes. Klaus Bondam is Director of

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.880
the Danish Cyclists Federation and a former
mayor of this city. He’s leading its push

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.290
to be the first carbon neutral capital by
2025.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.920
I feel the need that there is a strong political
consensus in Denmark that we need to act.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.600
It’s pretty cold right now, but we had an
extremely hot summer. It didn’t rain for

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.810
two and a half months here. But it made us
think is this right? Is there something going

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.720
on? And I think we have to realise that something
is going on.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.560
Copenhagen has been breaking all records in
traditional ways to clean the air.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.370
Now according to this metre, sixteen hundred
and thirty-one bikes have crossed this bridge

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.220
this morning alone. In the past year, it’s
been three million, five hundred and nineteen

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.520
thousand and sixty-two. It’s extraordinary.
But the problem is no matter how much we ride,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.450
no matter how much we recycle, no matter how
fast communities transition to renewables,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.420
it’s probably not going to be fast enough
because governments aren’t meeting the commitments

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.630
they made at the Paris Climate Change Conference
to cut emissions. The politics are failing.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.870
Which is why there’s now such an urgent
push to try new technology, to experiment

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.329
with things that sounds like science fiction
but could be the only way to ensure a secure

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:48.979
future is a fact.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:55.639
The warning was sounded in October by the
IPCC, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:04.160
Climate change. Leading scientists said carbon
needed to be almost halved from 2010 levels

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:13.370
to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Otherwise
runaway temperatures would destroy the Great

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.790
Barrier Reef, droughts and hurricanes would
become the norm. Melting ice sheets would

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.230
flood major cities.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.130
But ice climatologist Jason Box, a former
lead author to the IPCC, says even that won’t

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.400
be enough.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.820
It’s frightening and I’m sorry to say
this, but at one and a half degrees of global

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.570
warming, we still have like two and a half
degrees of summer Arctic warming and that

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:52.110
pushes Greenland beyond its threshold of viability,
so we still lose Greenland but at a slower

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.810
rate.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:04.230
Based in Copenhagen, he measures ice retreat
for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.520
When we lose the reflective cover of the Artic
sea ice, when we lose the Greenland ice sheet,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.440
the climate system globally unravels and it’s
going to create the kind of problems that

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.710
will make it pretty hard to govern society.
The migrations, the droughts, those destabilise

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.060
our societies and our economies in ways that
we lose control. So what’s at risk here

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.640
is practically civilisation.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:44.490
Professor Box shares the frustration of all
scientists contributing to the IPCC. Evidence

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:52.770
gathered through years of painstaking fieldwork
is often just ignored by politicians.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.600
Politicians and governments that dismiss IPCC
reports, that’s not conservative, it’s

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.220
not progressive - certainly it is insanity.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:16.770
He fears the world will need massive technological
fixes called geoengineering, literally re-engineering

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.010
the earth to hold back what’s coming.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.210
For example we can slow down melting of the
Antarctic ice sheet by piling up the sand

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.810
on the sea floor simply to block warm currents
that are already destabilising the whole west

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.260
Antarctic ice sheet.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.610
Other ideas include covering oceans with iron
filings to encourage carbon-eating plankton.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:48.760
Or sending ships round the world to pump sea
water mist into the sky to diffuse the sun’s

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.760
rays.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.580
We don’t yet know which they will be, but
we have some ideas and we need to try several

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.950
technologies and evaluate them and figure
out which are the least risky etcetera to

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:08.450
get the carbon curve which is like this now
to get it negative and that all needs to happen

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:18.780
in the next 10-20 years to start down that
path. It’s extremely ambitious.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:26.930
The idea of geoengineering has excited both
scientists and industry. On the other side

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:35.629
of Copenhagen, I’ve come to meet a prominent
political scientist, Dr Bjorn Lomborg. He’s

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:43.480
a favoured commentator in conservative media
for arguing against major cuts to fossil fuels.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.230
Look if you say to people there’s another
solution, yes, it is going to take the attention

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.080
somewhat away from the original solution.
But we should also be honest and say we’ve

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.610
tried the first solution namely ask people
could you please use the car less? Could you

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.280
please use less energy? Could you please turn
off your lights and all that and it’s not

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.500
worked for 30 years and actually there’s
about half a planet who’s waiting to get

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.980
more energy availability.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:15.810
Dr Lomborg says he accepts that fossil fuel
emissions are warming the planet. He just

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:22.140
thinks geoengineering will cool it much faster
than switching to renewals.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.260
Because it’s so cheap it’s very likely
to happen sooner or later. Some Indian billionaire

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.400
or some Saudi billionaire is going to do it
all by himself. Just turn it down a little

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:38.140
bit to pre-industrial temperatures or wherever
we decide to have it and that would be essentially

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:44.140
avoiding a large part – not all – but
a large part of the global warming problem.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:50.800
So, what are the most likely fixes and would
they really work?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.839
Most of these globally ambitious projects
are still on the drawing board, but one surprising

00:08:55.839 --> 00:09:06.170
new technology is up and running in a place
generally seen as neutral territory.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:18.560
It’s long been a home of precision innovation
– from Swiss watches that never lose time,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.930
to Swiss army knives in a country permanently
at peace.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.130
Switzerland hasn’t really been part of the
climate change wars or any other war for that

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.440
matter. It’s always been happy to sit back
and make money while everyone else is fighting.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.110
Now a small company here in Zurich believes
it’s found what could be a big part of the

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:45.630
solution to climate change.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:52.260
Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher were PhD
students when they decided to form a world-changing

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:58.480
company. Tonight, they’re celebrating Climework’s
ninth anniversary.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.180
] So we’re still not making money, so of
course money’s not the motivation, the motivation

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:13.020
is solving a big challenge and there is probably
as little as challenging as climate change.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:19.880
Their solution is building giant fans that
draw in air and bind carbon molecules onto

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.940
filters. The carbon free air is released back
into the atmosphere. The CO2 is super-heated

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.760
and collected as gas.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.050
I like to call it low tech, not high tech.
It is actually very simple. The challenging

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:39.590
part is making it work and making it cheap.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:46.950
In just two years they’ve opened plants
in Switzerland, Iceland and Italy. They believe

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:54.130
they could remove ten per cent of the carbon
the IPCC wants cut. Their first target is

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.170
one per cent by 2025.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:03.830
It’s like 300 million tonnes of CO2 and
that would require a quarter of a million

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.210
machines.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:12.960
But in this developmental stage, removing
just one tonne of carbon costs an uneconomical

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.620
600 US dollars.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:21.870
We are confident that in the next two to three
years we will have our cost in the range of

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.361
two to three hundred dollars per tonne and
in the mid to long term, and that’s for

00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:33.410
us 2025 to 2030 we see costs at one hundred
dollars as feasible.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:39.850
So the big question is what do you do with
all this captured CO2? Well fortunately in

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.500
this case there’s a greenhouse just three
hundred metres away, so after the carbon’s

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:53.770
sucked into the fans, it’s piped underground
to the greenhouse and turned into veggies.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:12:02.029
Plants absorb carbon so the greenhouse buys
the gas as fertiliser. Since it started spraying,

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:08.610
crop production has increased by ten per cent.
Climeworks is also selling carbon for soda

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:13.370
drinks and partnering with Aldi to recycle
it into fuel.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.980
What was your first thought when you saw the
plant?

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.530
It’s a very simple process.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.160
The quicker the process can turn a profit,
the more likely it is to spread around the

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.060
world. Even in frosty Switzerland, there’s
a real sense of urgency about limiting global

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.200
warming.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:40.279
I am German by origin and I came here for
the mountains, to climb, to ski and in the

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:48.800
Alps you could see very early signs of climate
change, like of course glaciers are disappearing

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.480
like we won’t stop that, if with and without
climate change, but the speed of disappearance

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:07.430
is shocking.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:18.390
Patrick Hofstetter from the World Wildlife
Fund took us out to see the disappearing glaciers.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:24.120
The Alps are warming more than twice as fast
as the rest of Europe. Over summer there was

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.850
unprecedented drought.
Yes that’s really special for us. The farmers

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:38.200
don’t know the situation yet. The grass
stopped growing, so there is a shortage in

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.050
feed so they actually started to slaughter
their cows much earlier. After this really

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:53.610
dry summer I can feel a renewed sense of urgency,
especially also because the farmers now really

00:13:53.610 --> 00:14:00.420
accept that they are directly affected by
it and the farmers being part of the conservative

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:11.720
population that’s a very important group
also in terms of politics.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.620
Three hours from Zurich we come to what used
to be the start of the giant Morterartsch

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.850
glacier.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.850
So this all used to be solid ice, this track?

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.220
Actually 160 years ago the glacier came up
to here so.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.550
Al the way to the town?

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:33.290
All the way to the station down here, yes.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:40.339
Since then it’s retreated by three kilometres
and six hundred meters of that in just the

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:41.700
past decade.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.720
This is 1940. 1970.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.850
This ancient glacier is expected to disappear
entirely within a lifetime.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.090
So are all the glaciers in Switzerland receding?

00:14:54.090 --> 00:15:00.180
The predictions show that by the end of the
century, most of them will disappear completely

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.110
only a few will remain in the very top mountains.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:13.440
The changing climate is already hurting the
economy. Many ski fields are now bare until

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.660
after Christmas.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:24.370
This is a new situation we face in the last
ten years it got later and later. So you to

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:31.770
do a lot of the snow machine here, prepare
all the downhill slopes.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:37.610
Even at higher altitudes, ski resorts are
laying giant insulation sheets over glaciers

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.410
to preserve snow.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.930
From May to October, more or less they cover
it like that, then they remove it in October

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.950
and start to ski again.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.079
They’re covering glaciers with blankets
to try to stop the melting?

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:57.399
Well it’s actually just slowing down the
process so it’s not a solution, it’s just

00:15:57.399 --> 00:16:05.970
to fight the symptoms of climate change. We
have been doing geoengineering now for many,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:12.490
many decades in actually burning so much fossil
fuel and altering the climate by humankind,

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:18.830
that we have to look now in a similar scale
into solutions to that problem.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:25.740
And as high as we are here, some believe the
real antidote to climate change is twenty

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.251
kilometres up there. At our next stop we’re
meeting scientists who don’t want to put

00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:39.620
blankets on glaciers, they want to blanket
the atmosphere.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:49.560
If climate change is the biggest problem in
the world then at least some of the smartest

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.130
people on the planet are trying to deal with
it.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:58.750
In the hallowed halls of Harvard University,
researchers are looking at just how practical

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.820
and dangerous geoengineering might be.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:09.889
So in here we have one of the big pieces of
test equipment that we use in preparation

00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:12.439
for putting instruments into the stratosphere.

00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:18.529
Engineering Professor Frank Keutsch is preparing
for the first test mission later this year.

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:25.569
Open it up and so we can put instruments into
the vacuum tank and then we can simulate the

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:30.510
stratospheric pressure you have at twenty
kilometres.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:39.239
They’ll use a high-altitude balloon to scatter
sun reflecting aerosols across the upper atmosphere.

00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:42.629
Right now, they’re fine tuning equipment
to measure the effect.

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:46.139
It feels a bit like the space race.

00:17:46.139 --> 00:17:49.919
In a way it does, on a much smaller scale.
[drawing on a white board] They fly up into

00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:51.739
the stratosphere high above us.

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:57.529
The white board theory is that tonnes of tiny
sulphur particles delivered by specially modified

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:00.429
planes would lower the earth’s temperature.

00:18:00.429 --> 00:18:04.700
Would result in cooling the planet.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:12.450
It’s what happened naturally in 1991 after
the Philippine’s Mount Pinatubo volcano

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.510
erupted.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:20.980
And this gas then reacts in the stratosphere
with occident’s and turns into sulphuric

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:28.429
acid. For the few years after Mount Pinatubo,
the temperature was noticeably lower and it

00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:32.009
cooled down the planet. That was one effect
that you got from this.

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:33.009
By what degree?

00:18:33.009 --> 00:18:39.000
It was probably in the range of about half
a degree Celsius.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.460
Trouble is a quick fix like that could have
nasty side effects.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:49.950
And what was also apparent after Mount Pinatubo
and other volcanic eruptions is that these

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:56.480
particles in the end reduce the amount of
ozone in the stratosphere. So you know we’ve

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.350
been trying to do a lot to actually fix the
ozone layer and here you now have the idea

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.529
of introducing something that could destroy
it again.

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:10.570
And it’s not just those risks that make
this project controversial, it’s the fear

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.830
held by many of the scientists themselves
that just the suggestion of a magic bullet

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.600
gives governments an excuse to keep pumping
up emissions.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.190
So Gernot, you’ve been running the numbers
on this, is it economically feasible?

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.179
Part of the problem is just how much cheaper
this geoengineering would be than switching

00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:31.179
to renewables.

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:33.340
If anything it is too cheap.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.419
Economist Gernot Wagner is the project’s
executive director.

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:43.590
It’s so cheap that we are talking about
single digit billions of dollars to potentially

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.499
influence the entire planet’s climate.

00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:51.609
Now if I was running a fossil fuel corporation,
I’d be thinking great, this can solve the

00:19:51.609 --> 00:19:54.179
problem and we can keep digging up coal.

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:59.100
And frankly that’s the problem, right? So,
you might consider that a vested interest

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:05.190
would in fact be very interested in something
like this as yet another excuse not to cut

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.049
CO2 emissions.

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:14.780
I very often compare stratospheric geoengineering
to painkillers. This does not fix the problem,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.750
right? It has nothing about CO2, the first
order. We’re just reducing symptoms and

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.629
then human nature can kick in and say, well
you know it’s hard to deal with changing

00:20:24.629 --> 00:20:29.129
the energy infrastructure – which is very
true, it’s a huge problem – so we’re

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:33.080
not there yet. Let’s wait with that.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.229
The irony is that for all the work this team
is doing, they hope this geoengineering will

00:20:38.229 --> 00:20:45.970
never have to be used. They just want to make
sure the real benefits and hazards are known

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:52.070
before governments or corporations try it.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.690
But what we can do is provide as many facts
as possible that can inform us about the risks,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:02.100
that can find ways that perhaps have less
risks, but in the end, any decision will always

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.320
have to be based on imperfect knowledge.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.389
Do you ever feel like this is playing god?

00:21:07.389 --> 00:21:13.710
It is. There’s a huge amount of hubris in
this idea of saying, well oh we’ve caused

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.009
the problem, let’s fix the problem and I
know how to do this. We’re going to do this

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:21.740
and we know exactly what’s going to happen
to the whole planet. Yes, it has a lot of

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:31.200
that. It’s actually quite unsettling and
quite frankly makes me quite anxious.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.539
Whatever geoengineering can achieve the IPCC
says the most carbon intense fuel should still

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:46.570
be phased out by 2050. At our next stop we’ll
see how the industry is fighting back.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:53.539
And it can now reduce its emissions by up
to 40 per cent. It’s coal. Isn’t it amazing

00:21:53.539 --> 00:22:06.769
what this little black rock can do?

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:15.729
Houston is a city built on carbon. Mining
fossil fuels is as much a part of Texan culture

00:22:15.729 --> 00:22:24.660
as raising cattle or boot-scooting. But these
days big energy is trying to sidestep demands

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:32.700
to cut production. Its response is a much-touted
technology to cut the carbon footprint.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:45.229
Well today we’re heading out to Texas’
biggest power plant. It’s a pioneer of what

00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:50.529
the industry likes to call ‘clean coal’.

00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:59.810
This is Petra Nova. It’s a coal fired generator
with a billion dollar absorption tower. After

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.860
the coal is burned, the emissions are pumped
through it and solvent collects much of the

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.269
CO2 before it hits the atmosphere.

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:14.279
Hi, I’m here with David, the vice president
of NRG, the owner of….

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:20.190
In 2017 Josh Frydenberg, then Australia’s
Energy and Environment Minister, took to Facebook

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.509
to extol it.

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:30.470
What’s so exciting about this project and
this facility is its inclusion of carbon capture

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:38.499
and storage. Helping to reduce the carbon
footprint by some 40 per cent but also including

00:23:38.499 --> 00:23:39.499
enhanced oil recovery.

00:23:39.499 --> 00:23:45.260
But it’s early days to get excited. The
tower captures carbon from just one of the

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.429
complex’s ten generator units. What’s
more it doesn’t actually reduce emissions

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:58.179
overall. The captured carbon is pumped in
liquid form into an oil field.

00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:02.919
So you put CO2 in an oil field and you get
more oil out?

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:03.919
Right.

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:09.159
As company spokesman David Knox explains,
it breaks up stubborn deposits so they can

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:10.779
extract more oil.

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:17.259
The CO2 has a tendency, it bonds with oil
and when it bonds it makes it slipperier.

00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:21.749
And when it’s slipperier, it comes off of
the rock, that last bit of oil in there.

00:24:21.749 --> 00:24:25.859
But if you’re capturing CO2, but to get
more oil out, aren’t you actually increasing

00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.499
the amount of CO2 overall?

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:32.749
It would if we were increasing the amount
of oil that’s being used, but we don’t

00:24:32.749 --> 00:24:36.860
actually have any impact on the amount of
oil that’s being used. The oil is the same

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.310
amount being used, we’re just increasing
the domestic production and we don’t have

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:49.109
to import as much oil from foreign countries.

00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:54.739
The industry is looking at other options like
super heating coal, but that still produces

00:24:54.739 --> 00:25:01.289
high emissions without cost offsets. This
unit and a smaller one in Canada, are the

00:25:01.289 --> 00:25:07.399
only ones at coal fired plants using carbon
capture commercially.

00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:13.809
There is such a thing as clean coal but it
is only at these two units. The economics

00:25:13.809 --> 00:25:18.779
are very challenging. When will there be another
one built? I’m not good at predicting the

00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:24.019
future, but we now know that we can build
one on time, on budget.

00:25:24.019 --> 00:25:30.149
The uncertainty hasn’t stopped politicians
insisting the industry is saved.

00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:37.649
We have ended the war on beautiful clean coal.

00:25:37.649 --> 00:25:42.250
Even Bjorn Lomborg, a sometime consultant
to big energy, is sceptical.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:48.179
Well clean coal has been a mirage for very
many years. It would be wonderful if you could

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:54.090
actually have all the benefits of the cheapest
fossil fuel and cut the carbon emissions.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:59.849
But it turns out, it’s fairly expensive
to do on the coal fired power plant. That

00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:03.480
is, it actually takes out some of the energy
that you would otherwise have produced. So

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.129
it has real costs and of course you also have
to store it securely, and there’s been lots

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:12.600
of conversations about that. We’ve not really
seen it running and we certainly haven’t

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.749
seen it running cheaply. So again, it’s
one of the things that we should investigate

00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:22.450
but we’re not ready to do it any time soon.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:30.789
Back in Copenhagen, ordinary citizens continue
to do their bit for the environment. Dr Lomborg

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:37.769
doubts his compatriots would ever accept the
real cost of abandoning fossil fuels.

00:26:37.769 --> 00:26:42.570
Most people are not content to only be able
to charge their phones or have their TVs running

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:49.019
or indeed their operating theatres in hospitals
running when the sun is shining and when the

00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:55.299
sun is not shining, the cost from solar panels
is infinite and likewise with wind turbines

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:57.450
and when the wind is not blowing.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:02.220
It’s not true this idea that when the sun’s
not shining, the wind’s not blowing that

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.470
we’re not getting energy. Because when the
sun is shining and the wind is blow, you can

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:12.789
charge batteries and so the frontier is battery
technology.

00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:20.450
No matter how fast the world switches to renewable
energy, the age of untested, high risk geoengineering

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.359
could soon be upon us.

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:29.349
We don’t get there by going neutral. For
better or for worse, geoengineering is part

00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:37.370
of the mix going forward. Because we cannot
get to where we need to be by conservation

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.489
alone.

00:27:38.489 --> 00:27:45.499
It could be the last throw of the dice to
save the planet. After decades of governments

00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:50.769
ignoring dire warnings, simply going green
may not be going far enough
