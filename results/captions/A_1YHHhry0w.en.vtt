00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.560
Wow this is a really nice place Stuart.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.180
Well I wanted to take you someplace special tonight Miss Lansb--

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.960
Kaylie.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.580
Kaylie! I've been coming here for years.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.620
This place is practically an institution.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.540
I'm putting your purse on the back of your chair!

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.260
Thank you.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.960
Is there anything else, sir?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.400
No -uh- no everything's fine.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.380
Sorry, he just looks familiar.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.360
It's okay.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.940
So I have an interview for a new job next week.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.260
It's just a job interview for the Marriott,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.520
but it'll allow me to take some classes.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.820
see if I can do some more photography stuff --hey!

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.940
It's okay. I'm having a really delightful time with you.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.060
I feel the same way.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.880
But if things are going to get serious between us I should--

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880
maybe come clean about something.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.300
Okay?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.840
You should know -uh-

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.520
I'm not sure how to say this.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.880
It's okay.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.600
Kaylie -uh-

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.500
I'm from the future!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
I traveled here two weeks ago from the year 2078.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.640
I came here using a time travel app.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.900
We have to go back?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.400
No, it's kind of a one-way trip.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.180
There's a whole "disrupting the fabric of time" thing.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.140
Look I can show you the app.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.200
Hi Stuart. You've accessed your phone again.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200
What do you want me to do?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.400
Oh no. He came with the -uh-

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.460
I feel strange. Current network of 4G?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.980
What odd wasteland have you brought me to 15G man.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.900
Oh my god! These are like olden days!

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.960
This is hella old!

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.320
Did you get shots before you came here because you ought to get shots!

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.480
This is so old!

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.740
Okay, okay! Just turn that thing off!

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.780
Okay.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.740
I believe you.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.460
But - why travel back to now?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.600
Do you have to stop an assassination or -

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.420
or kill the next Hitler or something?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.360
Actually, I came back to date you - to be your boyfriend.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.540
Wait - what?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.260
Am I, like, some famous historical figure or something?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.220
No - no - no! Nothing like that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.000
You're actually a resident in the nursing home I work at.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.680
Nursing home?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.940
Can I have some more wine? Thank you.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.960
Sorry, I'm sorry. I just -uh-

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.320
I'm in - in a nursing home?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.360
Well yeah! I mean, you're a lot older 63 years from now.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.380
You can't take care of yourself so I take care of you.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.420
What about my children? Why aren't I with them?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300
You never had any children.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600
Maybe we can change that this time around.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.480
Right! Let's take it slow. We'll take it slow, we'll take it slow.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.080
I get - stuck - in a nursing home?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.520
Okay, I know this a lot to take Miss Lans - Kaylie!

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.900
Wow, I really need to stop doing that. Kaylie, Kaylie, Kaylie...

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.840
I know this a lot to handle but I think you're a really amazing old woman.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.200
When I met you six decade from now,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.060
I was really taken back with how well you and I clicked.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.640
There was just this chemistry, you know? But the age difference was a bit much.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.180
So I thought  - hey - if we get along so well now, I bet if we were the same age

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.040
we would be the perfect couple.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.580
Woah, woah.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.620
What year were you born?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.500
2050

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.420
2050?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.140
Yeah, the year the Cubs finally win the world series.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.700
But -

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.660
Look, maybe seeing some images of us will make you feel better.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.360
Hey Stuart I got you someth -

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.860
Video Menu

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520
I found my grandma's old BlueRay player

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.860
and set it up in your room so we could watch all those old high defs.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.560
I think it's working. I've never tried the selfie droning mode.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.180
Oh, you hit power. Power.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.680
Oh my god. That's me.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.200
Here we are at your bone density screening.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.920
I love that dress on you. Do you have that yet?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.080
No...

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.360
And look! Here's your 90th birthday party.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.480
Who are you?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.100
Happy Birthday!

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.440
What?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.640
Okay, you know what - ah -

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800
this is too weird.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.000
I can't - uh - I -

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.880
I was planning on having sex with you tonight.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.880
Really? That's great.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.720
No! Not great!

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.720
It would be super weird to be naked in front of you now.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.820
No, it'll be fine.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.120
I see you naked every day when I give you your morning sponge bath.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.640
Gross!

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.620
Kaylie, do you know how many people end up dating their nurses?

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.060
This is different Stuart! It's not like we met in physical therapy.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.620
We would never be normal.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.420
I would never meet your friends or your family or your parents!

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.100
You could meet my grandparents -

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.780
my grandma actually attends the Jr. High right by your apartment.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.360
Jesus! I'm older than your grandmother!

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.460
We can make this work. You and me. We can do this.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
Next week, you're going to get that job at the Marriott

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.900
and they give you this really great plaque when you retire.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.420
50 years of service -

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.600
It's just like that Jay Weatherman's - Jay Weatherman...

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.840
Oh my god. Our waiter is Jay Weatherman, the famous musician!

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.260
- The what? The reception job?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
- He's going to become the godfather of psych-rock in a few years.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
When I retire? (He's huge!)

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.440
What about my - my photography career?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.280
Sort of thought that was a hobby you used to have.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.100
Okay. Nope. Uh. I'm done. I'm done.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.880
I can't. I just cant.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.620
Okay, where are you going?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.520
Look, I don't know why you thought coming back in time

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.780
and lying to me about who you were

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.000
and then just unloading every little, grizzly detail about my life

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.720
was going to work out well for you romantically

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.860
but I am NOT that old lady that you knew.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.540
I don't want to BE that old lady that you knew.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.540
You should have stayed in your own time.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.620
You would have had a better shot with me then.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.240
Ew, no that's gross. / Well I might be into it...

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.240
No... I just -

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.500
you're a creep and I will see you in fifty years!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.800
Here you are, sir.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.560
Keep it up, man. The bands going to make it.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.960
Band?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.020
Stuart, it looked like you were attempting to access -

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.200
Oh? Did she go?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.820
Oh, Stuart. Oh, buddy.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.740
Oh poodle-do. Oh poodle baby Stuart.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.440
I'm not good in these situations.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.780
I'm sorry your date didn't work out.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:33.540
Alright, ready? Yes. One, two, three....

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.100
Yay! Yay! You did it! She did it! Yay!

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.440
I'm having a really delightful time with you tonight, young man.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.860
Yeah, oh you used to think so anyway.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.880
Do you know where my purse is?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.120
Do you know where my purse is?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.300
Let me just get this straight.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:11.020
In the year 2075, I'm a single, retired, hotel worker with no children living in a state funded nursing home.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.060
Yes.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.600
You are a man who not only enjoyed spending time with me as a doddering old lady,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.720
but you also decided to dangerously travel back in time to go on a date with me.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.360
Well, yeah.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.840
And, if things worked between us,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.960
there's a possibility we could change that future?

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.920
Absolutely.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.160
I need you to forget the future you know.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
We're going to make our own future.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.320
Deal?

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.680
Deal.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.660
Let's go.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.120
Can I just say one thing?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.880
What?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.020
I just really want you to take better care of your teeth this time around.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.700
Stuart.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.800
You have really beautiful teeth.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800
No, stop, not okay, not okay.
