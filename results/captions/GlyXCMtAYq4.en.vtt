00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.420
Medical science is changing, for example
when we started talking about

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.480
intermittent fasting, which is truly a
method, a diet, it's literally the oldest

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.990
dietary intervention known to humanity.
It's been used for thousands of years.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.609
And we know that if you don't eat,
nothing bad will happen you'll burn some

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.000
sugar, you'll burn some fat, that's the
reason you have body fats, so that if

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.510
you don't have anything to eat, you're
gonna burn that fat. So nothing bad

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
really happens.
So intermittent fasting, for example, five

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
years will go when I started talking about
it and using it for patients as a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
therapeutic option, because we don't make
anybody do it, we can't make anybody do anything.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.890
We give them the option to do it.
Everybody thought it was the craziest,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.190
stupidest idea they'd ever heard. And
just last month I went to San Diego to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.960
give the keynote lecture for the Obesity
Medicine Association, which is the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.510
largest association of obesity
specialists in the United States. And

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.830
there were hundreds and hundreds of
doctors there wanting to know about how

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.930
to use intermittent fasting so that they
could also make their patients better.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.390
The problem is, I think that the doctors
and the medical community in general is

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.759
very slow to change, and that's really
one of the reasons why I go to sort of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.340
popular books and social media, because
this is a message that doesn't need to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.729
be delivered to a doctor to change the
message, we want people to kind of be

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.610
empowered, and the thing is that medical
science, everybody thinks it moves very

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.070
fast, is very very slow, so you could have
debates ongoing. If your blood sugar

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.930
drops, then you don't need to take
medications. And then, if you continue to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.090
not eat, you'll lose weight. And then if
you lose weight, your diabetes your

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.729
type 2 diabetes will go away. Again, I
don't think anybody is gonna argue with that.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.760
So the question is, why don't we just do
that? And that's what we do. I'm not gonna

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.830
make my patient, who I know in 12 years
will be on dialysis, I'm not gonna

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.459
make them wait 12 years assuming
that I can actually get the funding for

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.310
this. My duty to him or her is to take
care of them right now

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.590
to the best of my ability. So I do that.
And we see cases every single day. So we

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.420
have an intensive dietary management
program and every single day I come in,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.440
and just this morning for example, I saw
a lady - 15 years of type 2 diabetes on 80

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.130
units of insulin, followed by a
specialist an endocrinologist. I took her

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.430
from 80 units of insulin to zero and her
A1C is now 5.9 % which

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.500
is classified, because she's on no
medications and her A1C is below 6%, she

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.700
actually classified as a non-diabetic.
So we took a severe type 2 diabetes and

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.760
in four months we moved her and she
would be classified as a non-diabetic.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.519
This is a reversible disease, but I don't
need to prove it to anybody. I need to

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.170
treat people. And that's what I do. I mean,
it would be great if somebody gave to me

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.180
a, you know, a couple million dollars to
hire five or ten researchers full-time

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.150
who can do a study, but that's not gonna
happen and I don'tsee

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.209
that as a very logical solution. We can
do both at the same time. So when you

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.590
take the message out sort of directly to
the people on the frontlines, that is the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.480
doctors who want to be there, the
patients who want to be there, they want to

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.440
know, because something like fasting,
something like low carbohydrate diets,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.700
it's an option. I'm not saying that
everybody in the world must do it, I'm

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.010
saying you can give it a try, it's okay.
If you do well, great. If you don't do

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.669
well, then don't do it. But at least you
have the option. It's like a tool in your

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.799
toolbox -  it's better to have that there,
rather than saying "Oh, you must never do

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.490
this." It's ridiculous really to to give
that sort of,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.930
you know, to take away those choices from
patients when they should really, you

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:33.739
know, be empowered to to make decisions
for themselves.
