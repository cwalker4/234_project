00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.960
Aussies have a pretty distinct accent.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.800
And it’s one that Hollywood finds hard to
imitate.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.100
Imitate *well*, that is.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.420
But every now and then, we get something like this.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.420
Here’s Liev Schreiber’s own accent, for
comparison.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.600
Not that you did, Liev.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.480
So what makes the Aussie accent so hard to do properly?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.511
It is really challenging because it’s
similar to a lot of different accents, it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.569
has components of a lot of different accents and I think that’s where people get derailed.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.000
Leith McPherson is a dialect coach, and the Head of Voice at the Victorian College of the Arts.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.230
I always find it quite pleasing when I
listen to accent tapes where one person is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.780
demonstrating 17 different accents, and
you go wow, impressive, and they get to the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.520
Australian and you go, nah.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.220
To understand the intricacies of the Aussie accent, we have to look at how it was born.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.480
The Australian accent started more than 200 years ago in January 1788, when the first

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.500
European settlement landed.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.430
Aboriginal Australians were already here at the time, of course, but English was a foreign

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.980
language to them.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.520
The first colonies of Australia mainly came from south-eastern England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.480
It was the children of these colonists who
would’ve created the Australian accent.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.020
These children had their parents’ accents,
but also would’ve been influenced by the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.920
other children around them.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.420
By the 1830s, these different sounds caused a new and distinct accent to emerge.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.780
Even as late as the mid-1900s, you can still hear that British influence.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720
But overtime, those traits decreased as people embraced the Australian identity.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.780
Sorry, Mr Keating.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.480
Anyway, this constant change has evolved the accent into what we know today as Australian English.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.060
So why is it so hard for others to get right?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.340
I think it’s because of that familiarity,
so your brain will always, is always looking for patterns.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.920
It’s always looking for things that it already knows.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.540
Take for example, Robert Kazinsky: he's a British actor playing an Australian character in Pacific Rim.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.200
And it ends up sort of sounding like
a weird kind of Cockney sort of thing that

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.079
people are doing, and you think 'ah, that’s
what your brain is hearing', your brain is

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.969
hearing that pattern and then grouping it
all together.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.520
Compared to something like this.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.740
Now, before you get all defensive in the comments, no, there is no “one” Australian accent.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.400
There are three general groupings of the accent: cultivated, broad, and general.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.480
But nowadays those definitions aren’t really adequate, as we've shifted towards

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.230
a more general accent.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.559
A better way to group the accent would be Standard Australian, Aboriginal English, and

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.640
Ethnocultural Australian English.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.520
That last one reflects the fact that everyone has an idiolect — your own accent is shaped

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.430
by the history of where you’ve lived and
who you’ve grown up with, so we all sound

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.990
a bit different from each other.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.980
But there are plenty of common traits.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.900
Maybe because he’s a New Zealander, but
that’s not quite right.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.940
The back of the mouth, at least, should be
really open.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.020
So you can feel like you’re almost sitting
on the edge of your seat looking down a little

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.320
bit, like you’re feeling like you’re looking
over the edge of something, and that’s going

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.610
to lift your tongue up at the back and give
you that warm kind of bright quality that

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.070
really distinguishes this accent.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.520
You don’t hear a lot of Australians sort
of talking like that, you don’t hear that

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.160
kind of dull, what we call a denasal sound,
Australians are much more likely to have a

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.240
level of nasality.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.820
So when people are actually making a statement, but they’re actually going up in tune, as

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.370
they’re talking to you.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.001
And you may notice that quite a lot, but again it doesn’t happen everywhere, it’s not

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:46.940
a distinguishing characteristic but it is
a trait which American speakers for example

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.990
would have to learn.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.040
And finally, ahh what was the last one again?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.170
The hesitation sound, which is a really
good way of figuring out how someone’s mouth

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.120
works in a different accent or language.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680
Ahh, that’s it.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.640
So to know that that’s where the Australian tongue rests is hugely helpful for

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.600
like if, um, like for Scots if I’m doing like a Scottish accent, um, like that’s

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.150
their hesitation sound which is really high
and forward, takes a lot of effort for us

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.720
but that’s where their tongue rests, so
for them to just drop back to ahh gives you

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.750
a sense of the whole landscape that you’re working with.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.320
And there are plenty of other common traits, like our lack of enunciation and our sing-songy flow.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.340
But who knows — with technology connecting us to other cultures and ways of speaking,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.420
maybe in 100 years we’ll sound totally different.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.820
It's interesting to see that maybe we might have more of an American influence coming in and

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.470
less of a British influence.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.550
But where that takes us, oooh I don’t know.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.060
What an exciting journey.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.920
Hi there, thanks for watching!

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.180
Before this video ends, it’s important to
quickly mention that learning any accent is

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.640
a difficult task — and sometimes actors
aren’t given enough time to learn an accent

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.420
during a busy production period.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.120
So while they might've been able to do the accent off set, they weren't able to do it on set.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820
Maybe.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.820
Or maybe they were really just bad.
