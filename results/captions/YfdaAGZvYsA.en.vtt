Well, good evening, London

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.319
Two weeks ago Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.329
Met in person for the first time on stage in Vancouver

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.479
Two nights ago the three of us got together for the first time in Dublin and it's a huge thrill for all of us

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.479
To now be here with you in the o2

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.209
As I said to Travis when these events were planned I'm not moderate enough to be a moderator

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.070
But I'm going to do a little bit of

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.530
fielding to begin with

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.950
so

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.020
Let me start by saying a little of some of the ground. We are going to be trying to cover here tonight

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.830
We're going to be dealing with the conflict between science and reason

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.969
We're going to be addressing the legitimacy did I say science and reason

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
We're not addressing that

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.679
We're going to be looking at the legitimacy of holding on to religion in any form and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.459
We are also going to be addressing the fact that we need to hide in a sports stadium

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.040
to address serious issues

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.869
But I think to begin with I'm going to hand over to Sam and he's going to kick us off properly

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.109
Thank you. And first thank you all for coming out. I you really can't imagine how humbling this is

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.230
Be here with you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.940
You really just should just take a moment to appreciate this from our side because

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.580
Justin Bieber is not coming out to sing and in the middle of this as amusing as that would be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.430
and you know though we

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.970
Put a date like this on the calendar with apparent confidence

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.320
There's really no guarantee that you guys are going to show up and we will never take this for granted

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.959
So it's really an immense privilege to be here with you. So

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.020
I thought I could start by

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.499
first acknowledging how fun this has been to have this these series of dialogues

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.109
With Jordan now, this is the fourth event. We've done and the second with Douglas and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.860
We clearly share a common project we are trying to figure out how to live the best lives possible

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.480
both individually and collectively and we're trying to figure out how to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120
build societies

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.230
that safeguard that opportunity for as many people as possible and I think we each have a sense that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.559
Ideas are really the prime movers here

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.500
That is it's not that the world is filled with bad people doing bad things because that's what bad people do

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.619
Oh, there's some of that it it is mostly that

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.399
So much of humanity is living under the sway of bad ideas

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.099
And it's bad ideas that can cause good people or at least totally normal people like ourselves

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.940
to do bad things all the while trying to to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.820
Live the best possible lives and that really is the tragedy of our circumstance that we can be that confused

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.669
So this is where the difference between Jordan and and me in particular opens up

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.890
Which is how do you view religion in this in this contest of between good ideas and bad ideas and for me religion?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.910
emphatically

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.989
gets placed on the side of bad and old and and

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.089
worth retiring ideas or ideas worth retiring and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.470
I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.420
Guess I but by analogy I would I would

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.629
Ask you to consider astrology right now Hannah. Maybe I can just get a sense of what I'm talking to

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.969
What percentage of you I want to know believe in astrology which is to say but who among you and you can signal this by?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.730
by applause or howls of

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.220
Enthusiasm what what percentage of you let me just spell it out. So I know you know what you're committing to

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.689
And you know how crazy your neighbor is in fact

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.529
What percentage do you believe that human personalities and human events and the difference between good and bad luck and a human life is the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.490
result of

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.960
What the planets are doing against the background of stars?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.990
Let's hear it somebody out there

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.679
Okay, so then you should know that something like 25% of your your neighbors believe that

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.190
There you go, so the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.299
I'm here. Wait, wait wait, I'm hearing I'm hearing a heckler among the astrologers is that

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.360
Is the FIR the first?

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.029
Astrological heckler I've heard haha

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760
You must be an aries, sir

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.189
So it won't surprise you I have a related question which is

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.020
What

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.040
what percentage of you I want to know our

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.419
religious which is say well who among you believe in God a

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.019
Personal God a God that can hear prayers a God that can take an interest in the lives of human beings and occasionally

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.549
Enforce good outcomes versus bad outcomes

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.880
What who among you and now again, I want to hear applause or silence believe in it that sort of God

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.419
Okay, so this is my concern is my concern with with what Jordan has been saying and right in

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.680
lo these many months

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.820
I

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.469
Feel that you're in danger of misleading these the second group of people that the way you talk about God

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.719
has convinced and will continue to convince some percentage of humanity that

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:02.029
It's it's fine to hold on to this old sword of God this God that can hear prayers and they can intervene or not in

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.030
the lives of human beings

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.799
And you know as we've begun to explore that I think there are a lot of problems with that kind of belief

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:18.560
If nothing else there are many such gods on offer and there and and devotion to them it becomes irreconcilable among the true believers and

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.710
My concern is it you could do

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.669
Exactly what you do with religion with astrology, right? It would be it would be no more legitimate to to

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.430
Obfuscate the boundary between clear thinking and and

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.139
superstition there because

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.370
the

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:44.570
This traditional God and the and the doctrines that support him or are no firmer ground

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.470
Than astrology is now today an astrology

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.679
Almost everything you say about religion

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.609
It's the fact that his organized human thinking for thousands of years that it's a cultural Universal

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:05.779
that every every group of people has has given rise to some form of it that it has archetypal significance that it

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:13.188
has powerful stories all of that can be said about astrology and it and in fact some additional things can be said about

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:17.059
astrology that are would argue in its favor for instance astrology is

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:25.369
Profoundly egalitarian, you know, there's there's no bad zodiac sign every whoever you are. Everyone's got a great zodiac sign and

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:33.588
You know, it's just a inconvenient fact of the discipline that if I read you Charles Manson's horoscope

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.649
you know 95% of the audience would find it relevant and

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.749
and that's just that's how easily falsifiable stralla g is but

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.838
My concern is that we could live in a world

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.690
Where societies are shattered over things like, you know different zodiac

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.609
Interpretations and we don't live in that world for good reason because we have beaten

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:02.209
Astrology into submission and I would say that religion in terms of revealed religion and belief in a personal God

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:09.739
is over the centuries getting the same treatment by science and rationality and should be and it is a a

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:13.549
Preferred circumstance that we live in a world that is that is shattered by religion

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.579
So, I think what I'll do first is adopt the

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.429
Exceptionally difficult and likely counterproductive position of saying something

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.960
Not so much in defense of religion, but in defense of astrology

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.700
knowing

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.540
knowing full well that that's fundamentally a fool's errand but there's something I want to point out is that

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.530
First of all

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.680
Astrology

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.910
was astronomy in its nascent form and

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:06.900
astrology was also science in its nascent form just like alchemy was chemistry in its nascent form and

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.580
so sometimes

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.910
You have to dream a crazy dream

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.570
with all of the error that that crazy dream entails

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.470
Because you have an intuition that there's something there

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.950
To motivate you to develop the intuition to the point where it actually becomes of genuine practical utility

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.879
now when we look back on the astrologers and

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.129
we view their contributions to the history of the world with

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.899
contempt we should also remember that the people who built Stonehenge for example, and the first people who decided

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:49.830
determined that our fates were in part written in the stars were people whose

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:58.410
Astrological beliefs were indistinguishable from their astronomical beliefs and you might think well in what sense is your fate?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.260
written in the Stars and I would say

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:07.290
It's certainly the case insofar as there are such things as cosmic regularities

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.080
so it was the dream of

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:16.200
astrology that there was some relationship between the movement of the planetary bodies and the fixed stars and

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.890
Human destiny and that's what drove us to build the first

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.330
astronomical

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.270
observatories and to also determine that there was a proper time for planting and a proper time for

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.040
Harvesting and a way of orienting yourself in the world for example by using the north

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.710
It's also the poetic

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:41.670
ground that enabled us to identify the notion that you could look up and orient yourself towards the heavens and that there was a

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.849
Metaphorical relationship between that and positioning yourself properly in life and at a deeper level

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:54.240
The the the cosmos was the place that the human imaginative drama was

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:00.719
Externalized and draped itself out into the world as something that was essentially observable so that we could derive great

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.939
orienting fictions from the observation of our imagination and so

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.849
Part of the problem that that Sam is pointing to is the difficulty of distinguishing

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:18.660
Valid poetic impulse from invalid poetic impulse and that really is a tremendous problem

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:26.010
You you see that arise also in people who have religious delusions attendant upon manic depressive disorder or schizophrenia

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.010
but so much of what eventually

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:36.330
Manifests itself is hard core pragmatic scientific belief has its origin in wild flights of poetic

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.309
Fantasy and it's also the case by the way that that's actually how your brain is organized

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:48.869
As far as I can tell that when you and and it isn't just me. I actually it's it's there's a very large

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.570
What would you call it research literature?

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:59.099
Outlining the relative functions of the right and left hemisphere and it certainly appears to be the case that when we encounter something. Absolutely

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.300
unknowable or unknown

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.030
What we do is drape that unknown thing in fantasy as a first pass

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.370
approximation to the truth and then refine that fantasy as a consequence of

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:17.219
Iterative critical analysis and so Sam believes that what should happen

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:23.850
Is that the the poetic and fictional domain should be some planted by the rational domain?

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.190
Well, let me just close the loop there

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:34.140
it's not quite I think we we need poetry and fiction and then there's there's more to engage in with reality than being a

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.640
Scientist in a white lab coat, but we need to be able to clearly distinguish

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.810
fact from fantasy or fact from mere merely fertile flights of the imagination and

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:52.169
we want to be rigorous there and rational there and it's not that it's not that there's no place or

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.250
Mere creativity. That's not well, I guess well

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:03.960
then the rails of rationality look fair enough then but I mean then then partly what we are disputing is the the relevant the

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.909
What the relative import and the of those two domains?

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:14.219
Let's say the heretic and the fictional and the rational and status of religion now in that

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.140
Well, I have a hard time reconciling that to some degree with your with your more

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.039
What would you say formal statements about the problem?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.650
because your mechanism the mechanism that you put forth above all outside of truth is

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.669
Rationality and it isn't clear to me if you're willing to allow the utility of spiritual experience

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.759
which you do and and and if you're willing to make

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.229
What would you say allowances for the necessity of the poetic imagination?

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.129
exactly how it is that that is also

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.260
Encapsulated under the rubric of pure rationality see

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.440
Let's see and here's something you can tell me what you think about this

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.059
And I've been thinking a lot about what Sam and I have been talking about by the way, you know

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:07.380
So I'm making the case in my writing that the democratic institutions not only grew out of the judeo-christian substrate

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.460
but that their that that they're properly ensconced within that substrate, but I'm also perfectly aware that

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:22.499
not every religious or poetic system gives rise to democratic institutions first and also that there are

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.270
Christian

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:31.379
Sub structures may be the most obviously in the case of the Russian Orthodox Church. Where the same

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:38.489
metaphysical principles apply but out of which a democracy did not emerge and so it does seem to me that

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.959
what we have in the West is the consequence of the interplay between the

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.660
fantasy predicated poetic

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.890
judeo-christian tradition and the

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.640
rational critique that was aimed at that by the

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:57.270
Enlightenment figures and that seems to me to mirror something like the proper balance between the right hemisphere and its poetic imagination

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.569
and the left hemisphere and it's critical capacity and

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.239
Then I would say that part of the way so one of the questions you brought up was. How do we

00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:09.419
Decide which let's say religious in

00:16:10.089 --> 00:16:13.679
Intuitions are valid and I think we do that in part through

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:16.949
negotiated agreement, you know because people have

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:23.039
Look even even among the Catholics say in the medieval time. There was an absolute horror of heresy

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.230
So if you were some mendicant monk

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.749
And you had a profound religious vision?

00:16:28.089 --> 00:16:33.808
the probability that you were going to be tried as a heretic and burnt at the stake was extremely high because even the

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.269
gatekeepers of the religious tradition realized that

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.909
religious revelation untrammeled by

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.949
Something like community dialogue something like that was something extraordinary

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:47.248
Danger and so I would agree with you that

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.399
The poetic imagination and the ground of religious revelation is something that can lead people dangerously astray

00:16:53.470 --> 00:17:01.110
But I would say at the same time that it constitutes the grounds of our initial exploration and that it's actually in a radically necessary

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.419
Okay, well briefly address that and I want to ask a question that brings Douglas directly in here

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:12.479
I I think this is an instance of what's called the genetic fallacy the idea that because

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.089
Something emerged the way it did historically

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:23.339
As a matter of historical contingency, it is the the the the origin is in fact good and worth maintaining

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.329
or that it was in fact necessary that we couldn't get these good things like democracy any other way or were unlikely to and I

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.600
Would say that that there's no Abrahamic religion

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:38.489
That is the best conceivable womb of democracy or anything else

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:44.789
We like science that were a great place to get Douglass involved so it but but I would just add one other category of

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.380
Thinking here we have what we think is factual and

00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:56.789
Methods by which we derive facts and I would put rationality there and an empirical engagement with with reality

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.630
then we have

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.839
other good things in life like

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.929
Fiction and and flights of fancy that are pleasing for one reason or another and could be generative

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.859
toward the first category, but then we also have

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.100
I know I would acknowledge we've spoken about this before

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:21.000
Useful fictions and cases I would you know, hope rare cases where where fiction is

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.879
more adaptive or more useful than the truth right that there's a

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.029
Sometimes the truth can can be not worth knowing and I would argue that they you know, there are those cases

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:33.539
Okay

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:37.979
But they're not so they're few and far between but we should focus on that but some degree of so

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.939
I wanted to point to Douglas here and focus on that because I think your fear Douglas is that

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:47.398
my style or you know, Richard Dawkins or style or Christopher Hitchens a style of

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:55.739
Anti theism, you know, just let's let's just throw the vicar's from the rooftops now because it's time to end this thing

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.970
Literally get off Twitter now. But yeah

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.909
That's a hashtag. Yeah. Yes

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.570
Your concern has been that

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:14.130
And I think what Jordan shares this that that so much of what is good in our Western developed societies?

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.100
is

00:19:17.409 --> 00:19:21.479
The very least maintained by mayn't maintaining

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.470
so-called

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:29.370
Judeo-christian values or the or the remnants of our past religiosity and that you know

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.209
there is a baby in the bath water that can be difficult to discern and

00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:38.129
We can to empty the tub all at once because and this is very much of because there's a zero-sum

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:42.989
Contest with the the religious enthusiasm. We see coming from the Muslim world

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.309
And of course the Muslim world is all over the world at the moment

00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:54.119
So in that contest between a very an older style of religiosity and the theocracy

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.279
really and modernity

00:19:56.289 --> 00:20:00.269
You are not as eager as I have been to to pull up

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.000
Western religiosity by the roots

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.640
Or chocolate vicars. Yes

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.510
Yes, I think that's fair. I think I sit

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.010
metaphorically as well as literally between the two of you I

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:17.969
Realized from our conversation in Dublin some of

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:24.660
what your concerns are about what Jordan has been saying and what he is saying and I share some of the concern I

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.540
said to you then that I used the

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.010
analogy of water

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.620
And Eric Weinstein recently described to me as Jesus smuggling

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:40.560
But it was a consequence of a discussion about biologists. What do you do if you're discussing?

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.679
design intelligent design

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.730
You can be okay as long as your own

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:54.869
Bandwidth on this on the issue as long as your own depth of knowledge on the issue is very considerable. You can be okay

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.269
discussing that biology with somebody even a fundamentalist Christian

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.450
So long as you can follow every step of the way

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:10.439
But the fear will always be at the moment. You're not looking they're gonna smuggle Jesus in

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.110
Or they'll wait till the moment that you're not comfortable

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.669
anymore with the argument the bit when you're at the very end of your cognitive ability, and then they'll

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.639
Trust me. There's Jesus. There's Jesus

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.440
and

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.440
one of the things I realized from Dublin was

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:36.540
Although I think you may not think that Jordan himself is going to try Jesus smuggling on you

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.070
You fear that?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:44.159
Somewhere down the line from what he's saying. Somebody else will do that trick. Yes, it's worse than that

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:49.229
I actually know the people the people who were clapping are doing that

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.750
I hear from those people on a daily basis

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.439
right so that the segment of Jordan's audience that is that is

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.090
Very happy to be told they can stay on the riverbanks of their traditional

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.380
Christianity for the most part and they don't have to get into the stream of

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:12.929
totally monitor and rigorous rational thinking about everything from first principles right that there's something that that the Iron Age

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.080
Scribes got right and it's right for all time

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.980
those are

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.819
those are the applause I'm hearing and and and

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:29.009
However, consciously or not Jordan is telling them it's okay to stay stick right there with a with a shard of the cross

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:37.019
Actually tried a little conscious Jesus smuggling on Sam to see how that would in a discussion we had about

00:22:37.629 --> 00:22:41.699
The central archetype of superheroes, but I'm gonna try something a little different tonight

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:47.909
I'm gonna try a little direct God smuggling we won't bother with Jesus. Let's go right to God. Why not?

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:52.888
So one of the things I've really tried to do when I've been analyzing

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:56.939
Religious texts is to take them as to take them

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:04.139
seriously in the sense that I don't presume that I understand them and I presume that they're a

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:11.939
Mystery of sorts and at least the Bible for example is a mystery because we don't really understand the processes by which it was

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:18.628
constructed and we don't understand the processes by which we all agreed collectively over several thousand years to

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:20.889
Organize the book the way it

00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:27.329
Is organized or to edit it the way that it's edited or the and to keep what's in it and to and to discard

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.320
what's not in it and why it's

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.730
Lasted and why it's had such a huge impact why I don't want to

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:37.109
Derail you but we do understand that the first part of the process all too

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.350
well

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.399
We know that the this there was a political and all-too-human

00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:48.149
process of voting certain texts in for inclusion and some were in for centuries and then got jettisoned and

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:51.298
and sure a revelation came in far later than

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:52.360
whole

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.319
Generations of Christians who lived and died under the banner of the Bible and it was a different Bible at the time

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.730
They had the wrong Bible so well

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.480
But it's the same

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:07.199
It's the same issue that that we really don't just we really don't understand fair enough Sam and I'm not saying that political etcetera

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.179
Considerations didn't enter into it

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:11.429
I'm sure all human considerations entered into it

00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:18.418
But there was some collective process of winnowing and you can attempt to reduce that to economic or political causes

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:20.419
Which is generally what secular?

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:28.259
Assessors like Freud and Marx both did and with a fair degree of success. I might add but there's still some mysterious

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.659
assessment of what it is that will be remembered that entered into it, but

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.970
It's a separate point to some degree. I'm just saying that my point my

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:45.118
My point of departure when looking at these texts is one of an essential radical ignorance. I don't

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:52.720
that I understand the mechanisms by which they were generated or edited or collected or kept or remembered or

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.539
Why they had the impact they had now

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:02.110
I've been thinking a lot about the idea of let's say God the Father because that's a very common archetypal

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.560
representation of God God the Father so I'm going to tell you an

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:11.830
Experience that I had that I've never really told any audience about I had a vision at one point

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.680
That and the vision had to do with a dialogue that I was having with my father and you know

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.740
You have a father right and when you're a little kid you

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:27.790
act out your father when you pretend to be a father and what you're doing when you're acting out your father isn't

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.250
imitating your father because you don't

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.830
Duplicate precisely the actions that your father ever took in his life

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:42.159
what you do is you you watch your father across multiple contexts and you abstract out something like a

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.190
spirit of the Father and then when you're a child you

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.470
implement that spirit of the father in your pretend play and you come to embody that

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:57.909
Deeply so the notion is that people can abstract out something like a spirit of the Father and that that's part of our min

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.780
Pneumatic tendency, which is a very powerful human cognitive tendency

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.930
and in this vision I

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:09.039
first started to talk with my father and I would say more with the spirit of my father because he wasn't actually there and

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.610
I would say it was the wisest part of him and then that sort of

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.379
transformed into a discussion that I had with a series of ancestral spirits and then that

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:25.059
transformed itself into a vision of God himself with whom I had a conversation and this was a visionary experience and

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.160
then that all went away and I spent months and months thinking about it and I thought

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:37.360
So you guys can tell me what you think about this and this sort of stretches my cognitive ability to to its utmost

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.650
Limit to contemplate such things but here's a biological argument

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:47.740
I already made the case that a child can extract out the spirit of the father and embody it and that's

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.799
Necessary insofar as you're going to be a father in the wise one

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.110
But we can also extract out the spirit of the father over much longer periods of time

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.800
Because my father was a father because he imitated his fall

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:05.920
Who imitated his father who imitated his father as far back in time as you can go and there's a cumulative

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.920
development of the Spirit of the Father across time

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.780
now then the question might be does this spirit of the father have any reality other than the

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.910
Metaphorical and I would say damn right?

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:22.869
It has a reality and I can describe a biological reality and and and I don't know what this says about any background metaphysics

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.870
But here's our hypothesis

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.480
We know

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480
that human beings

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:35.440
Separated from chimpanzees over the course of the last 7 million years at least in large part because of human female sexual

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.049
selectivity so it was the spirit of

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:45.670
Femininity collectively that helped elevate us to the degree that we have been elevated above our chimpanzee Co ancestor

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.190
But here's in something interesting to contemplate

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:55.539
What is it precisely that makes men what makes men desirable to women and so I have a bit of a hypothesis about that

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.540
So here's what men do

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:05.050
They get together in productive groups and the orient themselves toward a certain task and they produce a hierarchy

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.640
around that task because whenever you implement a task you produce a hierarchy and

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.690
They vote up the most

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.959
Competent men to the top of the hierarchy and then the women select the competent men from the top of the hierarchy

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:23.829
But the vote that determines who the competent men are that are more likely to reproduce as a consequence of male

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.339
Evaluation of men and that's occurred over millennia

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:34.180
And so there's a spirit of the father that's embedded in the patriarchal hierarchy that acts as the primary selection mechanism

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.640
that offers men up to women and plays a

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.229
cardinal role in human evolution and it looks like we've we've

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.900
Personified that spirit of the father in our religious imagery and and that's that's how it looks to me

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.310
But then there's something that's even more mysterious and deep about that. That's worth considering is that

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.780
apparently the entire course of

00:28:53.780 --> 00:29:01.269
evolutionary history has conspired to produce human beings and we could argue that it could have been different but it certainly hasn't been different and

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.790
That means that that selective spirit of the Father has been part of the process. That's

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:11.320
Generated our very being and it's certainly possible that that collective spirit of the Father

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.649
We fly something metaphysically fundamental about the structure of reality itself

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.640
Yes, well

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.820
Insofar as I

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.129
Agree with with virtually all of that. I should say that none of that

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.300
Should give comfort to people who want to hold on to this notion that

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.570
Certain of our books might have been revealed by the creator of the universe

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.129
Well, it depends on what you mean by the creator like well, you know

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:49.849
I'm just saying that that that the world we're living in now is one in which we have whole societies

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:57.800
Shattered over this notion that some books weren't written by human beings, right? There's a different class of book, right?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.550
there's a different shelf in the library where the the products of

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.150
almost certainly merely human brains are

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:12.949
Venerated for all time and and considered uneditable and unag nora Bulai by the majority of human beings

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.480
yeah, it's it's clear clear that revelation can devolve into but

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Unbelievers are real. But any

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.349
There's a risk in all this always is is it often made critique

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:30.709
But that when you're talking about religion you're talking about the Inquisition you're talking about the jihadists. You're not talking about

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.820
Somebody who wants to go to their local Anglican Church once a year

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:40.099
Maybe get the children to school and maybe when they're at some desolate moment of their lives

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.920
returns to this as the place that stores meaning

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.349
I mean the thing that I think Jordan and I are in agreement on in this is is that thing?

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.909
Quote from shop and how and the dialogue on religion when he says, you know

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:58.699
The truth may be like water and needs vessels to carry it and when we were talking about this the other night

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:03.800
You know you admitted that one of the consequences perhaps of the you know

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.729
The parents sort of going through the belief structures. They may not believe in anymore

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:13.040
But they keep doing it as a demonstration of what you said was the the you know

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.859
the non embarrassing options that atheists have come up with but it may also be that

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.399
That since we don't have very many vessels

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.730
that cracked and

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:31.050
damaged and sometimes transparent as they are what vessels you have might be worth holding on to

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.950
well, no, I think I think the challenge here is

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:43.320
I mean it feels that well, first of all, we should first notice that these comments very often take the form of

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.109
You and I don't need this stuff

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:52.260
But most other people do right and that is it can't do it. Yes

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.390
I mean that's inevitably and if it is it's sort of to took that format one moment the other night

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:04.530
whereas where you acknowledge that that people of low intelligence are best placed in a

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:10.560
Conservative paradigm like traditionally conservative paradigm because there's less to think through right now

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.380
Obviously, you don't want your your view on religion summarized by it's good for stupid people

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.459
well, I do I do want to summarize to some degree that way because for

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.330
The opportunity again to put a foot in your mouth I

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:31.889
Would say not not only I mean the thing is is that we're all stupid and and some of us are far stupider than others

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.890
But we're not we're not that stupid

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:41.700
Well, but there's another problem Sam I think and and and this is obviously a contentious one one of the things I I don't go

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.790
to church

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:49.469
But there is one thing I admire about the church and that is that it's managed to serve as a repository

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.850
for these

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:58.260
Fundamental underlying fictions for two millennia, and that's really something bloody. Unbelievable. I mean the great

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:05.729
What would you say is bloody? Unbelievable? Look Sam there. Everything's everything's everything's soaked in blood

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.800
We have no disagreement about that

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.040
but the secular

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.659
Alternatives that we produced in the 20th century were certainly no less blood sword and they produced nothing of any program within it whatsoever

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.489
We did not do it now, but we have to put to bed that secular canard what we are using

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.489
well, it's just it's just not so that

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:30.810
Stalinism was the product of secularism or atheism. And nor was that product

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.869
It wasn't an inevitable project or is our product

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.640
Well, it wasn't Bey and please anyone who has this meme in in your head

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.820
Please just allow the next sentences I speak to just push it out because it's I'm so sick of hearing this

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:52.049
This this idea that the greatest crimes of the 20th century were somehow the product of atheism, right?

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.649
They say when you look at what actually engineered these atrocities

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:00.149
It was something that looked very much like a religion

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:05.310
It was a religion in every way apart from an explicit commitment to other worldliness

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:11.249
It was based on that's a bit different dis dogmatism through and through it was based on a personality

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:15.270
cults that that grew up around figures like Stalin and Hitler and now

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:21.090
It's these were it was not the ideas of Bertrand Russell and David Hume

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:27.419
That brought us to the gulag or to Auschwitz, but then you say it's the thoughts of Jesus Christ. I very well know

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:31.349
It's true. No, I can say that I can say it was the thought of st

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.259
Augustine and I can say it was the thought of st. Thomas Aquinas

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.010
Explicitly that gave us the Inquisition. This is the fact

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.959
It can I make a suggestion? Yeah, I mean, this is a general one as well as one for tonight

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.030
but the whole discussion

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.179
I mean I said the other night in Dublin that to a great accessory

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.989
books are written about the period we're living in they'll probably be described as the

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:58.709
Post Holocaust period in history the post-world War two ERA in Europe. It's still going on

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:02.909
they were still we're still going through this try to work out what happened and

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.030
I

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:09.810
Have to say one thing that I had any rated equally tired of is the claim that this has got to be a tennis game

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.739
between the religious and the non-religious but people say

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.459
That the 20th century's crimes were committed by atheists

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:25.080
Sometimes true often wrong or that the 20th century's crimes were committed by people who are religious sometimes true often wrong

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:32.790
Why do you think nobody you're not observing a crucial distinction here because I would never be tempted to hold religion accountable

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.509
For the bad things that religious people do that have no connection to religion, right?

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:44.010
So if a Muslim Rob's a liquor store, I'm not gonna blame Islam for that

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.530
There's no job

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.740
Not a us

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.010
There's no doctrine that makes sense of that behavior what I blame religion for and likewise

00:35:55.010 --> 00:36:02.390
There's no doctrine in the mere loss of religion a ie atheism that gets you the gulag, right? Oh, there is

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:08.480
No, there's not there's not I just let me just flesh out this point for one more a second

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.800
The only thing I blame religion for are the things that it becomes

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.320
rational to do by the light of these beliefs if you accept these doctrines a

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.960
rational and good person

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.210
can be tempted to join Isis

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:30.860
That's my concern a rational and good person can be tempted to support the Inquisition. But of the many things they had in common

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.430
This is the point that David Berlinski made in his book

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:42.980
What did the nkvd have in common with everyone who oversaw the gulag the SS

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:48.410
People who guarded the camps of people who put people on trains. What did they all have in common?

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.250
What are they have in common with MAO?

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:55.430
Among other things they had in common the fact that none of them thought that God was watching them

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.630
None of them thought that they were being observed and would be held it

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.510
You dick God is on your side

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:07.880
We have just as many examples where people do it because they think God is on their side, right?

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:14.900
Sure, cuz I think watching and clapping. I'm not denying that I'm saying that the attempt to make this at a tennis match

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:21.319
Over the 20th century's mistake. We we're still trying to work out what caused it religion had a role a fizz amader role

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.589
But that the perpetual tennis match of it

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.999
I think well and there is something to be said at a more sophisticated

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.769
level I would say for the idea that you have an obligation to a

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:41.570
Transcendent ethic now you make that claim in the moral landscape you lay out a transcendent ethic in my estimation

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.570
that's one that puts the

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.710
onus of the of

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:49.519
responsibility on the individual to act in a way that at

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.540
minimum

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:56.960
minimizes suffering and so and you think of that as a statement of fact that that's

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.519
The proper way of being and I think about it as an axiomatic statement of faith, and that's one of our differences

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.240
but I have

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:11.189
been very careful in my analysis of the relationship between the idea of sovereignty and the idea of

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.570
Religious belief and one of the things that I have worked out

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.100
I think partly from reading such people as le atta and Jung was that

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:27.120
the there is an emergent idea of sovereignty that does involve being accountable to a god and

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:33.960
Here's how he would justify that and I would think about this essentially from a practical and biological perspective

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:42.030
independent of any metaphysical reality that it might have so the ancient Mesopotamians for example believed that their

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:47.370
emperor was the incarnation or the representative of a god named Marduk and

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.229
That actually bestowed certain ethical responsibilities on the ruler

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:59.010
And so the ruler had to be a good Marduk in order to be a sovereign to be regarded as sovereign he had to be

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:05.669
the embodiment of these divine principles and it took the Mesopotamians a very very long period of time

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.189
perhaps several tens of thousands of years

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:14.490
they weren't Mesopotamian during that whole time obviously to work out what those principles of sovereignty should be and

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:19.169
The Mesopotamians encoded this in their fictions and their religious fictions

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.199
Making essentially the proposition that the proper ruler had to have eyes all the way around his head

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:32.340
because that was one of the attributes of Marduk, so he was someone who was genuinely paying attention who was capable of

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.510
Coming into voluntary contact with with the great

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:44.310
chaotic sub structure of being and cutting it into pieces and making the habitable world and also speaking words that were

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.660
truthful that that had the power the magic power of truth and

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.740
The the the ruler had to act that out if he was

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.150
going to be the sort of ruler that his people weren't entitled to slay and

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.359
Sacrifice and then once a year at the new year's festival

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:05.759
he would go outside the city the walled city and he would act out his role of Marduk and

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.650
The priests would humiliate him and ask him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.380
good Marduk, so that he could remember that he had a

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.150
responsibility to undertake this this to embody this

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.840
Relationship with these divine principles and the thing that's so important about this

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.840
so absolutely crucially important is that it established the principle that even if you were at the top of a hierarchy

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.100
You weren't absolute

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:37.199
there was something above you that you were subordinate to and one of the extraordinarily useful ideas about the abstraction of

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:44.789
Even God as a personified spirit. Let's say is that it allows every leader to be subordinate to something

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.759
That's beyond him. Now. That doesn't mean it can't be misused

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.750
but it's a very very very

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:54.780
important idea except you can also you can get there the other way around you can realize that you

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.970
Even if you're at the top of the hierarchy

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:02.310
you are radically dependent on everyone else, but the

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.429
Tip of a hierarchy doesn't believe that sometimes they believe what they quote whatever the hell they want

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:14.519
But I'm saying if you if you're going to believe something that's compatible with with rationality

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.890
globally, and has the least conceivable downside I would put in that place not a

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.070
superstitious attachment to a notion of an invisible

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.880
friend

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.530
or Punisher

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.160
Who's above you? I would put in its place

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.900
They totally defensible and and palpably true fact

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:40.290
that we that even you could be the king of the event of the world and you are dependent on

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:45.779
Everyone around you to eat to not be murdered by them. I mean like you are like you are

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.770
You are I mean, it's it's amazing. It's amazing how

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.480
precarious

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.480
even a a

00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:01.560
totalitarian regime is I mean the amazing thing is that that these last at all because in many cases it would just take

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.040
50 people to act in unison to kill the tyrant

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.330
Right, but it never happens because we either so have a first mover problem

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.330
Everyone is afraid to be the first person shot

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:19.499
but it is it is a genuine mystery that these systems even perpetuate themselves and when they unravel when you see, you know Qaddafi being

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:27.909
Murdered in a crowd you realize wow. It really is just a matter of the restraint and fear of human beings

00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:36.549
Keeping any of these things together a benign if you if you wanted a hierarchy where you had a kind of philopon. Ein philosopher-king well,

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:40.839
Pulling the reins of a society. I'm not saying we do but even there

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:47.650
You could have an ethical one. You could have one where an anon superstitious one with one where someone recognized

00:42:47.779 --> 00:42:54.279
Hey, this is this is how we're doing it, but we are radically I at the top of the hierarchy. I'm radically dependent on

00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:59.259
Having being surrounded by as many happy people as possible

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:07.389
Well, look, I mean I don't I don't in some profound sense. I disagree what we're actually late

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.079
you know, we're living this sounds like a

00:43:09.079 --> 00:43:12.728
Fiction, but we're living with this problem and we encounter this more and more when you talk

00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:20.078
you know in Silicon Valley as you and I occasionally do and I'm sure you do as well where you meet people who are

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.979
fantastically wealthy

00:43:21.979 --> 00:43:23.979
who seem

00:43:24.529 --> 00:43:27.698
Uncannily detached at the by the

00:43:29.029 --> 00:43:33.218
detach at the fact that the there's this growing chasm between

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:41.229
Them and those they know and the rest of humanity and then and you one who begins to wonder what level of wealth inequality

00:43:42.259 --> 00:43:49.929
Will everyone find alarming and some people are acting as though there is no level that is alarming that there's the kind of a law

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.930
of nature that this thing can grow

00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:54.259
it just

00:43:54.259 --> 00:43:57.279
Impossibly to the point where we have trillionaire is walking around

00:43:57.979 --> 00:44:05.289
and you know in driving in their motor caves and it's kind of as sort of the libertarian religion one occasionally runs into

00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:06.769
and

00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:08.769
Clearly there's some level of inequality

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.099
That's untenable or at least would be undesirable there

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.670
well

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:19.539
It's it's a funny thing because that's a place where our thought loops and then agrees to some degree again because I do believe that

00:44:20.029 --> 00:44:22.179
You can in some sense

00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:25.389
rationally derive an an

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.049
ethic

00:44:27.049 --> 00:44:31.659
So so let's let let's take the argument that you put forward and say that well

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:39.899
You're and this is an extension of your well-being argument to something which ever with which I've thought about a fair bit it's like well

00:44:40.809 --> 00:44:43.258
Okay, what's the optimal solution for you?

00:44:44.019 --> 00:44:47.969
Well, okay. Well, first of all, there isn't just you now

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:53.578
There's you now and you tomorrow and you next week and you in a year you in five years

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:58.859
So there's you and the you that propagates across time. So one of the implications

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.289
Of that is that you can't do anything

00:45:01.289 --> 00:45:05.248
That's really good for the you now. That isn't very good for you a week from now, right?

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.639
so that means you have to imagine yourself as multiple individuals across multiple timeframes and

00:45:11.979 --> 00:45:15.629
Then you have to figure out what's good for all those individuals across all those time frames

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.319
although you

00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:20.038
Discount the future to some degree because of its unpredictability

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.279
but then

00:45:21.279 --> 00:45:23.819
so that's a very tight set of constraints and

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:28.200
You might say well a rational person would calculate what was optimal across all those all those

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:33.988
Multiple timeframes then you do the same thing with other people which is the point you just made

00:45:33.989 --> 00:45:34.349
well

00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:37.859
It isn't just you because who's you there's you and your family

00:45:38.019 --> 00:45:45.089
And most people are in a situation where they would regard damage to their family as perhaps even worse than damage to them

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:51.180
So whatever they are, obviously encapsulate s-- their family and then to some degree that flows off into the community

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.339
and so there is no isolated you and then that's sort of yeah point with regards to the ethic but then

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.960
so so I agree with all that but then one of the things that I would suggest is that

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:08.160
Because that's an incredibly in in difficult rational calculation and perhaps an impossible one. Technically speaking

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.579
But for certainly very difficult

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:17.008
that's what that what has happened in part as our as our great narratives havoc have emerged across time is that

00:46:17.229 --> 00:46:20.789
We have observed ourself attempting to solve that multiple

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:28.769
identity multiple time frame problem and we've told stories about people who do that exceptionally well,

00:46:28.799 --> 00:46:36.059
And then we've whittled out those stories and we've produced these powerful narratives that encapsulate the ethic that does in fact

00:46:36.819 --> 00:46:40.859
reflect that wisdom and so so and I think you actually

00:46:41.499 --> 00:46:46.019
Accept some of that in your in your moral propositions, which is something that we've talked about before

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:47.190
so for example

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:52.470
Although never really agreed on you certainly believe for example that the embodiment of truth

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:59.370
Is one of the means whereby you solve the problem of ethics and I would say that that's a deeply rooted

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.040
judeo-christian concept that that

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.910
so deeply rooted that it that it precedes any notion of

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.200
religious

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:13.740
Provincialism it's deeper than judeo-christian. It's deeper than our humanity on some level at one point

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.640
we talked about the Golden Rule and I said that you think that the the

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.630
Precursor to the Golden Rule can be found even among monkeys. Right? Right Golden Rule is the ground rule even for monkeys. Yes, exactly

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.500
Exactly and sort of let me just add to the picture you sketched out

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:34.920
I completely agree with we have a we have an ethical obligation even to our future selves, right?

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.279
I mean we are in relationship to who we will who's going to be the person is drinking

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.640
His fourth scotch tonight will be well

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.930
it has some ethical relationship to the person who's going to wake up with a hangover tomorrow morning and

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:52.380
We and one thing we know for sure in which we have begun to dimly understand and describe

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.889
Scientifically is that we're bad at all of these calculations?

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.880
Yes

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.800
hyperbolic discounting of future rewards

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:07.320
Well, that's also why I think we have these stringent limitations on rationality Sam is that we can't solve the problem through calculation

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.590
well, no, but we

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:12.120
Increasingly can and and even where it's best

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:18.150
Summarized not by capital what one thing I'll grant you is that it's not always best conveyed or rendered

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:23.910
indelible and actionable by being given a nature paper or you know

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:28.019
a saw an abstract from from a paper in the literature and being told

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.989
This is the way you want to behave to maximize your well-being

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:37.830
It may best be conveyed by certain stories, right or certain books that are that are in the philosophy section of the bookstore

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.830
not the science section and

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:45.840
maybe where you and I were at the book signing the other night and someone came up with with a copy of the

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.120
meditations of Marcus Aurelius write a

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.420
Fantastic book there's so much wisdom in that book

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:57.479
Right, and there's nothing about stoning a girl to death if she's not a virgin on her wedding day now

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:04.710
we all recognize that Marcus Aurelius was a human being who wrote this book and

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.570
that that

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.680
Providence is no barrier to take in the book

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.290
deadly, seriously

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:16.529
it's an incredibly useful book and stoicism a

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.400
stoicism could be

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.319
the quote religion or the guiding philosophy of the West it could it would be a much better one than Judaism or Christianity and

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:33.749
and as have not virtue aliy none of the downside and and so that's my point that we're in this perverse circumstance of

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.829
Being held hostage by certain

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.350
products of literature and

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:45.990
We need to break the spell and if and if we're finding it this hard to break

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:52.020
What do we think is gonna happen in the Middle East or in the sub-saharan Africa? I mean we the

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:59.160
Moral progress we need to engineer is a common humanity coming together those shared values

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.559
Those are perfectly credible arguments

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.269
but but the weakness in the argument I think is the one that we started to talk about earlier, which is that

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.400
When you talked with Dave Rubin a while back and Michael Shermer said the same thing recently

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:15.990
He he basically said that atheism is it is a doctrine of negation

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:24.150
That's what I said with Rubin is that there isn't that positive a ethos? And atheism? All it says is that there's no there's nothing

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.540
Personified there's nothing personified

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:30.269
Transcendent, it's something like that. There is no God

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:36.240
And so and so the problem with the Atheist, it's not even the assertion that there is no God

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:41.549
It's just that it's a failure to be convinced by any of the gods on offer fuck

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.590
It's just like not believing in Zeus fine. And it's not like it's a weak. It's not like it's a weak argument

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.280
I mean I'm perfectly aware that

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:53.850
Making a de istic case or a case for religion in the face of the claims of the rationalist

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.420
Atheists is perhaps. Well, it's a very very difficult thing to manage but

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.060
it is also the case that

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:05.579
and and this is where I think we differ with regards to what happens say in the Soviet Union and perhaps to to

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:08.010
also in Nazi Germany is that

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.589
when when when when your doctrine demolishes the

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:19.719
That's called it the literary or fictional sub structure and leaves nothing behind

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:26.139
an F Oh an ethos needs to be provided because something will rush in to fill the void and

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:31.780
it's certainly the case and this is what Nietzsche warned about even though he was a strident anti-christian and it's also what

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.270
Dostoevsky first saw he said if we knock out

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:41.170
The logos from the substructure of Western society and we need to believe that it was

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:47.830
Christianity's emphasis on truth that destroyed Christianity which was an extremely an interesting criticism, you know

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:52.809
The Christian adhere the elevators to truth to such a degree that it was it actually

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:58.090
resulted in the demolition of its own dogmatic sub structure, but be that as it may Nietzsche's

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.670
prognostication was that if we allowed

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:08.590
God to die and perhaps there were reasons for that that the consequence would be that would we would be awash in both nihilism and

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:16.030
Totalitarian bloodshed and that is what happened in the 20th century. And so so and there's another there's another aspect to that

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:22.749
Which is if you may you may try to knock out the whole thing take out some of the substructure but not the whole thing

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:26.019
that's what Nietzsche also shows but his prediction I think is

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:34.690
Blindingly, obviously true that you might in this post Christian era have a remand of Christianity such as guilt

00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:37.700
overbearing guilt and

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:44.560
no means of alleviation or redemption which is actually part of the problem of Protestantism, by the way, because it's you know,

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:50.919
and and and there are other things to that it seemed to be that it seemed to be fundamental religious issues that the

00:52:51.859 --> 00:52:56.259
secularists I think have a difficult time accounting for it's like so you actually have to

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.679
grapple seriously with the problem that a

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.850
Doctrine that's essentially one of negation doesn't offer a positive ethos

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:10.839
And now an E and you are doing now to be perfectly fair. You said that reading a nature paper about the necessity of

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.570
Calculating your ethic across multiple

00:53:14.119 --> 00:53:21.399
Multiple time frames and multiple persons doesn't have the motive force that's going to drive you to act ethically in life and I do believe

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:26.950
That's true. But I think the fact that the rationalist ethos doesn't have

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:33.220
Motivational push is actually a fatal flaw. They don't every week to read marcus aurelius

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:36.380
Yeah, and they don't

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.300
Like there's no music that goes along with it. There's no art that goes along with it

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.459
there's no architecture that goes along with it like

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:49.420
Weifare, but to be fair to the present most music and most art and most architecture

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:55.690
yes is no longer religious that it has flown the perch provided by religion traditionally and

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.360
most of what we care about

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.170
in

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.190
increasingly

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:04.929
cosmopolitan at the end secular societies is not

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:13.329
tied to religion in any direct way and there's even whole religions like Judaism where you have to look long and hard to find

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:18.399
Anyone who believes much of anything that is religious. I have literally sat on stage

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.409
Debating what I thought was a religious rabbi who was a conservative rabbi

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:28.000
And when I asked when I said something that assumed that he believed in a God who could hear prayers

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:32.259
He threw up his hands and he said what makes you think I believe in a God who can hear prayers?

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:38.620
And I thought I was just you know, I practically lost the debate just in in my astonishment, you know

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:46.120
It's like wait wait, you know, what does it mean to be a conservative rabbi in this case? There are religions that have made that

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.409
transition to a an increasingly

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.880
attenuated

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:58.000
Commitment to the truth of the doctrine and there are religions who haven't moved an inch

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.249
right and we and and it but I think we have to acknowledge that that

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:11.619
this this movement in this direction is progress because what it what it actually is at bottom is

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:18.790
Increasing sensitivity to the difference between having good reasons and bad reasons for what you believe

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.980
Right and and the fact that that this book has been around forever is not a good reason

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.500
The fact that mommy hates it so well

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:33.579
It's actually it's not a terrible reason though because the fact that something has lasted for that length of time at least

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:41.199
Makes the fact that it's lasted a mystery and you can't just attribute that to casual politicking or economic circumstances

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.930
There's through something

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.589
look

00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:51.509
You can say about many of the biblical stories is that they're incredibly memorable and that means that in some sense

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:56.699
They're adapted to the memory structures of boys. So is the the mythology of ancient Greece?

00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:03.359
It's incredibly memorable, but I'm but I don't know luck. All those gods are dead. The stories still can be useful

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:10.229
Yeah, the gods on let's say yeah, but it lives on in a way that is benign. It lives on in a way where

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:17.520
You learn about them in mythology class in school, right? You you don't have it. You don't have a fear of

00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:21.179
Hades drummed into you as a child by your parent

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.240
No

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.990
the other thing that is lacking as far as I can tell in the in the

00:56:25.089 --> 00:56:28.769
rationalist doctrine and this is something that I've observed in my clinical practice and

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.500
so one of the things that's happened over the last year is that I've had many people especially

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:42.059
Ex-soldiers come to my lectures who have post-traumatic stress disorder and they say that listening to my lectures

00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:44.729
especially the ones on good evil and tragedy there's a

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:51.270
particularly sure that I suppose you might be you might think about as devoted to people at post-traumatic stress disorder and that

00:56:52.059 --> 00:56:55.709
the language of good and evil that I lay out in those lectures is

00:56:55.780 --> 00:57:01.739
Actually what allows them to recover from the post-traumatic stress disorder and dealing with people like that in my clinical practice

00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:04.558
The same thing has been the case if we can't

00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:10.169
Transcend the language of the merely rational and move into an intense conversation

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:17.699
About good and evil in some sense as metaphysical realities. We can't enter a realm of seriousness conceptual seriousness

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.909
That's of sufficient depth to help heal

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:27.119
someone who's been touched by malevolence because that actually is what happens to people with post-traumatic stress disorder is that

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:33.540
Inevitably the reason that there are so shattered isn't because something tragic has happened to them

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.290
Although that does happen upon occasion

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:39.599
it's because someone malevolent has made contact with them and sometimes that

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:47.609
malevolent being let's say orb level and force or spirit for lack of a better word is something that resides within them and

00:57:47.799 --> 00:57:50.879
So there we have these limits on rational debt

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.820
And the reason I'm making this case is because we've already identified another limit of rational discourse. It's like it doesn't have the

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:03.840
motivating power of great fiction and great literature and great poetry, but it also doesn't have the healing power of

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.340
language that that

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.140
takes the ethical realm to its

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:14.160
Extreme in some sense and and then the next problem with that and this is something that Douglas has been has been

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.940
Contemplating I would say is that

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.219
What what evidence do we have that a merely secular?

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.180
representation a rational

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:31.500
representation of our ethic is going to provide us with a motive force that would be sufficient for us to do such things as

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:35.940
identify what's valuable about our culture and be motivated to

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:42.510
sufficiently protected assuming that we do something of protection, but we know it what a few of those things are and

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.449
They have they have nothing to do with what's on the inside of a church or a synagogue or a mosque

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:51.839
they have to do with things like free speech right like

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:57.720
the trench we are all fighting in is at least one of them is

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:05.489
Defense of the free exchange of ideas and that is put in peril by many kinds of orthodoxies

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:11.820
But some are the old orthodoxy is the blasphemy laws and the people who want, you know apostates to be killed

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.689
We're leaving in this case Islam. So it's it's a

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.259
That those are some of the sacred I would even if we were gonna list the

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:27.060
The sacred artifacts of art that that keeps that keep our society

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.380
worth living in

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:35.310
There it's I think the list is gonna be very long before we start getting to the the actual

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:42.479
sacred objects of any one faith, but we'll be things like freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and and

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
the the

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:51.149
The free exchange of ideas across boundaries the fact that we are no longer

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:54.030
religiously or

00:59:54.370 --> 01:00:02.099
Linguistically or geographically partitioned in the ideas. We can entertain well, it seems to me though like and this may be my own my own

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:08.429
idiosyncratic reading of the of the of the domain but when I look at something like like I

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.099
And considered a cathedral dome

01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:16.799
Let's say and there are very very old cathedral domes that have an image of Christ put up against the dome, right?

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.070
So as as creator of the cosmos, okay

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:25.769
and I'm trying to look at that from a psychological and even a biological perspective and what I see is the

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:31.770
elevation of a particular image that represents an ideal and so the the the Christ that's

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:38.129
Represented on the on the on the dome of a cathedral is something that's projected up into celestial space

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.710
So it's it's an ideal to which you are supposed to be

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:46.140
Subordinate or that you're supposed to embody and the ideal is the ideal of the logos

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:53.279
Technically speaking the logos the word made flesh, which is not only the word free speech for lack of a better term

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:58.290
but also the embodiment of that elevated to the highest principle and and

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:05.490
and that is given status as the creator of the universe and the reason for that in part and this is written into the

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:12.330
judeo-christian doctrine right from line one is the idea that it's through the discourse that you value so much that we actually

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:20.189
engender the world as such and that is a divine principle and it's it's also in my reading the divine image of God that

01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:27.269
men and women are made in and so what I see in the underlying metaphysic where you see superstition and and

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:32.310
Fundamentalism and look fair enough and it's not like I would ever argue that that's not a danger

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:36.929
I see the imagistic and and and dramatized

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:44.790
Representation of exactly the idea that you hold to be paramount above all else, which is your commitment to truth expressed in speech

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:52.320
Okay, what's my concern? And this is this is where I started with you is that you could give the same charitable reading of

01:01:53.230 --> 01:02:00.119
Astrology and you'd even be tempted to do it as we as we talk about astrology as you showed at the outset now

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.810
But I don't why is it a charitable reading Sam?

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:11.460
How else would you explain the existence of something like a cathedral with that? Hey, what the hell I'm people going when they built

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:16.409
I'm saying we could is it's by dint of mere historical contingency and

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:21.599
Questionable look that we're not living in a world where the cathedrals

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.769
Have stained-glass windows with signs of the zodiac on them

01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:26.279
right

01:02:26.279 --> 01:02:28.498
We could be in that world. What we are we?

01:02:28.599 --> 01:02:32.818
were very close to being in our in that world to some degree because the astrological

01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:37.379
endeavor in the judeo-christian landscape expanded to incorporate

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:41.129
Christianity and there's an entire astrology of Christianity including

01:02:41.769 --> 01:02:43.769
representation

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:53.399
Yes, but my point is is that we recognize that the literal claims of astrology the the mechanism by which

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:56.309
astrologers think it works is

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.450
intellectually bankrupt

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:05.549
Right and if any significant mayhem were being caused by people's commitment to astrology if we had presidents of the United States

01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:10.649
Who couldn't get elected unless unless they paid lip-service to a literal belief in astrology

01:03:10.989 --> 01:03:16.049
If we had presidents who were consulting their astrologers to figure out when to meet with other world leaders

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.980
right the this this would be a problem that that

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:25.470
Rational people would recognize me astrology can be disproven in a single hour

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:31.589
You simply have to go to a one hospital in one city sometime and find find two unrelated

01:03:32.019 --> 01:03:35.039
children born in the safe within 20 feet of each other and

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:37.269
follow their lives

01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:43.559
and if they have different lives than then there's then signs of the zodiac mean nothing part of your argument is and

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.179
Invalidly so is how in the world do we determine which revelatory?

01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:55.768
Axioms are worthy of respect and of maintenance and fair enough salmon, maybe none. Well, maybe a revelatory

01:03:55.769 --> 01:04:01.019
Maybe that's not it is just a matter of K conscious agents like ourselves having better and better conversations

01:04:01.019 --> 01:04:06.869
Well that well, it is certainly partly that it is certainly partly that but let me again revelation

01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:11.038
The I in my book is nothing other than the record of past conversations

01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:18.719
so you've either got Iron Age conversations shaping your worldview or you have conversations like these shaping your or you have both

01:04:19.569 --> 01:04:25.139
You could have both but then you have a dialogue with the past. Let's beautiful which brings me to Marcus Aurelius

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.890
I read him with great pleasure and great and and and astonishment frankly, I mean that yeah

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.970
it is such a modern and edifying take on ethics and

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:42.500
and one's own personal well-being and just not getting just not being encumbered by by thoughts and and

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.740
and vanities that that are that are so easy to cut through once you notice them but so

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.279
captivating and arranging of your life when you don't and he I mean

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:57.379
There's no wisdom in that book then then then almost any book I can name and you don't have to believe any

01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:01.760
Bullshit to honor. Okay. Let me offer you a continued explication here

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:09.290
so and you didn't answer my question about what all these crazy medieval people were doing spending almost all of their excess capital building a

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:12.680
Representation of the sky and putting an image on that. So just hang on a sec

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:17.210
So so let's talk about what it would mean to embody the truth

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:23.929
So there's a deep idea in Christianity that this is what it would mean it would mean to confront the suffering of life

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:32.330
voluntarily to its fullest which would mean to accept the necessity of death and betrayal at the hands of your fellow men without

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.200
undue bitterness

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.460
to accept that

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.550
voluntarily and to still understand that your

01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:45.560
fundamental ethical task is to work towards the redemption of the world and that's associated with that image that's cast upon the heavenly dome and

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:52.970
And that isn't a charitable reading Sam that's that that's an essential analysis of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:56.600
Yes, but I could do the same thing with Buddhism and give you a slightly different story

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.709
but nonetheless inspiring and edifying and I could do the same thing with

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:05.959
It but we can't do it with rationality, but I can do it. I can do it with Greek. No, no

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.199
No, that's not true. I yeah, I can do it with Greek mythology

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.980
I can do with any of these domains

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:16.340
But the the crucial bit for me is that in order to make use of those stories? I

01:06:16.859 --> 01:06:24.259
Don't have to believe in Revelation. I don't have to put I don't have to believe that you get everything you want after you die

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.420
No, no

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:34.220
But but I'm talking about the applause of conventionally religious people who think that their conventional religion is in some way

01:06:34.859 --> 01:06:37.099
cashed out or redeemed or

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.129
Supported by the reading you're given now of the of Christ in starry heavens

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.299
it's not unless you're adding this other piece, which is

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:50.990
Some probabilistic claim that yes

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:55.820
This book probably was dictated by an omniscient Dean unlike any other book well

01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:01.189
Or maybe the Muslims are right that our angel Gabriel did show up to Muhammad in his cave and give him the one

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.860
final revelation never to be superseded and

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.689
Just on the merits of the text. We know that's not true

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.850
We know for all it gets wrong and all it fails to get right about the nature of our circumstance

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.250
We know that book is not the best book ever written on any topic and here I'm speaking of the Quran

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.080
But it's true of the Bible. It's true

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.299
It's true of the meditations of Marcus Aurelius

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:31.039
But the book but but no one's claiming that about the meditations and that's a crucial difference. It's a difference that that

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:35.540
explains so much unnecessary suffering in our world and

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:40.939
again what I fear about the way you talk about religion is that

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:48.139
At the end of all these conversations I'm still not sure what you believe on that point frankly and

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:52.219
if I'm not sure no one out there is

01:07:53.280 --> 01:08:00.320
Well, I don't know why I don't know why you would expect to be sure about what someone believes how do you think that any?

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:06.889
One of you are capable of fully articulating what you believe you certainly aren't you are. No I it's completely ridiculous

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:10.790
You're not transparent to yourself by any stretch of the imagination

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:16.220
You act out all sorts of things that you can't articulate butthat, but how about if how about a best-guess?

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:18.690
Ya

01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:23.089
Know if you look let's go all cognitive neuroscience on this. Shall we?

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:30.079
Ninety-nine percent of your processing is unconscious. You're not capable of articulating yourselves if you were you'd be omniscient

01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:34.549
Okay, but that's gonna give me any nonsense about that for that. That is a

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.240
I've never heard so many people applaud an evasion of a simple question

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:46.569
It was a good yeah

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.589
okay, I

01:08:48.589 --> 01:08:49.730
honestly

01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:54.879
Yes, everything you just said about not being fully transparent to yourself is true

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.640
And you are ruled by committee in there all the time

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:02.619
No doubt, but I'm at I'm asking what you actually believe

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:10.059
I mean, there's several things I can ask. I mean almost any one of these threads can can pull the whole tapestry, but

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.700
To take Christianity as an example

01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.190
What do you believe about?

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.169
This the origin of this sacred book the Bible old a New Testament

01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:24.129
Do you believe that just maybe it has a status?

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:27.220
Unlike any other book or is it?

01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:33.339
Simply old writing of human beings just like ourselves. I think it's both

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:37.510
Okay, so, but but but so what does that mean that you're saying?

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:42.819
You're saying that there's somebody who's taking dictation that is unlike any other dictation

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:46.569
So it's so Homer though creators or Shakespeare is operated within

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.120
Hours of inspiration, okay

01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.450
Everyone's been inspired if you talk to creative people

01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:59.769
Yes, they say they often describe themselves as something approximating a conduit through which higher wisdom is pouring again

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:04.810
You're dodging shakes that Shakespeare could say that and yeah, and any writer can say that

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:08.859
Yeah, and it's also the case that we would or we would rank organize

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.330
we would rank order those writers, which is why you pointed to Shakespeare in terms of the

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:20.020
Generalizable validity of their revelations sure, and so well look so you run into the same issue, you know

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:26.020
You criticize the Bible and look fair enough, you know, man, but you're you're also evading a very important issue

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.020
Which is how do you how do you?

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:35.800
Quantitatively rank the contributions of literature without assuming that there's a hierarchy of Revelation you although this a hierarchy of wisdom. Sure

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.839
There's a heart a hierarchy of human wisdom

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.980
I will grant you that every day of the week, but this it is but we're talking about

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.880
primates like ourselves having conversations and

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.789
This is the most important game we can play

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:53.439
this is the best game in town and it has always been so but

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:57.249
People are imagining and it includes as you said at the outset

01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:01.809
what I would call spiritual experience and spiritual experience is

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:08.740
Admits of a fact-based discussion about the nature of human consciousness. And why do you allow that as an

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.950
Exception like because it's not an exception as part of that the data set. So it's possible to have the e ritual

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:20.200
So this is spiritual experience without the possible of possibility of concretize revelation

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.139
So it's a formless spirituality that you're advocating

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.169
No, no it you can have a money

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:30.940
Even I'm not even discounting the possibility that there are invisible

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:37.630
entities out there in the universe far smarter than ourselves who we could possibly be in dialogue with I mean

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:43.960
There are many strange ideas that we could defend to one or another degree of you that they're people walking around

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:48.910
Speculating that we might be living in a computer simulation that all of this is being run on some

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:51.999
hard drive of the future or or some you know

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.979
Alien supercomputer now that you can actually I mean Nick Bostrom at Oxford gives a very cogent argument in defense of that thesis

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:06.309
Right now you can you can deal with that on its merits I'm not saying the universe isn't stranger than we suppose or even can

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.150
suppose but

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:13.360
one thing we know is that when you read the Bible you can turn every page of that book and

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:19.899
You will not find evidence of omniscience. You will not find anything in there that

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.050
Someone as smart as Shakespeare or actually a little bit dumber could have written

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:33.970
No, I don't think that's true Sam. They're incredibly potent. There's whatever I'd say about the biblical writings that are incredibly potent

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:41.530
But so it's impossible to write something virtually impossible to write something like Cain and Abel. It's a paragraph in shame

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:46.869
You're saying the Shakespeare the Shakespeare of the two 3,000 years ago couldn't have written Genesis

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.630
He couldn't have written to Cain and Abel not intends it so that so then it's okay enable is 10 sentences long

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:55.659
So then who gains more wisdom than you can then you can dig?

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.300
Okay, let's go now, but now we're getting to the nub of it

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.979
Then you think because that it was not the product of a human mind

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:07.589
I think it was the product of a vast collection of human minds working over millennia, okay

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:08.320
so we have a

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:15.270
city of Shakespeare's so but still which is really what we so we've just got people about this and this but this

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.830
concession if indeed

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:23.939
You're making it and I'm still not sure is the eradication of traditional Christianity if something is deeply wise its

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.370
reflective of a deeper reality

01:13:26.739 --> 01:13:30.149
Otherwise, it wouldn't be what I've okay. I'm in love with deeper realities

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:35.700
The deeper reality that something is wise is the story of Cain and Abel reflection. It's the real

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.810
a landscape of mind that we we are

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.390
That either takes great training great luck or pharmacological

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:48.150
bombardment of the human brain to explore

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:55.739
Right there. There's a way there are ways to get there. There are ways to have the beatific vision, right? And and if and

01:13:56.950 --> 01:14:04.829
We will we understand this to some degree but experientially and we can understand it to some degree by by this

01:14:05.469 --> 01:14:07.829
third-person methods of science and

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:10.710
It's not it's not like I don't know

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.529
I've had many experiences that

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:20.909
If I had them in a religious context would have counted for me as evidence of the truth of my religion

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:21.330
right

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.780
but because I I

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:28.950
have was not brought up up in a religious context and because I spend a lot of time seeing the downside of

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:36.810
That form of credulity. I have never been tempted to interpret these experiences. That way try a higher dose

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:44.219
Yeah, I've tried believe me. Yes. Oh, I'll go I'll play that game of poker with you all day long

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.779
You know surprise. Yes. Well, maybe

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.560
Maybe maybe there's our next podcast. Yeah

01:14:55.270 --> 01:15:01.950
Did you just see a card that I've got to ask all of you a question now, so we're an hour and

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.680
15 minutes into this discussion and

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:08.100
hypothetically, what we will do is stop and

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:11.669
and go to Q&amp;A but our

01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:16.969
Experience so far has been that when we asked the audience because we have done that each time

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.219
Whether we've asked the audience whether we should continue or whether we should go to Q&amp;A

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.010
so the first thing I'm going to do and you can

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:29.149
Vote on this by making a certain amount of noise if you're inclined to do

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:33.559
So how many of you would like us to stop talking and go to Q&amp;A?

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:41.690
How many of you would like us to continue this discussion for 45 more minutes

01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:57.199
It's it seems to me that it's an objective fact, it's louder people have the floor

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:04.040
So it really is gonna be a rude awakening when those applause are reversed. However, yeah, we know it's timeless

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.120
Was I gonna ask something? Yeah

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:27.380
Something let's go back to let's go back to thee to one of the core problems that we've been trying to address which is the

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960
the apparent

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.319
failure perhaps of the

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:41.150
The the rationalist atheist types to develop a an active ethos that has

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:49.400
Sufficient beauty and motivational power to serve as a credible replacement for the religious rituals

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:55.790
So there seems there must be a reason why that's that failure has occurred

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.850
right, so

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:01.460
Maybe a short list of reasons one is that

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:08.059
Traditionally the impulse to do that in a religious context has been fatal

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:16.400
Right. So to declare your apostasy has been the almost as reliable a way of committing suicide as jumping off a building

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.300
in most

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.830
cultures and most

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:24.650
societies for the longest time and still is in many places as you know in the Muslim world, so

01:17:25.489 --> 01:17:31.249
if there's been a barrier to entry to thinking creatively about alternatives to religion and

01:17:31.739 --> 01:17:36.079
so much of atheism and secularism is just a a

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.910
pitched battle against the the

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.879
Eroding power of religion and when religion really has its power, right?

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.160
We know what it's like, you know

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:55.129
they again I think what we spoke about this at one point it just yet at the moment that it makes this most salient is

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:01.730
You know Galileo being shown the instruments of torture by men who wouldn't look through his telescope, right?

01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:03.919
I mean that's that was the point of contact between

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.100
untrammeled human rationality and

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:15.019
The womb that bore it right give the religious awe at the beauty of the heavens, right?

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:20.479
So the moment was a person like Galileo stepped a little too far and to connect us to astrology again

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.700
Galileo was a court astrologer, right? Mr

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.289
Doe did they were there was a cunt there was a point of contact between astronomy and astrology at that point. So

01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:34.789
We're still under the shadow of that kind of dogmatism and oppression in much of the world

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.869
And for the longest time, I mean, it's still in the United States

01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:43.279
You cannot run for the presidency without pretending to believe in God

01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:46.549
It's amazing. It's amazing fact, right?

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.360
When will that change it?

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.500
Someday it will

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:56.120
But we have we have just had almost no time talks if it's to experiment in this base and intervals means some time

01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.489
I mean some decades I suppose the thing that unites Sam it would be nice to Auden to me on this is

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:09.620
If if we face some of the problems some of the enemies might even say that you identify as well

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:16.340
And the question is whether you should face them in the midst of an experiment that may or may not work

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.400
ie a leap into pure rationality or

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:22.489
Whether you might decide it's worth among other things

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:29.599
Taking some of the versions of things that you've had that have been of worth in your past and using them where they're useful

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:36.589
Well, but what do you picture in there because there really is no leap. There's no global leap to pure rationality

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:38.779
There's just there's this incremental

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.780
erosion of

01:19:42.119 --> 01:19:47.989
Religious answers to terrestrial questions. So there's that. Yeah, I guess at the moment

01:19:48.869 --> 01:19:54.259
You you have a science of neurology. You begin to look at epilepsy

01:19:54.260 --> 01:20:01.999
Not as demonic possession, but as a neurological problem before there's a science of neurology. You don't know what the hell is happening, right?

01:20:01.999 --> 01:20:08.119
So so into them say something obviously drove Douglas. I would say in some sense

01:20:09.419 --> 01:20:10.559
surprisingly

01:20:10.559 --> 01:20:15.288
to make the assumption that one of the things that we need to do to

01:20:15.689 --> 01:20:20.779
Defend whatever it is that we have a value in the West assuming that we have anything of value

01:20:21.329 --> 01:20:22.439
was

01:20:22.439 --> 01:20:24.389
something like the

01:20:24.389 --> 01:20:26.189
reincorporation of this

01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:32.239
Religious substructure, so white it's not something that I would have expected you to conclude. Oh, wait, what are you?

01:20:32.239 --> 01:20:34.398
Why did you conclude it? Well?

01:20:35.369 --> 01:20:37.369
Partly for the reason I just suggested

01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:40.309
That the leap into pure rationality

01:20:40.349 --> 01:20:45.259
There's no evidence yet that it's going to work or there's gonna be enough for enough people are gonna be able to partake

01:20:45.749 --> 01:20:50.389
Give me the precise amount place where you're worried that it's gonna fail and what can you what are you imagining?

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:52.189
Well, you wake it now

01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.669
Yeah

01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:57.589
Let me give you one example and we may be in the midst of the discovery that the only thing

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:00.168
Worse than religion is its absence?

01:21:01.079 --> 01:21:06.708
When we're where are we discovering that look at the religions that people are making up as we speak

01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:13.639
I mean every day there's a new dogma and you and I and Jordan have repeatedly tripped over his dogmas

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:16.969
some are usually survived it has to be said but

01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:25.849
They're stampeding to create new religion all the time at the moment every every new heresy that's invented and

01:21:26.099 --> 01:21:28.639
They're not as well thought through as past terraces

01:21:28.889 --> 01:21:34.969
they don't always have the bloody repercussions yet, but you can easily foresee a situation in which they do a

01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:40.099
New religion is being created as we speak by a new generation of people who think they are

01:21:40.349 --> 01:21:47.058
non-ideological who think they're very rational who think their past myth who think their past story who think they're better than any of their

01:21:47.159 --> 01:21:49.848
Ancestors and have never bothered to even study their answers

01:21:51.679 --> 01:21:53.679
But

01:21:56.719 --> 01:21:58.719
Can't you say that

01:21:59.150 --> 01:22:00.489
Dogmatism is the problem

01:22:00.489 --> 01:22:07.718
okay, the generic problem here is dogmatism a firm belief in the absence of good argument and good evidence and

01:22:09.409 --> 01:22:14.979
Absolutely, we can agree that dogmatism of any kind has that danger or will always have that danger

01:22:15.199 --> 01:22:16.579
but the void

01:22:16.579 --> 01:22:22.689
Also has a danger the void that you can create if you throw out all the stories that help get you to where you are

01:22:23.059 --> 01:22:27.489
also has this danger because people come up with these news stories and

01:22:28.579 --> 01:22:33.639
Every day's news now is about this every hour politics is now basically about this

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:41.618
up, I mean well and what and what's flown in to fill the gap seems to be something like a new tribalism absolute is exactly

01:22:41.619 --> 01:22:43.420
What you'd expect in some sense, right?

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:49.929
If you if you demolish the superordinate system, you know religion divides people no doubt, but it also unites people

01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:52.329
yes, and so one of the things that

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:58.839
Arguably unites people above their mere tribalism is their Union and an abstract religious

01:22:59.179 --> 01:23:05.618
superstructure and then if you demolish that well then one of the things that does seem to happen is the emergence of a

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.239
Reflexive tribalism because people need to need a group identity of sorts

01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:16.689
And the easiest thing to do seems to be to revert to ethnicity and race and gender and sex, etc. Etc

01:23:16.849 --> 01:23:23.018
And then we do end up and have ended up in this situation that Douglass outlines and you know

01:23:23.019 --> 01:23:26.109
One of the things I think that distinguishes us temperamental II

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:32.619
possibly maybe because you're a little more on the liberal side and I'm a little more on the conservative side even temperamentally speaking is that

01:23:33.139 --> 01:23:34.550
your

01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:37.329
Fundamental terror, is that of fundamentalism?

01:23:37.329 --> 01:23:44.199
although you also state in the moral landscape that you understand that the perils of nihilism and I would say my

01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:47.349
fundamental terror, is that of nihilism even though I'm

01:23:47.869 --> 01:23:54.308
Susceptance ative to the catastrophes of fundamentalism, but I don't think you do address the problem of the void sufficiently

01:23:55.099 --> 01:23:58.419
because I don't think that you have anything to offer except an

01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:03.969
And I'm not trying to minimize your offering you you make a case that people should work to

01:24:04.429 --> 01:24:09.249
Alleviate suffering and that we should live in truth. But Jesus Sam you can summarize that in two sentences

01:24:09.469 --> 01:24:12.729
it doesn't have the potency of the

01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:20.349
Fictional literary artistic substructure that seems necessary to make that into something. That's that's a compelling story

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.889
So it's the this is where we might disagree. This could be a fundamental disagreement

01:24:24.679 --> 01:24:31.598
because I actually I don't see the problem of nihilism the way you do or the way it's advertised like

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.320
once you rip out

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:40.329
the false certainties and the bad evidence and the bad arguments and the and the the mere dog was imposed on us by

01:24:40.639 --> 01:24:42.440
prior generations

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.360
That hole

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.360
never closes

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:53.289
Safely with anything else you have to put something in its place that's shaped just like that some other false certainty or some other story

01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:55.299
I simply don't think that's the case

01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:01.329
I think there's so many things we outgrow both individually a you know, if in art your own childhoods and

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.730
Culturally that where there is. No, there is no void left

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:10.419
there's no Santa Claus shaped void that we have to fill with the

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:18.549
Experience but people certainly experienced some people you people I'm not discounting the fact that it is hard to be happy in this world

01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:25.659
I mean we are living in a world that seems designed perfectly designed to frustrate our efforts to find

01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:28.150
Permanent happiness, so you asked me

01:25:31.429 --> 01:25:36.789
What my answer is I just think there's the recipe for a good life or least least a

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:44.679
Minimal recipe for a good life. That's not that this is all that's entailed. But this is this is this is certainly necessary

01:25:44.719 --> 01:25:48.638
If not sufficient is to live a life that is

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:54.340
Increasingly motivated by love and guided by reason

01:25:55.190 --> 01:26:02.199
Right, you can't go very far wrong if you are motivated by love and guided by reason, right? And and the problem is is that

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.530
Well, okay

01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:08.559
Well, the first thing I would say about that is to me. That's a

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:16.840
recapitulation of the judeo-christian ethic which is be guarded by love and up and use logos to serve that that you gotta

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:23.620
Regenerate the fine print on reason. Oh, yeah clever didn't say reason I said logos cuz that's the that's something that's deeper there

01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:26.889
There's the Jesus smuggling. Yes, exactly. Well, yes. Yes, definitely

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:34.749
Okay, so but but so look I've been I've been trying to part of the reason that I'm doing what I'm doing is to try

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:36.740
to address the void

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:42.460
Let's say and I suspect that many of you are actually here because you would like to have the void

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.760
addressed and so the way it looks to me is something like this and this is what I've derived in part from my studies of

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.529
Religious tradition so I could say that at the beginning of Genesis

01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:54.190
for example

01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:59.889
there's a proposition that it's truthful speech that generates habitable order from

01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:02.950
chaotic potential that seems to me to be the fundamental

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.139
Narrative and I do believe there's something dead accurate and real about that because we do

01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:11.410
generate the world as a consequence of our

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.130
communicative

01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:15.670
Effort and then there's a second proposition

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:21.519
which is that the world that we generate from the the chaos of potential is

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.079
habitable to the degree that the communication that we engage in is

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.630
truthful and that's why God who uses the logos at the beginning of time to generate the world is

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:38.050
Able to say that his creation is good. The proposition is the world you bring into being through truthful. Speech is good

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:42.279
and that's the image of God that's implanted in man and woman and

01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:48.309
There's a grandeur about that idea and you think well, you don't need the grandeur because it's just a fiction

01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:50.300
It's like just wait a second here

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.130
It's not just a fiction

01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:57.159
unless you don't believe that in some manner you partake in the creation of the world and that you have an

01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:03.280
Ultimate responsibility that might well be described as divine to participate in that process properly

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.560
truthfully and with love and there's every reason to think that that's an

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:16.239
elevated ideal so high that it's worthy of conceptualizing as divine and also to presume that it represents some

01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:18.730
fundamental metaphysical

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:25.069
And that's a lot more powerful than you need to be good. Yes, but that the problem here Jordan

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.759
It's that I could do exactly what you just did with

01:28:32.429 --> 01:28:34.079
Buddhism or Hinduism

01:28:34.079 --> 01:28:37.009
and it is just as grand and

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.619
just as deep and just as anchored to the the first person experience of

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.359
Contemplatives who have taken that as far as they could take it, you know, well then ask Sam

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.889
You should do that and see how people respond to it. Well, no, no because I yes seriously

01:28:51.889 --> 01:28:54.289
No, no because I see the end of at the end of the game

01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:59.389
it's not that doesn't arrive where I want to get to where we need to get to because it is

01:28:59.969 --> 01:29:01.969
it's

01:29:02.429 --> 01:29:04.230
It would be to different effect

01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:06.500
It's to it they're they're different claims

01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:12.469
Ultimately about the status of truth and good and evil and about the beginning of the world and the fate of a human

01:29:12.869 --> 01:29:16.578
Consciousness after death, it's completely they're completely irreconcilable

01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:23.480
worldviews, you know, I also do not that we're if there are Hindus in the audience, they believe something that is totally

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.279
Irreconcilable to what Christians believe I don't think that you can offer

01:29:29.099 --> 01:29:34.999
pardon me a watered-down version of Buddhism as a consequence of psychedelic experience as a cut as an

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:43.669
acceptable and credible alternative to the power of the fundamental founding myths of the Western culture and if you think you can

01:29:44.219 --> 01:29:48.289
Try no I'm trying. Well, I'm not trying that but that's that's not

01:29:49.349 --> 01:29:55.429
That's not what I thought. Well, first of all just to just to get my biography straight. It's not just the psychedelic experience, right?

01:29:56.579 --> 01:29:59.569
And I'm also not making light of the psychedelic experience

01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:03.050
Listen to take this

01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:06.799
we're having most of this conversation on the side of

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.960
Where we're in it seems reasonable to worry about the faith of civilization

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:17.329
Right you we could have started at a very different point with just the nature of consciousness

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:25.339
Right just the just our first person encounter with being itself, right you wake we all of us wake up each morning

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:33.259
we are thrust from a condition of deep sleep which we've seen nothing about and

01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:37.820
Would just have pushed through the veil of dreams into this apparently

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.759
solid reality that we call the world and we're engaging one another in this space of

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:49.460
just consciousness and its contents and we're trying to make sense of it and science is

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:56.089
The best language game we play I would argue in trying to make truly rigorous sense of it

01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:58.730
But it's not doesn't exhaust all the language games. We play we play

01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:05.989
others that are also fact-based we talk about what happened historically before we arrived here we talk about

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:13.399
Facts as we can understand them that we just didn't witness but others did and we call that journalism, right?

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400
So we're trying to have a family

01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:17.810
Yes we use to call that journalism

01:31:17.969 --> 01:31:23.149
It's getting harder and harder to discern what's actually going on now, but we are we are

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.540
thrust into this condition of

01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:34.310
Being our apparent selves moment by moment and we notice the difference between happiness and suffering

01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:37.789
Right, and this is not merely sensory

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:42.019
it's not merely that you know, I don't like the feeling of a hot stove and I do like a

01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:44.810
warm bath, it's

01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:47.010
ideas

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:50.870
the ways of thinking about ourselves and the world can can

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:57.830
Open the door or close the door to various states of happiness and suffering and religion comes into religion

01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:59.430
leverages that

01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:06.200
people it that the difference between believing that your dead child is in heaven with Jesus and

01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:13.189
Not being able to believe that is enormous right? I want to ask a specific though

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:20.269
You've expended a certain amount of reputational energy and much more on the jihadists

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.940
in your

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:27.700
battles should we say there how much allie ship to use a

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:35.480
Very vougish  term have you found from fellow secular rational people who want to love and reason like you?

01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:42.669
Well, that is a leading question, isn't it I've got fingers if you need more I

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:46.870
Know you your fingers are safe

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:54.700
No, unfortunately but it's but this is a problem of I wouldn't describe this too

01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:02.829
Well, the Allies you can easily find among deeply religious Christians. Say are

01:33:02.829 --> 01:33:03.380
well not surely not all of them

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:07.120
There for the wrong reasons right? I mean I can find you know them

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:13.990
Well know note that the reason they're there for the wrong that will they they see the problem clearly

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.709
For the wrong reasons. So for instance I so I meet

01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:19.670
secular

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:21.530
scientist types, you know

01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:23.530
Anthropologists say who?

01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:27.970
Are so far from knowing what it's like to believe in revelation

01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:34.450
That they don't believe anyone else does right. So when you tell them that members of Isis really believe that

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.970
if you die in the right circumstances

01:33:36.970 --> 01:33:42.309
You get 72 virgins and you're you're in you know surrounded by rivers of milk and honey and all the rest

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.620
If you go into the ivory tower

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.459
You meet people who don't believe that anyone believes that stuff

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:53.589
But if you go into a megachurch, they know people believe that's not because they believe their own dogmas, right?

01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:54.560
that's

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.769
That's what it's like to be to be effortlessly right for not especially good

01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:05.229
reasons the fact that you believe a book the fact that you believe a book was written by God and

01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:10.809
Therefore it's trivially easy for you to understand that someone else believes that but they just have the wrong book

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.530
That's not the rational basis for understanding our circumstances

01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:16.989
We're looking for I'm not saying whether one is right and one is wrong

01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:24.129
But one seems to have more commitment in that and in one battle, you're fighting commitment, maybe important

01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:27.339
Yeah, there may be many reasons why the people who?

01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:29.890
Deeply want to love and be rational

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:33.100
Are absolutely no damn use in that fight

01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:35.810
because they want to

01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:37.810
preserve their happiness a bit longer

01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:43.989
Preserve their comfort a bit longer cannot understand people who genuinely come from a fundamentalist standpoint

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:49.959
Yeah, and then there's also other well there to steal man their case for a moment it is

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.660
understandable to be

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:59.469
sensitive to and guilty about the history of colonialism and the reality of racism and

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.960
to be so committed to

01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:04.490
tolerance as your master

01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:10.990
Virtue that you're tempted to tolerate intolerance and not recognize it to be cowardice

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:16.749
Which in fact it making tolerance your core value is much different than making truth your core value

01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:22.089
yes, which is an interesting thing because and perhaps this is one of the places where you and the

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.419
Fundamentalist radical leftists, let's say differ

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:32.319
is that the core value that's emerging there is definitely one of tolerance whereas the core value that you espouse is one of truth and

01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:36.789
Truth and tolerance are not the same thing. And so it might have been yeah

01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:37.240
Yeah

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.529
As more as the pursuit of truth and the belief that as a result truth can be found

01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:45.039
That it's not a single thing on its own. You just pursue it as a hobby

01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:49.570
There's just something you do but that you believe that at the end of it. There is a truth to be found

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:59.289
Yeah, you know, so it's over Douglas, what what do you fear is the case here if if there were more people like me

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:05.079
In the West right? Well, maybe I'm not maybe I'm the I'm the outlier here. I'm I'm

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:09.850
somehow infected by this over waning commitment to truth and

01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:14.920
Rationality and science and yet, I'm still motivated to worry about jihad

01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:19.839
But you're you worried that there are many people like me who are oblivious to the bomb

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.160
Are you worried about it when so many other people who are hypothetically the question you ask?

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:30.039
Why are you so worried about when there's so many people who are hypothetically like you that don't seem to be worried about it

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.919
I mean, maybe you're wrong you shouldn't be worried about

01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:40.660
It's a possibility that's my worry at any rate that we may be living in an era when we are discovering that

01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:48.640
the Enlightenment and the Enlightenment values never went very wide and didn't go terribly deep and

01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:52.749
this is a very painful realization to make

01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:57.609
But not only do we go all around the world and discover that we find that at home

01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:06.179
The roots turn out not to have gone very deep in even this society and the problem it is a problem

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:12.510
But but hence my my commitment to making them deeper and and to reiterate the point

01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:16.530
I'm very happy if it was entirely Sam Harris's all the way down

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.340
Ok, I'd have no problem with that. It's just that underneath Sam Harris. Its he'll

01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:32.760
Know me too. Well, yeah, and that has to be very carefully edited on

01:37:38.110 --> 01:37:44.189
Rationality in the service of love, like this isn't interesting. Like I'm not sure you get to get away with that because

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.189
Like is it rationality or is it love?

01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.780
because well

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:53.579
I don't understand the place in your conceptual system for love given your emphasis on

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.419
Rationality as the ethic of as the mechanism of ethics

01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:01.769
So I would say to the degree that I smuggle in Jesus which by the way isn't

01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:09.389
Accidental in some sense and I'm fully conscious when I'm doing it you smuggle in love and it plays the same role. No

01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:14.789
No the love but love is a an experience reality. I mean love love is its state of consciousness?

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:22.709
It's a state of and I wouldn't ultimately act. Oh, it's a it's a fact that one can experience it or not. Well, yeah

01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:31.140
There are the fact that you can experience something but their apparent you're experiencing is

01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:37.199
there's also the thing that you're experiencing as a fact well know that there are facts about the the

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.660
the range of human experiences

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.830
Not even just human just conscious experiences that if we can build

01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:49.499
Computers they can feel loved and that's not inconceivable and will either succeed in doing that or not

01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:54.210
but consciousness admits of a range of experiences and

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.960
Love is

01:38:58.630 --> 01:39:05.130
One of the best on offer it's not the only one we care about but it's the one that anchors us to a

01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:09.629
positive commitment to the well-being of other conscious systems and

01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:15.389
But but the crucial thing is those are far I agree no snow do you know what it is

01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:17.390
It is a fact that loving someone

01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.460
entails a

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.139
Really of it's their their love and it's counterfeits right there. People can confuse, you know romantic

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.130
You know attachment or lust with love, right?

01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:34.230
so I've been and the Buddhists are especially good at differentiating these various states of consciousness and and

01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:37.330
It's a II

01:39:37.330 --> 01:39:39.330
a

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.780
This this true pleasure

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:47.550
mental pleasure in the company of another that is colored by a

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:55.679
Commitment to their well-being I wanting them to be happy a wanting them wanting to have their hopes realized a nonzero-sum

01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:58.270
commitment

01:39:58.270 --> 01:40:02.969
Or sense of your entanglement with them and you can see your failures to love me

01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:04.740
You can be with people who you think you love

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:05.100
You know

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:11.520
I'm with my best friend say and I just find out something fantastic has happened for him into let's say in his career and

01:40:11.650 --> 01:40:14.730
I feel a moment of envy say well then you see well

01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:18.509
Okay. What I just how much do you love this person if the for your first reaction?

01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:25.650
To this something good happening to them is you feel poorer for it, right? That's the Cain and Abel story exactly

01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:30.719
So so this is these are all kinds of defects you can witness in your own mind

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:36.150
and yes, you pay enough attention to the Nate to what it's like to be you the full horror show of

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:42.570
An almost, you know biblical unwinding of all possibility is available, you know

01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:48.059
And it's and you add psychedelics to that cocktail and it gets even more vivid. Alright?

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.080
So are we do you think this is it but but the painting attacks of you know?

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.090
the fact these are facts about the human mind and it is also factual to say

01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:01.590
That it is possible to navigate in this space. It is possible to design

01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:09.510
Institutions and and social systems and ethical commitments that help us navigate in the space

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:11.510
It's not that we all have to get up every morning

01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:14.130
naked and

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.430
try to

01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:23.280
rebuild civilization and all of human wisdom for ourselves each day you we inherit we inherit the most useful tool the

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.800
tools you don't have to figure this all out for yourself and my appeal to you is that

01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:34.869
What we should want to use all the best tools available

01:41:35.989 --> 01:41:40.899
without hamstrung in ourselves by this notion that certain tools are

01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:45.070
Must be the best for all time or certain books

01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:50.710
must be read in on every page with equals to diligence because

01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:53.799
It that this book came from the creator of the universe

01:41:54.079 --> 01:42:01.509
when we're reading Marcus Aurelius if he gets something catastrophic ly wrong on page 17 we say well what the hell he

01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:05.650
Lived 2,000 years ago. There's no way he knew everything right and we turned the page

01:42:05.869 --> 01:42:08.498
okay, so we can't do that with the Bible's the

01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:10.369
mythological

01:42:10.369 --> 01:42:12.170
representation of that

01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:14.949
so there's an ancient idea a

01:42:15.650 --> 01:42:18.219
Very ancient idea that when you face the void

01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:22.269
what you do is confront it and leap into it and

01:42:22.639 --> 01:42:27.189
What you discover at the bottom is a beast and inside that beast you discover your father

01:42:27.979 --> 01:42:34.719
Lying dead and then you reanimate your father and you bring him back to the surface and that's the means of dealing with the void

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:39.670
Right and so in his in essence in some sense, that's just what you said

01:42:39.979 --> 01:42:43.539
you said that if we accept accept that again this

01:42:44.449 --> 01:42:45.650
there's something

01:42:45.650 --> 01:42:53.650
confabulate ory about that because you can do you I could change the valence of virtually every word you use there and

01:42:53.719 --> 01:42:56.319
It would also sound profound and true

01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.739
I could I could swap father for mother and I could swap void from mountaintop and I and I could it could be the same

01:43:03.349 --> 01:43:05.439
seemingly archetypal journey and

01:43:06.289 --> 01:43:10.359
Somebody makes a it's not that easy sound like that's the same damn easy

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:15.400
I've done with a cookbook, but look if it's that easy, then you can write great novels

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:23.229
Great story, so these things can't be swapped out with these

01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.710
well

01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:28.719
There is a reason that it's your father that you rescue from the belly of the beast and not your mother in those sorts of

01:43:28.719 --> 01:43:30.719
situations you

01:43:31.099 --> 01:43:35.018
Can't I give you buddhism and hinduism that had that have completely different

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:40.449
Iconographies and mythologies and other different variables but not at all

01:43:40.449 --> 01:43:46.138
It's like languages, but there's but there they're not they're crucially opposite in many of these cases

01:43:46.139 --> 01:43:48.179
I'm just saying that this is this kind of

01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:51.750
Reading meaning into story is

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.780
There's a reason why it's not science

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:58.349
Because it's because it is in some basic sense unfalsifiable

01:43:58.599 --> 01:43:59.409
I

01:43:59.409 --> 01:44:01.090
There's nothing you and I can do

01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:06.059
for the rest of our lives to be sure that the mother isn't at the bottom of that void and it's really the bottom to

01:44:06.059 --> 01:44:08.909
Develop a factual approach to the analysis of literature

01:44:09.489 --> 01:44:15.959
well, yes on its own terms you can say well it but that that extends to things like it is a fact that

01:44:16.539 --> 01:44:21.089
Hamlet was the Prince of Denmark and now I'm a in terms of the writing of literature

01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:27.179
Well, yeah, but that you can make true and and false claims or more and less plausible claims about literature

01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:31.288
But that's what I'm trying to do or it takes more its effects on you. But again,

01:44:31.289 --> 01:44:35.489
But this is a very different game than what most religious people think is on offer

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:40.409
Well, look if you look at the domain of science most scientists aren't very good at what they do

01:44:40.409 --> 01:44:45.359
And if you look at the domain of religious thinking most religious thinking people aren't very good at what they do

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.389
But that doesn't mean that the whole damn thing should be thrown out

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:54.749
There's relations of religious revelation and and and and wisdom. But but there's that word. Obey because a

01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:58.980
Revelation if revelation is something that we can all do

01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:06.150
You know you me and Marcus Aurelia's right? That is a very different world than the world that

01:45:06.849 --> 01:45:10.409
Muslims think they're living in but you just said Sam that we have to go in

01:45:10.409 --> 01:45:14.879
This is why I use the the going down into the void to rescue your father metaphor

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.670
You just said that we have to and you've said this before it

01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:22.440
I know you believe it as well that we have to go it back into the past and find

01:45:22.630 --> 01:45:27.359
The the wisdom that can help guide us because we don't have to do this as if we're encountering

01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:32.670
Everything for the first time and that's exactly the idea of going into the void to rescue your father

01:45:32.829 --> 01:45:34.829
that's how bad in that is the

01:45:34.929 --> 01:45:36.760
eternal age-old

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.809
Medication for the confrontation of the void and you said it yourself?

01:45:39.909 --> 01:45:44.699
And so I don't know which it is is like do we have to go into the past to rescue what's best?

01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:52.739
Given the understanding that there is something there worth rescuing or not. Is it pure rationality and nothing else moving forward?

01:45:53.619 --> 01:45:56.489
unconstrained by convention it is it's it's just

01:45:57.010 --> 01:46:00.539
again, it's it's I want our certainties and

01:46:01.150 --> 01:46:04.379
I think we all in every other area of our lives

01:46:04.599 --> 01:46:11.129
We agree about this effortlessly, right? If I'm pretending to be certain of something that you can sense

01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:15.779
I have no good reason to be certain about you begin to mistrust me in

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:20.279
Every area if it's in business if it's in in sports

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:23.219
Or if I told you I knew that France was gonna win the World Cup

01:46:23.219 --> 01:46:28.498
And I was absolutely sure and and and yet I magically didn't bet any money on it

01:46:28.499 --> 01:46:34.529
I mean these are these are conversations we can have that everything else and yet on this topic of religion

01:46:35.499 --> 01:46:42.059
people change the rules right and I'm just arguing that the rules should never the rules of by which we

01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:45.119
Dole out our our credence

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.880
shouldn't change and

01:46:48.039 --> 01:46:51.059
and if they don't it and again

01:46:51.059 --> 01:46:58.679
It's we couldn't be misled by the the duration of the past. Maybe this is what this is

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.610
the the

01:47:00.610 --> 01:47:05.339
the comparison of something like Scientology to Christianity is so

01:47:05.979 --> 01:47:11.609
Invidious because we can practically meet l ron Hubbard, right? We've got film of him

01:47:12.429 --> 01:47:18.868
Confabulating about the galaxies the ruled by by overlords whose names he magically knew right?

01:47:18.909 --> 01:47:21.689
We we see we see the man behind the curtain

01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:29.999
we don't see that with the Apostle Paul or anyone else who brought us the the the quote real religions and

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:34.169
Yet it's always just been human beings doing this

01:47:34.389 --> 01:47:34.889
right

01:47:34.889 --> 01:47:36.840
and and and if you go back far enough

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.380
They were doing it in a in a situation. That was completely

01:47:40.749 --> 01:47:45.209
uncontaminated by the kinds of concerns we have as scientists and

01:47:45.489 --> 01:47:52.498
Secular rational people for evidence and consistency and a knowledge of the past. I mean they had nothing even recorded

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:57.299
It had no mechanism by which to record their observations. No, and I'm going drop to you

01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:03.329
Yes, because festival I saw was signs saying five minutes. Yes, and I'm very conscious of a number of things

01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:06.030
apart from my own silence

01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:09.350
And the

01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:13.250
We had a long

01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:19.309
Session on love just then and I refused to finish this evening on such a positive note

01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:22.020
and

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.649
I'd like to turn that round. We're all them

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:29.479
in agreement on certain aspects free speech

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:35.029
civilized discourse on the most important matters and much more

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:40.489
but there's also I'm sure a lot we have in common of what we just can't bear and

01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:43.790
I just wanted to hand over to both of you at some point

01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:48.319
To give an idea not of your loves but of your present hates

01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:53.090
That's Jordan

01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:07.130
Hates

01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:11.430
Well, I would say

01:49:12.610 --> 01:49:15.690
That I spent a lot of time over the last thirty years

01:49:18.130 --> 01:49:20.130
Trying to understand

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:26.910
The part of me that could be deeply satisfied as an ostrich prison guard and

01:49:28.090 --> 01:49:29.710
I would say

01:49:29.710 --> 01:49:31.710
that

01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:36.749
That part is something that's worthy of hate and

01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:41.040
I think the best way to overcome it

01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:44.310
is to

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:47.670
Recognize it in yourself and to do everything possible

01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:52.889
to constrain it and that's what's given me an

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.720
Overwhelming

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.929
horror both of the

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.910
nihilistic void and

01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:03.959
the catastrophes of totalitarianism and

01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:10.680
The reason that I've turned to the degree that I have to the analysis of religious traditions

01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:18.060
Not losing my scientific perspective in the meantime is because I've done everything I could to

01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:31.079
To extract out the wisdom necessary to understand how to deal with that bit of unredeemed evil that every bit of us possess

01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:46.129
Well, I would say that I hate

01:50:47.730 --> 01:50:55.370
Unnecessary suffering and especially my capacity for it and I see so much of my time

01:50:57.090 --> 01:50:59.810
Conscious time moment a moment devoted to

01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:08.299
This experience that should be familiar to all of you which is it to be captured by thoughts of the past or the future

01:51:09.210 --> 01:51:11.210
which are

01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:15.560
Which almost by definition have a

01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:18.960
Mediocrity

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.340
so

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:23.480
Transcendent that it's just a it

01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:27.379
it is what makes human life just

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:35.509
Just pure monotony and pettiness and and everything that religion

01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:41.090
advertises itself as a corrective - right say that what I'm sensitive to is that someone like

01:51:41.610 --> 01:51:44.210
SCI Utica - when he came to

01:51:44.730 --> 01:51:47.509
This is Osama bin Laden's favorite philosopher

01:51:48.090 --> 01:51:54.020
When he came to America in the in the 50s, he saw his hosts and their neighbors

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.400
spending all their time

01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:00.200
You know bragging about how well mowed their lawns were and and what just what new?

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:06.230
Chevrolet as they had purchased and he looked at all of this as just it's just the quintessence of

01:52:07.890 --> 01:52:12.829
Desecration and lost opportunity and the lack of profundity and

01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:17.750
For which for him? The the corrective obviously was Islam and

01:52:19.170 --> 01:52:21.060
Half of that is right

01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:27.470
It's possible to be totally captivated by the wrong things in this life and to make yourself not

01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:32.929
it's so obviously being a guard at Auschwitz with a clear conscience is the

01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:40.490
Extreme of the extremes of that happiness all that or being a guard at Auschwitz with happiness. Yes, okay

01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:45.589
Yeah, even worse still right. So that's the extreme case enter and to realize that that is

01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:51.650
that that that job was not only filled by psychopaths right that

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:57.470
Psychologically normal people could could be brought to that point. That's yeah. I recognize that

01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:01.280
That's the situation we're in but most of us live our lives

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:04.190
in a different place where it's just

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:06.889
mediocrity and pettiness and and

01:53:07.410 --> 01:53:09.530
and needless anxiety and

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:15.740
very dimly, we recognize the possibility of overcoming that on a day-to-day basis and

01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:19.130
you know, honestly, I think

01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:27.500
The atheism the lack of belief the lack of faith in an afterlife for instance the lack of the lack of belief in the notion

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:30.799
That you get everything you want or may get everything you want after you die

01:53:32.670 --> 01:53:34.670
And helps

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:39.350
Lalit's leads to greater depth rather than to

01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:43.790
Superficiality here. It's like when I kiss my daughter's goodnight

01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:47.509
Right. It is with the understanding that

01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:49.230
I

01:53:49.230 --> 01:53:50.910
May never see them again

01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:51.410
right

01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:58.610
It's not with the assumption that if the roof caves in where we'll all be reunited in heaven along with our pets

01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:03.199
Right, which is what both many people find consoling about faith

01:54:03.570 --> 01:54:10.850
but that and and so what I would say what I hate in myself and what I hate in our

01:54:11.370 --> 01:54:12.750
culture is

01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:18.889
Everything that conspires to make the the preciousness and and and sacredness of the present moment

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.159
Difficult to realize and that's that's what I as the tide against which I keep slipping

01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:38.730
Iemon I'm not going to answer my own question primarily because of the length of the list and the knowledge of the time

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:46.860
But I would say that if there's one thing I hate it's the fact that conversations like this

01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:55.739
Civil discussion on the most important matters between people who have enormous amounts in common and have important

01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:59.159
disagreements which engage with the past and

01:54:59.890 --> 01:55:06.629
Which are going to be facilitated for a long time by knowledge of all the extraordinary progress. We're about to hit

01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:10.350
Can take place in an arena like this?

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.800
with an audience like you

01:55:14.110 --> 01:55:17.640
Who have all come out and now set sat here for?

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.260
two hours

01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:24.270
And I think it's at any rate from my point of view

01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:31.169
One of the most positive things I can imagine in the world at the moment that an evening like this is happening

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.660
with an audience like you

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.320
And

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:42.239
Unless either of you want to say anything I think on behalf of all of us

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:45.810
I just like to say what a thrill this is for us and

01:55:46.630 --> 01:55:48.630
thank you to you and

01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:56.339
I hope that this is an example of a constructive discussion of a kind that might even at some point catch on

01:55:57.190 --> 01:55:59.190
So, thank you

01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:05.940
Everyone please put your hands together for sam Harris Jordan Peterson and Douglas Murray. Hi
