00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.720
Who would like to play Send To All?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.960
Michael!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.360
This is awkward.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.920
Brilliant!

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.360
Whoa!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.600
It's Alesha's phone,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.840
No!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.160
Oh, my God.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.760
Don't! No, no!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.640
Oh, my God!

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640
What's great about Send To All is,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.000
you don't know where the comedy
is going to come from.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.080
I've got your blower.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.680
In fact, Danny Dyer said it to me.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.120
I went to see Danny Dyer
before the show to say thank you

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.720
so much for doing this, don't worry,
all the rest of it,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.040
and he looked at me and went,
"Right, it's not about me,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.120
"it's about the blower."

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.880
Photos maybe, a few photos
on here? Yeah,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.720
I've got a few smudges
in there, yeah.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.160
There's some funny photos already.
What's this?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.800
I turned 40 this year
and I thought I need to start

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.320
growing up a little bit and
so I thought I'd get into gardening.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.080
Anyway, as I bent down, that, right,
done me right in the eyeball.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.160
Have you got a picture of it?
Is it on the phone?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.200
Yeah, look at the state of me eye.
Oh, my!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh, that is so fun.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.440
So this is the result
of your attempt at gardening.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.520
Terrible, I had to go to work
and tell them,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.960
a week I was out of the game, Mike.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960
But were people in the week,
were they saying,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.560
"Oi, Danny, had bit of a tear-up?"

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.240
And you were going, "No,
I've taken up 'orticulture, mate."

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.400
But it's great fun to see people's
apps and little things

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.600
that you don't know is going
to be funny and insightful

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.880
end up being that,
like Alan Shearer's alarms.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.040
These are your alarms. Oh...

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.760
What? I don't...

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.360
Alan, are you a narcoleptic?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.240
The best one undoubtedly
was Olly Murs's Uber,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.360
because it was just so spontaneous.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.880
Uber. Get me out of here!

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.520
I've never used it before.
Is it good? I don't know.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.760
This is your last journey.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.120
Did you have a nice trip?
It was lovely, thank you, yeah.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.840
Not according to that rating.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.360
I'd never used it before,
and realising

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.280
I can order a car here,
so we ordered this luxury car

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.480
and I had kind of forgotten about it
and he had arrived

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.000
at the theatre, the production team
had met him and said,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.840
"Look, do you mind
being on this TV show?"

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120
They put a microphone on him.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.640
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Ionut!

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.400
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.280
Our UNEXPECTED Unexpected
Star of the Show!

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.080
Ionut, am I saying that right?
Ionut? Yes.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.640
So, listen, do you like music?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000
Of course. Do you like pop music?
Everything.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.080
If I was to say...

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.520
# Dear darling...

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.760
# Please excuse my writing

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.000
# I can't stop my hands
from shaking... #

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.920
Does that ring any bells with you?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.960
No.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.880
How much do I owe you for
the trip to Basildon? Around 200.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640
AUDIENCE GASPS

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.920
Have you got a credit card,
or something?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.600
It has already been
charged to me anyway.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.600
Oh, does it already get charged?
Yeah.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.200
Does that already get
charged automatically? Yes.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.360
But, of course, Send To All is all
about the texts we send

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.320
to their contacts.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.120
The message I'm going
to send into your phone.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.840
VOICEOVER: My first ever celebrity
Send To All was Spice Girl,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.160
Geri Horner.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.040
Right. So let's just remind
ourselves what the text was.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.960
Oh, my God. There's a classic.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.560
Farmer Clive.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.280
Oh, my God!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.400
I'm assuming he is a farmer.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.040
Yeah. How do you know Farmer Clive?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.720
Because I was at this party. Yes.
And...in the country,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.160
and I was going to surprise
my husband and buy him some sheep.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.600
As you do. As you do! When you're
an international pop star. Yeah.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.880
Surprise him with some sheep.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.800
So, we got chatting so
I took his number. Oh, no!

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.880
So he thinks I want to massage...
So, you've only met him once

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.360
and it was about the possible
purchase of some sheep. Yeah.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.880
He's a farmer, he's called Clive
and he's in your phone.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.000
"I'm permanently in the
lambing shed at the moment,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.920
"so it would have to be on
a straw bale."

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.680
LAUGHTER
Oh, my God!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.160
Oh, my God!

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.920
I sent a text to Bradley Walsh's
contacts

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.680
saying he'd had a crazy
dream about them.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.960
Matt Up Yard? What's Matt Up Yard?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.560
Who's that? That is...

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.720
Who's Matt Up Yard?
It's just Matt up the yard.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.200
He lives at the end of your garden?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.120
Matt Up Yard. It's just... It's
just... It's just Matt up the yard.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.320
Which yard? It is just a yard.
A yard,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.680
where there's, like,
workshops and stuff.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.880
Right, yeah. Like a mechanic yard.
Yeah, but he wraps cars.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.960
He's a rapper? I don't mean, like,
he raps cars, he wraps cars.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.000
OK. Matt.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.160
So, Matt Up Yard -

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.120
"Seriously? It probably means that
you need

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.440
"to have a moment to ground yourself
and get some quiet time.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.080
"Try a bit of meditation.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.200
"Let me know if you need help
with that."

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.800
On the side, Matt does
all the crystals and stuff.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.920
He does crystals and cars?!

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.560
Matt Up Yard... Matt Up Yard.
..does meditation and he fixes cars.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.200
Is business not booming? Yeah.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.680
I'm going to text him back.
Can you do Tuesday at two?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.480
Thank you very much. Here we go.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.480
The text I sent from Holly
Willoughby's phone told everyone

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.440
they looked hideous the last time
she saw them.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.600
Mr Hook? Oh, my God!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.320
That's... That's my kids'
headmaster!

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.920
Mr Hook. He's gone with...

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.240
"Are my suits really that bad?"

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.240
Oh, no!

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.560
Oh, my God, no! Oh, no!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.800
Quick text back - yes. See you
tomorrow. No! Don't you dare!

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.080
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.520
Oh, my God!

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.120
I'm so sorry, Mr Hook.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.800
Hannah Peckham?
Oh, she's my old school friend.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.920
Hannah Peckham.
Yeah, we went to school together.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.480
"The last time I saw you
was my wedding day.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.520
"Bit harsh, Hol."

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.960
With Jamie Oliver, I sent two texts.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.200
First text was...

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.360
So that was sent off.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.800
And I think people started
responding to that one

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.120
before I even sent this one.
The second text.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.760
So, Babyface. Who's Babyface?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.800
Dexter Fletcher, the actor. Ah.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.440
What did he say?
"What's going on, J?"

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.480
He's gone, "Ah! Got you.
I knew it.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.720
"Fine, I'll keep your secret,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.280
"but you have to promise to come
over in the week

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.160
"and cook my nan a curry."

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.760
It is the funniest thing.
Alfie Deyes?

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.640
Yeah, blogger, vlogger.
SOME CHEERS

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.200
Whoo! Alfie Deyes, people
know about Alfie Deyes. Yeah.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.880
"On my way to deliver it to you.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.320
"Wait. Only 12 nuggets?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.120
"Last time you smashed 24."

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.920
And it's always fun
when big stars reply.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.240
Russell C? Who's Russell C?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.000
QUIETLY: Russell Crowe! Oh, God.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.040
That's Russell Crowe.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.320
Russell Crowe!

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.920
Gladiator?!

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.040
"My name is
Maximus Aurelius Maximus.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.200
"Father of a murdered son.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.000
"Son to a murdered father.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.040
"And I shall get my vengeance,
Ronan Keating."

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.280
I really didn't want him to respond.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.360
Oh, nothing gets past Crowe.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.120
"Ha-ha! Someone's got
your phone, mate."

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.960
Thank God. Thank God!

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.960
Yes. I have his phone.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.800
And my name...is Maximus.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.160
Father of a murdered son. No!

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.040
Shall I send that? AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.440
Right, that's gone to Russell Crowe.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.200
But what's it really like to sit
in that Send To All box?

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.280
You forget how personal
your connection with your phone is.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.560
We'd like you to pop your phone
into our little contraption here

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.720
and I will take it away from you.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.320
Thank you so much. Ladies and
gentlemen, Alexander Armstrong.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.840
What a wonderful sport.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.160
There's this contraption,
obviously, you've seen it.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.280
It looks like a... It's a sort
of blue velvet bum

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.600
and in the sort of cleft of the bum,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.680
you then put your phone.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.280
POINTLESS COLUMN SOUND EFFECTS
Oh, look at that.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.600
And I think there's a moment,
as you sort of let go of your phone

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.600
and it goes down,
there's a sort of...

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.800
Ah. Ah.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:35.320
Possibly the most awkward text
I've ever had to send.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.320
How are you feeling
about that as a starter? Lovely.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.480
You've got my tone of voice
absolutely there.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.880
If it was me...I'd want to know.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.680
You...have...

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.760
..really bad breath.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.960
Maximum mortification. Just... Eek!

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.680
Shall I send that? AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.400
Well, that's gone!

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.360
And it's not until some
of them start replying,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.040
you think, "Oh, my God,
they got one as well."

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.640
Upholstery Jane.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.400
No! Oh, no!

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.280
If it went to her, only then do
you start thinking,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.760
"Oh, God, it must have gone to them,
gone to them

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.200
"and gone to them and gone to them."

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.120
So what did she upholster for you?
Oh, she's done some chairs for us.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.600
Lovely. Chairs? Yes.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.400
"Xander. Probably the most awkward
text I've ever replied to,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.760
"especially as I haven't spoken
to you for at least two years.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.960
"Is that why you forgot
to pick up your chair?"

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.880
Lovely Jane Leadbetter.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.640
Most wonderful...
What she can't do with a needle.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.480
"Is that why you didn't
pick up your chair?"

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.360
For two years, she's been sitting
watching Pointless,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.040
on the chair that you never
picked up, thinking,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.840
"Why has Xander never
picked up this chair?"

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.640
She's currently sitting
at home doing that.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.960
Charlotte Church is in.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.880
"Is this a hoax?"

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.400
She's on to it, Churchy.
Yeah. That's not Charlotte Church.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.680
That's actually someone called
Charlotte from the church.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.440
We organise this big carol service
every year and Charlotte

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.680
is the person you absolutely...

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.640
You know, you don't want to let
Charlotte down.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.400
I am so sorry to assume that

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.600
that was Welsh songstress
Charlotte Church.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.600
Of course, it's somebody called
Charlotte from the church.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.680
I was still getting texts
from Charlotte Church.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.000
I don't think any amount
of reassurance

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.040
was going to put her mind at rest.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.640
Please give it up for
the incredibly brave

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.360
Alexander Armstrong!

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.440
I mean, a number of people go,
"Ha-ha! Of course I knew,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.160
"of course I knew,"
some people say.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.000
And you think, "No, you didn't,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.120
"I've got your abusive reply right
here, thank you very much.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.800
"What do you mean,
of course you knew?"

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.400
Ed Balls was on Strictly

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.040
and was obviously infamously
brilliant and hilarious.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.200
MUSIC: Gangnam Style
by PSY

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.040
Every wedding, christening,
Bar Mitzvah I go to these days,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.040
the DJ will say, Gangnam Style,
and everybody gets moving.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.640
Yeah!

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.040
I don't think I believed
that I was going to hand

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.760
over my phone until it happened.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.360
There it is. OK.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.320
NatWest bank.
I won't go into your bank right now.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.520
Ocado. Quite middle class.
Shop on the fly.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.240
Oh, yes, there is a delivery,
it's coming!

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.320
We've got some savings there,
very good.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.200
More than you offered us
when you were Shadow Chancellor.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.600
Charlie Bingham chicken korma.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.200
I'm racking my brains thinking,
"What on earth did I order?"

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.720
Fine green beans.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.360
There wouldn't be any polenta,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.720
but what happens if there
was two packs of doughnuts?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.280
Two salmon skinless
mid-tail fillets.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.760
Don't mind if I do.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.200
Yvette's away. Cooking for one.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.480
I'll save the other one,
freeze it for tomorrow, yeah?

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.040
You're a cook,
aren't you, I can tell. Yes.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.960
And I do the Ocado shopping every
week. Well, how brave, how brave.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.600
That is the most middle-class
sentence I've ever heard.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.880
I'm absolutely exhausted.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.480
Do you know, I do the Ocado
shop online every week?

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.440
Do you mind, Ed, if I have a little
look at your photos?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.120
Because that is always a bit of fun.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.280
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.040
Oh, OK.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.360
Has your shirt split open?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.640
I should have edited these photos,
really. Yeah, that's...

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.680
I was on It Takes Two and they said
that you shouldn't wear a jacket,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.200
you should come in leisurewear.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.000
I'd never worn smart casual before.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.640
I bought a shirt,
which in retrospect was a mistake,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.320
because it turned out
to be what's called tailored fit,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.960
which was totally bursting
and looked absolutely terrible

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.760
and then the wardrobe person ran on
with a pair of scissors

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.120
and cut my shirt all the way up
the back, to relax my front,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.760
which, from behind,
was quite exposed.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.160
Most people call it too small,
but you have opted for

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.040
"tailored fit". No, no...

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.360
I was embarrassed when Michael found
that photo, but relieved

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.080
because I think there were quite
a lot worse in there.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.320
That is...

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.560
I... I...

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.160
I'm sorry, the audience is having
so much fun,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.960
we might sit on this for a while.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.080
On that one, you can zone in a bit.
Sure, I wouldn't mind that at all.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.800
I think that's exactly
what the viewers want.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.720
In fact, I forgot we could zoom in.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.360
I'm going to go back
to the other one. No, no, no, no...

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.280
Come on, we might as well
have some fun.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.320
No, no, I'm kidding.
You told me to zoom in!

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.840
That is good.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.760
Those tracksuit bottoms are,
shall we say...

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.640
Shall we say "tailored fit"?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.160
I think at that point
I just thought,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.440
goodness knows what's going
to happen in the next hour,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.520
but I might as well
just sit back and enjoy it.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.160
So the text I am going to send
in Ed Balls's phone is as follows.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.440
"Just had a new hot tub delivered.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.640
"Yvette's at the party conference."

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.560
LAUGHTER

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.240
No, don't go there. It's not there.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.120
Trust me, you'll like it.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.280
"So I'm having...

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.920
"..a party of my own.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.960
"Anton du Beke is here.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.640
"Delia is doing canapes.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.040
"And Stormzy is coming."

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.200
A hot tub with Delia Smith
and Anton du Beke and Stormzy?

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.520
That was a surprise to me.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.280
Grab your swimsuit
and get down here,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.440
"Gangnam Style."

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.560
That has...

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320
..gone!

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.480
When you finally hit send to all,
my first feeling was relief.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.040
At least he's not going to put
anything more

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.720
into this text message.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120
It's party time at Ballsy's house!

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.120
Whoohoo!

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.960
Hundreds of people

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.240
were about to be invited by me
to a hot tub party.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.040
What's Tony Blair
and Gordon Brown going to think?!

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.920
Jeremy Vine from BBC Radio 2.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.240
He has just opened with, "Blimey.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.520
"Is Delia in the hot tub?

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.400
"I'm finding my leopard-print
swimming shorts..." in capitals,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.960
"..RIGHT NOW."

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.680
People think I'm actually inviting
them to a hot tub party.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.040
Who's Charlie K?

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.720
Charlie K is a councillor
in Wakefield.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.560
So he's northern, Charlie K.
Yeah. Charlie.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.960
"I would love to, but just
got back from Zakynthos,

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.360
"so me and Gracie are
a bit travel weary.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.880
"We'll ring you in the week.
Take care. Thanks for the invite."

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.760
Dude, did you read the text?

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.480
"We're a bit weary."

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.760
We're in a hot tub with Delia
and Stormzy and Anton du Beke!

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.880
"Yeah, but as I said, I'm a bit
travel weary from my trip."

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.760
June Cooper?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.040
Is my mother-in-law.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.880
At that moment, I realised
things could get quite bad.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.000
Your mother-in-law has texted,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.320
"Your father-in-law is coming
if Katya is there."

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.680
Dwayne Grucock.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.520
Oh, Dwayne Grucock is the person
who used to live next door to us.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.520
He's a Methodist vicar.
He's a Methodist vicar?

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.240
I got to tell you. It's really good.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.080
"I'll just finish writing my sermon,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.280
"then grab my towel."

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.680
I think what people don't realise
is that, even after the show,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.120
the texts keep coming through from
people who know it's a joke

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.840
or from people who are actually
taking it seriously

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.560
and apologising that they didn't
get the text and didn't come round.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.320
Thank you from all of us
to Ed Balls.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.000
Come on, what about that?
What a sport.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.200
One really good friend of ours came
round that night with their towel

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.320
and trunks for the hot tub party
and were really disappointed

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.360
that we weren't there
with Anton du Beke.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.680
Bit awkward.
