Uh, I can help you.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.629
Oh no, don't worry about it. Uh, the bathroom is over there, there's no lock on the door though

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.473
so you're going to want to knock before you go in.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.380
--All fixed!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.160
I'm Al.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220
I'll help clean when I'm back.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.760
Bye Leda.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.160
Bye Al.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.640
Good luck with the build!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.840
"Welcome to Allocorp, pioneering housing one home at a ..." (fades out)

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.420
"I'm going to say this for the last time,"

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.600
"You cannot charge me anymore."

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.940
"Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing?"

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.600
"Do you have any decency?"

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.160
You should add that to the garden soon.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.940
Yeah, I think you should come up tomorrow,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.440
Those tomatoes are starting to ripen.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.180
I know.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.880
It's been crazy at the lab this week with all these samples.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.980
How about you? How are the interviews going?

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.380
None of these change places wanna hire an old mechanic.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.260
So you work in a garage?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.100
I used to.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.500
Actually, I owned the garage, but uh-

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.770
Allocorp.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.770
Tore down the whole neighbourhood.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.440
I helped build some luxury apartments right over me

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.840
our department lost its entire outdoor research facilities with them last year. Allocorp doesn't approach onto universities and hospitals this ... policy.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.020
I think that's just what they tell people

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.300
What about you? How long have you lived here in Los Angeles?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.760
Eight years

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.320
And... before that you lived...

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.480
Long

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.760
Well, the garden is up on the roof if you ever want to come up, umm.. do you garden

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.460
Not really

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.249
But I do like plants. Well, then you should definitely come check out my research lab

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.570
Yeah

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.730
Those are all GMOs

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.899
Coded to self-sustain germination past the toxic topsoil

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.339
Nice change of pace from all the big plants everywhere else

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.120
How do they grow so well

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.240
Our work, mostly

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.500
So, yeah, that's pretty much the whole place

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.409
It used to be huge, but when they tore down the old labs they shoved us all in here

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.749
I'm sorry. Don't be it's not your fault

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.550
Ready?

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.620
Bye Dr. Palmer. Bye, have a good one.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.839
I like it in here

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.479
Haven't seen a place like this since school.

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.648
Well, you're welcome here anytime

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.160
Call terminated for aggressive behavior any feedback for me? No.

Why didn't you tell us. I just answered calls.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.840
You should have said something

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.720
Miss Leno, right

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.570
Corporate decided to release you early. The new automated system is taking over most departments starting today

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.269
Well, can I go see there's anything left behind no you no longer work here so no, I can't let you do that

I was never any good at taking care of plants

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.100

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.480
They kicked me out today

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.420
I know I should've quit sooner but.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.160
I didn't know what else to do. Nobody does
