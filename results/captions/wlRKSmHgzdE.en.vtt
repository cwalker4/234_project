00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.690
- Over the past couple of years

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.900
on the Barn Find Hunter series,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.800
we've found a couple of substantial cars.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.980
And the ones that come to
mind are the Porsche Speedster

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.600
in Dallas, the Pegaso with
the Saoutchik bodywork

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.670
near Santa Barbara California.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.130
The '54 Corvette in north Georgia.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.170
We've gotten a lead on
a collection of cars

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.070
that hasn't seen the light
of day since the '80s.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.170
That sounds like it could blow

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.490
all those cars out of the water.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.120
Not that I don't like those
other cars, I love 'em,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.010
but as far as a collection
with presence and value,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.130
and heritage, and longevity of ownership,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.520
we're heading there right
now to unearth what could be

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.118
the best Barn Find Hunter
discovery we've ever had.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:54.118
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650
Well, here we are.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.410
And we've beat everybody else here.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.820
We're supposed to meet here,
oh actually we're early.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.653
1:30.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.380
It's a nice looking garage.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.790
It was a nice looking house,
but it's just been left

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.920
to kind of go bad and now
the house and the garage

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.590
are gonna be torn down, a
new house will be built here.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.790
But this is one fine neighborhood.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.730
Doctors and lawyers
and people of substance

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.790
live in this neighborhood.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.900
Who would imagine that this garage

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.120
would contain some of the
rarest sports cars in the world.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.240
Or so I'm told.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.040
And you can see there's leaves
built up against the doors.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.590
There's been nobody in this
garage for a long time.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.970
Here we are with a friend of the owner.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.810
He's kind of managing where these

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.640
cars go in their next life.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.780
They've been sitting
here for, I don't know...

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.140
How long have they been sitting here?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.357
- Since 1991.

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:52.540
- '91, okay.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.460
- Apparently, according to my friend,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.010
who I've known for a number of years,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.550
he had a mechanic that was
a personal friend of his

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.410
who was an extremely competent mechanic

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.310
and he believed, my friend believed

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310
that this mechanic was the only person

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.200
who could possibly be qualified
to take care of his cars

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.240
in the manner that they should be.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.610
So this fella was also a motorcycle racer,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.438
and as luck would have it,
he died in an accident.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:20.600
- Oh, God.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.690
- So then my friend, he was
going through a few changes

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.320
in his life and he figured, well,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.750
maybe eventually I'll
get another mechanic,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.240
but if I don't, I'll just park the cars.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.350
And he did and life moved
on and he left them there.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.080
So here they are, since 1991.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.650
- Unbelievable, it's a real time capsule.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.817
(garage door opening)

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.690
- It's a bit of a mess.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.960
- Oh man.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.740
This is, this is a dream.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.840
- It is...
- For a guy like me,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.900
this is a dream.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.620
- For me it was, I mean my
friend had mentioned these cars

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.190
in passing and I didn't
think he still owned them.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.560
He said we should go have a look.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.430
And so I pretty much did you and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.740
I think I stood here
and my chin hit my chest

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.940
and I just said my God.

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:11.740
(garage door opening)

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.370
- Boy there's mice living in that Cobra.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.210
- [Warren] We have mice in there, so...

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.800
- [Tom] This is a shot we'll
never see in our lives again.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.448
Mouse nest in the back of a Cobra.

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:20.389
- [Warren] In the back of a Cobra.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.400
(laughter)

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.260
- [Tom] I know about Cobras, but I don't

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.750
really know about Ferraris.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.840
What I do know is that a
275GTB was the first Ferrari

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.850
available without wire wheels.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.670
The standard wheels, apparently,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.860
were solid wheels like these alloy rims.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.247
But that's all I know, so
what can you tell me about it?

00:03:39.247 --> 00:03:40.370
- [Warren] Well, as far as I know,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.370
this is a 275GBT2, long nose alloy coupe.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.520
Which is with a two cam engine.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.910
Which as I understand it is a bit unusual

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.080
because usually the alloy cars

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.770
were bought with a four cam engine

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.000
because it would be somebody who was...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.800
A guy who would campaign the car

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.760
at least in some form of
racing with the alloy.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.750
This car was rather unusual because

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.150
it has the two cam street engine

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.300
which is not really heavily de-tuned,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.570
but is slightly less aggressive.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.490
But maybe makes it a little bit

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.040
more civilized for driving
around town, et cetera.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.770
So the gentleman who bought this

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.390
car had it up in Connecticut.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.510
My friend bought this car
from the original owner

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.780
for $47,000.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.804
- [Tom] In what year?

00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:31.580
- [Warren] About in the
early 80s I believe.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.413
- [Tom] Okay.

00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:33.331
- [Warren] I'm gonna guess '82.

00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:34.164
- [Tom] Okay.

00:04:34.164 --> 00:04:35.309
- [Warren] Something like that.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.960
And drove it down here and drove it around

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.810
sporadically for seven or eight years

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.680
and then as the aforementioned
mechanic passed away,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.210
and then the car ended up here.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.590
But it's, I believe
it's a 13,000 mile car.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.980
Has the original vinyl, blue
vinyl, not leather seats.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.750
That sounds odd for a Ferrari,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.900
but apparently that was normal in the day.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.300
And everything about the
car as far as I know,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.504
literally all the parts are
original as parked in 1991.

00:05:07.504 --> 00:05:09.150
- [Tom] Man, amazing.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.380
And you haven't tried to start this car?

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.920
- [Warren] No, my friend
thought it would be a bad idea

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.320
to try to start anything, to do anything.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.681
We just wanted to have the cars

00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:19.540
and have you come and have a look at it

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.802
and see what you thought.

00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:23.000
- [Tom] Because this car is dry,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.880
it hasn't been sitting outdoors,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.810
it doesn't sag.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.880
The body lines are real fine.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.050
I'm just wondering.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.840
(door slam)

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840
It's like a new car.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.070
It's got beautiful blue vinyl interior.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.870
Blue vinyl seats, blue carpeting.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.830
And it's got 13,205.2
miles on it from new.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.420
So '67 Ferrari just 50 years old,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.670
13,000 miles in 50 years.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.470
It was, yeah, I mean wow.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.040
This is probably one of the few GTBs

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.510
with this kind of mileage and
this original in the world.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.310
So there's a couple of
amazing cars in this garage.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.350
I'm leaning against one of them.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.900
I don't know much about Ferraris, but

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.900
fortunately I do know something
about that car over there.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.190
And it's the bright red Cobra.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.790
So let's go take a look at that.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.210
So this car is called a 427 Cobra.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.830
Even though this one does
not have a 427 engine.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.920
There are several stories about why

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.920
it has a 428, but the
427 had 425 horsepower.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.280
And the 428 had 390.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.660
The 427 was a racing engine and it was

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.590
made to run at high RPMs for, you know,

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.870
the length of the
Daytona 500 or the length

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.140
of the 24 hours of Le Mans.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.420
So just on and on at high RPMS.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.020
They were built to put
out peak horsepower.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.490
The 428 were built really a
police interceptor type motor.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.120
They were built for Thunderbirds.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.316
They were built for large country

00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:56.870
squires and things like that.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.100
They had 390 horsepower and
instead of having solid lifters,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.640
they had hydraulic lifters and it

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.600
was just a more drivable motor.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.450
Well, the story is that either Ford

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.740
couldn't supply all the
427s that Carroll needed

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.780
or Carroll Shelby wanted to save

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.170
several hundred dollars on each engine

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.960
and make more money in profit.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.730
So whatever the case is, many
427 Cobras have 428 engines.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.210
Once Ford found out that he
was substituting 428 engines

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.250
into 427 Cobras, they made
him pull the motors out.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.160
If the customer complained, wait a minute

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.870
I paid for 427, I got a
428, Ford Motor Company

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.500
made Carroll Shelby put the
correct motor back in the car.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.310
So they got what they
thought they were paying for.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.890
There were 998 Cobras made in all.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.820
That's 289s and 427s.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.910
The 289s, and even the
earlier ones the 260s

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.870
have what they call a slab sider,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.350
a very mild little lip on the fender.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.830
The 427s, we see many more of,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.480
not because they made more of them,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.114
they only made 300 and something of these.

00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:57.000
- [Warren] 348.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.340
- 348, okay they made 348 427 Cobras.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.790
The reason we see more of these is

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.520
because there are about 60,000 replicas

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.215
that are based on this car.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:09.610
So you can see this car
has a mild flare here.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.550
Because the car was a beefier car.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.330
It had a four inch diameter chassis tube

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.140
as opposed to three inch and it was made

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.750
to have bigger tires and wheels.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.610
It has coil over suspension in all corners

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.360
instead of the old leaf
spring that a 289 had.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.650
The rear of the Cobra, 427 Cobra,

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.940
there was four different styles of rear.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.520
And this is the street rear end.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.360
When I'm talking about rear,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.130
I'm talking about the body line.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.380
So this is the most common 427.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.770
They made a racing body which

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.200
this flare was out even further.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.090
They made one with a lip that was kind

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.900
of a little raised lip all around here.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.110
They made that on a few of them.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.610
And then they made a narrow hip car

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.530
which didn't have this excess fender,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.210
but it kind of tucked in nicely.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.810
The kit cars that you see are often

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.420
based on either an SC
or a competition Cobra.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.260
So you see there were side pipes

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.060
and big flares and big wheels.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.010
But in fact, street cars
didn't come with side pipes

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.560
and big flares and big wheels.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.840
They came like this.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.920
So this is a very untouched car.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.130
19,000 miles.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.600
It has an under car exhaust.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.510
So it's got dual exhaust exiting

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.360
out underneath the rear bumper.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.500
Which believe it or not,
Cobra people prefer this type

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.090
of look and sound to the
side pipe version cars.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.915
The Cobra has an aluminum body so

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:40.770
I can do my little trick here again,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.330
and I know it's not gonna stick

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.570
because it's an aluminum body.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.220
These were hand made in
England by AC Car Company.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.100
There's an emblem right here and

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.150
it says Shelby American Cobra powered

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.000
by Ford and it gives a serial number.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.840
Cobras have several places around the car

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.570
where that serial number is hidden.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.980
So if these cars were ever
stolen and dismantled,

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.490
you could trace parts of the car

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.390
by knowing where to look
and I'm gonna show you

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.040
where those pieces are right now.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.330
On each of these hood
latches, is a serial number.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.440
One here and there's one over there.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.400
So you've got the same serial number

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.440
that's down there is here and there.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600
On each of these hinges on
the left and right door,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.920
right inside underneath that
plastic and inside there,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.900
that same serial number exists.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.160
If you were to crawl, and I'm not

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.940
gonna crawl underneath this car.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.300
But if you were to crawl
underneath the car,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.130
that same serial number would be scraped

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.800
with an ice pick on the under side

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.170
of this transmission tunnel.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.380
It's an aluminum panel.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.370
As well as behind this panel right here.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.770
If you were to crawl underneath the car,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.700
and look in front of the rear end,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.700
you'd see the number
scratched across that panel.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.140
And the last place that
that serial number exists

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.560
is on this little trunk latch right there.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.560
So, often, you'll find a car
that has different pieces

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.480
from different cars on the same car

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.020
and you know that that car was assembled

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.170
some time because of a wreck,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.100
or they found parts they
needed in a junk yard

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.420
or they bought it from a collector.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.340
So this is where you can
tell how authentic a Cobra is

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.610
by those numbers all
being in the same places.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.430
That number also exists on the frame rail

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.020
next to the motor mounts that
stamp right in the frame.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.870
It's a four inch tube frame as opposed

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.380
to a three inch tube on the 289.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.480
The 289 is really a flexible flyer.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.190
It was built on an existing chassis,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.190
but Shelby designed this Cobra to be built

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.190
to handle a huge engine.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.250
Engine probably weighs 500 pounds.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.330
If you look at how far back the engine is,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.330
the engine is well behind
the front axle of the car.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.690
That meant that the transmission

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.270
went way back here,
the transmission lever,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.460
the shift lever, they
couldn't get a Mustang

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.320
shift lever to work because
it would be behind the driver.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.000
So they swapped that lever around

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.670
and it kind of faces forward.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.450
It looks awkward, but it
kind of works alright.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.120
But you know, you kind
of lift the transmission.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.950
You lift the lever up
to go into second gear

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.160
and you push it down to go third

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.360
and lift it up to fourth,
and it works fine.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.460
This car, having been sitting

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.240
here a while, it has occupants.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.330
In the glove box, that's probably

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
a condominium for a whole mouse family.

00:12:35.764 --> 00:12:38.900
There's more mouse stuff
going on in the back,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.110
and I'm sure after a couple
of decades of urination,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.520
that's all that crud on top
of the wheel and the tire.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.050
And if I was brave enough, I'd dig through

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.170
to see what's in that box,
but I see the correct jack

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.570
is in the corner over there.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.520
One very rare thing about
these cars are tool sets.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.110
They had screwdriver, a
pliers, and several wrenches,

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.290
couple of other pieces.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.750
And Cobra people would give their

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.900
eye teeth for a correct tool set.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.780
As I'm looking at the body here,

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.970
there's a real shiny, beautiful paint job

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.240
right underneath that layer of dust.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.880
I mean, the reflections that I'm

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.860
seeing back here are perfect.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.400
This car could be cleaned up so pretty.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.720
It would be such a sin to
restore a car like this.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.420
This car should be kept
just the way it is,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.420
cleaned and enjoyed as the
19,000 mile car that it is.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.320
I wrote a book about 20 years ago

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.580
called The Cobra in the Barn and that

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.570
was the first book I
did about barn finding.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.640
And the whole idea of that book was

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.160
the dream of being able to find a Cobra

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.180
in a neglected environment like this.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.210
Whether you're a Mopar
guy, or a Chevy guy,

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.050
or a Ford guy, we all dream about finding

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.920
cars in barns, but all of us would love

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.820
to find a Cobra in a barn.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.670
This brings tears to my eyes.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.940
This is the perfect setting
with the perfect car.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.020
I don't know if I'll ever do better

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.523
than that in this series.

00:14:00.523 --> 00:14:04.320
(upbeat rock music)

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.310
I've been hunting for old cars

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.040
in garages since I'm 12 years old.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.040
And I've never found a group
of cars like this in my life.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.190
A Ferrari, a Cobra, a V8 Morgan, and

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.800
a TR6 Triumph with low mileage.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.720
This is amazing and we may never find

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.150
another collection like this again.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.330
So maybe this should be the last

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.620
episode of Barn Find Hunter.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.390
Well, no, I'm only kidding.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.447
Happy hunting.

00:14:31.447 --> 00:14:34.447
(upbeat rock music)
