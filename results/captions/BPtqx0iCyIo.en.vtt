00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.800
I really want to understand the European elections.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800
Yeah.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.750
Populists have obviously, the movement AfD
in Germany, Lega, Five Star in Italy, even

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.650
Vox, now, in Spain.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.650
Yeah.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.430
These are all populist parties that have gone
from, as you've explained, I saw you speak

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.860
at an event, a banking event where you said
Lega and Salvini were 1%, 2%, 3% of the vote

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
10 years ago.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.860
Yeah.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.860
And where are they now?

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.730
Explain that and that impact on the parliamentary
I mean, they're up in the 30s now.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.730
In the 30s?

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.730
Yeah.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.730
It's remarkable.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.730
And this is Italy, Lega.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.290
You know, when you think about Italian governments,
what do they have?

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.690
I think 51 governments in the first 50 years
after World War II.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.150
I mean, you know, chaos is the norm in Italian
politics.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.130
Governments come in and governments go.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.750
This government, this merger that has happened
between Five Star, who are on the left, the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.520
Lega, who are on the right.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.710
Their approval ratings are up in the 60s.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.710
Together?

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.640
Yep, together.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640
And it's working.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.930
So this would be like in America, a Bernie
Sanders party and a Trump party together.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.990
In many ways, it would be.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.990
Yeah, in many ways it would be.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.890
And that's just fascinating, to an American,
to think.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.500
But it's working.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.490
They're clearly on a collision course with
Brussels.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.070
Because one group wants to spend, one group
wants to cut taxes.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.880
So how is that--
Yeah, that's difficult.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.560
--sustainable financially?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
Well, coalition forces compromise, obviously.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.950
But they presented a budget, their annual
budget with a deficit running at about 2.4%.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.290
And, all right I know some of the future projections
were a little bit optimistic for growth.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.880
But it wasn't, by any means, an outrageous
budget, particularly given the French.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.330
After yeah, the expectations were I think,
4% or 5%.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.330
That's right.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.330
That's right.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.330
And they came in with 2.4.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.330
I thought it was relatively responsible.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.630
And yet, the European Commission, you know,
and I repeat the point.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.671
Men and women who we can't vote for, men and
women who we can't remove, people who have

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:16.790
power without accountability rejected the
Italian budget and made them cut it.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.270
And I think these European elections particularly
in Italy, are effectively going to be a virility

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.023
test of Italian political parties against
that amount power being in Brussels.

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:36.879
So you have Brussels, the EU parliament, and
net, net, net, a larger percentage of populists

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.480
will be in that government.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.090
Look, you know, I mean, when I was first elected
to the European Parliament in 1999, I mean,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.629
I was the only secessionist in the place.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.090
I mean, literally, I was one out of 600 and
something.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.970
I was the only person really there saying
we shouldn't be part of this.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.020
It's going to be very different.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.820
I think there's going to be a big move.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.500
I would guess that we're going to finish up
with, I would think 25% of the Parliament,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.349
maybe nearer 30% will be new MEPs with a pretty
robustly skeptical attitude towards the way

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.959
the European Union works.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.080
It doesn't mean they'll be outright secessionist,
but it means they will be euro-critical in

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.870
many, many ways.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.349
And kind of what I think we're going to see
happening is, I think the discipline that

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:36.510
keeps the eurozone together, you know, and
that combination of ECB, at times IMF, and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.620
certainly European Commission, that discipline
that tells countries what they must and must

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.700
not do, that's going to fragment.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.840
That's going to start breaking down.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.750
So you had Ms. Angela Merkel, incredible leader
through, obviously, 2010, '11, through the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.690
last eight, nine, I think a decade, almost.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.690
Yeah.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.690
She was the glue of Europe.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.349
And what you're describing is a more fragmented
power base throughout Europe.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.349
Well, she's going.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.349
Yeah, she's gone.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.349
She's going.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.349
Amazing, isn't it?

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.739
You know, glittering political career ruined
by one mistake.

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.959
That one phrase, "let them come."

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.320
As many as want to come, come.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320
And it's ruined her.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320
The immigration.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.320
It's ruined her career.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.569
So a lot of people here in the States think
that if Europe had handled this immigration

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:23.639
issue over, say, a decade and didn't try to
jam it down everyone's throat, is that your

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.639
argument?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.809
Is it that that's what--
Well, I think that if you bring in huge numbers

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:35.780
of people in a very short space of time, nearly
all of whom are young males aged between 20

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.909
and 30 and who come from countries where women
aren't even second class citizens, don't be

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.610
surprised that there are huge, huge cultural
uproar going on in German cities and elsewhere.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.400
So it was a huge, huge mistake that she made.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.870
Either way, if you think back to 2008 and
on, it was actually Merkel's leadership, in

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.449
many ways, that kept the eurozone functioning
and kept the whole thing working.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.389
Her political authority, the sheer weight
of Germany as an economic power kept the whole

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.810
show on the road.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.599
She's on the way out.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.529
Very unlikely that she's going to be replaced
by anybody with that level of stature that

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.529
she has.

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:19.529
So this is important.

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.099
So you think of the relationship between Germany
and think of Schauble, the former finance

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.099
minister.

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.099
Yeah.

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.809
You've had this group of people that were
very hard on austerity, really forcing the

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:37.879
austerity into the periphery, which, you know,
Italy, Spain, Portugal.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:44.630
Could we see a left shift there where they're
actually more supportive of deficit spending

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.699
in the south?

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.250
Could that somehow be a positive coming out
of Germany?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.250
Well.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.430
Because that's a major--
They might, but it won't be enough.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.159
The Greeks had their little mini rebellion.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.729
They put Mr. Tsipras in power.

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.270
They had the rather colorful finance minister
Mr. Varoufakis for a bit.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.219
But in the end, when it came to the standoff
between the Greek government and the European

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.919
institutions, the Greeks blinked.

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.619
And the Greeks have now just given up, basically.

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:19.249
Italy is a very different kettle of fish.

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:27.679
I think what you're beginning to see with
Salvini is a series of tests of will that

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:31.529
are going on between him and the European
institutions, and at some point--

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:32.689
There's no going after the ECB.

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.289
They've taken the Trump playbook.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.310
Oh, absolutely.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.449
Well, I rather agree with Trump on that one,
actually.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.899
But, yeah, so what I see, I see discipline
breaking down within the eurozone.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:51.719
I think it becomes much harder for the ECB,
the Commission, and Germany to limit what

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.020
governments borrow and what they spend.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.159
So it would be much harder for the EU to enforce
financial discipline.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.159
Much harder.

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:05.719
So you have credit default swaps on Italian
sovereign bonds that have gone up dramatically

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.020
as of the famous Memorial Day weekend.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020
Yeah.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.020
God bless Brevan Howard.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.339
They got it right.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.169
They had a good run.

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.039
But now, what's interesting is that even as
markets have rallied here in the United States,

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.139
you still have those credit default swaps,
which is actually a bet on default, the cost

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.139
of protection.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:30.429
They're still very, very elevated among Italy
and the banks.

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:37.279
So you're talking about $1.8 trillion of near-term
debt maturities in Italy.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:41.979
So these are bonds that are coming due that,
at the same time, they're running the deficit

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:43.050
and they're having this confrontation.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.580
So we're talking about near-term paper coming
due in the next three or four years, maybe

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.580
five.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.580
So near-term debt maturities are extremely
high, $1.8 trillion.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.580
Yeah, massive.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.009
How do we get through this?

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.389
Where does it break?

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:58.969
Does it break sometime in the next 18 months?

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:04.899
Well, in the end, of course, that's the one
thing that they have over Salvini, is the

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:08.309
worry that if they rebelled too much, the
whole system could go back.

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:14.179
You know, that is the one thing that perhaps
holds the Italians back from being too rebellious.

00:08:14.179 --> 00:08:17.819
But ultimately, in the end, this is about
public will.

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:20.669
And we've seen it with Brexit.

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:26.639
I mean, we were told in that referendum that
if we voted to leave, half a million jobs

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.169
would go immediately.

00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:29.979
Growth would collapse.

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:31.699
House prices would collapse.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:35.219
Plagues of black locusts would descend upon
our farmlands.

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:38.959
And we still voted Brexit.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:44.229
And you get to a point where even if you tell
the Italian electorate, if you start to pursue

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:49.740
a path of basically looking at alternatives
to the Euro, which is what we're talking about,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.079
really, that terrible things will happen to
you.

00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:55.930
Well, in the end, people who haven't got anything
have nothing to lose.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.750
And I think, ultimately, that's where we're
going.
