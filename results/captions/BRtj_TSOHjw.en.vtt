00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480
The Russian Community in particular has been quite adamant

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.960
that I do a series on a T-34.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040
Well, where better to visit a T-34 than to come to Russia.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.360
We’re in a little town Padikovo a tad west of Moscow,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.360
to have a look at their T-34/85.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.720
It’s the middle of June, it’s absolutely freezing,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.920
but my Russian Camera crew says it’s kind of warm

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.160
so we’re going to do this anyway.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.960
The T-34 was doing quite well,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.560
but it needed a little bit of an upgrade to the gun.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.800
The 76mm was starting to show its age,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.160
so by August of 43, they started to investigating

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.200
as to whether or not you could but an 85mm into it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.640
Well the answer was Yes you could,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.960
but you needed to increase the turret ring diameter to about 1600 millimeters,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.440
quite an increase over the 1420 of the earlier T-34.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.120
This did allow one significant advantage though,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.800
and that was you could now put a wider turret with a three man crew.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.840
This fixed a significant failing of the older T-34,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.680
which was a little bit cramped,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.200
and the two man crew were overworked and inefficient.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.880
We’re going to look at the T-34 in the usual manner

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.080
you are now familiar with.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.960
We’re going to start at the front and work our way around,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.800
look at the engine, and then hop inside.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.840
Maybe even take it for a spin.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.960
We’ll see.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.960
The vehicle’s front hull, 45mm of armor,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080
sloped at 60 degrees, top and bottom.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.000
This is sort of a mid production vehicle,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.000
it has this small narrow rail in front.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.200
Earlier ones had a larger radius and later ones

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960
they dispensed with it entirely and just went

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.280
with a two piece direct weld.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.240
If you look at the details of the far left

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.520
and right wings are two armored plugs.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.400
This is for the track tension system.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.480
Now there is some misconception that

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.000
because T-34 had slack unsupported track

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.520
you didn’t need to tension it.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.800
Well this is absolutely wrong.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.760
If you don’t keep an unsupported track

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.320
at the correct level of tension

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.120
you will walk the track off.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520
So in order to tension the track

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.520
what you do is you first release a lock

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.920
which is on the inside of the tank,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.440
right in the front corners in the bow.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
You then take a tool, insert that into here,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.880
and then you crank a worm drive,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.920
which will then move the idler wheel forwards or backwards.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.520
When you’re done you lock the idler wheel back into position,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.000
put your plug back in the top, and away you go.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.400
Other features on the front, two tow hooks, spare track,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.160
and of course a machine gun, a horn and a headlight are on the left.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.680
If you want to know a little bit more on the specifications of the tank,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.960
well I’ve got Yuri Pasholok here off the screen teaching me the finer points of T-34-ology,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.720
and one of the things he points out is the serial number is actually coded.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.880
The first character, in this case a four,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.040
is the year of manufacture; 1944.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.400
The next two characters are the month: 12, December.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.560
Lastly, ‘117’ means it was the 177th tank to come off the line

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.640
that month in Nizhny Tagil.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.480
Now, it doesn’t say Nizhny Tagil on this,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.760
but there are a couple of features around the tank

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.120
which indicate that was the plant of manufacture.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.000
Every single manufacturing plant had its own little idiosyncrasies

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.720
which it implemented into the tank.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.160
So a T-34 built in one plant was not necessarily identical

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.400
with a T-34 built in another plant.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.840
They were just fit to the same general design and specifications.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.320
External Fuel Tanks, 90 Liters, you would have one of course on each side.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.280
Now later on in production you were able to put on four of them.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.000
These were not part of the fuel system;

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.920
they were simply extra fuel that you could

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.600
then pump yourself into the fuel tanks.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.800
Moving a bit further forward,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.560
this is an access cover for some of the oil,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.320
there is one on the far side as well.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.000
Now, common to everything else on this tank, it is bolted down.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.440
You can’t do any maintenance without tools.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.960
So, undo this bolts, lift this up out of the way, undo more bolts,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.440
you can finally access your lubricants.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.920
Moving forward, this is a post war addition so ignore it.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.040
Keep moving, of course you have your hand rails for the tank riders,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.840
firing port for personal weapons, the horn, headlight,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.240
and finally point to note is the welding.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.320
Now if you compare the weld with that on earlier T-34s,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.000
especially the early war production ones,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.200
you’ll see this is far, far better.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.360
About part way through the war,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.960
a Soviet Engineer figured out the concept of submerged Arc Welding,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.600
which is far more efficient, far faster, far less man hours.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.000
The welds that it produced were so strong,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.560
that in testing they were stronger than the armor it was welding together.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680
So, improvement there.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.680
Finally on the side, an access point here for one of the suspension units.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.080
There’s another one you can see here aft of the turret.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320
But also you can see that the turret is on top of it.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.760
So in order to do any maintenance,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.880
you got to pull the turret off,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.800
which is mildly inconvenient.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.160
Finally, fuel filler point, and as ever,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.600
you’ve got to open up the bolts to gas up the tank.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.280
Now, T-34 is not the most refined tank in the world.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.160
A perfect example of this is found in the running gear.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.880
Now most other tanks you’re going to look at,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.800
they’re going to have some sort of mechanism

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.360
to stop the track from falling apart.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.960
There is maybe a clip, or a bolt, if you’ve got a double pin track,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.480
like an American system for example,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.080
you’ve got end connectors.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.480
This, as you can see, there’s absolutely nothing

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.720
which stops the track pin from working its way out of the track.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.720
The only thing that keeps the track together in the end, however, is this ramp.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.280
Which if the track pin was worked its way out too far,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.200
when it comes forward and hits this ramp it just gets whacked back into place.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.960
A somewhat crude technique,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.880
however, given how long they expected the tank

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.560
was going to survive in battle anyway,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
it really didn’t matter.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.560
This wasn’t supposed to last for years and years,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.440
it was supposed to last one or two battles,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.680
maybe three battles, and chances were by then that your tank was dead

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.160
or the track was dead, it didn’t matter.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.360
The links themselves, 72 per side cast of Hadfield Steel.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.840
There were two types of links on each track; 36 of each.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.920
One will have the center guide, and the other will have a hole.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.880
This hole is used for ice grousers.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.360
Basically once every six or so

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.320
link you’re going to put an ice grouser in here.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.520
It gives you a little more traction on particularly loose or slippery surfaces.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.000
To propel the tank forward, again this is a bit like the BT we saw before,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.320
most tanks are going to have a sprocket wheel.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.760
Not so in the case of T-34 and its derivatives.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.800
There are rollers in the drive wheel,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.280
each of which will mesh with the center guide,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.200
and this will propel the tank forward.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.040
Now the advantage of this, is that there is no friction.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.120
You’re talking about rollers meshing with the teeth.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.200
The downside though of course,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.560
all of your tractive effort going through a single piece of metal,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.760
every other link, and when you start talking about 40 ton tanks,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.800
you start getting to a weak point.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.720
So at that point, it was about as far as you went,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.480
and later tanks you would see more of a conventional sprocket wheel.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.680
Moving right back right quick to the main road wheels,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.920
830mm each one, five pairs per side on the Christie Suspension.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.200
These particular road wheels are unique to the Nizhny Tagil Factory.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.320
Other road wheels for T-34s you see, some are solid, some are spoked,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.120
but by a combination of very simple features you can tell where a tank was built,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.960
and this is one of the features that Yuri was telling me “Ah ha! Nizhny Tagil tank!”

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.920
Look around to the back of the tank,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.360
we have more armor plate at 45mm thick also well sloped.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.320
And you’re starting to come along some of the inefficiency

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.280
if the back of the tank is as well armored

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.480
as the front the tank almost,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.160
you wonder if that’s the most effective use of the weight.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.040
However, that said, if you were to be shot at from the rear,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.080
better to have it than not.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.240
Dominated by a large access port,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.800
undo these bolts and you can open this up,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.000
and you can access the starter motor,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.520
the transmission, and the steering clutches.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.080
Exhaust ports on each side, and the entire plate can be unbolted,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.360
as you can see it’s hinged, and you can bring it forward.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.680
The 67 and a half liter tanks, I mentioned earlier.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.800
It was more often than not that three of the four external tanks would be filled

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.160
with fuel and the fourth one would have oil in it.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.840
Outside of that, underneath, you have the tow hooks as you would expect.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.640
These little pipes up here are for smoke dischargers,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.640
and you can barely see at the top here a convoy light;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.800
small little red bulb.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.840
So this particular tank does have a third 90 liter tank on the right hand side.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.200
Now the internal fuel capacity was about 680 liters.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.840
If you add that to the external tanks it would be expected that,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.240
again diesel engine, this tank will go about 300 kilometers,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.560
which is actually pretty reasonable.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.320
Under the turret we have another access port for a suspension unit.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.640
And I’m told another unique Nizhny Tagil feature is

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.040
this sort of flat triangle on the side of the turret,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.640
which apparently most other T-34/85s did not have.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.920
So after spinning the turret, we can open up the back hatch.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.800
Of course it requires the use of a tool,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.880
like everything else on this tank does.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.200
However it’s actually pretty simple,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.640
it’s just a case of lever it up and pull it back.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.240
This reveals to us the V-2-34.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.560
It is a V-12 Diesel cranks out about 500 horsepower.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.560
The cooling system is about the only thing you can actually access under here.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.080
The filler cap is right in the center.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.400
There are radiators on each side of the engine,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.200
under the louvers here.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.560
The capacity of the cooling system is 75 liters.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.360
Not much else to be seen from the top here,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.400
we’re going to close this up and then open up the transmission compartment.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.680
The Transmission Compartment is held in place,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.520
there are some relatively quick release springs here,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.520
which have already conveniently been half way opened up.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:59.400
Ah ha! And now a nice light…Oh come off

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.000
oh, it helps if you’re not standing on it.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.760
There we go, much better.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.040
Underneath, you can see these cooling louvers,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.200
they are on a swivel shutter.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.760
You can close these up if you need more protection

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.160
from airburst or aircraft attack.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.040
Underneath you can see a large flywheel,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.000
which of course transmits the power back to the transmission.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.600
If you look down at the very far bottom,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.560
you can see the control linkages for the clutches and brakes,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.480
there’s one on each side, obviously for steering.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.640
You can also see the two multi-cyclone air filters.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.440
Unfortunately, if you’ve got to change these air filters out

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.520
you have to do it usually every 25 hours.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.520
You have to pull out these armored louvers first.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.920
That will then allow you to access the air filters.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.520
It’s not the end of the world because

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.560
there’s only a couple of bolts in each side,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.840
but it’s still a nuisance

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.040
that you don’t really want to deal with all that much.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.520
The maintenance on this is a little bit intense,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.240
if after only 10 hours of use you’re supposed to check the clutch plate

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.120
and make sure it goes six to seven millimeters.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.400
If you’re lucky enough to get your engine going 25 hours,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.440
you’ve got to clean out your air filters.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.160
If your tank lasts for 50 hours of travel,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.960
or a thousand kilometers,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.560
then things really start getting nasty.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.280
You have to start disassembling the suspension to get to get at them.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.800
However, if you’re lucky,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.400
your tank won’t last that long.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.720
You won’t have to do the maintenance;

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840
just go and get another tank.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.800
There’s a lot of ways of almost falling off this tank by the way.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.360
It’s not quite as bad as the Matilda,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.920
but it’s pretty nasty.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.600
And thus ends Part One.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.680
So Part two of course, Turret and inside.
