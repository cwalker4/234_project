THIS SAYS SOCIALIST LIKE CORTEZ

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.069
AND BERNIE SANDERS WANT TO TAKE

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.972

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.093

INCOME THERE ARE FAIRLY STRICT

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:44.471
RULES ABOUT HOW CANDIDATES PAY

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.006
THEIR SPOUSES, FAMILY MEMBERS,

IT HAS TO BE FOR CERTAIN, ALL OF

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.246
THAT IS GREATER GOAL OF LIMITING

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:54.014
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRUPTION

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:55.816
THAT CAN COME THROUGH FAMILY

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:59.186
MEMBERS OR CANDIDATES.

00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:01.388

COMPANIES, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.251
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU OPERATE A PAC, A

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:33.954
GROUP THAT'S DEDICATED TO TRYING

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:35.355
TO GET ELECT TODAY OFFICE, YOU

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.291
HAVE TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE HOW

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:39.459
YOU SPEND ALL OF YOUR FUNDS AND

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.396
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT LAW.

00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:44.064
THAT LAW GIVES VOTERS AND

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:47.267
JOURNALISTS AND WATCHDOG GROUPS

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:48.502
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS THE

00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:49.703
OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW THE MONEY

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:51.772
AS IT GOES THROUGH OUR CAMPAIGN

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:54.942
FINANCE SYSTEM.

00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:55.642
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THAT YOU

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.711
HAD A PACK THAT DISCLOSED HOW IT

00:02:57.712 --> 00:03:00.113
SPENT THE MONEY BUT WHAT THE

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:01.715
DISCLOSURE SAID THAT A LARGE

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:02.916
AMOUNT, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.952
DOLLARS HAVE BEEN PAID OUT TO A

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:07.087
COMPANY AFFILIATED WITH THE PAC

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:10.390
AND NORMALLY THAT SORT OF

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.159
ARRANGEMENT HAS ALARM BELLS

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.494
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED

00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:15.796
ABOUT IS THE PAC IS RAISING

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:18.199
MONEY TELLING PEOPLE IT'S FOR

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.767
POLITICAL PURPOSES AND PAY TO GO

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:22.570
AFFILIATE COMPANY THAT THEN PAYS

00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.640
THEM, IN A SENSE POCKETING THE

00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:28.476
PAC'S MONEY.

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:29.176
LIZ: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:30.912
HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF THAT, THE

00:03:30.913 --> 00:03:32.480
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE BERNIE

00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:33.447
SANDERS' CAMPAIGN ACCUSED OF

00:03:33.448 --> 00:03:35.116
VIRTUALLY THE SAME THING LAST

00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:36.617
DECADE.

00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:38.186
I MEAN, THAT BASICALLY THE HOUSE

00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:40.655
THAT'S RUNNING HIS TV AND MEDIA

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.957
AD SPENDS $82 MILLION THERE,

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.792
THEIR FORMER ASSOCIATES OF HIS

00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:46.327
WIFE JANE AND JANE WAS GETTING

00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:48.163
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN

00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:50.465
COMMISSIONS ON THE AD BUYS, SO

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:52.133
IT FELT LIKE AGAIN THAT BERNIE

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:53.968
SANDERS' WIFE THAT THERE WAS

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:54.803
SELF-DEALING INVOLVED THERE,

00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:56.971
SAME WITH OCASIO-CORTEZ'S

00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:58.273
BOYFRIEND BEING PUT ON THE

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:03.211
PAYROLL OF THE SHELL COMPANY.

00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:03.945
&gt;&gt; LOOK, THERE ARE RULES ABOUT

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:06.681
AND FAIRLY STRICT ABOUT HOW A

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:09.918
PAC OR A CAMPAIGN CAN PAY FAMILY

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.719
MEMBERS OF THE CANDIDATE TO

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.154
PREVENT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:19.027
CORRUPTION THAT ARISE FROM THAT

00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:20.295
AND CANDIDATE TO BE PARTICULARLY

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:21.329
TRANSPARENT WHEN IT COMES TO

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.299
PAYMENTS MADE TO FAMILY MEMBERS.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.999
LIZ: IS THE FEDERAL ELECTION

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.134
COMMISSION GOING TO STEP IN HERE

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:27.602
AND IF BERNIE SANDERS DOES IT

00:04:27.603 --> 00:04:31.105
AGAIN, WILL IT STEP IN THERE?

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:31.806
AGAIN, HE'S NOT RELEASING TAX

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:32.540
RETURNS, THE QUESTION IS IT

00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:35.076
FEELS LIKE HE'S HIDING

00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:35.877
SOMETHING.

00:04:35.878 --> 00:04:36.644
&gt;&gt; SEC DOESN'T HAVE JURISDICTION

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:38.246
OVER TAX RETURNS BUT AS TO THE

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:40.715
-- AS TO THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:42.383
MATTERS, THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE

00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.219
SEC IS A COMPLETELY

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.289
DYSFUNCTIONAL AND BROKEN AGENCY.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.056
IT DOESN'T ENFORCE THE LAW EVEN

00:04:48.057 --> 00:04:50.592
IN THE MOST CLEAR-CUT CASES,

00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:53.528
BORDERLINE CASES THE SEC IS

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:54.296
ESSENTIALLY NONFUNCTIONAL SO I

00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:56.131
WOULD NOT HOLD MY BREATH WAITING

00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:59.834
FOR SEC ACTION IN ANY PARTICULAR

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:02.404
CAMPAIGN FINANCE.

00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:05.040
LIZ: MEANWHILE ALONG THE WAY ALL

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.542
PECULIAR THINGS ARE COMING UP, 2

00:05:07.543 --> 00:05:09.744
YEARS AGO JANE AND BERNIE

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:11.880
SANDERS FORMED A NONPROFIT,

00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:13.482
RAISED HALF A MILLION BUCKS, HE

00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:16.084
HAD NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT, NO

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:17.252
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THE FAMILY IS

00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:18.553
ASSOCIATED WITH THE NONPROFIT,

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:22.057
YOUR TAKE ON THAT?

00:05:22.058 --> 00:05:22.624
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, WELL, IT'S

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:24.826
PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS FOR

00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:28.196
NONPROFITS, 501C3 TO BE CLOSELY

00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:30.899
ALIGNED WITH CANDIDATES.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.466
HUGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:32.634
CORRUPTION THERE BECAUSE UNLIKE

00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:33.402
CAMPAIGNS, NONPROFIT

00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:35.037
ORGANIZATIONS AREN'T SUBJECT TO

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:36.138
CONTRIBUTION LIMITS, SO YOU

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.073
COULD GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS IF

00:05:38.074 --> 00:05:40.475
YOU WERE TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR

00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:42.878
WITH A CANDIDATE, GIVING A

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.646
MILLION DOLLARS AND ENGAGE IN

00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:47.316
SERIOUS CORRUPTION THAT WAY.

00:05:47.317 --> 00:05:48.250
THE LAWS ABOUT COORDINATION

00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:49.651
BETWEEN NONPROFITS AND CAMPAIGNS

00:05:49.652 --> 00:05:51.787
ARE VERY WEAK, THEY NEED TO BE

00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:53.422
STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY TO

00:05:53.423 --> 00:05:54.690
PREVENT THE MONEY FROM

00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:56.358
ESSENTIALLY BLEEDING OVER FROM

00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:58.160
THE NONPROFIT SIDE TO THE

00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.464
CAMPAIGN SIDE.
