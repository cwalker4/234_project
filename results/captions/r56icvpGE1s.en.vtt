00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.040
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: An enormous flying
creature born of a raging

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.540
inferno...
a vicious three-headed dog

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.120
guarding the gates of hell
and mysterious sea serpents

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.500
terrorizing mankind.
But are such monsters just

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.460
mythical creatures; a fantasy?
Or did they actually exist in

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
the ancient past?
&gt;&gt; GEORGE NOORY: There was some

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.960
kind of experimentation
going on.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.620
Let's take this animal and give
him two heads.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.040
Let's take this dragon and give
him wings.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.670
&gt;&gt; GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: These
creatures are direct products

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.540
of extraterrestrial genetic
experimentations in our past.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.460
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Millions of people
around the world believe we have

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.880
been visited in the past by
extraterrestrial beings.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.880
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really shape

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.000
our history?
And if so, might the beasts and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
monsters of ancient legend
really have been the product of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.420
an advanced extraterrestrial
intelligence?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.040
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Surfside Beach,
Montauk, New York.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.170
On July 13, 2008, a 26-year-old
woman and three of her friends

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.000
discovered the carcass of a
strange looking creature that

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.210
had washed onto the shore.
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: It actually looked

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.210
like a hybrid creature that had
the claws of a raccoon and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.210
possibly the beak of a bird and
the body, perhaps, of a dog.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.210
A very unusual creature.
A photograph was taken

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.460
and circulated.
It started popping up all over

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.170
the Internet.
It went viral.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.710
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The people
couldn't identify the animal

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.000
because it didn't look like
anything.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.750
It looked like a mixture of
different animals.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.620
&gt;&gt; REDFERN: And because it
looked so strange, you know,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.710
it provoked a lot of theories.
Is it just an unknown animal?

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.460
Could it be some sort of hybrid-
type creature?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.620
Something, you know, that had
been genetically tinkered with

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.670
in a lab?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some believe the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.040
mysterious creature is a hybrid
beast, perhaps created at a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.880
nearby government testing
facility, the Plum Island Animal

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.790
Disease Center.
Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.540
labels the creature "The Montauk
Monster."

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.540
&gt;&gt; COLEMAN: This is a replica
of the Montauk Monster.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.000
One of the things that we
noticed about this creature was

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.210
the strange features around
its mouth.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.790
It looked like a beak.
It actually looked like we

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.460
didn't know what was going
on here.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.210
Was it a griffon, was it a
creature, was it a giant turtle?

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.880
But indeed, that was decaying
flesh that had come away from

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.210
the skull.
Other features were the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.710
strange looking feet, and the
body, indeed-- because the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.540
picture had no scale in it--
we thought looked enormous.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.960
But on the body, these white
objects here really define the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.540
size of flies on the creature,
which then determined a scale.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.330
This creature was very small.
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: Unfortunately, someone

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.210
grabbed the carcass and
supposedly took it to his front

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.120
yard, and it ultimately
vanished.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.120
So the only evidence we have of
this creature is the photo.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.620
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But while some
researchers theorized that the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.210
so-called Montauk Monster was
the product of modern science,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.500
ancient astronaut theorists
believe the animal could be part

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.210
of a long line of genetically-
modified creatures that have

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.000
appeared throughout human
history.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.500
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: If the Montauk
Monster is in fact a reality,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.000
then that could mean that if
we're able today to create some

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.710
very bizarre creatures behind
closed doors in labs all around

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.210
the world, it is possible that
our ancestors, especially the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.830
extraterrestrial ancestors, had
the same capability.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.460
Because in ancient texts, we
have numerous references to

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.960
monsters, bizarre beings that
have been described

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.120
in great detail.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Ancient Greek

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.710
artifacts depict terrifying
beasts such as the gorgon...

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:35.960
the Hydra...
and the ferocious Cerberus.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.670
And in Homer's epic poem
the<i> Iliad,</i> the Greek author

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.210
describes a battle in which the
hero, Bellerophon, slays a

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.620
monster called the Chimera.
&gt;&gt; JASON MARTELL: The Chimera

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.540
was a dreaded beast that wreaked
havoc and terrorized the people

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.460
of Asia Minor.
Homer described the Chimera as

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.880
an immortal beast with a
lionlike head, a snake tail

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.540
and a third goat head in the
middle that snorted bright fire.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.670
&gt;&gt; GLENN: The notion of chimeras
and hybrids is one that has been

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.330
part of the human psyche
for millennia.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.880
I mean, when you think about
things such as the Minotaur,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.000
Pegasus, Anubis, this is
something that either we have

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.290
imagined or had been created
at one time.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.710
&gt;&gt; RICHARD RADER: These beings,
these monsters, serve more of,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.000
kind of an ethical purpose in
mythology than they are catalogs

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.290
of something literal because
storytelling and fiction are

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.420
just a part of what we are as
human beings.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But did mythic
monsters merely spring from the

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.460
imagination of our ancestors?
Or might they have actually

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.040
existed?
Ancient alien theorists believe

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.880
in their existence and that
evidence can be found in the

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.880
relics of the past.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: To suggest that

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.540
all of these creatures were
nothing else but fantasy, in my

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.330
opinion, doesn't really hold
water because our ancestors

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.170
weren't stupid.
They depicted what they saw.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.500
We find these mixed hybrid
beings all throughout Egypt as

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.460
sphinxes, as griffons, as
bizarre creatures that,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.460
according to the the ancient
Egyptian texts, they did exist.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.960
They were not a fantasy
of our ancestors' imagination.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.330
&gt;&gt; ERICH VON DANIKEN: Just
imagine there is a mother

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.040
spaceship traveling in the
universe for centuries and

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.460
centuries.
Then they find a solar system

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.710
with a planet with the
possibility of life like the

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.040
earth.
And they observe on the Nile a

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.460
crocodile, a living creature
which obviously is resistant

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.210
to the heat.
They observe a lion with his

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.120
power, his muscles.
And now they start to think, "We

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.710
could use a mixture of this
creature on another planet."

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.880
And now, by genetical design,
they start to create mixed

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.330
creatures.
Some of these mixed creatures

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.120
did exist in the past.
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN YOUNG: The griffon

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.040
was a mythological creature
that had the body of a lion with

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.540
the head and wings of an eagle.
Now, the lion is the king of

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.210
beasts, the eagle is the king of
birds, so the griffon was the

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.210
king of all creatures.
&gt;&gt; PHILIP COPPENS: The creature

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.670
is somehow two creatures put
together in a way that defies

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.880
normal sense, defies normal
explanation.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.880
So the question then is:
how does that happen?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.710
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the mid-19th
century, scientists began to

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.670
look at fossil records around
the planet to study how

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:07.710
organisms changed over time.
Naturalist Charles Darwin

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.710
theorized that all life-forms
share a common origin and have

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.960
evolved over the centuries
through a process called

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.290
natural selection.
Might the hybrid monsters of

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.710
ancient religion and myth really
have been the result of

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.460
evolution?
&gt;&gt; STANFORD: Darwin's theory of

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.960
evolution by natural selection
is a mechanism by which

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.460
life-forms can change from one
into another.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.830
It relies on the principle that
organisms that have certain

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.880
traits, permutations may be
advantageous in the struggle for

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.710
existence and the struggle
for reproduction.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.210
And those traits are the ones
that will be perpetuated over

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.710
time, over many, many
generations.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.710
&gt;&gt; IMBROGNO: Certain different
species can breed if they are

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:05.710
genetically close, like the...
like the donkey and the horse.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:11.040
Like the wolf and the dog.
However, cats and dogs will not

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.620
mate because, first of all, they
don't have the biochemical

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.170
signatures to mate with each
other, and plus their genes are

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.540
so different that the
chromosomes just won't line up

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.880
properly to reproduce.
It's impossible.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.460
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if Darwin's
theories on evolution and

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.880
natural selection cannot explain
the origins of ancient beasts

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.330
and monsters, then where might
they have come from?

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.120
Perhaps the answer cannot be
found on Earth, but in a place

00:10:47.120 --> 00:11:03.920
much father away.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Southern Pakistan.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.120
In the middle of the Indus River
Valley lie the ruins

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.920
of Mohenjo-daro.
This ancient city, whose name

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.000
means "mound of the dead," was
one of the largest urban

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.460
settlements in the world
in 2600 B.C.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:28.500
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: The ancient city of
Mohenjo-daro had what appeared

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.290
to be streets that were laid out
parallel and perpendicular to

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.170
each other, like a modern city.
The homes actually had their own

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.330
toilets and they had a very
sophisticated sewer system.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.790
So it looks like a very
advanced city.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists have long thought this

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.500
site was also the epicenter
of a nuclear explosion that

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.330
occurred more than 4,000 years
ago.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.420
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: Skeletons were found
in dead positions as though

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.920
there's an instantaneous death,
and some of those skeletons, as

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.620
measured by Soviet scientists,
had 50 times the normal

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.330
radioactivity.
They found pottery that had been

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.420
fused, then walls were heated to
such an extent they became

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.170
vitrified or glasslike,
suggesting some sort of ancient

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:26.000
nuclear weapon involved.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to the

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.750
Mahabharata, the ancient holy
text of the Hindus, white-hot

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.920
smoke rose in infinite
brilliance and reduced the city

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.580
to ashes.
Horses were burned by the

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.920
thousands and corpses were
vaporized by intense heat.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.670
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: And afterwards, a
big silence came over the entire

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.170
land and people start to have
boils on their skin.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.580
Their hair start to fall out
and their nails.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.670
There's only one thing that
causes this, and that is

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:06.330
radiation poisoning.
It's radiation fallout.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.420
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: So the question then
becomes when events happen in

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.670
a place where there is
extreme radiation, what impact

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.920
does that have on human life or
on other life present there?

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.500
Could this explain, for example,
why creatures were born with

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.170
more than one arm or more than
one leg, which then somehow

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.500
became deified?
Because even to this day, we

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.170
know that in civilizations where
anomalous human beings are born,

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:37.170
somehow the touch of God is seen
to be part of this creation.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.920
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to the
ancient Hindu texts, after the

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.920
carnage at Mohenjo-daro, a
fearsome flying monster appeared

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.920
in the sky.
It was called "Garuda."

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.620
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: In the Mahabharata,
the Garuda is a massive birdlike

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.920
creature; it's a red face,
red wings, talon.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.500
It's so huge it would block
out the sun.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.580
There are stories that it would
let a certain god, Vishnu, ride

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.170
on him on occasion.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: And each and every

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.000
time he would show up,
descending from the sky, he

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.670
would create hurricane winds.
And upon his descent, the Earth

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.170
would shake, dust would fly up
in the air and everyone in the

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.500
vicinity would be absolutely
terrified.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:27.500
Now here we have a carving
of Garuda, and if we look at the

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.920
top, yes, they look like
feathers, but at the same time

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.920
they could be interpreted as big
gigantic flames.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.000
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: According to Hindu
mythology, Garuda's born out of

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.670
this cosmic event, this war and
destruction that happens at the

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.250
end of every age.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Could this have been

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.790
somehow connected to exposures
or to radiation being borne

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.670
within a zone of high radiation?
We cannot know the answer, but

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.920
we do know that within India and
within Pakistan there are known

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.790
zones of higher radiation than
there are normal.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.330
The logic dictates that somehow,
genetic abominations will have

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.500
been born within those places.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If Mohenjo-daro was

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.170
in fact the site of an ancient
nuclear attack, could it be

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.290
possible that Garuda was a
mutant beast created as a

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.170
by-product of intense
radioactivity?

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.920
&gt;&gt; STANFORD: We tend to have a
science fiction view of what

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.080
mutation is.
We think of mutations being

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.920
caused by radiation and they
cause outlandish features and

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.580
gigantic-sized insects and so
forth, but in fact, mutations

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.670
happen all the time.
&gt;&gt; BUSBY: There's no recorded

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.920
evidence of any radiation
causing a mutation which changes

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.580
some species into a different
species.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.920
Most of the radiation mutations
are lethal.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if, as modern
scientists believe, Garuda was

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.580
not likely the result of genetic
mutation, then what could

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.670
explain its existence?
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The Mahabharata

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.290
states that Garuda was born from
this raging inferno.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.460
And what's really intriguing is
the fact that in some text

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.670
passages, we can read that the
exterior of Garuda did not

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.000
consist of feathers, but of
metal.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.500
Now what kind of a bird
is that?

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.920
No bird is made of metal, unless
it's a type of machine.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.080
&gt;&gt; VON DANIKEN: Garuda was a
flying vehicle, and Garuda was

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.000
able to travel to the Moon and
around the Earth with very, very

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.500
high speed.
Garuda even was able to shock

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:56.750
mankind with lightning, which
fell from heaven.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.420
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: Garuda was
considered to be a snake killer.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.960
In fact, Garuda needed to eat
snakes in order to survive.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.920
Now compare an airplane at the
airport today hooked up to a

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.330
fuel line.
Isn't that airplane eating

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:21.670
a snake?
If you see modern fighter jets

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.170
take off in the middle of the
night, and there's smoke and

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:31.000
fire coming out of the exhaust,
it looks like a dragon.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.620
It looks like some type of a
mythical creature, especially if

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.920
you don't know what you're
witnessing is nuts-and-bolts

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.960
technology.
So of course you're gonna liken

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.920
it to a living creature.
Those ancient aliens knew that

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:54.500
our ancestors would worship them
as gods because they knew that

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.920
our ancestors didn't know it
was technology.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.330
They thought it was magic,
spirituality, divine

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.670
intervention, which it
never was.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.920
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To the east of
India, near the village of

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.290
Wucheng in the Sichuan province
of China, similar tales of

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.670
flying beasts have also been
found in ancient texts.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:27.420
In the fourth century, historian
Chang Qu reported the discovery

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.670
of what were then called
"dragon bones."

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.420
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: A question occurs as
to whether dragons might

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.620
actually have been actual
dinosaurs that had wings.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.120
I should point out that the
wings would have been lost to

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.500
the fossil record.
We're just recently talking

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.670
about dinosaurs having feathers
and having evolved into birds.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.170
Well, it's possible that some
dinosaurs actually did have

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.620
wings and could be described
as dragons.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.750
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But while most
mainstream scientists believe

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.330
the remains found were most
likely dinosaur fossils, like

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:07.580
those of the flying pterosaur,
ancient astronaut theorists

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:13.330
have another, more provocative
explanation.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.170
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Now a creature which
somehow was able to spit fire

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.290
obviously is not anyplace in the
animal kingdom of today.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.670
So what we have here is either
an invention which did indeed

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.120
spit fire, in which case we're
not confronting a creature here,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.670
but somehow a creation.
Something which was either

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.620
engineered by mankind or which
was engineered by

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.920
extraterrestrials.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Machines that fly

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.000
through the air and spit fire
causing mass destruction,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.580
thousands of casualties and
radioactive fallout.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.330
Could the Garuda, and other
so-called flying dragons, really

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.920
have been ancient versions of
today's high-tech bomber planes?

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.170
Or perhaps something else?
Something even more out

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:14.210
of this world?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In March 2010, a

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.420
panel of 41 international
experts concluded that the

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.120
impact of an asteroid that
smashed into Earth at Mexico's

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.920
Yucatan Peninsula 65 million
years ago probably triggered the

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.120
global climate change that
resulted in the mass extinction

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:37.710
of the Earth's dinosaurs.
But is there also evidence that

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:43.120
some dinosaur species survived?
And if so, might they also

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.960
have evolved?
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: Paleontologists

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.540
tell us that, "Oh, these things
have been extinct for 65 million

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.580
years," yet they still crop up.
And they appear to be

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.960
prehistoric animals, dinosaurs
literally, that have survived

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.880
right down to today.
Much like the coelacanth and

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.920
alligators and sharks and
turtles also have survived from

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.960
those same prehistoric times.
I believe that ancient

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.620
prehistoric monsters are still
living in remote areas of the

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:21.750
world, either in oceans and
lakes or jungle areas today.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the highlands of
Scotland, the legend of the Loch

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.420
Ness monster has long been part
of Celtic and Norse folklore.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.120
Recorded accounts of sightings
can be traced to the year 565,

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.250
to the Irish monk St. Columba;
a powerful leader who founded

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.790
monasteries in both Ireland
and Scotland.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.290
In his journals, Columba wrote
of an encounter with people

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:57.080
bearing a man near the shores of
the now-fabled Loch Ness.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.790
&gt;&gt; MARTELL: They explained to
Father Columba that the man who

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.120
had died had been swimming in
the lake and was attacked by the

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.540
water beast.
Upon hearing this, Father

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.960
Columba sent his own follower
into the lake.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.620
When the beast came after this
man, Father Columba made the

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.620
sign of a cross and commanded
the beast not to harm the man.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:20.120
The beast fled and was never
seen harming another man again.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.540
&gt;&gt; REDFERN: A lot of people
don't realize how big

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.750
Loch Ness is.
It's 23 miles long, a mile wide

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.960
and at its deepest point, it's
about 800 feet.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.040
And the water's very, very dark
and dense.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.960
And so it is the prime location
where conceivably, if they

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.790
didn't need to surface that
often, they would sort of bypass

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.620
detection.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: When we're

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.790
confronted with the Loch Ness
monster, or any kind of

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.620
anomalous creature, the question
really is: where does it come

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.040
from?
Is it a remnant of the dinosaur

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.250
age or is it something which is
out of this world?

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.040
We know that, for example, St.
Columba definitely felt that

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.540
lake was sacred and that there
was something present there

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.540
which had a religious
connotation, which is why he

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.790
went to that place to begin
with.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.920
&gt;&gt; REDFERN: The intriguing
thing is that there actually

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.290
have been a significant number
of UFO sightings over the

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.620
Loch itself.
Of strange, brightly lit objects

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.290
hovering over the water late at
night, which clearly aren't

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.080
helicopters or aircraft or
meteorites or anything like

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.290
that at all.
So in other words, Loch Ness is

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:35.710
a weird and spooky place.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could the so-called

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.620
sea monsters of Loch Ness
possibly be descendants of

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:45.290
ancient dinosaurs?
Or might it be of another,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.790
perhaps, extraterrestrial
origin?

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:53.790
And if so, what might this say
about other mythical sea beasts,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.290
like the seven-headed Sumerian
sea monster the leviathan?

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.620
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: The leviathan is
sometimes described as a serpent

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.250
or a crocodile or a dragon, but
it lurks.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.420
It is the gatekeeper to a portal
to hell.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.920
And this gateway to hell is
apparently deep in the ocean,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.830
and the leviathan is there
forever, lurking.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.710
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Greek myths, the
Hydra was described as an

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.920
ancient sea serpent with
many heads.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.620
It was said to be a descendant
of the Earth goddess Gaia.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.380
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: Hercules was sent to
kill the Hydra, but it was

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.880
terribly difficult.
He would slice off the head,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.540
and two heads would form
And he had to ask help from

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.120
his nephew.
And his nephew had a brilliant

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.540
idea: bring a torch.
Fire might keep the heads

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.540
from forming.
So Hercules would bash off

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.710
one of the heads, and his nephew
would, essentially, cauterize

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.250
the neck so another one
wouldn't form.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.250
And in this way, the Hydra
was finally defeated.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.120
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: In the case of a
Hydra, we have something which

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.540
has several heads which is once
again a category of a creature

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.960
which you would expect
not so see.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.120
So we're either confronted here
with something which was

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.120
genetically engineered or which
genetically went wrong, but

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.540
clearly it was of such
importance that it was adhered

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.790
to in mythology where it
attained a status over the

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.670
years, over the centuries, up
until this moment in time.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.920
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to
Scandinavian legend, the kraken

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.120
are legendary sea monsters
of gargantuan size and are said

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.080
to have roamed the seas off the
coasts of Norway and Iceland.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.790
This fearsome beast was infamous
for its attacks on sailing

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.540
ships.
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: The danger was not

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.960
only being attacked by the
kraken, they would come up to

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.790
the surface, and were enormous;
the size of small islands.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.750
So you could have a collision
with a kraken that wasn't even

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.250
out to attack you.
Another great danger was that if

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.540
it submerged suddenly, it formed
such a great whirlpool that it

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:10.120
could pull a ship under.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could such

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.620
legendary sea monsters have
actually existed?

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.880
Might they have escaped
extinction in the safety of cold

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.040
deep waters?
According to ancient astronaut

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.960
theorists, there is evidence of
the origin of giant sea

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.710
creatures in the sacred texts of
the Hebrew Bible.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.290
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: A very early account
of an encounter with some

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:36.380
kind of monstrous sea creature
is found in the Bible:

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.620
the story of Jonah.
Here Jonah was not fulfilling

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.540
his destiny, and his punishment
was to be thrown off a boat into

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.540
the ocean.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: Jonah is swallowed

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.580
by this giant fish sent by God.
He spends three days and three

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:57.290
nights inside of this giant
fish, and then is spewed out.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.120
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: If Jonah, a human
being, had been swallowed, he

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.290
first of all would have been
ripped up by the creature's

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.420
teeth, then been crushed as it
was swallowed, and perhaps

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.580
stomach acids would have
destroyed his skin and

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.620
internal organs.
So I propose there's no way

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.960
he could have survived being
swallowed by whatever this

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.960
entity was, if it was a fish
or whale.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.420
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: So the question I
have: is this truly a

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.790
description of Jonah being
swallowed up by a

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.790
biological animal?
Because in some references, we

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:35.540
can read that the ribs of that
whale were made out of gleaming

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.120
bronze.
Now, that, to me, is a

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.290
description of some type of
technological device that was

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.790
made of metal.
Jonah was, in fact, not

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:55.290
swallowed by a whale, but by a
USO: an unidentified submersible

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.920
object.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Jonah disappeared

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.420
into an object which was clearly
of a manmade or extraterrestrial

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.380
origin, and which was of such a
specific interest that he not

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.710
only related the story, but that
thousands of years after it

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.750
occurred, we're still talking
about it today.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.750
&gt;&gt; REDFERN: I think we need to
look at stories like this at a

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.120
deeper level.
Not to rule them out just as

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.290
mythology, but to determine if
the people reporting these

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.960
things actually did have real
experiences, but they were just

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.210
trying to incorporate it into
the way they understood the

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.580
world at that time.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could alien beings

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.210
really have lurked beneath the
seas in submersible machines?

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:40.420
If so, why were they there?
Might they have come to share

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.620
advanced technology with humans?
Or did they come for another,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:56.250
perhaps more sinister reason?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Volgograd, State

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:02.580
Medical University, Russia,
1954.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.750
Soviet scientist and organ
transplant pioneer Vladimir

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.580
Demikhov surgically produces
a fully functioning

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.000
two-headed dog.
&gt;&gt; GLENN: What he did was he

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.420
took the upper torso of a dog
and grafted it onto the neck of

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.170
another dog.
And surprisingly, this creature

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:35.580
lived for a few weeks.
Demikhov brought it to medical

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:41.000
shows as evidence that he could
do this, that these sort of

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.330
hybrids, that these sort of
things could be done.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:48.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Although, highly
controversial, the transplant

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.880
pioneer's audacious experiments
paved the way for the first

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.880
human heart transplant in 1967.
But while the image of

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.250
Demikhov's dog is disturbing,
ancient astronaut theorists

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.710
believe our early ancestors also
left behind evidence of equally

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.420
bizarre creatures.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The great thing

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.580
about the ancient alien theory
is the fact that we can compare

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:22.420
modern achievements with stories
from our ancient past.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:29.000
And so if today we're able to
create a two-headed dog with six

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.750
legs, is it possible that a
similar creature existed

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.960
thousands of years ago?
And I say yes.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.750
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the Greek epic
poems of Homer's<i> Odyssey</i> and the

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.750
<i>Iliad,</i> a vicious three-headed
dog named Cerberus guards the

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:56.080
gates of Hades.
According to the myths, Cerberus

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.170
was descended from the Greek
gods Typhon and Echidna.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:07.000
But might the so-called gods
that created the strange beast

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.750
really have been early Earth
visitors misinterpreted as gods,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.040
as ancient alien theorists
believe?

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.420
&gt;&gt; RADER: The humans and gods
were kind of still living among

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.380
one another.
All of this interbreeding, this

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.420
fertility, like, produces, um,
all of these monsters.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.830
And you do not want to meet
these monsters.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.580
These are not the kind of things
you want to encounter.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:36.080
And if one guard dog is
ferocious and terrifying, you

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.420
can imagine three of them, but
all on one body.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.250
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: If Cerberus is a
factual creature, then really

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.750
what we're talking about here is
somebody with the knowledge and

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.250
the technology to create a
multiheaded animal.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.330
And so we are dealing with
extraterrestrial technology.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.080
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Is it possible that
Cerberus and other hybrids, like

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:05.000
the griffon, the Egyptian ammit
or the Greek Chimera, were in

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
fact created through advanced
alien transplant procedures we

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.580
have yet to discover?
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Any civilization

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.830
which has contacted us in the
past or which is contacting us

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.040
today, roughly needs to be at
our level of technological

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.380
advancement.
It's probably going to be a bit

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.250
beyond that.
And that also means that it's

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.880
not just the science of space
travel, but all sciences which

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.750
are going to be somewhat more
advanced.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.880
So we know that the
extraterrestrial who comes to

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.540
Earth from a distant place will
have this medical knowledge.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.540
&gt;&gt; NOORY: There was some kind of
experimentation going on.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.420
Novelty, a zoo.
Let's see what we can do.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.830
We'll play with these creatures.
Let's take this animal and give

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:55.250
him two heads.
Let's take this dragon and give

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.040
him wings.
Let's let him breathe fire.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.040
Let's have some fun.
Maybe that's what they did.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Depictions of
monsters that are half beast,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:13.080
half human can be found dating
as far back as 5000 B.C.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:20.000
The centaur, the Minotaur and
Medusa are all hybrid creatures

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.380
described as being created
by gods.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.750
Researchers point to the origin
stories of these creatures as

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.750
further evidence of alien
contact.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.000
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: In Greek mythology,
the centaur was half human,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.330
half horse.
The torso of the human would be

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.210
joined to a horse at the
shoulders, and this would leave

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:49.580
them in perpetual tension
between the raw animal instinct

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.000
of the horse and the more
civilized morality of human

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.210
consciousness.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: And interestingly

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.580
enough, when we start looking
towards mythology, we actually

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.250
find specifically in the case of
the minotaur, this is said

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:08.080
to have be been done
specifically by the gods.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In India, the epic
text the Mahabharata details the

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:18.670
ancient account of the naga,
a half human, half snake deity.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.500
&gt;&gt; MARTELL: The naga was a
serpent god in both Hindu and

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.000
Buddhist mythology.
It was known to have human and

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.710
serpentlike traits.
It was also known to be

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.670
persecutors of all creatures,
very poisonous and with

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.170
great strength.
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: A question arises as

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.000
to why ETs might create these
various hybrids.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Well, of course, first of all,
I point out scientific

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.210
curiosity.
Once you develop a technology,

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.670
you want to see where you can
take it.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.420
We humans would do that.
I think any intelligent beings

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.420
would.
But they might have created

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.000
these various hybrid creatures
to actually intimidate the

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
existing human populace so that
they would give them no trouble.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.080
Or perhaps to create these
creatures so they would be

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.580
thought of as gods and be
worshipped.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.250
Even though they're advanced
aliens, they might crave

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.080
attention from humans.
&gt;&gt; IMBROGNO: Perhaps they

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.710
wanted some type of slave labor
that would not just be a dumb

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:15.000
animal by adding human
intelligence to, let's say, a

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.040
bull, they could create a
creature that would be able to

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.000
move quite a bit of weight
and work without exhaustion, but

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.170
still have the intelligence
to follow rules.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:34.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 1970, scientists
from Case Western Reserve

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.750
University School of Medicine,
lead by Dr. Robert Jay White,

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:43.000
performed a highly controversial
operation: transplanting the

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.040
head of one monkey onto the body
of another.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.750
&gt;&gt; HAROLD F. YOUNG: He was an
excellent surgeon, superior

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:57.000
technician, and had come to
Cleveland from the Mayo Clinic

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.250
where I think he'd learned
really excellent neurosurgical

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:06.080
care in the operating room.
&gt;&gt; WHITE: When in this room,

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.080
there's a large amount of items
from my dad's original

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.750
laboratory.
This is a halo; a brain

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:15.000
transplant halo device.
It would clamp the brain in here

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.420
as such.
And then they could actually put

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.420
the patient in and complete the
transplant with the body here.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.830
This would hold the brain, the
monkey's brain, and then the

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.750
transplant could occur here,
with the spinal connection and

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.120
the connection to the neck
right here.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.080
&gt;&gt; GLENN: They transferred the
head.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.750
It was essentially a brain
transplant by taking the

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.670
whole head.
He was able to restore

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:50.420
consciousness to the head of the
monkey who had been

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.040
transplanted.
And kept it alive for

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.250
approximately three days.
&gt;&gt; WHITE: The monkey was able to

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.420
open his eyes, he was able to
hear, see and smell.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.250
And as a result, they could show
that this procedure could be

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.170
done, it could work.
&gt;&gt; RUEHL: Even at our stage on

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.750
Earth, we have the ability to
transplant one head onto

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.880
another creature.
Now that certainly argues for

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.330
the possibility that various
entities like the minotaur...

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:25.250
the hydra and even the griffon
could be created by advanced

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:32.080
transplantology.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.000
extraterrestrials visited
Earth in ancient times, might

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.670
the tales and depictions of
weird hybrid monsters

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:45.210
actually provide evidence
of alien contact?

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:49.210
Or do they provide clues to our
own future?

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:53.080
A future that may be closer
than we think.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2003, Chinese
scientist Hui Zhen Sheng, at the

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.000
Shanghai Second Medical
University, successfully fused

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
human cells with rabbit eggs.
The embryos were the first

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.290
human-animal hybrids created
through genetic engineering.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.750
&gt;&gt; ARMSTRONG: She took rabbit
egg cells and removed all of the

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.750
nuclear material from them,
all of the instruction set that

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.620
tells them to develop into
a rabbit embryo.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:40.080
She replaced it with a similar
instruction set, but from

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.960
a human cell.
So essentially, the embryo was

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.620
human with small elements of
rabbit.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.750
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Why would researchers
want to combine rabbit DNA and

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:59.580
human DNA?
The first reason is for medical

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.500
research purposes, perhaps for
organ transplantation.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.500
The second reason is to create
an enhanced human.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.330
That is, give the human some
sort of quality they might not

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.580
have unless spliced with a
rabbit gene.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.960
Although it's hard for me to
imagine... what that would be.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.830
(chuckles)
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A year later, in

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:30.500
2004, researchers at Minnesota's
Mayo Clinic created pigs with

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.500
human blood flowing through
their bodies.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.750
&gt;&gt; REDFERN: One of the animals
that's actually quite close to

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.250
us, surprisingly enough, in
terms of genetics, uh, is the

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.960
pig.
And one of the ideas that's been

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.330
put forward is the idea of
literally having almost, like,

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.500
pig factories to grow hearts for
people who need heart

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.750
transplants, and literally,
you know, you'd have a pig's

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.290
heart inserted into your body.
And, you know, with certain

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.330
drugs to prevent the organs
being rejected, you could live a

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:05.460
full and viable life.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: At this moment in

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.750
time, medical technology is able
to create weird situations--

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:13.000
genetic things which shouldn't
really happen and which do not

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.250
happen unless you start to make
genetic modification.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.580
This is evidence of manipulation
of the genetically available

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.750
material.
We are creating hybrid monsters

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.500
as we speak.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: If modern science

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.330
today would be able to create a
hybrid being, a mixed being,

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:36.790
then that would in essence
corroborate the ancient alien

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.920
theory, because we're merely
saying that what today is being

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.830
discovered is a rediscovery of
what already took place

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:52.710
thousands of years ago...
meaning genetic experimentation.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.620
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But is there any
actual evidence of DNA splicing

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:06.420
in the ancient past?
In 1849, in what is now Iraq,

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.170
British archaeologist Austen
Henry Layard uncovered numerous

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:16.170
Sumerian clay tablets inscribed
with cuneiform script dating to

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:21.170
4000 B.C.
Based on interpretations of the

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:25.750
tablets, ancient astronaut
theorists believe an advanced

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:31.170
race of intelligent beings
arrived on Earth 450,000 years

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:35.750
ago, during the age of
Neanderthals... and through

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.830
genetic engineering, they
created Homo sapiens--

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:45.290
what is commonly referred to as
modern-day human beings.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.750
&gt;&gt; NOORY: The Sumerians talk
about a civilization that came

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:53.080
here from above, on another
planet called Nabiru, and they

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.830
called these creatures the
Annunaki-- high-level people

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:03.170
who came here to mine for gold.
And in order to do it, they

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.170
needed to genetically alter the
species that happened to be on

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.170
the planet at the time.
They created man according to

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.830
the Sumerian texts.
&gt;&gt; ARMSTRONG: It is not

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:21.500
impossible that we exist as the
result of gene manipulation

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.580
experiments.
There are so many stars and

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.170
galaxies out there in space that
it's impossible for a scientist

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.330
such as myself to say that there
are not alien species out there

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.460
who could have visited the Earth
at some point in the distant

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.170
past.
So it is entirely possible that

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:44.500
someone or something could have
come along and manipulated those

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.330
organisms.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: So this inherently

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:53.170
means that if extraterrestrials
tampered with our own DNA, they

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.750
could have also tampered with
animal DNA.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.500
They could have used all sorts
of DNA from every single animal

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.500
on planet Earth.
&gt;&gt; GLENN: The creation of a

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.170
chimeric monster is certainly
something that will probably be

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.170
possible within the next 20 to
30 years.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:20.580
We have the technology now to
create these kinds of chimeras,

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.290
something that might be
perceived as a monster, but what

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:28.330
we don't have right now is the
technology to bring such a

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:32.750
creature to term.
But that's only a matter of

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.750
time.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If the mythical

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.750
monsters of the ancient past
really did exist, what were

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:44.500
they?
Messengers from alien gods?

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.580
Products of genetic
experimentation?

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.330
Biomechanical weapons?
And if they did exist, where is

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:57.330
the physical evidence?
Still buried miles beneath our

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.580
feet?
Or are they, in fact, still out

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.580
there, somewhere, waiting to
return?
