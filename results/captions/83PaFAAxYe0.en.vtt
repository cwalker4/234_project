00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.113
BUT THE VOTE TALLY WAS SO CLOSE
THAT FLORIDA HAS BEGUN AUTOMATIC

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:19.419 align:start position:0%
RECOUNTS IN BOTH THE SENATE AND

HUGE RECOUNT FANS.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.024 align:start position:0%
RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHO
WON.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.793
OF COURSE, THIS IS FLORIDA, SO
ONCE THEY FACTOR THE WRITE-IN

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.362 align:start position:0%
VOTES, WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT
SENATOR GATOR WEARING

THE DOCTOR.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.513 align:start position:0%

YOU'LL WANT TO CALL ALL YOUR

KNOW."

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.623 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.827 align:start position:0%
OF THE RECOUNT.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.695
ONE G.O.P. CONGRESSMAN SAID,
"FOR ALL I KNOW, THEY'RE STILL

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:06.566 align:start position:0%
COUNTING BALLOTS FOR AL GORE

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start position:0%

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.646 align:start position:0%

DESANTIS, IN THAT LARGE NUMBERS

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.354
OF NEW BALLOTS SHOWED UP OUT OF
NOWHERE, AND MANY BALLOTS ARE

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:29.255 align:start position:0%
MISSING OR FORGED.

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.823 align:start position:0%
AN HONEST VOTE COUNT IS NO
LONGER POSSIBLE.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.258 size:84% position:42%
BALLOTS MASSIVELY INFECTED.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:40.299 align:start position:0%
MUST GO WITH ELECTION NIGHT!"
GO WITH ELECTION NIGHT?

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.201 align:start position:0%
( BOOING )
YOU CAN'T JUST PICK THE TIME

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:45.238 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS BEST FOR YOU.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.508
(AS TRUMP): "MY TEAM WAS UP IN
THE SEVENTH INNING, THEN I WENT

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.343 align:start position:0%
TO BED, AND WHEN I WOKE UP, THEY
HAD LOST.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:54.380 align:start position:0%
AN HONEST SCORE IS NO LONGER
POSSIBLE!

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.116 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
MUST GO WITH SEVENTH INNING!"

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.085 align:start position:0%
AND THESE AREN'T VOTES "OUT OF
NOWHERE," THEY'RE ABSENTEE

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.487 align:start position:0%
BALLOTS.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.158 align:start position:0%
IN FACT: FLORIDA ACCEPTS
OVERSEAS AND MILITARY BALLOTS

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
THROUGH NOV. 16, MEANING THAT
TRUMP'S PLAN WOULD

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:11.731
DISENFRANCHISE MILITARY SERVICE
MEMBERS AND AMERICANS ABROAD.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.766 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CELEBRATE
VETERANS DAY BY TAKING AWAY

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.102 align:start position:0%
THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.804 align:start position:0%
YOU CELEBRATE BY POSTING A
PICTURE OF YOUR HOT GRANDPA IN

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:25.178 align:start position:0%
WORLD WAR II ON INSTAGRAM AND
RAKING IN THE LIKES!

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:34.387 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MEANWHILE, IN ARIZONA'S SENATE

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.658
RACE, AFTER TRAILING ON ELECTION
NIGHT, DEMOCRAT KYRSTEN SINEMA

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.594 size:84% position:42%
NOW LEADS REPUBLICAN MARTHA
MCSALLY BY 1.5 PERCENTAGE

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.663 align:start position:0%
POINTS.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:48.301 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ARIZONA HAS A HEATED RACE, BUT

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.702 align:start position:0%
IT'S A DRY HEAT.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:53.172 align:start position:0%
SO, PRETTY COMFORTABLE.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:57.043 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.245 align:start position:0%
BUT UNLIKE FLORIDA, BOTH SIDES
IN THIS ELECTION ARE SAYING

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:04.850
EVERY BALLOT SHOULD BE COUNTED.

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:06.752
IT'S BEEN SLOW BECAUSE 75% OF
THE STATE'S ELECTORATE VOTES BY

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:07.820 align:start position:0%
MAIL.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:09.155 size:81% position:41%
THE OTHER 25% OF ARIZONANS
WHISPER THEIR VOTE INTO A

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.524 align:start position:0%
DREAMCATCHER.

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:19.065 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
   NOW, THERE WAS A BRIEF

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.434
CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHAT TO DO
ABOUT SOME OF THE VOTES BECAUSE

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:26.405 align:start position:0%
SIGNATURES DIDN'T MATCH, BUT A
COURT RESOLVED THE ISSUE.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:29.775 size:75% position:38%
TRUMP STILL FREAKED OUT,
TWEETING, "JUST OUT-- IN

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:33.446
ARIZONA, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.649 align:start position:0%
ELECTORAL CORRUPTION-- CALL FOR
A NEW ELECTION?"

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:37.283 align:start position:0%
SURE.

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.453 align:start position:0%
HOW ABOUT 2016?

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:50.162 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.332 align:start position:0%
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN PARIS THIS
WEEKEND FOR THE 100TH

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:56.502 align:start position:0%
ANNIVERSARY OF ARMISTICE DAY AND
WAS SCHEDULED TO PAY HIS

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:59.238 align:start position:0%
RESPECTS AT A U.S. MILITARY
CEMETERY.

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:03.009
THESE SOLDIERS FOUGHT TIRELESSLY
THROUGH BRUTAL CONDITIONS, SO OF

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.478 align:start position:0%
COURSE, TRUMP CANCELLED HIS TRIP
TO THE CEMETERY DUE TO RAIN.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:08.781
WELL, YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM, HE'S
ONLY GOT ONE UMBRELLA AND HE

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:14.420 align:start position:0%
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING
IT ON THE PLANE.

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:24.230
TRUMP DID ATTEND THE CEREMONIES
YESTERDAY, BUT THE OTHER LEADERS

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:29.035
SAID MEAN THINGS, LIKE FRENCH
PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON:

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:35.308 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; PATRIOTISM IS THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF NATIONALISM.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:40.379 align:start position:0%
NATIONALISM IS A BETRAYAL OF
PATRIOTISM BY SAYING OUR

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:43.549 align:start position:0%
INTERESTS FIRST, WHO CARES ABOUT
THE OTHERS.

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:46.419 size:88% position:44%
WE ERASE WHAT A NATION HOLDS
DEAREST, WHAT GIVES IT LIFE,

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.455 align:start position:0%
WHAT GIVES IT GRACE, AND WHAT IS
ESSENTIAL.

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:51.824 align:start position:0%
IT'S MORAL VALUES.

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:54.960
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: FIRST OF ALL, THESE
FRENCH GUYS SOUND LIKE GIRLS.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.296
SECOND, I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT
THAT A MAN GAVE A SPEECH ABOUT

00:04:57.329 --> 00:05:00.166 align:start position:0%
THE IMPORTANCE OF MORAL VALUES
AND EVERYONE SAYS HE WAS

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.470 size:75% position:38%
INSULTING OUR PRESIDENT.

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:06.605 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT TRUMP DID HAVE ONE ALLY.

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:09.842 size:88% position:44%
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WASN'T AN
ALLY, IT WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.778 align:start position:0%
JUST LOOK AT TRUMP'S FACE WHEN
PUTIN ARRIVED.

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.947 align:start position:0%
SO HAPPY.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.317 align:start position:0%
I CAN JUST IMAGINE THEIR
INNER-MONOLOGUES:

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
(AS MACRON): "I AM LOOKING INTO
THE EYES OF A SOCIOPATH."

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:25.891
(AS MERKEL): "MEIN GOTT, THIS
MONSTER WILL KILL US ALL."

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP): S "MORE THAN A
FEELING S

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:31.130 align:start position:0%
MORE THAN A FEELING
S WHEN I SEE VLADIMIR WALK MY

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:35.101 align:start position:0%
WAY" S
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.769 align:start position:0%
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
