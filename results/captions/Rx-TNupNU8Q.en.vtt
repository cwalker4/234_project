00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
I think one of the the other key psychological concepts that people should focus on more is the idea that you can practice something

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.139
deliberately

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.109
So you have to deliberately practice the weaknesses and make them as strong as you can

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.769
While also practicing your strengths and making those the top of your performance. Most people are too lazy to do that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.219
They just want to practice everything or they don't want to even bother to figure out which piece is the most important

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.480
Everybody welcome to another episode of impact theory our goal with this show and company is to introduce you to the people and ideas that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.779
Will help you actually execute on your dreams. All right

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.910
Today's guest is a former Wall Street lawyer who gave it all up to pursue a life of meaning

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.789
Following his love for learning instead of chasing money

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.560
He co-founded a podcast and Academy called the art of charm back in

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.280
2006 long before podcasting and online courses were a thing and he methodically built it into a

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.069
seven-figure business and one of the most dominant podcasts on iTunes

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.080
Before leaving to start something new his interview show received more than 4 million downloads per month and his new podcast

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.979
Which he just started from scratch recently has already received more than a million downloads in the first three weeks alone

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.298
And it's no surprise giving how hard this guy works and how damn interesting he is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.080
He speaks five languages including Mandarin Chinese and Serbian. He used to run a business giving tours of North Korea

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.250
He's been kidnapped twice on two different continents and in high school

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.639
He was an exchange student in the former Soviet stronghold of East

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.099
Germany his company and interests have led him to study some of the most successful people in the world

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.389
And from that he's created a playbook on social dynamics that has made him one of the most sought-after speakers and coaches in the world

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.180
His work has been presented in Silicon Valley at mega companies such as Google Apple

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.989
Twitter and Square and he's given talks on security social engineering and psychology at places such as blackhat

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.209
Def Con and Harvard Business School

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.889
Additionally Forbes named him one of the 50 best relationship builders

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.839
Anywhere and heat magazine paralleled him to one of the best interviewers in modern era

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.560
so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.330
Please help me in welcoming the former phone hacker. And now host of the Jordan Harbinger show Jordan Harbinger.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.850
I am stoked to have you on the show dude, you are the master of introductions

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.040
I would if I didn't know who you were introducing, I would have been very excited to hear from that person that person

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.749
Yeah, they're gonna be here today. Oh good. I'll stick around exciting what's crazy is

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.979
How many weird things you've done? Yeah, like the the North Korea, that, in my notes

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.570
I literally wrote "what the fuck" like I had to go back and like listen to that again

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.939
I'm like he actually gave tours in North Korea. How does one end up giving tours in North Korea?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.039
That's what my mom wanted to know, too

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.219
Of course. Wait, how does that happen?

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.029
are you sure this is allowed a long time ago when I was in law school a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.220
Friend of mine kept telling me about Turkmenistan and how weird this place was and how they had this crazy dictator

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.649
that was renaming the calendar months and everything and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.139
Built an ice palace in the middle of the desert and I thought what a weird guy. So that's for sure interesting

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.809
But the thing I really want to know is what makes you when your friend goes. Oh, there's an even crazier dictator. What?

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.510
Yes, you've moved towards that. That's a good question

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.010
I think anything that's really esoteric or forbidden was always appealing to me when I was a kid. So you mentioned former phone hacker

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.239
Totally great reference because that was me when I was a kid

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.929
Opening up those green boxes on the side of the road where you needed a special wrench to get it and I thought they don't

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.940
Want people to open this you need a special wrench?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.649
I'm gonna figure out how to open this and I open it and there's all these little screws with wires attached to him and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.929
I see the lineman with his little orange handset clip and alligator clips on there and I went and got

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.480
one of those things and

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.679
Started to play with it in the green box and I was listening to people's phone calls when I was 13

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.900
And I thought this is something I'm not supposed to do that

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.470
Theoretically doesn't hurt anyone. So I like that and

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.269
now as an adult

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.399
I realized that I still have that

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.080
bit of code that says people kind of don't want you to do that and I go

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.299
Oh well in that case, it's more appealing

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.400
So it's a little bit of a rebellious streak

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.369
But I'm more interested to learn wipe people are trying to keep something a secret

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.229
Then I am about breaking the rule itself if that makes sense, totally

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.640
So this whole like lifeless ordinary thing, is that something that you cultivate?

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.920
Intentionally like so I know the story you're a lawyer on Wall Street at the time of the collapse, and so

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.680
It there was a natural out if you wanted to take it

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.059
But I don't feel like you took it because there was a natural out it would have been easy enough for you to do something

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.500
That was still centered around lobby

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.059
You don't you start something that at the time would have been so beyond counterintuitive like in 2006, I'd listened to exactly zero podcast

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.099
Yeah, I don't even know if I'd ever heard the word podcast

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.459
I don't think people listening today really understand like it didn't really exist back then no

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.000
So, how did you.. Why did you get into that?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.070
Right, so in college, I had to outwork everyone which is easy because in college everyone's just drinking partying

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.859
So I out worked everyone that was my competitive advantage

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.110
But then I got to Wall Street and everyone was really hardworking and really smart and I thought okay

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.719
We can all work 20 hours a day seven days a week

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.679
How do I make myself smarter in a timeframe that's short enough for me not to get fired because I had hard core imposter syndrome

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.288
Whereas like they're gonna figure out I don't belong here

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.449
I'm gonna get fired then I'm gonna be out of luck

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:49.119
And I have all this debt from law school. So I decided to work on this sort of secret third path

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.750
which well

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.719
Actually, I wanted to work from home so that nobody could see how much I didn't belong at this Wall Street firm

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.789
There was a partner that always worked from home

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.249
And eventually I caught up with him and I said "hey you're never in the office. Do you just work from home a lot?"

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.269
He actually explained well sometimes but I usually get business

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.090
I generate the business for the firm by creating and maintaining relationships and that was really interesting to me

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.359
So I asked him how that was done and he explained

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.639
Look, I'm friends with these people and they throw us deals and I don't even worry about my billable hours

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:28.749
I just bring in deals and get Commission based on that so I dedicated my life to learning how to create maintain

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.349
Relationships, because that was my only hope that was my secret third path not outwork everyone

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.609
I was already working as hard as I could not try to make myself smarter in some way and

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.399
you're dealing with real natural talent and hard work with some of these other people that were at my level, but

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.949
Nobody was thinking about networking in relationships. We all thought well we stay here long enough

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.460
We put our time in dot dot dot senior associate or partner Country Club network

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.520
That's how that worked in my head at age 25

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.630
That's not how that works. You build that network the entire time

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.679
Deliberately, ideally and then you have those relationships

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.110
That are valued enough to make you a partner or get you to the top of the law game or any game

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.159
So I decided to focus on that thinking if I work on this

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.010
I'll probably have five years before any of my

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:28.449
Colleagues even think about this as a skill set and that time advantage will allow me to master the networking and relationship development skill set

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.890
That I need to not get fired. Maybe make partner stay at the top of the game

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.790
So I focused on that

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.260
Skill set and that was what we were talking about at

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:44.439
Bars, and at meetings and things like that and other people wanted to learn these skills too because they started noticing

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.089
Some of the rewards that were coming from it. I would never wait in line at a bar

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.760
I would never pay for any food or drinks when I went out

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.989
I always seemed to know everyone I was with different friends all the time

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.770
So bartenders doormen everybody knew who I was and that

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.110
Was appealing to younger guys, and girls for that matter, back in college

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.510
But it was really useful in the working world

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.650
So when I finally started to teach these skills on the side

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.169
I was having the same conversation every

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:20.950
night six nights a week because I was going out trying to work on these skills and I started burning those conversations to CDs and

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.580
Eventually a friend of mine said, you know

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:31.600
You might not have to carry a pocket full of crappy burned at home CDs if we can figure out how to distribute these

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.680
mp3 files in another way

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.640
there was no way to do that back then and then we found out about

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.749
Podcasting and at the time there were 800 shows in iTunes

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.070
There are about 350-400,000 now and that's what we did

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.689
we started uploading our conversations to a server and listing them in iTunes and

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:57.100
The first couple days we had 24 downloads and couple of them were from South Africa and that's when the light bulb went off that

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.440
there's something here that

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.100
Nobody's really paying attention to if I can have a conversation

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.000
with my friend in his basement or living room and that

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.579
Can go to South Africa an hour later and someone can email us and say hey, I tried this and it worked

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:19.870
We have a new concept here. Remember YouTube did not exist. I think it was like video Wiz or something, right?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.489
so it was like this small niche nerd community of people that knew about podcasting and

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:30.070
That's what we started building from there, and we just thought this isn't a business. It's a hobby

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.150
we went on with our lives and

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.240
Then one day we checked our numbers months and months or years later and we went this is a real snowball

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.839
There's really an audience here. Now was that when you were still at the law firm or yes?

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.509
yeah, I was working at the law firm and then

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.780
actually sort of moonlighting because a

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:56.740
Couple friends of mine said hey, I'm doing this show on Sirius XM satellite radio a couple blocks from your office

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.279
I don't want to drive up and make it because there's too much traffic

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.759
Can you just do my slot on the show is the guest?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.240
So I show up to Sirius XM satellite radio and I go hey

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.969
I'm here to talk about someone else's book and I get up there and they're like you didn't write the book No

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:18.699
Well, we don't have a guest. What can you talk about body language persuasion influence networking?

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.110
They said great you're on in seven minutes go down that hallway. See you later!

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:28.750
And we went down the hall set in did the did the show and they said you guys did a decent job

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.080
Have you done this before?

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.040
Well, we have this thing called a podcast and the station manager just happened to be listening to that episode of the show

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.300
And he started listening to our podcast and when I emailed him two weeks later he goes

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.339
I love this thing you're doing in your basement

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:48.040
If only you actually had a studio and weren't just talking with a furnace next to you and like noises

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:55.090
so he gave us our own show on Sirius XM satellite radio just to see if we could do it and that's how

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:02.240
The show really started to launch and when did you start thinking about it as a business because I can't think of anything

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.640
Sort of less likely to turn into a business when you're peeling out of your law career

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.560
than that

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.560
Yeah, that's a good question

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.439
the business hobbies shift

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.550
started to happen

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.550
Not because we went alright, there's an audience here. We got to monetize it. That's what people do now

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.850
That are smart and think ahead we were not those people

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:30.569
what we had was a bunch of free content on the podcast and people started writing in and saying hey, you know

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.570
I'm having trouble applying some of this stuff

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:37.290
Can I call you and I thought this is a great way to not have any free time ever

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:43.019
So I said sure but I'm gonna have to charge for it because I don't want to just do free coaching all the time

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:48.720
So this guy said great I'm gonna give you two grand. Can you give me like 20 hours of coaching for that or ten?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.829
And I said sure no problem. What do you do for a living? And he said I'm a mortgage banker. I

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500
Really want to teach this stuff to my team

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:01.770
So he just kept keeping us on retainer and I thought there's real money here and then him and another friend

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.920
we're doing this phone coaching with me during the summer at Law School and

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.710
Another guy said I just want to come and see you do this stuff and I said sure fine he goes

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:15.990
Why don't I give you ... five grand and I'll stay with you for a week? And I thought that's creepy, right?

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.949
That's a little creepy you want to live with me for a week, and he goes look

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.700
I'm a normal guy

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.819
We can talk on the phone for a while so that you know that I'm not a weirdo

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.999
but I know that if I learn from you in person I

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.950
Will figure this stuff out and I thought that's probably a good way to learn this stuff

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.060
So that was our first client he flew in lived with us for a week

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.450
basically paid the rent on our Manhattan apartment for a minute and

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
He just ended up being our first

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.200
training client and

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.140
That was when we went we'll wait a second if people are willing to do this and there's more than one

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:54.030
This could be a business where the business was driven by the demand for the service and the coaching and the knowledge

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.530
It was not okay

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:00.989
We're gonna be life coaches and we're gonna figure out this curriculum and then start cramming it in people's face

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.280
It was the opposite it was here's all this free stuff

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.880
If you can use it cool and that became the foundation of the business

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.480
You said growing up that you were painfully shy. Yes, did you use tactics and techniques to get out of that? And is that

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.600
Sort of what becomes your teaching or how did you get out of that? 
- Great question.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.619
Yes. I definitely use tactics and techniques to get out of that and

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:29.199
And in the beginning you feel like you're faking it, right you feel like all this body language stuff

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:35.859
you're just sort of going through the motions and to an extent you are but once people start treating you differently because you're

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.550
Open positive confident or at least that's your first impression

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.929
You start to realize oh, I'm not being rejected by people at first glance

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.320
You know

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.999
I'm sitting up and I've got a smile on my face and I feel good about what I'm doing and

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:55.089
You start getting attention from people that normally you would think. Oh, I didn't realize this woman

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:57.698
Wanted to date me or this person. wanted to hang out you really

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.089
Don't have yourself esteem matching up with the way people are perceiving you and so there's one way to sort of

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.990
Fix that right. And that's you get pulled in one direction

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:14.349
So if you think you're really great, but people treat you poorly your self-esteem drops, right and you eventually meet that expectation

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.929
but if your self-esteem is sort of shaky like mine was and you're painfully shy but people start treating you like

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.519
You're upright confident positive friendly outgoing you get pulled in that direction

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.839
instead and that

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:28.839
Became a core

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.620
Concept of what I was teaching because I realized wait a minute

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.949
I don't like fake it till you make it but in some respects this really worked for me because I wasn't lying to anybody

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:42.789
I was just acting a little bit more confident than I was and then people went oh

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:49.420
He's comfortable and fun and friendly and I grew into that so I had a core level identity shift

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.289
Into who I was and sure enough people treated me in

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.130
That way and I started to become that way because I realized I had nothing to lose

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.640
So and nothing to fear more importantly, so yeah

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.609
I really used those techniques at first and they were very robotic and then eventually I realized I can take off the

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.839
Scaffolding because I'd become the person who I had been trying to be

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:17.169
Because you're not adding a veneer of falsity to you're not telling fake stories or acting cool or something like that

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:23.889
You're really just being more confident in just for a few moments while people make that first impression of you

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:29.799
They start to treat you differently and you start to act into that and it happens. Naturally. You don't have to force it

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.589
I love the concept that you have about every time you walk through a doorway the doorway concept and

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:41.529
what I love about it is that basically all of this stuff can be practice and once you practice it then it becomes

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:45.488
natural and there's this quote from Bruce Lee which I've always loved which is I

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:53.108
I kick until I don't think kick. I just kick. So what is the doorway principle? And why is it so powerful?

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:56.379
the doorway drill is really potent because

00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:02.019
what this does is it fixes body language in a way that creates a different kind of first impression, so

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:07.658
Essentially, we're making people more confident with a pack of post-it notes. So the way that this works is

00:16:08.209 --> 00:16:13.448
We know our first impressions are made non-verbally and if you don't believe me if you're not sure if this is true

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.399
what you need to do is go walk down the street walk to through them all and your mind will be

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:26.258
Making these little judgments about someone tall person. Scary person cute person small child in fun person. You're making these judgments

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:30.519
Subconsciously all the time, but this is evolved behavior. It doesn't mean you're

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.979
Prejudiced or something like that. This is just what your brain does but what that means is that your first impression is made

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:40.568
Non-verbally those people don't have to talk or tell you something clever

00:16:40.729 --> 00:16:45.278
Or tell you something scary for you to make that judgment about them. You just feel it

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:49.298
So the doorway drill is potent because if we walk through a doorway

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:52.839
Which we do hundreds of times a week dozens and dozens of times a day

00:16:52.839 --> 00:17:00.308
Even if you're just seated in your office, if we reset our body language our nonverbal communication to create a positive first impression

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:04.809
Then we don't have to think about it much anymore because the problem is if you say all right

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.408
Sit up straight have upright open confident positive body language

00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:11.918
Then I go into a meeting or a networking event

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:18.099
And this first thing that happens is I reset to my defaults computer mode, right because I'm not thinking about it anymore

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:25.120
It's a conscious shift in my body language that I will lose control of. So we have to delegate or relegate that

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.729
set of nonverbals to a

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:30.278
subconscious process and the way to do that is

00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:34.929
to practice it and the way to practice it is to remember to practice it in the way to remember to practice it is to

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:39.038
Do it every time you walk through a doorway. So whenever you walk through a doorway

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:44.739
Stand up straight shoulders back chest up chin up smile on your face, and you don't have to Superman it you'll look

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:51.580
You'll look awkward and fake. But if you just have open upright confident positive body language every time you walk through that door

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.290
You will start to do this

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.980
habitually the problem is we tell you this and

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:03.070
the first thing you do is you walk through a door and you forget it instantly because you learned it on impact Theory along with

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:08.470
The million other things and it goes right out the window. So take a pack of post-it notes these little tiny ones

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.389
you don't have to write anything on it stick them up at eye level in the doorframe or in the doorway of

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:19.599
Your office your home wherever you can get away with it. And when you see that you're gonna go why is there a post-it?

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:24.339
Oh right doorway drill up right open positive confident body language now

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:31.059
That over time weeks months whatever it takes you will start to do that every time you walk through a doorway

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.190
the beautiful part of this is our

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.250
First impressions are often made as soon as people see us

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:40.359
And as soon as they see us is usually when we walk into a room through a doorway

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.950
So every time if we're resetting our body language every time we walk through a doorway

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:52.360
We're creating a positive nonverbal first impression every time we enter a room and then we don't have to think about it anymore

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.290
So we can stay present in

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.300
Conversations we can get through what we need to get through in a conversational agenda

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.279
If we have one we can network and meet people and have it look natural and we don't have to think all right

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.649
Oh shoot. You were slouching stand up straight. Oh crap. What was Tom saying? I forgot. Oh no now he knows that I'm lost

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:14.860
Wait a second. I'm slouching again. That's what we're trying to avoid. We just want to make sure our nonverbal first

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:22.269
Impression is good when people start treating us differently because of that first impression, then we start to act differently and we start to become

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:29.109
Essentially a different more confident person because of the way that other people treat us because the way other people treat us

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.840
Informs the way we feel about ourselves and then we don't have to fake it anymore. We don't have to try hard

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.490
We don't have to put on airs, you know respect me. We don't have to do that anymore

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:44.559
We don't have to do that. Now. You said one of the hallmarks of the Jordan Harbinger show is

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:51.340
Takeaways acts, actionable items that people can do and actually implement in their lives

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.889
What are some other psychological principles that you think people are unaware of that have that real actionable core?

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.390
Great, so yeah

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.599
One thing I like to do on the show every show has worksheets so that people can sort of fill out

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.060
what they've learned because I believe that

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.889
Revision and review. I mean look, I'm a nerd like many many people who are listening or watching

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.470
I spent way too much time in school

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.000
So I like to review these things

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.030
But I will tell you I think one of the the other key psychological

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:26.320
Concepts that people should focus on more is not just nonverbal persuasion or communication and things like this

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.109
But the idea that you can practice something

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.930
deliberately

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:34.869
So you have to deliberately practice the weaknesses and make them as strong as you can

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:41.529
While also practicing your strengths and making those the top of your performance. Most people are too lazy to do that

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:48.720
They just want to practice everything or they don't want to even bother to figure out which piece is the most important.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.560
I'm super fanatical about that and I think that that's something that people really

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.950
overlook is in this debate about you know

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:02.590
Do I focus on my strengths or do I focus on my weaknesses and hearing you talk and having done all the research?

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:10.420
One thing that I will say you have an extraordinary ability to learn regardless of what the topic is

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And I find that very interesting

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:20.139
walk me through like how have you learned five languages and not easy languages like Serbian and

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.390
Mandarin Chinese like that's insane

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.930
so

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.409
How do you like what is that process?

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.859
So I'm a big fan of immersion. What's funny is people go? Oh, you must have a knack for languages

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.960
I'm not good at languages and so a question

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.899
I will always ask people who think that they're not good at something is

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.090
How they know that they're not good at it

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.249
and usually the answer has to do with the environment that they learn in or the

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:51.999
Set up their learning process and very rarely with their actual talents. So people will say, oh, I'm not good at languages

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.960
How do you know well I took French in high school and I didn't do well

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.459
Well, I took French in high school and French was my worst subject every language

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.460
I took in middle school in high school was terrible

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.499
I took languages in college a little bit and I was much better at it

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:11.020
but I'll tell you I got really good at languages because when I was a senior in high school

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.449
I moved to Germany as a next student and I got placed in East Germany

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.940
Where they didn't speak English very well and they learned Russian growing up instead of English

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.719
So I was surrounded by German the whole time and I thought I'm in trouble

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.540
I was told everybody kind of speaks English and I could get by and I knew I was gonna have to learn some German

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.149
But I had no idea that it was gonna be the basis for me making friends at all getting by at all

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.050
So I started to realize that German was really hard surprise

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.470
and I took some German classes and I learned a little tiny bit and

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.119
not much and my host parents started to get worried because I wasn't really talking and

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.290
Then one day my host father took me out for a beer and he goes look

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:58.110
You got to learn German because no one can relate to you and you're not getting along with other people because they just see you

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.939
as this weird robotic American guy and then we had another beer and I said

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.800
I just feel lonely and homesick and all this stuff and he goes but German is not that hard we can teach you and

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.910
Then he started teaching me a little

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.969
Here and there and this is three or four months in and then I had another beer and suddenly I could speak German

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.099
And he went wait a minute. You can speak a lot more German than you let on and I just realized at that moment

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.760
I was afraid of making mistakes

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.640
I didn't know how much I knew and that since I'd been immersed in the language for so long

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.400
I actually understood a lot more than I thought. So at that moment, I realized I can learn this

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.650
I just need a different type of learning environment

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.570
I don't learn well by memorizing a verb table that a French teacher gave me and said quiz on Friday

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.850
I learned well by watching a TV

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.609
hanging out with a bunch of kids my own age and

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:50.640
Having them yell things at each other and I hear that over and over and I remembered that that's actually how humans learn language in

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.070
general and I realized

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.570
Immersion is the way to do it

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:00.780
Study with a coach study with a teacher do not try to self teach a lot of people self teach

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.290
It can be great. But you really learn best with a coach for?

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.050
Anything at all? I have interview and broadcast coaches that teach us on the Jordan Harbinger show

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.359
I hire and if you can't find a coach

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.260
Find a coach anyway, you know find someone on CNN and tweet at them and say can I hire you to teach me interview skills?

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.790
Someone will eventually respond to you and that's how I find these types of people

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.060
So I'll immerse myself in something to the point where I can

00:24:27.249 --> 00:24:30.238
Really get any higher on my own and then I will find a coach

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:35.878
Generally to take me to the next level and even that's a mistake honestly some of that is ego

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:38.488
I recommend finding a coach as early as you can

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:44.728
You should find a coach before you try to do anything because otherwise you're just unlearning bad habits that you've self taught

00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:48.929
I want to go back to some of these just said which is really really interesting to

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.239
Basically stalk somebody until you get them to agree to be your coach. Sure

00:24:54.519 --> 00:24:58.769
What does that process look like and and I want to put it in context of when?

00:24:59.229 --> 00:25:02.669
Forbes magazine says that you're one of the best relationship builders

00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:07.498
Anywhere like dude, I will I will just tell everybody right now. How true this is

00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:10.269
out of nowhere

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:14.279
He reaches out to me and was just like hey been watching your show. I think it's fantastic

00:25:14.649 --> 00:25:17.758
Let me know how I can help.
- Did I do that? 
- Yes

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:25.228
I'm glad I follow my own advice. I was like, whoa, like Jorgen Hart Harbinger is like just reach out to me. This is crazy and

00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:30.149
You were like. Oh, I think this person be a good guest this person and we're like, dude

00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:32.728
we've been trying to get them we can't get them and you were like, oh

00:25:32.729 --> 00:25:34.739
let me make an intro and then all of a sudden like

00:25:35.289 --> 00:25:41.309
Like this huge cascade of guests coming on me getting on other people's podcast. It was huge. And I've said

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.899
Privately a thousand times and this is the God's honest truth, dude

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:53.338
nobody outside of this company has had a bigger impact on this company than you
- Really? Wow!
- from out of nowhere and

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:59.488
Your whole thing about you know, give without any expectation of anything in return. You've never asked me for anything ever

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:01.809
I

00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:04.079
Was just totally totally blown away. So

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:09.809
Leveraging like that ability to reach out in a pretty smooth way

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:13.829
Like how do cuz I know people watching this right now, they reach out really clumsily

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:14.769
so

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:17.338
How can they reach out in an intelligent fashion?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.680
To get a hold of somebody that can really be a meaningful mentor a teacher whatever and actually get a yes.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:30.239
Yeah, this is a topic that's very near and dear to my heart as well because I do remember reaching out to you

00:26:30.239 --> 00:26:34.499
I didn't I'm glad to hear I was that impactful and helpful. That's always nice to hear

00:26:35.829 --> 00:26:40.379
What people do wrong when they reach out is they go alright,

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:46.469
Hey Tom, love your show. You should have me on it because I have a new book and you're like

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.379
Oh one of these right? I mean you must get that a

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:50.850
hundred times a day

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:57.389
I know you do because I do all the time and I don't usually mind that but it doesn't work nearly as well

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.879
As a friend reaching out and saying hey, I'm watching a book in a few months would love to do the show also

00:27:02.879 --> 00:27:06.509
Here's a bunch of other things happening. The reason this is important is

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.409
most people don't

00:27:08.409 --> 00:27:09.549
build these relationships

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:14.849
Before they need them and these are the same people that would they obviously have a spare tire in the trunk of their car

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.850
So if they get a flat on the highway

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:19.679
They're taken care of but if they want to build a relationship

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.340
They're not thinking about digging that well before they're thirsty

00:27:23.619 --> 00:27:29.369
So they're only looking at what help they need when they need it and that is a huge mistake

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:35.639
You have to dig the well before you're thirsty and you have to give without the attachment to getting something in return

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:38.309
so when people want to reach out

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.320
Stop thinking about what's in it for you

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.169
Start thinking about only what's in it for other people and if you don't worry about what's in it for you

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.629
You will find opportunities that come later down the line and to sort of illustrate this

00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:56.549
when I moved to LA I had a toothache and it started to get more and more painful and it

00:27:56.619 --> 00:28:00.839
Really was starting to just dig into my brain. I couldn't think I didn't have a car I moved from New York

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.610
This is pre uber I didn't have dental insurance cuz I was 27 and you know

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.269
Who cares about your teeth right you think about those later? Yeah, I'll get new ones

00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:14.008
And so I started to desperately call dentists and they were like look

00:28:14.009 --> 00:28:19.289
I don't take new patients or I can see you in a week. Go to the ER if you have a toothache

00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:25.589
And I'm thinking a week. I haven't slept, you know, this thing is killing me. So I post it on Facebook

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.789
And obviously I didn't have my privacy settings set correctly because of random stranger

00:28:30.129 --> 00:28:32.759
Filled in the comment and said my aunt's a dentist near you

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:35.368
Do you want me to give her a call and I said sure yeah

00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:40.679
So I went to his aunt the next morning before they officially opened got that thing drilled the hell out

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:47.579
Got it filled. She didn't overcharge me. I send this guy message. Thank you so much. He goes, no problem, man

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.470
I don't know what you do

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:54.360
I heard you have some show that my friend likes, but I'm glad you got your tooth taken care

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.070
And I said, let me know if there's anything I can do

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.730
He said well, I'm a graphic designer, but I'm working at a cafe right now as a barista

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:05.099
I would love to just not make another cup of coffee again, and I said well, I don't have any work for you

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.620
But I'll keep my ear to the ground. He said whatever you can do. No problem

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.149
I don't expect you to give me a job. Four days later another entrepreneur friend of mine

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:18.360
She writes me and says my web guys are blowing it. I keep firing them who can create good branding for me

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.529
I said I've never worked with this guy but here's a portfolio. He's a nice person

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.829
That's really all I can say. That guy got a full-time job as far as I know still works there years later

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:36.600
designing websites and templates and themes and branding for this woman's company because he helped me find a dentist on

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.290
Facebook so if he'd been thinking, how do I get a job?

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:47.820
He would never have made that introduction to a dentist because there the connection the nexus is unclear the opportunity lie over the horizon

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.319
But since he was helping without the attachment or expectation of anything in return

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.990
He ended up finding an opportunity through me that I didn't know about and that he didn't know about

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:04.949
But you won't find those unless you were constantly reaching out digging the well before you're thirsty and giving without that

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.580
Expectation of anything in return and last but not least

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.820
People keep score now. And this is bad. Do not keep score and what I mean by that is if you

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:21.420
Interview someone and then you help them you drive them to the airport

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.170
They don't owe you anything

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:30.240
But people in our heads we create these covert contracts and the reason they're called covert contracts is because it exists in my head

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.540
But it doesn't exist in yours

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.930
So we've got this weird agreement where I Drive it at the airport and then I pick you up and I Drive you again

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:41.700
I pick you up and you're like hey Jordan such a good friend. He's always got you know, he's always got time for me

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.470
He wakes up early so he doesn't mind driving me to the airport for my super early flights and in my head I go

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.590
One day I'm gonna make Tom

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:54.449
have me on his show and I'm gonna sell my magical weight loss formula and

00:30:54.610 --> 00:31:00.899
Then one day I pitched this to you and you go. Oh not totally a fit from what we're doing here an impact Theory

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.359
I'll help you in other ways if I can and then in my head I go you son of a bitch, right?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.289
I'm mad at you now because you broke the deal that I created in my head

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:16.919
You broke the comp the contract the covert contract. So I'm starting to be passive-aggressive. I'm angry with you

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:22.949
I can't change my behavior. Even if it's a little subconscious. I'm a little bit colder towards you and our friendship gradually dies

00:31:23.649 --> 00:31:25.539
Why did this happen you?

00:31:25.539 --> 00:31:26.640
Didn't do anything wrong

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:33.509
I created an agreement in my head where you started to owe me something and you didn't reciprocate and that made me angry

00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:36.119
People do this. We do this subconsciously

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.370
We think other people owe us if someone

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.559
Creates opportunities for you you introduce them to a bunch of people you help them out a lot

00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:47.819
That's it. There's no agreement to reciprocate now

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.799
If someone helps you you should reciprocate what you can if someone doesn't reciprocate towards you though

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.870
Do not keep score because you are poisoning all of the relationships that you start

00:31:58.179 --> 00:32:02.249
Because you don't know how that person might be able to help you in the future

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:08.579
You don't want to create a bad reputation for yourself and you will spend years thinking this person

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.429
There are one-sided friend. They're not a friend

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:14.609
This person didn't do this thing for me and years later down the line

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.469
You just have no idea what could have been because you're poisoning all of your own relationships

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:26.100
so the rules are dig the well before you're thirsty, give without the expectation or attachment of getting anything in return and

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:31.979
Do not keep score. And if you do those three things as a matter of habit throughout the next

00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:37.109
Rest of your life, in fact, you will have so much opportunity coming into your life

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.289
You won't have you want to know what to do with yourself, you know?

00:32:40.289 --> 00:32:46.528
I really hope people listen to that and in your life right now is such a reflection of that as you're reinventing

00:32:46.899 --> 00:32:52.289
Yourself and your brand it's been incredible and I want to talk about that

00:32:52.899 --> 00:32:56.849
Reinvention you've been crazy like raw and real and vulnerable about it

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:06.268
So I'm not so interested in the like what happened to the company to necessitate the reinvention

00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:09.239
But how do you conceptualize it? And how do you face those fears?

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.049
so when I left the art of charm and

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:18.089
Suddenly found myself. What I thought was out in the cold. I

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.789
actually was in a

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.939
Position than I thought because I had actually been following my own advice

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.959
Dig the well before you're thirsty give without the expectation of anything in return

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.090
So when I left the art of charm

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:34.470
I actually took the vast majority of the team with me not in some Jerry Maguire moment

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.160
But in a different type of situation everyone always goes Jerry Maguire, not quite

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.759
Unless Rene Zellweger is my producer Jason who doesn't exactly fit fit that mold

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.820
But I left and I went okay guys and girls what are we gonna do right now?

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.450
And the answer from the team unanimously was rebuild

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.260
we already know we want to do we just have to start over and I thought

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:04.920
Easy for you to say I've been doing the other show for 11 years. I built this business over 11 years now

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.100
I've got to start over. This is terrible. What do I do?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:14.039
And so I had a couple of choices early on one was don't tell anyone what happened

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:20.009
make sure that your pride and ego are intact and try to do this with your team or by yourself and

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.329
It's gonna take five plus years because now I know what I'm doing, it won't take 11 years

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:30.569
Maybe it'll take a mere half decade. The other option was you've built a network over 11 years

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.080
You've got a lot of friends. You've got a lot of people that want to support you

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:39.420
Spread the message about what happened. Not in a look what happened to me. It's so sad kind of way

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:42.870
But in a here's my little predicament right now

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.900
What can what ideas would you have and most of the people that I had reached out to who have any sort of?

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:54.180
Platform or anything. We're like, I want to help you. Get back on your feet with the Jordan Harbinger show

00:34:54.370 --> 00:35:01.349
What can we do to make this happen? And so I reached out to dozens and dozens of people that I knew would?

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.879
I'll be honest at first it was like if people start rejecting me

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.729
I'm gonna feel pretty damn bad about this right it's gonna take its gonna knock me down even further

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:16.649
So I picked people like yourself that I knew wouldn't be like you're dead to me click, right?

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.759
So I found a bunch of people that I consider real friends

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.660
and I've reached out to those people yourself included and I went here's what's going on and

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.420
You've been through similar stuff, too

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.610
And so you empathized of course

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:34.949
But also you're in a great position to say like actually we'd love to make this conversation happen. And so

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:40.498
Once the initial first few people had said let's do this. My confidence was bolstered

00:35:40.499 --> 00:35:42.839
I had a lot of great mentorship from

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:49.919
People on my network like Norm Pat is who owns PodcastOne said don't skip a beat do your own show forget about the past?

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:56.970
Just get back on your feet. But if you've got a strong network around you you're good. No, it's incredible. I love that

00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:02.518
You said that it's not just because Jordan is an incredible interviewer

00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:07.499
But I'll say that is part of the equation and how do you think about the very notion of?

00:36:08.019 --> 00:36:11.728
Going into a crowded arena or whatever having to start over

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:17.279
How do you think about being great, how are you approaching your interviews? Sure

00:36:17.279 --> 00:36:21.268
so the one thing that I know that you and I do

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:23.940
Probably more than other interviewers

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:29.339
At least the ones I've spoken to is we do more homework than anyone whenever I interview somebody

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:31.379
I always look for the Tom Bilyeu

00:36:31.569 --> 00:36:35.788
Interview because I know that you read the book you looked at all the videos

00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:40.558
You had people make sure that they weren't on hashtag me too somewhere

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:43.829
Right like you did all the homework for that person

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:44.410
and

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:49.829
I know that your interview is gonna be really good and I too will read the book watch the videos and do everything and I

00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:54.929
Know that we're gonna be able to pull these things out, but the question is that it's a crowded arena

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.319
How are we gonna be great?

00:36:56.319 --> 00:36:56.819
well

00:36:56.819 --> 00:37:02.129
If I'm doing exactly what you're doing, then are either of us great, or am I just copying you?

00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:05.818
So what what I will do is I will always outwork

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:09.508
The next guy and I will do my own

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:15.760
I'll put my own angle on everything just like you do with this like you've got this incredible production

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.560
You've got these incredible interviews. They're always enthusiastic. They're always inspirational your crew around you is is second to none

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.000
What me and my team do is strive for

00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:28.299
similar quality

00:37:28.299 --> 00:37:34.409
Except I will always go for let's say practicals and so I put my own look like unique spin on that

00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:41.459
You've talked pretty openly about some of the anxiety that you've gone through and rebooting the show and the uncertainty

00:37:41.769 --> 00:37:44.549
Financially that comes with building the business from scratch

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:50.130
What techniques have you used actually overcome the anxiety?
- I would love to say

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:55.710
Oh, yeah, I had all this anxiety and then I started using this app and meditating and everything was fine

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.670
That is not what happened. Not at all. What happened was? Yeah

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.420
It was I went from alright, we've got this nice multi seven-figure business

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:09.719
The shows really grace got this huge audience - okie dokie. How are we gonna figure out what to do luckily?

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:16.050
I am a saver. I plan well financially and I I think that that is underrated

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.650
because

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.789
when you have no debt when you have a

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.480
backup

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.440
Set up six months or a year of finances

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.999
Even if you have to downgrade your lifestyle a little bit the level of freedom that you have is enormous

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:36.509
Because when I started asking friends what to do they want. Oh, man, you need to get income you need to do all-in

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.940
There's a list of projects they came up with that are all

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.930
Distractions from rebuilding the Jordan Harbinger show into what it needs to be

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:48.599
It's like you got to go on a speaking tour and you need to write a product and you need to start selling ebooks online

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.940
You need to do that. That would have been fine

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.719
I would have had to do that if I were going broke in a month

00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:00.450
But I wasn't because I had planned for in inevitable situations such as this

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.900
So instead I'm able to spend the next year and change

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.270
focusing on what's really gonna matter in five years and not trying to figure out how to keep the lights on and

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.319
Keep people paid and keep myself in with a roof over my head

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.880
so I think it's really important to make sure that you

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.759
It sounds cliche as I suppose again

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.200
But if you dig the well before you're thirsty financially you'll be ok later as well

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.780
if

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:31.620
you just assume everything is gonna work out or that you can figure out how to get income when you need it because many of

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:37.200
Us are crafty and smart. That's fine, but I don't want to spend time trying to make

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.870
Short-term money when I have a long-term goal

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:46.469
So first of all plan ahead if you find yourself unable to do so because you're in this situation now

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.050
And you did not plan ahead. Okay, all is not lost

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.060
What I would say is the anxiety that I had that I still have

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:59.819
Sometimes you have to zoom out far enough on the timeline and that sort of cures all and here's what I mean by that

00:40:00.339 --> 00:40:02.339
Effective I guess is what people would call it

00:40:02.749 --> 00:40:09.159
What I've been doing is zooming out far enough on the time line in thinking. Okay, is this gonna matter in a week?

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.289
Maybe is it gonna matter in a month?

00:40:11.289 --> 00:40:18.339
Probably not. It's hard to take comfort in that when that week. You feel crushed that in a year

00:40:18.339 --> 00:40:19.309
You're gonna feel better

00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:25.028
But if you put yourself in that situation where you're zooming out far enough on the timeline your own timeline

00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:32.949
You realize huh? Has anyone ever stolen from me before sure what are they doing now? Doesn't matter how often you think about it

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.729
Never how did you feel in that moment? Pretty much like you do now, okay

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:41.829
So that I have been through things like this before. Yeah, and you survived. Well, not only that

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:49.209
Thrived great, but I still feel bad right now. You're allowed to just realize that every second you spend feeling

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.219
sorry for yourself is a total waste of time and

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:57.849
Set a timer if you need to on your fancy Apple watch and give yourself time to have your temper tantrum

00:40:57.849 --> 00:40:59.599
Call your mom and cry

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:05.379
go take a nap whatever you need to do and then put your pants back on your britches back up and

00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:09.159
Get back to work. The one thing that made me feel better

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.719
Was getting back to work because I had all this anxiety

00:41:13.969 --> 00:41:17.139
Which was energy I had that I didn't know what to do with I

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:22.359
Was running around like a chicken with my head cut off and I spent a lot of it just whining or being like I can't

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:25.419
Do this. I don't know how to do this. None of that was helpful

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:31.569
But when I called my team and called my network my podcast network and they said don't skip a beat

00:41:31.569 --> 00:41:34.298
Just get back to work and produce the Jordan Harbinger show

00:41:34.519 --> 00:41:39.998
Stop whining about what happened to your last one and your last business when I got back in the studio

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:42.579
And I started moving forward again. I realized a

00:41:43.249 --> 00:41:46.179
Lot of the anxiety was this energy had no place to go

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.289
It was like a blender that you left the top off of and it's shooting all over your kitchen. I

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:56.919
Needed to focus this in one direction. And so when I focused that energy into producing a great show

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.719
rebuilding my business

00:41:58.719 --> 00:42:04.599
I started to feel better again because if you're doing everything you freakin can to get back on your feet

00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:09.039
Then when you go to bed at night, you don't think how am I gonna do this?

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:13.838
You realize you're gonna do this one day at a time one step at a time one brick at a time

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.879
Along those lines you wrote a really cool article recently and the key takeaway for me was

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:26.599
Action and suffering. Yes. I thought that was really cool. That was an accidental find right?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:32.750
I didn't think I've got to take action and end the suffering. I've got to direct my energy in one direction

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.520
It was kind of like, okay

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:40.550
Am I gonna try to sleep all day or be depressed or be angry or am I just gonna get back to work?

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.339
that that was my choice at the end and

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:48.199
I feel like a lot of us have those choices the action ended the suffering in many ways

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.300
But I didn't expect that to be the result

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:56.599
I really thought I was just gonna distract myself and that was the initial plan just distract yourself with work

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.609
But what I didn't realize was the work wasn't just going to distract me

00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:06.469
it was gonna take all of that drama and pack it into a neat little ball put it in a drawer and not worry about

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.990
it anymore because I had a bigger mission and

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:15.349
Part of that was the audience the Jordan Harbinger Show audience. There were people going where's the show and

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:21.379
the answer was it's it's on the way I didn't miss one episode of

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:26.239
The show when I left the art of charm it ended on a Thursday

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.909
I would have had to release an episode on Tuesday

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:33.500
But I wasn't a part of the company anymore. The first episode of the Jordan Harbinger show came out that following Tuesday 
- Wow

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.849
I called a friend Mark Geragos, who's was Michael Jackson's lawyer and stuff

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:42.949
And I said, what do you do on a Saturday? And he said I'm really busy because I'm a really a

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:51.230
Million clients and I said great 11:00 a.m. Works fine for me. Okay, and he did the show and we launched it right then and

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:54.199
People who were with us early went. Oh my gosh

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.399
You don't even have a website and I said it's coming. But the first episode of the show is out

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:03.589
Action ends suffering not gonna be universally true for every type of suffering

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:09.859
It might only alleviate some of it but we see this pattern in people. We see the person who's

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.050
Lost a child in a shooting or something and is now speaking about it

00:44:15.089 --> 00:44:21.169
We see people who have undergone great tragedy and now run a charity that helps people who've been victims of similar

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:24.799
Situations or of different situations that action helps them

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:29.059
Eliminate or mitigate their suffering and so this was an accidental discovery

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:35.629
For me so I can't take credit for it. But what I can say is if you find that you are suffering right now

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:41.839
Try taking action instead of taking a bath in that suffering and I know it's easier said that done trust me

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:44.538
I know that but trust me that this works as well

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:46.769
so powerful

00:44:46.769 --> 00:44:51.169
All right before I asked my last question tell these guys where they can find you and the new show

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.279
Sure. Sure

00:44:52.279 --> 00:44:59.479
so
You are either watching this or listening to a podcast version right now search for the Jordan Harbinger show in your podcast app or iTunes

00:44:59.549 --> 00:45:03.799
we do have some clips that take place in the YouTube sphere but

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.460
Really?

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:12.289
I would love if people would find me and listen to the show because I will make damn sure that every minute of your time

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.839
Your ear your ear balls your share of ear, whatever we want to call that has been earned

00:45:18.029 --> 00:45:23.029
I will earn every moment of your attention on the Jordan Harbinger show. That is my promise to you

00:45:23.029 --> 00:45:25.488
So give us a shot and let me know what you think

00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:29.748
Yeah, and I will just say that I think it's even better than what you were doing on the art of charm

00:45:29.749 --> 00:45:33.199
I think you broaden things out a lot more. I think the interviews are more deft

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.899
Really I'm super stoked on this thing. It's absolutely fantastic. Thank you, brother. All right

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.049
My final question is what's the impact that you want to have on the world?

00:45:42.049 --> 00:45:48.829
I want to make sure that people get tools to improve their lives on a regular basis that they can improve

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.499
incrementally every single time they listen, so

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:56.538
every episode of the show you learn something you put it in you like those little

00:45:57.299 --> 00:46:02.809
one-piece Legos those little 1es you just stack them up and eventually if you get enough of those you could build a castle that

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.519
Is what I'm trying to deliver because I think that as busy as people are

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.939
Even though the smartest of us are always trying to learn it's hard to read a book or two every week

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.579
It's hard

00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:20.959
to make sure we're moving forward and learning when we're trying to build our own business or keep a career or manage a family so

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.539
I want to deliver this knowledge and this value in a way that people can get at the gym in the car, etc

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:32.689
And then take those little tiny one-piece Legos and after a couple of months or a couple years they go. I

00:46:33.299 --> 00:46:35.719
Built a freaking castle. Thank you

00:46:36.089 --> 00:46:41.819
That is what I want to do is make it bite-sized enough that anyone and everyone can do it in makes their life better

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:45.209
Very similar to what you're doing here. I think thank you man

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.689
Great answer. Thank you so much for being on the Thursday

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:55.019
All right, guys, I'm telling you. There's a reason he's considered the godfather of podcasting

00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:00.150
This guy takes greatness to a whole new level and I'm telling you that behind the scenes

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.799
Everything that he's talking about on camera and on the podcast he's doing in real life

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.939
I cannot emphasize enough how excited I was to bring him on the show because I

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:14.400
Wanted to do something nice for him because he had done so much for me. So not only did

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:21.929
I think he'd be an amazing guest but that sense of really building real friendships nurturing them making sure that they're

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:26.519
Blossoming of their own accord and never literally you can feel it and everything he does

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.679
He's never worrying about what the payoff is gonna be and that is how you get a payoff

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.909
and you know me I'm a big believer in holding to competing ideas in your head and

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.659
He is the master at this he knows that that's a good strategy

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:44.400
he knows that and yet he can approach you with such authenticity and

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:50.999
Give you those Legos whether those Legos are a piece of information whether they are a connection

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.199
He is doing that better than

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.469
Anyone, I think I've ever met in my entire

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.870
Life it is absolutely extraordinary. There is much for me to learn from this man

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:04.870
He is

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:11.429
Whenever possible one of the first videos I go to research somebody that we have coming on the show because he gets absolutely amazing stuff

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.760
go watch his show subscribe to the Jordan Harbinger show and

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.929
Look at how he approached his life without a sense of scarcity

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.720
He's the dominant force and yet he reached out to me to find out how he could help that is so beautiful. And so

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.740
Inspiring and it's just incredible and as something I think that we can all learn

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:35.520
So if you haven't already be sure to subscribe and until next time my friends be legendary. Take care

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.380
