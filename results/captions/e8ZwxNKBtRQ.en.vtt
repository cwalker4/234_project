00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:03.725
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:04.893
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES NOW

00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:06.394
CHARGING DOZENS OF WEALTHY

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:08.363
PARENTS ARE BRIBERY AND FRAUD

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:10.232
FOR ALLEGEDLY BUYING THEIR

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.666
CHILDREN ADMISSION TO ELITE

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.301
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:16.371
AMONG THOSE NAMED TV ACTRESSES

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:19.141
FELICITY HUFFMAN AND LORI

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:19.508
LOUGHLIN.

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.776
THE F.B.I. BREAKING THE CASE

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:22.644
YESTERDAY DURING OUR PROGRAM

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:23.445
AFTER A MASSIVE NATIONWIDE

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.515
INVESTIGATION.

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:28.150
&gt;&gt; MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS NOT

00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:29.117
A CASE WHERE PARENTS WERE

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.219
ACTING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.686
THEIR CHILDREN.

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:34.523
THIS IS A CASE WHERE THEY

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.691
FLAUNTED THEIR WEALTH, SPARING

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:38.794
NO EXPENSE TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.061
SO THEY COULD SET THEIR

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:42.831
CHILDREN UP FOR SUCCESS WITH

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.733
THE BEST EDUCATION MONEY COULD

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:45.867
BUY LITERALLY.

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.969
&gt;&gt; Bill: DR. WILLIAM BENNETT

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.137
FORMER SECRETARY OF EDUCATION,

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:52.374
HOST OF THE WISE GUYS ON FOX

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:53.542
NATION AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:55.210
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK.

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:57.079
THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING OUR

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.479
INVITATION.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.081
ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS YOU'RE

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.816
MAKING HERE, BILL, IS HOW MUCH

00:01:00.817 --> 00:01:01.750
INTEREST THIS STORY HAS

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:02.217
CAPTURED.

00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:05.020
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.622
&gt;&gt; EVEN BIGGER THAN THE ODELL

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:08.623
BECKHAM STORY, BILL, AT LEAST

00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:09.024
TO ME.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:12.361
I THINK TO YOU AS WELL.

00:01:12.362 --> 00:01:13.295
BUT SERIOUSLY, THE MOST

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:14.229
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.931
STORY IS THE INTEREST IT IS

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:16.331
GENERATING.

00:01:16.332 --> 00:01:18.233
HOW BIG IT IS AND HOW MUCH IT

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:19.868
MATTERS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.170
YOU STEP BACK AND WONDER WHY,

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.338
BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW IN THEIR

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:26.408
HEARTS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.542
RESOURCES HAVE ADVANTAGES.

00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:29.044
THAT'S WHAT RESOURCES MEANS,

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:29.945
YOU HAVE ADVANTAGES.

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:32.080
IN THE CASE OF THEIR KIDS THEY

00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:33.715
CAN MOVE IF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.083
AREN'T GOOD TO AN AREA WHERE

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:36.985
THE SCHOOLS ARE GOOD OR THEY

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:40.122
CAN BUY A PRIVATE SCHOOL

00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:41.356
EDUCATION, TUTORS, SUMMER

00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:42.557
PROGRAMS TO ENRICH THAT RESUME.

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:45.127
BUT I THINK WHAT SHOCKED PEOPLE

00:01:45.128 --> 00:01:46.962
HERE WAS THE OUTRIGHT FRAUD,

00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:48.163
THE CHEATING, THE DEGREE TO

00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:50.932
WHICH PEOPLE WILL GO TO ADVANCE

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.134
THEIR CHILDREN'S INTEREST AND

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.703
THAT'S RIGGING THE SYSTEM AND

00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:55.504
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REACT

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.673
VISCERALLY TO THAT AND THEY'RE

00:01:58.674 --> 00:02:00.609
CORRECT TO REACT VISCERALLY TO

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.909
THAT.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.944
&gt;&gt; Sandra: YOU WONDER IF IT'S

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:05.747
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, THE

00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:07.916
U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE AND IRS

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:09.351
MADE THIS OFFICE YESTERDAY SAID

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:10.285
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING INTO

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:11.920
OTHER PARENTS WHO HAVE DONE

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:14.856
THIS, OTHER COACHES AND

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:15.691
UNIVERSITIES THAT THIS DOES

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:16.725
EFFECT.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.393
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE HOLLYWOOD

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:20.262
DIMENSION, WHICH HELPS WITH THE

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:20.629
HEADLINES.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.499
BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT SOME CEOs,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.667
SOME VERY ESTABLISHED PEOPLE

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:28.537
WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS.

00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:30.072
AND AGAIN, REMEMBER, I WAS

00:02:30.073 --> 00:02:31.139
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION AND I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.242
DID A RADIO SHOW AND I DO A

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:33.942
PODCAST NOW.

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:36.512
THE THING I GET CALLS FROM AND

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:38.847
NOTES FROM THE MOST IS FROM

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:39.782
PARENTS SEEKING ADVICE ABOUT

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:41.884
THEIR KIDS' COLLEGE.

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:44.787
WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE, WHERE

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:49.792
SHOULD SHE GO, WHERE SHOULD HE

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:50.092
APPLY?

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:51.860
TO AMERICANS COLLEGE IS THE WAY

00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.328
UP.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.962
THE WAY TO UPWARD MOBILITY TO

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:54.663
SUCCEED.

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:55.898
TO THINK THAT THE SYSTEM IS

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.700
BEING GAMED TO THIS DEGREE I

00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:59.134
THINK REALLY SHOCKS AND

00:02:59.135 --> 00:02:59.835
DISTURBS PEOPLE.

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:04.139
I HAVE TO SAY BASED ON THE

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.674
EVIDENCE, I THINK I KNOW THIS

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:09.445
PRETTY WELL, IT IS NOT THE MOST

00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:10.613
IMPORTANT CHOICE -- MOST

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:12.014
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN A PERSON'S

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:12.348
SUCCESS.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.751
IT HAS TO DO MORE WITH THE

00:03:15.752 --> 00:03:16.219
PERSONS ABILITY.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.523
THE S.A.T. SCORES ARE A BETTER

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:22.358
PREDICTOR THAN WHERE YOU GO TO

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:22.859
COLLEGE.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.994
FACTORS OF GRIT AND

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:25.428
DETERMINATION.

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.096
YOUR ABILITY TO SET A TASK FOR

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:27.463
YOURSELF.

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:28.765
THESE ARE MORE IMPORTANT.

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:30.600
BUT A FACT IS A FACT.

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:32.702
THE FACT IS AMERICANS CARE

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:33.636
DEEPLY ABOUT WHERE THEIR KIDS

00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:34.604
GO TO SCHOOL.

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:37.607
&gt;&gt; Bill: ONE THING THAT STRIKES

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:38.108
ME.

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.443
THIS WORLD IS FAUX FOR SO MANY.

00:03:40.444 --> 00:03:43.279
YOU CAN MAKE IT SO BASED ON

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.680
TECHNOLOGY.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.582
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SOME OF

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:46.783
THESE HEAD SHOTS WERE PHOTO

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:48.885
SHOPPED ONTO THE BODY OF OTHER

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:50.053
YOUNG ATHLETES AND THEY WOULD

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:51.454
USE THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:56.593
PITCH THAT THEY SHOULD BE ON

00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:59.095
THE ROWING TEAM OR WHICHEVER

00:03:59.096 --> 00:03:59.696
AVENUE THEY CHOSE.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:01.898
YOU THINK A LOT ABOUT THE

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.533
MILLENNIAL GENERATION AND THE

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.467
TECHNOLOGY THAT COLLIDES IN

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:07.137
THEIR LIFE ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:04:07.138 --> 00:04:09.139
YOU CAN LIVE A LIFE THAT'S OF

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.542
YOUR OWN MAKING AND IT IS ALL

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:12.876
ONLINE.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:13.943
&gt;&gt; ENTIRELY FALSE.

00:04:13.944 --> 00:04:15.345
&gt;&gt; AND IT'S PHONY.

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.914
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.816
HERE THE SYSTEM WAS USED, GAMED

00:04:19.817 --> 00:04:21.918
BY THIS MR. SINGER, THE GUY WHO

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.852
FINALLY WENT STATE'S EVIDENCE

00:04:22.853 --> 00:04:24.554
HERE WHO WENT TO PARENTS AND

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.490
SAID I'LL DO THIS.

00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:28.892
AND WHAT DO PARENTS SAY.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.293
THIS GUY SAYS WE'LL PUT YOUR

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.262
CHILD'S HEAD ON A WATER POLO

00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:34.130
PLAYER EVEN THOUGH THE CHILD

00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:35.765
HAS NEVER SEEN A WATER POLO

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:37.867
GAME BUT THAT WILL GET THE

00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:39.803
CHILD INTO STANFORD.

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:41.671
IT IS ENTIRELY CYNICAL AND VERY

00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:43.206
DISCOURAGING TO A LOT OF FOLKS.

00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:44.841
YES, THERE WILL BE MORE.

00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:45.675
SUSAN IS RIGHT.

00:04:45.676 --> 00:04:47.077
THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.711
INVOLVED AND I THINK WE'LL HEAR

00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:49.446
MORE ABOUT THIS.

00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:51.515
THE OTHER THING IS IF I CAN FOR

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:54.051
A SECOND, THIS PLAYS INTO A

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:55.919
DEEP WORRY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.554
HAVE, I SHARE THAT WORRY.

00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.189
WE SEE IT IN POLITICS.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.225
THIS WAS APPEALED TO BY DONALD

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:02.760
TRUMP AND BERNIE SANDERS.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.027
IS THE SYSTEM RIGGED?

00:05:04.028 --> 00:05:05.796
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN DONALD

00:05:05.797 --> 00:05:09.266
TRUMP SAID IS THE SYSTEM RIGGED?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.901
BERNIE SANDERS ASKED THE SAME

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:11.268
QUESTION.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.237
IN HIS CASE IT WAS RIGHT.

00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:17.441
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.343
ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:19.810
NO PRIVILEGE.

00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:20.577
BILL CLINTON, WORK HARD AND

00:05:20.578 --> 00:05:21.712
PLAY BY THE RULES.

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:22.646
THIS IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF

00:05:22.647 --> 00:05:24.047
THE RULES AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY

00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:24.982
MAD ABOUT IT.

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:26.150
&gt;&gt; Sandra: REALLY MAD ABOUT IT

00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:28.252
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:29.186
WHETHER IN YOUR OWN

00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:31.622
NEIGHBORHOOD OR AT WORK AND

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:33.023
TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO SITS BY

00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:34.859
AND YOU WORK CLOSELY WITH.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.527
PARENTS ARE STRESSED TO THE

00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:37.695
NINES WHEN THEY'VE GOT KIDS

00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:39.096
THAT AGE OR HIGH SCHOOL WHERE

00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:41.098
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THEM INTO

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.366
THESE COLLEGES, BILL, AND IT IS

00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:45.703
A STRESSFUL SITUATION AND THE

00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:46.804
PARENTS AND THE KIDS.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.672
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:05:48.673 --> 00:05:50.574
WORKING NIGHT AND DAY TO TRY TO

00:05:50.575 --> 00:05:53.844
GET THEIR KIDS TO THESE SCHOOLS.

00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:57.481
CARROLL ROSS PENNED A PIECE.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.284
COLLEGE CHEATING SCANDAL SHOULD

00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:01.452
MAKE BLUE COLLAR FAMILIES

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:03.521
ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS.

00:06:03.522 --> 00:06:05.156
THIS HAS MADE EVERYBODY REALIZE

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:08.893
THAT IF SYSTEM IS AND CAN BE

00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:09.360
RIGGED.

00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:10.861
&gt;&gt; CAN BE RIGGED AND THE

00:06:10.862 --> 00:06:12.463
OBSESSION OF PARENTS FNLTS WE

00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:13.865
LIVE IN A COMFORTABLE

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:16.234
NEIGHBORHOOD IN A D.C. SUB URDS.

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:18.336
I REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT A

00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:20.471
