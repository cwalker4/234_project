MITT ROMNEY: Drug trafficking.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.020
That's one more of those
areas of concern.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.680
It's time for the United States
of America to take

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.590
responsibility for the pain and
suffering and torture and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.090
murder that's going on
throughout Latin America.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.970
SHANE SMITH: Maybe one of the
reasons that Mitt Romney is so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.760
concerned with the drug wars
taking place just south of the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.500
American border is that it
affects him and his family

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.320
personally.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010
Hi, I'm Shane Smith and we're
here at the Vice headquarters

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.180
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.120
Now, Williamsburg is ground
zero for hipsters.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.900
Which means it's also ground
zero for partying.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.080
Which means it's ground
zero for cocaine.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.870
Now, Vice has talked a lot about
cocaine over the years.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.750
In fact, one of our magazine
covers featured a mirror with

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.360
a big line of coke
chopped up on it.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.780
But recently, we followed a
story that made us think twice

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.060
about our historical fascination
with coke.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.800
And it has to do
with Mormons--

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.600
as in Mitt Romney's family-type
Mormons--

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.480
Mexican drug cartels, polygamy,
kidnapping, cocaine,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.540
and finally, murder.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.500
Now, it's a freaky,
freaky story.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.180
And it's taking place just
south of the US border.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.310
So we went to check it
out firsthand to see

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.560
what's going on.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.568
We just passed through from El
Paso, in Texas, which is

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.550
actually one of the safest
cities in America, into

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.560
Juarez, Mexico, which is
actually one of the most

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.000
dangerous cities in the world.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.060
In fact, it's the most dangerous
city in the world

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.290
for journalists.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.990
And we're driving with the
camera rolling, which is, in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.870
retrospect, very
fucking stupid.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.551
People always ask me what the
most dangerous place I've ever

00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:44.340
been to is.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.270
And when I say Mexico, they're
a bit flummoxed.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.330
And they say, Mexico,
I've been to Mexico.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.300
I've been to Cancun, Joe's
Tequila Foam Party

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.630
and Boom Boom Room.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.310
But this Mexico, here in Juarez,
is the Mexico run by

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.190
the narco lords.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.810
They don't care about what
you're shooting.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.960
They don't walk up and say, hey,
what's that camera for?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200
They just see a camera and
go, that can't be good.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.710
And bam.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.320
Now, the drug lords that rule
northern Mexico are like most

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.255
mafia around the world.

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:10.199
They're very wealthy, and
they're insanely ruthless.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.520
But the thing that sets the
Mexican cartels apart from the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.205
other mobs is their seemingly
profound love of murder.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.010
They put other crime syndicates
to shame with the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.950
sheer scale of their killing,
not to mention the gruesome,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.810
eye-catching way they present
their murders, with a kind of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.060
evil inventiveness.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.660
And it's not just traditional
gang-on-gang violence, either.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.860
The cartels kill anyone and
everyone in their way.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.200
Rivals, witnesses, journalists,
politicians, and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140
police are all targets.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.610
And rather than hiding the
bodies like most criminals,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.730
they actually want
you to see them.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.040
And they want you to know
exactly who did it.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.600
In fact, the war on drugs in
Mexico is so violent that its

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.390
body count is almost 10 times
that of American soldiers

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.750
killed in the real wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.080
And in a country where it's
supposedly illegal to own

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.140
guns, the narcos are armed
to the teeth with

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.350
state-of-the-art weaponry, 90%
of which are smuggled in from

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.660
the United States, which is
something we got to see

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.880
firsthand as soon as we
arrived in Juarez.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:29.480
FORENSICS DEPARTMENT HEAD:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.160
SHANE SMITH: We came in here,
and we saw this huge bunker.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.570
And we're like, oh, this is
where they hold all the guns

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.980
and all the drugs and
everything, in this big,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.190
massive concrete bunker.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.940
And they're like, no, no.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.090
The drugs and the guns are
here in the trucks.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.925
That's a nightclub called
The Sphinx.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.840
So last night, the police caught
these guys trying to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.510
smuggle in 268,000 rounds of
ammunition in a truck with

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.660
Oklahoma plates.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.590
It was driven by a
guy from Dallas.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.120
Over a quarter of a million
rounds of ammunition.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.580
This is the kind of firepower
that they have.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.250
This is a 30-caliber Browning,
which shoots super fast and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.630
can shoot through
armored cars.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.970
And then they have this
antiaircraft .50 cal.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.020
Can I pick it up?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.770
SHANE SMITH: Shit, I did.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.990
I put my finger on it.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.730
I'm going to get in trouble.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.020
They just confiscated
these weapons, and I

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.640
touched the .50 cal.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.150
And they haven't dusted
them for prints yet.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.590
So now my prints are
on a murder weapon.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.039
Not good.

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:44.200
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.110
SHANE SMITH: These look like
they're from America.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.595
America America, America.

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:48.910
All the guns are from America.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.210
They're all homicides
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.530
They've tested them out?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.820
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.405
SHANE SMITH: Oh, sorry.

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:59.265
[GUNSHOTS]

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.590
SHANE SMITH: That was loud.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.290
It smells very strong.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.170
Holy Jesus.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.150
I knows this doesn't look like
crazy, but you can smell, wow.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.060
It's a lot of drugs.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.860
Drugs and flak jackets.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.210
So this is sort of a rustic
type of smuggling called a

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.585
burrero, which is
like a donkey.

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:18.910
And they just walk through
the desert with the

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.530
pot on their back.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.920
So the market for the
drugs is America.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.020
The market for the weapons
is here in Mexico.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.520
And they go like this.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.150
But when you look at this-- like
.50 cals, assault rifles,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.190
military-grade machine guns--

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.450
you realize, OK, how do the
police fight them, let alone

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.260
regular people, let alone
Mormons, who aren't

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.835
allowed to own guns?

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:43.085
It's crazy.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.040
So we're about 200 miles south
of Juarez now, and we're out

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.490
in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.470
This is the narco
superhighway.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.130
There's actually 300 different
smuggling trails

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.930
right through here.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.150
There's no big wall
or anything.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.430
You can just walk off into
the desert with your

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.700
pack full of cocaine.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.700
And then all of a sudden,
coke's in Williamsburg.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.170
And hipsters are doing coke.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.730
As you're out here, it kind of
dawns on you that there's

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.480
nowhere to go.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.760
Like if something happens, or
if someone even chases us,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.340
where are we going to run to?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.135
Because you can't trust
the police.

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:18.260
You especially can't trust the
local police because they're

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.290
all corrupt.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.380
So basically right now, it's a
straight shot to the Mormons,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.050
their guns, and their God.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.330
MITT ROMNEY: My dad had been
born in Mexico, and his family

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.440
had to leave during the
Mexican revolution.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.700
He had big dreams.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.910
We were Mormons.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.540
And growing up in Michigan, that
might have seemed unusual

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.400
or out of place.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.020
But I really don't remember
it that way.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.660
My friends cared more about what
sports teams we followed

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.130
than what church we went to.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.360
SHANE SMITH: So we're on our
way down here to colonial

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.630
Juarez, which is in northern
Mexico, in Chihuahua state.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.250
A lot of people may know that
Romney and his family are

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.270
actually from here.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.310
His father was actually born
here in a Mormon colony.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.730
But maybe what they don't know
is that these Mormon colonies

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.160
are still here, and they're
actually fighting the narco

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.150
cartels, the drug cartels, that
run this whole region.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.440
They're standing up, and
they're fighting the

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.390
kidnapping and the violence
and the crime.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.100
So the question is, what are
the Mormons doing down in

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.990
Mexico in the first place?

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.100
Mormons originally came down to
Mexico in the late 1800s,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.750
after the American government
forced the Mormon church to

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.850
ban polygamy.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.110
The problem with this is that
Joseph Smith, the prophet of

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.240
the religion, held that polygamy
was actually a divine

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.980
commandment.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.970
He believed that you can only
reach the highest level of the

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.730
celestial kingdom, or heaven, if
you were actually a partner

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.480
in a plural marriage.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.160
So basically, the more wives
you had, the better

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.280
heaven would be.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.145
And rather than give up their
place in heaven, many moved

00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:09.730
down to Mexico to continue to
practice polygamy, and thereby

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.090
assure their place
in the afterlife.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.010
Here in the seclusion of the
Mexican desert, they could

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.220
practice all the standard Mormon
rituals like baptizing

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.260
the dead or wearing magic
underwear, but also the more

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.950
controversial plural marriage.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.180
Or, as we were soon to find
out, the outright insane

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.660
practice of blood atonement.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.970
So after about five hours of
some very nervous driving and

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.049
a couple of very thorough stops
at military checkpoints,

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.520
not to mention two stops at
drive-through liquor stores to

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.179
calm our very jangling nerves,
we finally arrived at the

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.239
Mormon promised land.

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:48.590
[MUSIC - "PRAISE TO THE MAN"]

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.370
SHANE SMITH: We left Juarez,
which is very dirty and poor

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.940
and very druggy.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.270
And then all of a sudden,
you come over this hill.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.250
And there's orchards
and golf courses.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.700
And the streets are
laid out nice.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.480
They've got nice schools.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.370
Kids are playing baseball.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.440
And there's angels.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.590
And It's kind of like,
[SINGS HEAVENLY REFRAIN]--

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.170
you know, we've come
to God's country.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.140
Because it's beautiful here and
they obviously have money.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.200
So this is why they're being
targeted by the narcos.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.680
And this is why they
have to fight back.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.880
So now we're going to go meet
some Mormons who are actually

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.190
fighting the narco cartel.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.650
This is Brent LeBaron's farm.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.750
They are sort of famously
secretive about their weapons,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.780
their fighting, because they
don't want to be targeted

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.140
anymore by the cartels.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.270
But we're going to go
meet him and see if

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.520
he'll show us around.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.500
Brent?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.450
BRENT LABARON: Yeah,
how's it going?

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.600
SHANE SMITH: Shane Smith.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:37.900
BRENT LABARON: Brent LeBaron.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.690
Nice to meet you.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.110
SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.540
How you doing?

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.600
BRENT LABARON: I'm
very, very well.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.890
SHANE SMITH: This
is your farm.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.470
BRENT LABARON: This
is my farm.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.460
We farm chili and a little
bit of wheat.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.550
All depends the time
of the season.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.020
SHANE SMITH: We've heard that
the LeBaron family, the

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.280
LeBaron colony, has sort of been
standing up to some of

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.660
the narco cartels.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.020
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.140
We've had a few run-ins
with them.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.690
Don't like to say too much about
them, but I'd love to

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.440
show you around.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.240
Let's go.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.270
SHANE SMITH: Let's do it.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.680
Now, I didn't know what to
expect when I first met Brent.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.130
And when I did, he
seemed to me more

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.610
American than most Americans.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.600
In fact, I wouldn't have been
surprised if he told me he

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.510
played linebacker for Alabama.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.470
But when he started to give me
the tour around the cemetery,

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.660
I realized that his story
was anything but normal.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.180
BRENT LABARON: This is the
graveyard where my grandfather

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.050
and great grandfather
are buried.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.710
The original story is they come
down for the cause of

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.540
plural marriage,
to continue it.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.960
You know, Mexico allowed it.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.120
SHANE SMITH: So they wanted
to continue polygamy.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.730
BRENT LABARON: Yes.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.670
My great grandfather, being a
fundamentalist, he broke away

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.260
from the Mormon church because
he had two wives.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.465
That's when he went to establish
Colonia LeBaron.

00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:47.130
They established five or
six colonies down here.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.690
SHANE SMITH: A colony would
be like a family.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.740
BRENT LABARON: A few families.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.350
SHANE SMITH: Right.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.140
And then your grandfather
had 10 wives.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:53.670
BRENT LABARON: Yes.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.240
Had children by 8 of
those 10, but yes.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.650
SHANE SMITH: And how many
grand kids did he have?

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.520
BRENT LABARON: Between grand
kids and great grand kids,

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.010
they're probably pushing
the 400 mark right now.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.480
SHANE SMITH: Wow.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.250
All named LeBaron.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.445
BRENT LABARON: All
named LeBaron.

00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:07.680
SHANE SMITH: Now, having more
than 400 grandchildren might

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.980
seem extreme to some.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.370
But it's nothing compared to
the shit that Brent's uncle

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.300
Ervil got up to.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.570
He was a straight up
fucking lunatic.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.130
Now, Ervil not only had 13 wives
and over 50 children,

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.550
but he also used own family,
including his

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.720
own kids, as assassins.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.420
Dubbed "the Mormon Manson,"
Ervil and his family were

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.840
suspects in over 40 murders.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.950
SHANE SMITH: Joel LeBaron was
killed by his own brother,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.070
Ervil, because of
blood atonement.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:37.440
BRENT LABARON: Yes.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.260
Well, Ervil tried to take over
the church, and he started

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.860
claiming blood atonement,
the right to kill

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.650
in the name of God.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.090
If you oppose him, he has
the right to kill you.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.960
Once Ervil snapped, he just
went on a killing spree.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.540
He had his daughters
killed, his wives

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.690
killed, his sons killed.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.240
And it just went from there.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.810
He went haywire.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.220
SHANE SMITH: So Ervil goes on
this killing spree across

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.180
Mexico and the United States.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.890
And at one point, the Secret
Service is after him because

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.260
he threatens to kill
President Carter.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.170
They finally captured Ervil in
1979 and sent him to prison.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.000
And all the killing
stops, right?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.960
Wrong.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.090
SHANE SMITH: And then after he
dies in jail, people keep on

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.060
killing for him.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.060
BRENT LABARON: He killed up
to 25 people after he died

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.560
because he left a sort of hit
list, and they kept killing.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.030
SHANE SMITH: They
kept killing?

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.820
BRENT LABARON: Yes.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.350
They did.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.160
SHANE SMITH: Now, as Brent is
telling me all this, I had to

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.290
keep in mind that this blood
atonement killing spree isn't

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.640
taking place in the
1880s or anything.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.410
This is all happening
in the 1980s.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.820
BRENT LABARON: My grandfather
ran from him

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.720
for probably 10 years.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.100
I mean, he chased my grandpa
clear to Nicaragua.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.980
SHANE SMITH: Your great uncle
was trying to kill your

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.235
grandfather.

00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:45.202
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.

00:12:45.202 --> 00:12:47.920
Verlan M. LeBaron died in a
car accident right out of

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.870
Mexico City.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.270
A lot of people have been
skeptical that actually Ervil

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.680
had something to do with it.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.130
And his last recorded words
were, brother, it looks like

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.720
we've been ran off the road.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.220
SHANE SMITH: Wow.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.720
That's some crazy shit.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.630
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.160
It's just a modern day
Cain and Abel here.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.040
SHANE SMITH: Do you think that
that's one of the reasons why?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.150
Because you had this sort of
familial civil war you got

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.240
tighter as a family, So when
the narcos came after your

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.740
family, you were sort
of tougher?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.940
BRENT LABARON: Oh, definitely.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.610
Everyone was a watchman.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.510
SHANE SMITH: Now, what he's
saying here is that because of

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.000
Ervil, everyone in the LeBaron
clan watched out

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.860
for everyone else.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.870
So when the cartels kidnapped
one of their

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.330
own, they were ready.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.860
Eric LeBaron was only 16 when
he was abducted and held for

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.200
$1 million ransom.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.280
You didn't pay the ransom.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.890
BRENT LABARON: We didn't
pay the ransom.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.700
SHANE SMITH: Even if you could
get the money and paid it,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.690
they're just going
to keep doing it.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.830
BRENT LABARON: They're just
going to keep coming

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.550
and keep doing it.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.600
SHANE SMITH: They'll just use
the money to buy more guns and

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.730
get more powerful.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.530
BRENT LABARON: Exactly.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.640
If we don't sever the head off
this monster right now, it's

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.800
just going to get worse.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.330
We had to go to the government
and say, hey.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.490
You won't allow us
to bear arms.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.020
But you're supposed
to protect us.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.930
SHANE SMITH: The protest forced
the government to put

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.520
pressure on the kidnappers.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.470
And as is quite rare in these
situations, Eric was returned

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.050
unharmed after paying
no ransom.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.850
However, it also served to
enrage the local drug Lord,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.370
named "El Rikin," who only lived
eight miles down the

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.740
road from Colonia LeBaron.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.185
Now, this is a narco who loves
drugs so much that he actually

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:24.710
massacred 18 people trying to
get off the stuff at a drug

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.555
rehab center.

00:14:25.555 --> 00:14:27.945
And now, he's after
the LeBarons.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.310
NEWS ANCHOR 1: Two more
Americans dead as a result of

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.740
the violence in Mexico.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.470
Those victims gunned down this
week by drug cartel killers.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.540
NEWS ANCHOR 2: We've done a lot
of stories about polygamy

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.570
and a lot of stories about
Mexican drug cartel violence.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.550
But we never imagined the two
topics would mesh like this in

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.920
a very tragic way.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.580
SHANE SMITH: The freeing of
one of their own by the

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.560
LeBarons protesting in Chihuahua
had sent a message

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.600
to the narcos.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.150
They weren't going
to back down.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.390
They weren't going to submit.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.320
They were going to fight.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.250
But it didn't take "El
Rikin" long to send a

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.500
message right back.

00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:18.750
BRENT LABARON: So yeah, this is
my cousin Benjamin's home.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.760
This "Rikin" guy actually
ordered the hit on him because

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.440
of the stand we took.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.390
He was a serious criminal.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.570
I mean, famously, he got caught
on the American side of

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.040
the border dressed as Mexican
military, had a shootout with

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.620
the border guards, and
then came back here.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.060
So they came here
to his house.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.100
He showed up with 15, 20 guys,
two, three trucks--

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.100
pickups.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.610
Benjamin and his family were
sleeping in the house when

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.520
these guys come, surround the
house, breaking down his door.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.580
Ended up breaking pretty much
most of his windows out.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.830
There's still marks on the door
where they were trying to

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.860
bash in with guns, whatever
they had.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.130
You know, those are sledgehammer
marks.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.180
And at that point, they had
threatened his family with a

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.920
hand grenade.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.270
SHANE SMITH: So they said they'd
blow up the family with

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.950
a grenade unless
he surrendered?

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:13.910
BRENT LABARON: Unless
he opened the door.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.410
And so he opened the door.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.240
At that point, his
brother-in-law Luis come over

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.490
to see what was going on.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.320
He literally showed
up in sandals.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.230
He came to the rescue.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.550
He was an innocent bystander.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.860
SHANE SMITH: So he came here
barefoot with no gun.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.210
BRENT LABARON: At all.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.980
SHANE SMITH: Against guys who
are armed with machine guns

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.435
and grenades.

00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:29.700
BRENT LABARON: Yes.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:36.090
But they beat him and picked him
and Benjamin up and took

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.860
them about two miles down the
road here and shot them both

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.646
and left them on the
side of the road.

00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:42.480
SHANE SMITH: Jesus.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.850
So because "El Rikin" put the
hit out on Benjamin, it put

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.830
enough domestic pressure here
that they would offer him up

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.370
to the American authorities for
the Mexican incident where

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.400
he was dressed as the military
with the border police.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.770
BRENT LABARON: Very much so.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.590
Very much so, yeah.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.380
Because I don't think they had
enough here to hold him here.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.760
So they actually shipped
him to the US.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.590
SHANE SMITH: And although "El
Rikin" was extradited to

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.740
America for his firefights with
the border patrol, none

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.089
of the other 20-plus men
involved in this double

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.904
homicide have ever
been convicted.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.260
But the LeBarons
wouldn't quit.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.040
In fact, Julian LeBaron,
Benjamin's brother, has since

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.690
taken up his dead sibling's
mantle of activism.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:24.900
SHANE SMITH: Shane.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.780
JULIAN LEBARON: Julian.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.569
SHANE SMITH: Good to meet you.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:28.750
JULIAN LEBARON: Well,
the main thing is,

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.104
we want to be respected.

00:17:30.104 --> 00:17:32.692
And in Mexico, nobody's
respected.

00:17:32.692 --> 00:17:35.057
We're not respected by the
criminals, and we're not

00:17:35.057 --> 00:17:36.307
respected by the government.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.850
"This is for messing with
[INAUDIBLE]'s people" or some

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.690
stupid shit.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.700
I don't remember what it was.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.330
And that's where they
found them.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.586
They shot them four times
in the head each.

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:51.500
SHANE SMITH: Shit.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.400
JULIAN LEBARON: I think that
most of us felt really

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.100
thankful that we found them,
because sometimes they'll take

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.460
them and torture
them to death.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.070
People from our neighboring
communities participated in

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.320
this murder.

00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:12.090
Those are some of the
people that are

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.000
involved with this shit.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.750
SHANE SMITH: Really?

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.450
Those guys are bad boys?

00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:24.036
SHANE SMITH: Jesus Christ.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.470
JULIAN LEBARON: 10 children
under the age of seven were

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.740
left orphans when that
happened that night.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.775
My brother and his
brother-in-law, they were some

00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:39.850
of the most valuable people
in our community.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.940
This can never be acceptable.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.050
Never.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.750
Because if this is acceptable,
there's no future left.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.230
The community-- initially, what
we said is, for every

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.673
person they kill from
our community,

00:18:50.673 --> 00:18:51.770
we'll kill 10 of them.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.561
Because we know who they are.

00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:56.090
And then we said, well, that's
not a solution, because then

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.420
you become just like them.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.510
SHANE SMITH: So the sun
was going down.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.690
It was getting a little
bit late.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.600
And the LeBarons told us that
we should get back to our

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.880
hotel before it got dark.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.840
We are going to a hotel that's
actually in the LeBaron

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.970
colony, which hopefully will
be a little bit safer.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.270
But after you hear stories
like that, you just can't

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.930
believe the fear of violence
that these people

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.680
live under every day.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.800
It makes you paranoid to
hear stories like that.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.714
So we're going to go to our
hotel and lock ourselves in.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.930
This is a shrine to Jesus
Malverde, who's the patron

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.900
saint of drug smugglers,
narcos.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.540
So we're going to
light a candle.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.190
This is freaking me out
because I'm very

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.080
superstitious.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.160
That's him there.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.030
Patron saint of the
drug dealers.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.490
They all come in here, they
say a prayer, they write a

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.910
prayer on here, and they say,
please let me get across the

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.330
border with my drugs.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.400
Literally, religion about
drug dealers.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.650
Now, the whole time I was
hanging out with the LeBarons,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.200
I found myself wondering, how
do you actually protect

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.590
yourself against narco lords
who employ whole armies of

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:21.090
assassins whose sole job is
to kill their rivals?

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.010
Well, the LeBarons started by
adopting military style

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.940
tactics and setting up
checkpoints, roadblocks, and

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.880
watchtowers.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.570
BRENT LABARON: We hit
a real big low

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.740
when they killed Benjamin.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.255
It was a real big blow to
our entire community.

00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:38.170
I was really close
to Benjamin.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.980
Knew him really well.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.960
SHANE SMITH: After Benjamin was
killed, you've set up your

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.010
own community watch, your
own night watch.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.680
And then you built this up, and
you have people watching

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.460
every night.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.170
BRENT LABARON: Every night.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.070
So we have--

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.120
SHANE SMITH: What are
you watching for?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.470
BRENT LABARON: Pretty much
suspicious vehicles.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.940
We pretty much know everybody.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.690
And so if it looks like a
vehicle I've never seen

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.790
before, then it was
getting checked.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.370
SHANE SMITH: This watch hut
looks down on one of the main

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.570
drug trafficking roads.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.730
BRENT LABARON: One
of them, yeah.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.400
SHANE SMITH: The only
people here with

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.950
weapons are the criminals.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.570
BRENT LABARON: Pretty much.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.650
SHANE SMITH: The drug cartels.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.420
BRENT LABARON: Rumor got out
that we had high-powered

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.840
rifles and snipers
and whatnot.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.170
SHANE SMITH: And .50 cals
up here and stuff.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.990
BRENT LABARON: Well, you know
how rumors can spread.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.640
Which was a benefit for us.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.955
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's good.

00:21:22.955 --> 00:21:23.270
It's a good rumor.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.570
BRENT LABARON: It was a really
good rumor for us, you know.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.770
I believe that the watchtower
is one of the key points to

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.270
keeping the bad guys
away from our town.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.010
Also, the feds and the military
are in our town.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.930
This is their base.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.270
We actually had a roadblock, to
where there was one way in

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.640
and one way out.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.260
SHANE SMITH: So you have
barricades, checkpoints, and

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:44.930
watchtowers?

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.040
BRENT LABARON: Yeah.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.220
I would say our valley right
here is quite a bit safer than

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.330
a lot of areas--

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.500
SHANE SMITH: Casas Grandes,
which is about 30 minutes

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.510
away, they're still having
kidnappings and stuff there.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.520
BRENT LABARON: Here and there.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.890
Before, it was literally
two, three a week.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.750
SHANE SMITH: Wow.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.970
That's a lot.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.110
BRENT LABARON: That's
a lot, yeah.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.810
So We were never pinpointing
drug cartels or anything else,

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.710
but when it came to them now
kidnapping our family members,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.860
that's what we took
a stand against.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.510
When it comes to protecting our
family, if we have to die

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.970
doing it, we're going to.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.760
SHANE SMITH: So the LeBarons
made their colony into a

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.940
little fortress using the same
counter-terrorist techniques

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.920
that the US Army uses in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.260
And because of it, the killings
and the kidnappings

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.980
in the Mormon areas actually
died down.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.340
But roadblocks and security
checkpoints are only going to

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.470
get you so far.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.960
At some point, if you're
fighting the narcos, you're

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.700
going to need guns.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.180
If Benjamin was taken by a bunch
of guys with weapons,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.880
they were unarmed, how are you
supposed to defend yourself?

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.100
BRENT LABARON: Well, there's
really no law in Mexico that

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.920
gives you the right
to bear arms.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.680
Legally, the quickest and best
way is through a gun club.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.980
SHANE SMITH: Now, in
Mexico, it's nearly

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.620
impossible to own a gun.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.820
In fact, one of the only legal
ways to do so is to go through

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.200
the extremely difficult process
of starting a gun club

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.450
or a shooting range.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.480
Why don't you have
your own shooting

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.450
club in Colonia LeBaron?

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.340
BRENT LABARON: Our ex-mayor
wouldn't sign

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.792
the papers we needed.

00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:23.670
We had all the first
members on a list.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.580
Well, he turns around
and shows it

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.400
to our bad boy buddies.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.340
SHANE SMITH: You're trying to
arm yourselves, and he's

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.350
working for the cartels so
you can't arm yourselves.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.680
BRENT LABARON: Exactly.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.010
Pretty.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:33.280
Much.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.080
SHANE SMITH: Where is he now?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.330
BRENT LABARON: He's in prison.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.410
SHANE SMITH: There's 15 million
illegal assault rifles

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.070
estimated in Mexico.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.660
I mean, the thing is,
if you have 20 guys

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.910
with assault rifles--

00:23:49.598 --> 00:23:52.996
Maybe I'm going to go for
one of those turkeys.

00:23:52.996 --> 00:23:53.516
Oh yeah.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:56.292
I'm going to get one of them.

00:23:56.292 --> 00:23:57.130
No.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.640
So the LeBarons finally decided
that if it continued

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.570
to be illegal to own weapons,
which meant criminals were the

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.340
only ones that had guns, that it
was time to change the law.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.930
Alex LeBaron, who's now a
congressman, is determined to

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.000
protect his colony from
the cartels, no

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.300
matter what it takes.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.700
Even if it means a shootout
with the Mexican military.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.070
ALEX LEBARON: They went
into our farm.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.490
We thought they were
criminals.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.630
We shot one of them.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.930
It was a very sad incident,
but it gained a lot

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:29.910
of respect for us.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.030
SHANE SMITH: You outshot
the military.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.150
ALEX LEBARON: We outshot
the military.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.440
We got phone calls from heads of
the criminal organizations

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.760
after that incident.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.750
And they told us they were proud
of us to some degree.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.690
People in drug organizations,
and including the same

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.630
military, know that we
have weapons because

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.720
we've been saying it.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.120
We have illegal weapons
in our community.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.150
Come in and find them
if you want.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.110
We buy them in the states.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.650
We know we traffic
them illegally.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.090
But that's the only
way to defend

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.060
yourself in this country.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.400
In order to get access to a
weapon here in our country, it

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.930
would cost you up to $10,000.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.790
And that wouldn't even be
through a legal way.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.900
SHANE SMITH: So the majority of
the weapons being used by

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.210
the narcos are coming
from America.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.940
ALEX LEBARON: Absolutely.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.390
SHANE SMITH: And the money
is coming from America.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.200
ALEX LEBARON: Absolutely.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.280
I think the Americans need to
really understand that any

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.980
policies that are implemented
in the United States impact

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.230
our country.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.950
SHANE SMITH: So the money
for all these guns

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.220
is coming from America.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.830
The guns themselves
come from America.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.140
The coke is being
sold in America.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.840
But the war is being
fought in Mexico.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.290
And considering 1,300 people
were killed in the region just

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.950
this past August alone, in
northern Mexico, self-defense

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.710
has truly become a matter
of life and death.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.110
BRENT LABARON: In the last
while, it's actually calmed

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.100
down quite a bit.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.370
I haven't heard of that many
kidnappings lately.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.990
Usually, it was like, boom.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.030
Every other day, oh my goodness,
there was another

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.050
kidnapping, you know?

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.610
The Joneses got kidnapped.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.720
Like, Romney got
kidnapped, or--

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.220
just someone you affiliated
with.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.860
SHANE SMITH: Now, it's hard to
picture a place that's so

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.030
fucked up that not that many
kidnappings is a sign that

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.300
things are going well.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.030
But in northern Mexico,
everything is relative.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.820
The sobering reality of it is,
in Mexico, in 2011 there were

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.670
49 kidnappings a day.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.610
BRENT LABARON: Things have
actually kind of calmed down

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.860
enough to where they actually
have parties

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.190
and rodeos and whatnot.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.060
SHANE SMITH: So they're having
this rodeo because a

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.490
dude lost his leg?

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.060
BRENT LABARON: Yeah, one of the
cowboys lost his leg, and

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.292
they're doing a benefit
for him.

ANNOUNCER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.200
SHANE SMITH: One of the things
that we were worried about

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.935
before we came here was people
knowing that we were here,

00:26:47.935 --> 00:26:49.030
people knowing that
we were shooting.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.366
And now we're in front of the
whole town in a town where

00:26:51.366 --> 00:26:53.740
they used to have three or
four kidnappings a week.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.275
And we're just parading in
front of everyone with a

00:26:56.275 --> 00:26:58.357

00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:06.470
that we're here shooting.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.860
In the most dangerous town.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.110
In Chihuahua.

00:27:18.728 --> 00:27:20.442
I'm just going to get drunk.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:26.675
Woo!

00:27:26.675 --> 00:27:28.620
Let's put that on.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.040
SHANE SMITH: Now, hanging out
with the LeBarons and play

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.830
acting as a cowpoke relaxed
us a little bit.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.130
As did the booze.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.330
I'd like to say "cheers" to the
LeBaron family because you

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.235
guys fucking rock.

00:27:37.235 --> 00:27:38.350
BRENT LABARON: To the
LeBaron family.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.960
SHANE SMITH: The

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.990
Good times, good friends.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.230
SHANE SMITH: We had a nice
lunch, got a bit drunk, and

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.556
sang some songs together.

00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:04.913
It was fun.

MALE SPEAKERS:
[SINGING IN SPANISH]

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.760
SHANE SMITH: After drinking
for a bit with Brent, he

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.930
suggested we go on a ride-along
on the nightly

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.710
patrol of the LeBaron colony.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.920
Now, I was picturing a pickup
truck with a CB and a couple

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.380
of good ol' boys in the back.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.310
But what we got instead was some
heavy, heavy business.

00:28:42.135 --> 00:28:43.800
What are we doing right now?

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.130
BRENT LABARON: So we're just
going to take on a routine

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.950
route that they normally take.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.285
And then they'll probably do
a security checkpoint for a

00:28:52.285 --> 00:28:52.720
little while.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.490
And maybe check some

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.060
suspicious vehicles or something.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.330
These guys use our town as
a base because they trust

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.320
everyone here.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.450
SHANE SMITH: One of the things
that's pretty crazy is you're

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.710
driving through with pickup
trucks with four armed guards

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.830
in the back and two guys in the
front, all with machine

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.030
guns, for a town of
1,200 people.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.280
So shit is serious.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.660
So the federales kept
stopping people.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.890
And they didn't seem to mind
us riding along with them.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.820
Until they roadblocked
the actual highway.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.232
Which, remember, is one of the
main drug routes into America.

00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:45.887
The cops are going to
stop some cars and

00:29:45.887 --> 00:29:48.500
look for some drugs.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.610
Then as the sun was going down,
they warned us that we

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.040
should leave because it was
very dangerous to even

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.320
be seen with them.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.360
Because as it turned out, riding
around with them on the

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.620
back roads is one thing.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.350
But stopping actual
drug runners on

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.835
the highway was another.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.590
You want a beer?

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:13.310
Back at the hotel, we realized
that our fun, boozy afternoon

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.860
had some unforeseen
consequences.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.150
About an hour ago, a black
pickup sort of

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.770
drove by really slowly.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.780
And then kind of sped off.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.770
Black trucks like the ones
Julian had pointed out earlier

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.940
had actually stopped, taken
pictures, and checked us out.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.500
And all a sudden, our LeBaron
run around town drunk time

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.990
didn't seem so smart anymore.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.760
All right.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.393
So we have to leave now
because we shot

00:30:37.393 --> 00:30:38.680
today at the rodeo.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.360
And then we did a drive-by
with the cops.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.750
So everybody in town knows
that we're here.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.975
And then we've just had a black
truck with black windows

00:30:45.975 --> 00:30:48.940
stop, pull up, check us
out, then drive off.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.440
And a black truck, I just found
out, came by and took

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.800
pictures of us before
I got here.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.340
So we have to go to another
hotel that we've arranged,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.330
which is crazy.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.560
So we took off.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.920
And when we called Brent to tell
him we had left, I half

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.950
expected him to say, hey,
you're overreacting.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:04.640
It's nothing.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.980
But in actual fact,
when he heard the

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.510
story, he said, oh yeah.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.110
You should get the fuck
out of Dodge.

[ROOSTER CROWS]

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.890
SHANE SMITH: Now, because
Colonia LeBaron is so close to

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.720
the American border, they're
totally affected by our

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.920
immigration policy.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.750
And of course, our
war on drugs.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.600
If America sneezes, Mexico
catches cold.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.080
And because of this, they're
extremely interested in

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.330
American political policy.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.180
You have narco cartels.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.130
You have a drug route.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.960
You have illegal immigration.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.620
So all of these problems.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.500
Who do you think should
be the next President

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.320
of the United States?

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.720
BRENT LABARON: Mitt Romney has
a great, great policy.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.060
SHANE SMITH: Now, are
you just saying that

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.180
because you're Mormonish?

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.820
BRENT LABARON: His ties, his
people, his family lives right

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.316
across the mountain here.

00:31:57.316 --> 00:31:59.085
You should probably meet them.

00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:01.860
SHANE SMITH: Now, when Brent
says "his family," he means

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.540
presidential candidate
Mitt Romney's family.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.210
Now, we knew that his father,
George Romney, had been born

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.200
into a Mormon colony
in Mexico.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.390
But not that they still
had an active Romney

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.165
colony here in Chihuahua.

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:17.270
So the Romneys still live
here across the valley?

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:17.620
BRENT LABARON: Yep.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.700
They're some great guys.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.180
Just really like them.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.785
Golf with them quite
often, and just

00:32:22.785 --> 00:32:24.670
some really cool guys.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.610
And the rest are fours.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.750
Pretty nice greens, huh?

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.610
SHANE SMITH: Beautiful.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.090
How did this golf
course start?

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.520
KELLY ROMNEY: We just got a
group together that liked to

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.540
play golf and copied other
golf courses, put in a

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.970
sprinkling system.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.540
When the violence started, we
lost quite a few members.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:59.010
Just like in Casas Grandes,
a lot of people moved out.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.050
SHANE SMITH: You play here with
some of the LeBarons from

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:01.820
Colonia LeBaron?

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.100
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.880
Some of the guys come
over here and play.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.330
SHANE SMITH: And who's better?

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.480
The LeBarons or the Romneys?

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.500
KELLY ROMNEY: The LeBarons.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.550
I don't know what they're
eating over there, but--

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.800
[LAUGHS].

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.320
SHANE SMITH: So how long have
the Romneys been here?

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.340
KELLY ROMNEY: 1885.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.620
My great grandfather, Miles Park
Romney, was one of the

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.500
original people that
came here.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.860
Mitt is a relative.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.040
He's a second cousin.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.560
SHANE SMITH: So his dad
was born in Chihuahua?

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.650
BRENT LABARON: He was born
in Colonia Dublan, about

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.430
15 miles from here.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.870
Their family left, and they
stayed in the United States.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.130
They didn't come back.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.046
You know, I remember his father
ran for President of

00:33:41.046 --> 00:33:42.400
the United States in '68.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.450
Or at least he was
a candidate.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.440
His citizenship was
questioned.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.190
Because he was born here in
Mexico, but he was born of

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.510
American parents.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.770
SHANE SMITH: And do you think
that this craziness around the

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.720
run-up to the election, is
that bringing too much

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.630
attention, or?

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.510
KELLY ROMNEY: I think one of the
reasons it's brought a lot

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.490
of attention to here is because
of Mitt's position on

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.250
illegal immigration.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.660
SHANE SMITH: Right.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.580
Now what's ironic about this
is that Mitt Romney, whose

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.330
father was born in Mexico and
would be considered the poster

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.710
child of the Dream Act, actually
has one of the

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.230
staunchest views on immigration
in his already

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.290
conservative Republican Party.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.730
MITT ROMNEY: And I've indicated
I would veto the

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.600
Dream Act if provisions included
that people who are

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.340
here illegally, if they go to
school here long enough, get a

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.900
degree here, that they can
become permanent residents.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.030
I think that's a mistake.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.150
SHANE SMITH: Now, it seems a bit
weird for a person who's

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.510
essentially a first generation
immigrant to have such harsh

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.320
views on immigration.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.239
It's kind of like, "Methink
thy dost protest too much"

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.420
kind of deal.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.699
And his own cousin Kelly, who
although he supports Mitt for

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.489
president, thinks that
his position on

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.280
immigration is wrong.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.610
KELLY ROMNEY: I think
he needs to change.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.150
Being born and raised in Mexico,
and especially since

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.990
NAFTA, I think the United States
is partly responsible

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.470
for the increase in illegal
immigration we have.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.840
SHANE SMITH: Right.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.710
So America makes policy.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.360
Then all of a sudden, northern
Mexico gets screwed up.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.260
KELLY ROMNEY: That's right.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.700
Give amnesty to those that are
out there that are working

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.540
legitimately and have a job,
come up with a guest worker

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.500
program, and let these people
go out there and work, and

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.350
then come home and take
care of their family.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:17.530
Because basically, they're
starving to

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:18.810
death here in Mexico.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.130
SHANE SMITH: In fact, it's so
bad that for many people,

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:22.660
there's only really
two options.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.500
One, sneak into America.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.480
Or two, work for the cartels.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.790
You know, didn't some farmers
go up from the farms and go

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.390
into the mountains and
start growing drugs?

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.780
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.870
A lot of them have gone into the
mountain areas, and they

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:33.560
grow drugs there.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.370
SHANE SMITH: And now we're
sitting here going, OK, well,

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:35.920
what are we going to do?

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.630
KELLY ROMNEY: What are
we going to do?

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.160
Exactly.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.540
You know?

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.280
I wish Mitt would make
contact with us.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.280
And I really think that
we could help him.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.520
SHANE SMITH: And as I would
later realize, contacting the

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.140
Mexican side of his family would
probably be the last

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.730
thing that Mitt Romney
would do.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.530
MITT ROMNEY: I think marijuana
should not be

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:52.380
legal in this country.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:57.070
I believe it's a gateway drug
to other drug violations.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:00.440
The use of illegal drugs in
this country is leading to

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.690
terrible consequences.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.250
SHANE SMITH: Now, we all know
Mitt Romney's stance on drugs.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.310
But it was interesting to hear
Kelly's thoughts on the drug

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:13.640
war, considering it affects
him every day.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.050
KELLY ROMNEY: To me, this used
to be the most peaceful place

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.010
in the world.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:17.410
Yeah, man.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.550
I used let my kids go to Nuevo
Casas Grandes, go to the

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.990
shows, go to dances,
go to parties.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.890
But now, you keep close watch.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.500
And it all has to do with the
drug violence that it started.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.250
When they started the
war on drugs, the

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.540
violence just escalated.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.470
Most of the problems
that we have around

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.260
here are drug related.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.580
And there's been some
kidnappings and some killings

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.080
from drug-related things.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.380
SHANE SMITH: Have there ever
been any Romneys kidnapped?

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.510
KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah, my brother
was kidnapped three

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.020
years ago in May.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.170
I think they kept him
for two days.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.030
Took him to a cave up
in the mountains.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.280
We paid a small ransom.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.400
It wasn't a lot.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.920
They were mainly punks.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.260
They weren't really
professionals.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.350
SHANE SMITH: And most of the
weapons that are here in

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.350
Mexico are illegal weapons.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.370
And most of those illegal
weapons are

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.580
coming from the States.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.380
KELLY ROMNEY: Yes.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.800
Fast and Furious, I'm sure
you heard about that.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.950
SHANE SMITH: Now, the Fast and
the Furious scandal he's

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.320
talking about refers to a case
where the American government

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.570
gave thousands of guns
to the cartels in

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.640
order to track them.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.460
Then, they proceeded to lose
track of them until they

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.930
surfaced again in the murder
cases of American agents.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.260
KELLY ROMNEY: What, did they
think they were going to be

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.180
able to keep control of them?

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.750
Or keep track of them?

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.660
Nonsense.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.500
I don't know what in the world
they were thinking in sending

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.470
all those weapons to Mexico.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.380
SHANE SMITH: And the Fast and
the Furious scandal is just

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.640
one of many that have seriously
embarrassed the

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.890
American government.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:49.480
Now, perhaps Mitt's hard-line
stance on issues like guns,

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.430
immigration, and drugs
becomes more clear.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.160
Because even though his father
was born in Chihuahua, Mitt

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.640
surely must want to distance
himself from the region.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.530
Because the region is
totally fucked up.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.950
And it's not the first time that
this has been the Romney

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.050
strategy either.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.080
When his father ran for
president, both his

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.450
citizenship and his Mormon
colony's polygamist roots were

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.920
called into question.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.030
And.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.870
His run for the White House
didn't last too long.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.010
But Mitt Romney has to deal with
his family's polygamist

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:21.730
past, kidnapping, drug wars,
and, in the extreme case of

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.440
Ervil LeBaron, crazy Mormon
blood atonement.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.785
Now, having close familial ties
to all this shit does not

00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:30.450
a good presidential
candidate make.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.650
Being on the front lines of
this, what do you think are

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.340
some of the solutions
to these problems?

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.330
KELLY ROMNEY: Looking at it from
a perspective of someone

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.250
living here, we say, well, why
don't they legalize it in the

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:47.730
United States and cut out all
the violence in Mexico?

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.680
As long as you have the swimming
pool over there, this

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.476
is going to be the
diving board.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.260
SHANE SMITH: So as we began
our long drive back to the

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.360
border, I had lots of time
to think about what

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.120
we'd seen in Chihuahua.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.400
I thought about the
LeBarons and the

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.640
war against the narcos.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.630
The kidnappings, the murders,
and the lengths they have to

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.540
go to protect themselves
every day.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.980
I also thought about what Kelly
Romney had said about

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.730
the US being the swimming
pool and Mexico

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.010
being the diving board.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:20.200
And how similar all this is
to America's history with

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.450
outlawing alcohol.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.030
So we're just approaching the
border here back into America.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.680
It feels like about a year
has passed since

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.840
we were here last.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.500
As we were driving here from
Chihuahua, I was thinking

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.030
about how prohibition in America
led to the rise of the

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.640
mob, the Al Capones,
the Lucky Lucianos.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.410
Our war on drugs, our
prohibition against drugs, has

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.350
caused the same thing.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.540
You see it down here.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.983
It's the sort of blunt
head to the hammer.

00:39:46.983 --> 00:39:48.350
It's the rule of the thug.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.120
You have $200 assassins.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.170
And as long as there's
prohibition,

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.230
it's going to continue.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.665
The war on drugs is a failure.

00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:56.900
There's never been more drugs in
America, and they've never

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.340
been cheaper.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:57.890
Or better.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.880
Or higher quality.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.150
And as we sat for hours at the
border waiting to get back

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.150
into America, I thought about
the fact that Mitt Romney

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.560
might just be the
next President

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.520
of the United States.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.816
MITT ROMNEY: God
bless America.

00:40:08.816 --> 00:40:10.550
Thanks, you guys.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.010
SHANE SMITH: Now, polygamy and
kidnapping not withstanding,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:16.420
if he wins, he's going to have
some hard decisions to make

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.550
about decriminalizing
drugs and fixing

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.920
our immigration problem.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.620
Because if he doesn't, Mexico,
his Mormon brethren, and

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.970
perhaps even his own flesh
and blood, are

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.220
going to pay the price.
