00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
the horrors of our world from the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.410
sadistic savagery that humanity has

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.170
proven capable of to the cruel majesty

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.080
of nature itself generate a sum of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.990
terror that far exceeds the tolerances

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.689
of the everyday citizen and though these

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.750
aspects may be horrific they pale in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.720
comparison to the inexplicable evils of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
our time those impossible incorporeal

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.860
shadows that simply can't be explained

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.219
that have enraptured the imaginations of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.770
men and women to exist in our collective

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.950
consciousness as twisted nightmares and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.180
chilling possibilities my name is mr.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.000
mysterious and these are five

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.640
disturbingly perplexing ghost videos the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.340
Torquay Museum home to dozens of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.619
artifacts from the pages of classical

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.200
history has a rather unfortunate history

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.500
of inexplicable interference ranging

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.000
from the disturbing apparition of a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.400
female ghost hovering around the remains

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.710
of an ancient Egyptian mummified child

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.409
being unintentionally captured on camera

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.259
to fingerprints being discovered on the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.390
inside of a previously sealed

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.290
sarcophagus a string of such hauntings

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.350
has pestered and amused the staff who

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.470
have in true English fashion simply

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.079
accepted the abnormalities as a fact of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.570
life and almost a year and a half later

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
one of these disturbances was finally

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.689
caught on camera taking place in the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.909
museum's gift shop two staff members

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.149
were present at the time watch the left

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.049
side of your screen from a seemingly

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.930
stable display stand several of the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.030
museum's leaflets are spat from the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.700
shelf to the floor leading to the Meuse

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.759
stances from the staff notice that the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.560
door to the shop is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.630
shut and that there is very little

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.390
active at the moment in the room it is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.300
extremely unlikely that a wayward breeze

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.790
simply knocked these cards to the ground

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.120
as one of the confused staff members

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.280
approaches and bends to pick up the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.160
wayward card several dozen more are

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.470
suddenly ejected from the shelf onto his

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.349
head leaving the man shocked and

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.330
confused watch the postcards again they

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.660
aren't simply knocked down they burst

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.030
forward from the display stand with an

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.120
unnatural energy like a deck of playing

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.910
cards being bent at the edges until they

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.060
explode forward in an erupting flurry at

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.660
this point the staff decide that things

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.060
have once again gotten a little strange

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.870
for them and they perhaps wisely choose

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.060
to exit the gift shop rather than risk

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.090
the very real possibility of a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.470
paranormal paper crops

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.380
our next destination is the city of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.770
Perth in Australia this footage was

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.319
recorded in a dimly lit parking lot

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.430
captured via automatically operated CCTV

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.970
and was uploaded on the 19th of November

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.230
2015 claimed to be one hundred percent

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.110
evidence of a real ghost by the uploader

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.440
there has been some controversy as to

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.670
its authenticity in the footage over the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.610
span of around a minute we see a thin

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.790
white figure gliding across the car park

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.000
stepping through both vegetation and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.260
vehicles due to the poor quality and low

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.840
frame rate of the recording it's not

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.910
possible to gain a clear image of the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.190
blurred creature as it steps across the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.310
car park the white apparition remains

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.989
out of focus throughout the video

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.680
however in several of the frames it's

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.350
possible to make out a vaguely human

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.650
like visit and its ghostly proportions

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.680
are distended and stretched far beyond

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.650
the standard anatomy of a human there

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.229
have been several possibilities proposed

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.440
ranging from examinations of the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.419
motivations and possibilities of the

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.540
apparition to more mundane solutions

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.760
such as the possibility that the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.200
creature is merely a fluttering

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.660
newspaper caught by the midnight breeze

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.450
a reflection of the lenses behind the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.450
cameras glass or even a large white moth

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.479
flitting past the camera which would

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.400
certainly explain the unfocused nature

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.050
of the creature in relation to its

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.419
environment if not it's humanoid shape

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.050
and glimmering appearance in the end

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.500
this footage is undeniably disturbing

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.100
and a definitive conclusion is unlikely

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.410
due to the poor quality of the recording

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.180
whatever this creature is we may never

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.510
know

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.849
are you afraid of hospitals sharp steely

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.690
knives sterile Dead's soaked countless

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.650
times with blood bile and assorted other

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.150
fluids and cold heart eye doctors and

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.479
nurses that see patients as possibly

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.610
more than mechanical problems to be

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.960
rectified between this and the simple

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.240
truth that hospitals are common location

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.050
for tragic and untimely deaths is it any

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.120
wonder that they seem to be something of

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.360
a hot spot for paranormal activity for

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.909
this first video we're traveling to

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.240
Honduras to a teaching hospital known as

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.199
the school hospital universitario where

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.720
a photographer stumbled across a truly

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.960
disturbing sight while recording in late

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.539
April of 2016 in the footage we see at

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.880
an individual peeking out from behind a

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.610
doorway and eventually walking out into

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.870
the corridor on closer inspection the

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.750
individual appears to be in co poriyal

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.990
we can see clear through them to the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.259
corridor behind the individual steps out

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.740
into the corridor and seemingly vanishes

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.830
as the photographer backs away clearly

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.979
shaken by this incident it's theorized

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.919
that the individual who can clearly be

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.039
seen to be humanoid in appearance is the

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.530
unquiet spirit of a doctor from the

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.219
hospital's past who had at some point in

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.789
the past committed suicide apparently

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.400
the doctor in question is something of a

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.130
local myth it said that he haunts the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.530
corridors moving between the patient

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.289
rooms to flick the light on and off

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:18.509
terrifying or merely irritating it's

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:23.370
hard to say

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.030
we've all heard rumors about scary

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.750
apparitions roaming old castle as this

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.690
video will prove it was taken in one of

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.460
the best examples of Elizabethan

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.979
architecture in Britain a building named

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:43.199
long lead house in 1733 lady louisa

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.680
carteret married the second vikon's they

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.770
moot of long lead house she had a number

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.490
of servants one of them was a footman he

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.280
was very devoted to lady louisa and she

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.430
recognized his fine qualities however

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.800
the other servants were jealous of his

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.320
privileged position until they moved

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.970
that the footman was having an affair

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.199
with his wife Vikon a man known for his

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.250
hot temper flew into a rage some

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.990
accounts state that the footman was

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.060
ambushed and thrown down the spiral

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.720
staircase outside the library his body

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.970
was buried in the cellar and the Vikon

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.160
told his wife that the footman had left

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.430
without saying a word however she knew

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.849
that wasn't true so lady louisa spent

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:34.770
night after night searching the building

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.789
for the missing man not long after she

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.630
died at the age of 22 it's the Phantom

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.450
of lady louisa who is the long lead

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.180
house ghost just like this video is

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.730
showing the corridor outside the library

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.060
is where this ghost can be seen which is

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.050
where the footman met his death however

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.170
the video you're seeing is a very clear

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.959
hologram that is made to replicate what

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.760
people have been seeing for centuries

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.420
now it's also worth noting that this is

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.000
not just an imaginary tail in the early

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.820
20th century when central heating was

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.250
being installed a body was discovered

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.160
buried in the cellar it was wearing the

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.440
uniform of a footman from the time of

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.080
Queen Anne it is said that the bones

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.790
were collected together in a shoe box

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.360
and buried in the local church yard

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:38.190
though we so often associate ghosts and

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.320
the paranormal with the fear of

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.380
uncertainty and assorted varieties of

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.430
unnatural terror it is perhaps important

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.649
to remember that despite the stigma of

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:51.810
ghost stories and their usage and works

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.450
of fictional horror very few ghost

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.089
sightings actually results in any direct

00:09:57.089 --> 00:10:00.300
harm aside from a few dozen jump scares

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.420
and the occasional climbing the various

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.010
ghosts and ghouls that we have observed

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.010
seem to do little more than irritate and

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.890
tease perhaps these unknown

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.040
manifestations have a sense of humor for

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.410
our final video we're delving into

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.740
Mexico specifically a branch of the

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.500
popular retailer blockbuster and the

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.750
struggle of one man to restock the

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.610
shelves following another day of

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.760
business armed with a cart full of

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.690
cut-price DVDs and an assignment the

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.660
employee sets about his work though it

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.899
appears that he's not alone the first

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:42.750
oddity in this video is the card itself

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.600
watch the bottom left of your screen

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.459
this juddering unnatural movement is

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:53.459
strange enough but the employee doesn't

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:57.510
notice then a sudden push sees the cart

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.630
skidding along across the floor that

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.339
gets his attention for a while but

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:07.649
eventually he goes back to work

00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:11.640
shrugging off the abnormality but not

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.940
for long keep your eye on the leftmost

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.160
portion of the shell that the employee

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.699
has just stocked the DVD falls off the

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:23.610
shelf seemingly pushed by some invisible

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.380
force it is placed back but falls again

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.339
then another this time on the back

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:35.160
shelves and another in the foreground

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.970
followed by the first falling yet again

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.660
at this point the employee is truly

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.570
spooked

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.670
and hastily makes his exit from the

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.730
obnoxiously haunted shop front while

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.280
each of these individual aspects can be

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.070
attributed to many things stored kinetic

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.480
energy in the wheels of the cart

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.610
releasing at the right moment to send

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.680
the cart wheeling forward across a

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.590
possibly sloped floor and potentially

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.840
crooked shells resulting in the falling

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.200
DVDs it's important to note two things

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.770
firstly the direction the cart moves in

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.470
and the direction the DVDs fall in are

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.590
directly opposed it would take a

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.780
significant coincidence for the stores

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.630
floor to have been built incorrectly and

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.120
for the shelves to have also been

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.150
manufactured poorly the second is the

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.790
pattern of a xem for lack of a better

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.420
term the entire series of events occurs

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.540
with superb comedic timing it is

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.060
unquestionably amusing to watch the

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.820
employee growing more and more disturbed

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.910
by the perfectly timed occurrences and

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.280
it's really not much of a stretch to

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.740
attribute these actions to those of a

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.020
poltergeist of sorts with a playful

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.710
temperament there are tales older than

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.860
time that talk of trickster spirits that

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.470
amuse themselves by teasing the hapless

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.410
and the unfortunate and while such

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.290
stories are usually disregarded as

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.480
little more than imaginative fairy tales

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.260
it is definitely possible from examples

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.840
like this footage to see how such tales

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.010
developed so a spiritual prankster or a

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.310
series of disturbing events I leave it

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:29.320
for you to decide from playful spirit to

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.350
malevolent dead doctors there are things

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.760
out there that we simply don't

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.610
understand be sure to keep your eyes

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.220
open you never know what you might find

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.630
lurking just out of sight if you find it

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.210
mysterious share and like this video

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.170

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.540
