00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.170
All right there is
an incredible family

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.420
that I want to tell you about.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.590
Chris and Christina Sanders are
a couple from Cincinnati, Ohio

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.500
who have 11 children, 11.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.790
But here's what's amazing.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.130
In the past A-- this
past April, they

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.440
adopted six of those
children after meeting them

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.060
in the foster care system.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.680
They're all siblings,
and the Sanders

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.846
wanted them to be able to
stay together as a family.

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:24.150
So they adopted all six at once.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.170
So right now--

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.680
I know.

[CROWD CHEERING]

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.740
Right now the whole family is
on the Warner Brothers Studio

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.730
tour.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.010
But what they don't
know is they are

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.269
about to drive onto this stage.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.060
And they're going to
be guests on the show.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.310
So everyone has to be quiet
when they start getting close.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.410
There-- that's not them.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.720
We just have a cam-- a
random camera just to let--

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.440
Here it is.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.900
Here they come.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.355
All right, so as
they get closer--

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:02.220
All right, so they're turning,
so they're going to be here.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.555
Oh, so we have to be very quiet.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.430
Because they're going
to pull into the stage.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.980
So what's also just kind of
really exciting about this,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.670
and this is what I
love to do as well.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
First of all, we'll head
in through stage two.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.943
Are you guys fans
of the Ellen Show?

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:20.335
Yes.

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:20.835
Awesome.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:21.996
Ellen's show is cool, bro.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:22.540
I know.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.040
I know.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.464
They finished filming earlier
today, which I say is exciting.

00:01:26.464 --> 00:01:28.380

gives me the opportunity

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.581
to give you guys a really
behind the scenes look.

close and personal,

to do for you guys.

Yeah, so this is behind
the scenes, guys.

as it gets in stage two.

So you know, so a
lot of equipment,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.280

earlier about how many people

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.641
it takes to make a show.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.140
Yeah.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.940
And I think this is one of
the best examples of that.

Oh my God.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.860

know, my wife wanted

to be a foster parent early on.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.296
Because she always liked
to take care of kids.

back and help people.

I just-- you know,

it was just a natural
progression for us to foster,

took the classes in December.

did we want to take some kids.

boys, and then you

didn't realize they had sisters.
