00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
I want to talk to you about camera
settings. Are they important? Are they not

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.790
important? How important are they? And
more importantly still, what about my

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.540
camera settings and how did they relate
to you? Now this is quite complex, I've

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.450
got some notes here because I don't want
to miss anything out and you know me I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
do go off on a tangent. So look, I get
asked which settings are used for a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.689
specific photo so many times. In the
early videos are never used to post

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.400
settings because in all honesty they
have no value to you whatsoever they

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.270
really really aren't trust me, but I've
got winged and moaned at so often and 'oh

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.230
what setting did you use?' and 'what settings did you use?' that I have capitulated in the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.920
last couple of years - I do post
settings but there's a problem with them,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
not only are they irrelevant to you and
the shot you're taking, they may even

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.480
confuse you, because let's say you set
the settings that I use and then you go

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.050
to take a shot that's similar and then
you're not going to get the same result

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.020
and you're going to be going - why is that?
what are you done wrong? Browne you're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.439
talking a load of ass! Well yeah I get it
(note checking time)... So I mean look for them

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.570
to work you have got to be in the same
place as me, in the same light, taking the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.729
same shot, from the same place, in order
and with the same composition for my

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.180
settings to be of relevance to you. If
you were taking the shot you're looking

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.439
at in the video camera right this minute
you would have to be using exactly the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.130
same settings because right now I'm
backlit, the light is how it is - that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.200
could change in an instant.
Have a look at this picture of a young

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
monk with the Buddha, you've probably
seen it before because it is one of my

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.509
absolute favorite pictures that I've
ever taken. Would my settings for that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.579
photo work for you? How dark is the
temple you're photographing in? How many

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.509
candles are there? How much light have
you got coming off them? Do you want more

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.979
detail in the shadows or do you want it
dark and moody like I have? Settings do

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.350
not give you pictures it's completely
the other way around. Also settings

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.610
change from one moment to the next, right
now we've got a little bit of blue sky

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.020
going on, the sunshine behind me, the
light's pretty constant but what if it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
changing? What about these shots here
that I took in Iceland? That's all the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.090
same location they were all taken
probably within 20 minutes of each other

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.160
but look at those clouds in the sky.
Can you imagine how much light levels

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.930
were changing? So I can't say let's use
these settings to shoot a picture of the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.520
plane wreck because it's got nothing to
do with the subject and everything to do

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.750
with how you want your picture to look,
plus you've got to move and juggle and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.360
and bend around according to the
changing environment. Let's go take a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.050
look at this because behind me
I got a huge great stoater of a church.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.600
Let's go and take some pictures of it
I'm gonna get me a bag. Brilliant right..

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.280
So I've got a shot set up, I've got a
huge great stoater of a church in the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.760
background lit up in the sun, but also
look I've got these little, twiggy

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.630
branches, this is what starts to make
more interesting pictures not settings.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.470
Let's take some shots because I just
want to show you that generally speaking

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.620
it makes no difference what settings you
use at all, particularly if you're using

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
a short wide-angle lens. If you're using a
longer lens you've got to think about

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.880
camera shake, got about got to think
about freezing movement and that's a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.280
whole other world of thing. Let me just
show you I'm going to take the same shot with

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.820
a whole bunch of different settings. So
starting off let's go with f-18 because

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.590
then we'll see lots of depth of field, so f-18 and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.970
80th of a second and I'm hoping the
light won't change. Okay now let's change

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:43.620
our exposure let's go to f-11 and take a
shot. Let's go to now f-8, we now have

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.030
four hundredths of a second and take the
same shot now let's go to f-5.6 and take

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.670
the same shot. Now look you can see - look
at the setting combinations, you can see

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.390
how each shot has got different settings
but how different is the shot? Virtually

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.290
unnoticeable. These are the things you've
got to realize, settings don't give you

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.220
pictures, pictures give you settings.
You've got to pre visualize what you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.540
want to do in your head and then you
take the shot. By and large what settings

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.770
you use are mostly irrelevant, unless you
want to get creative. We're going to go

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.740
and look at that in a minute, I'm gonna
go see if I can find another picture for

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.759
you. Just now I was talking to you about the

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.360
changing clouds in the shots of the
plane wreck and how the light scanner

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.199
change. Well that is obviously going to
have a huge impact on the settings you

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.949
use. So let's say you go to the same
location as me but the light's different

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.060
there's a bit of haze in the air for example,
your settings are going to be completely

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.220
different to mine - and there's more to it -
but first - light, look, you remember Lobby

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.400
the lobster that killer crustacean that
invaded Bournemouth Beach in the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.810
Ultimate Beginners Course? He's come out
in the sun because he loves it, look he's

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.620
even stolen my raspberry Bakewell tart
and had rather a large bite out of it

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.479
I can't say I blame him you know raspberry Bakewell and all... but look the light now, if you look up at the

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.050
clouds here, if you look up at the sun
right, they're feathered. The light is

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.580
feathered, it's on the edge of a cloud.
Look at the sun, right - you

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.419
see how it's feathered? Can you see that
Ben or is the exposure to great? - Just

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.800
about. Okay, where that light is feathered
it's on the edge of a cloud, the light

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.590
levels going up and down up and down up
and down. That means you're going to be

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.889
changing your settings every single
second, every single moment - as you're

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.630
shooting your pictures. Let's have a
little look at this, let's set up a shot

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:42.910
with Lobby. If I use a nice
sensible middle aperture like FA

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.080
Here we go - sorry it's getting windy, I
know you can hear the noise. I'm gonna

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.120
get in close under a wide wide shot. 
Now look in this light, all right you see

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.180
we've got a shot like that over Lobby
the lobster and he's a bit dark and he's

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:08.050
a bit dull, it's about the right exposure
and our settings are one 640 at

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.990
f-8 but if that sun comes out which it
will in a moment, we're just gonna wait

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:25.540
for it.... like this - let's see what happens.
Same shot. What are our settings going to

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.295
be now that the sun has come out? 
Let's just get our shot set up and take it.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:40.180
Look, so we've gone from a six fortieth
to and eight hundredths of a second with

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.910
the same aperture because the light
changed. So I can't tell you what the

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.730
light's doing where you are so I can't tell
you what settings you need to use but

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.050
there's another one too. If you change
the distance from the subject to the

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.890
camera but you want the same bokeh 
background blur effect that I've got

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.550
you're gonna have to use different
settings, let me prove it to you. Again

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:04.270
well no look - you've just seen lobby f-8
right, taken at about this distance. Now

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.750
if I move further back - I'm going to try and do it 
before the light changes. Let's just move

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.550
further back, let's extend this distance -
take the same shot again using the same

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.730
aperture with Lobby occupying the same
space in the frame, FA there we go...

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:26.050
If you look at the background bokeh
effect, you will see that in the first

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.840
shot when I was closer with a wider lens
it's sharper than further back. So if you

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.230
want to maintain the same level of
background sharpness or bokeh what are

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.230
you going to have to do? You're going to
have to change your settings, you're

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.540
gonna have to - I'm going to prove it to
you - stop down quite a bit probably I'm

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.440
just guessing, I'm just going to guess
and go with roundabout f-16 how do I

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.930
know it's f-16?
I don't, I'm guessing yeah I'm using

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.410
experience because I've been shooting
for donkey's years. I just want to show

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.860
you, yeah that's pretty similar, I think

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.400
that's pretty similar, but you see I had
to change the aperture to manage the

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.830
depth of field. Let's go and talk about
this a little bit more. Come on Lobby and

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.270
get off my cake. I came over here to have
a chat with you because it's great we've

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.540
been larking around with lobsters and
bits of cake and stuff but what I've got to

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.390
say is really very important and I
wanted my little notes because I don't

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.350
want to go off piste, I don't want to leave
anything out. Photography works in

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.510
reverse to the way most people believe
it does. Settings do not give you images

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:34.510
images give you settings. First you've
got to know what the different settings

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.640
do to the appearance of an image, you've
got to be able to just do it like that.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.560
When you see amazing pictures online and
on Facebook and in other places the

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.520
photographer knows what they're doing
like that. The camera doesn't take the

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.440
picture, the photographer takes the
picture by using their knowledge of

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.660
light and composition etc and how to
string their settings together in order

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.820
to get the image. First you pre-visualize
what you want and then you set your

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.710
settings appropriately to capture it, and
if your images are not what you want

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:15.660
you've got to learn how to do that. Also
think about which autofocus modes to use.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.720
Autofocus isn't just autofocus, don't
give all your responsibilities away to

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.100
the camera. The camera has no idea what
you want to focus on, you've got to

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.110
choose the auto focus mode that's
appropriate to your shot, then the camera

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:34.330
will deal with the auto focusing, leaving
you free to be creative, to think about

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.310
which aperture or shutter do I want to
manage the portrayal of movement or

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.700
sharpness? Depth of field? Back to front
in the image/ Where do I stand?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.720
When do I click? What's the light doing?
If you're just stood there endlessly in auto -

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.370
full auto everywhere focus mode and
you're going 'oh it's not in the... why

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.400
won't it do what I want it to do..?' It's
because you're not telling it what you

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.589
want it to do. Shutters and apertures
they have two functions I just mentioned

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:05.230
it. So shutters manage how you portray movement and apertures manage how

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.690
much sharpness you have front to back in the picture,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.340
also known as depth of field. You saw
when we were messing around with Lobby

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.150
over there that to manage the same
amount of sharpness from my settings to

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.660
a short you want to take, if you change
the distance you've got to change the

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.700
settings too, to get the same result. This
is so important guys I really really

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.200
can't emphasize this enough. You
pre-visualize your image and then you

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.880
work back from that pre-visualization to
give you the settings that you want and

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.330
you know what? The good news is there's
only about five or six settings you

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.320
actually need to know how to control.
Nearly everything else on your camera is

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.770
guff and it's put there by marketing
people. There is a multi-million dollar

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.040
marketing machine telling you that this
camera will do everything for you, this

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.360
camera is awesome, this camera will take
the best picture ever... Yeah well they're

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.300
not lying it is awesome, it will take the
best picture ever but what you're not

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.660
seeing is the pictures they're showing
you have probably been taken by a

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.610
world-class photographer using that
camera. Not someone who's just thought I

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.300
want to get a camera I'm going to take
some shots. Did you notice the light

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.200
just change then? Did you see that? These
are the things you've got to recognize

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.110
the lights change, now I'm going to have to
change my settings, how is it going to

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.700
affect my picture? This is the stuff that
makes a photographer - not the camera and

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.720
certainly not my settings... and that's why
I'm always reluctant to tell you what

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.310
they are. This is when my settings will
probably confuse you, I know I'm having a

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.450
bit of a rant here so learn how to
utilize the settings that I have

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:40.540
mentioned. Learn how to pre visualize,
use your imagination. Lots of people say

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.770
yeah but Mike I'm not very creative, well
get creative! That's all you've got to do.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.700
Listen you think you're not creative? You
do a thousand creative things every day,

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.780
you think of which route are you going
to use to drive to the shop? So like oh

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.630
this week shall I go that way, well
actually it's a nice day I'll go that way,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.720
we'll go the pretty way, it's nice
scenery, I've got a bit of spare time - I'm

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.870
in a mad tearing hurry, I'll go that way -
I'm going to take the shortcut around

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.220
the back roads because it's really
really busy, it's rush hour. That is

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.750
creative thinking, all you've got to do
is just harness that creativity into a

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:16.270
different direction. You got to practice
practice, practice. Imagine taking photos

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.920
in your head even when you haven't got the

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.080
camera. You've got to learn how to really
really see what's around you when you go

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.500
out to take pictures. Stop talking to
your mates about 'Oh I saw this deal on

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.600
eBay for this lens or that camera' and 'oh
my mate Graham's bought an F2.8 ooh woopie doo!'

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.260
I'm sorry if I sound sarcastic
these things are so unimportant.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.830
Understanding how a handful of camera
settings work and practicing with them

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.580
will make the world of difference. If
you're out on safari you're in Africa

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.960
you've arrived out there on the valgia,
your elephant comes out from behind the

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.830
acacia tree and flaps his ears as the
sun's setting and the dust is all awesome in

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.620
the air. If you practiced with a plastic
lobster in a park somewhere, you're gonna

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.320
go - oh look elephant - marvellous. Click click click click

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.270
Bam Bam Bam Bam oh look at that Bam Bam
Bam. Meanwhile everyone else in the back

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.230
of the Safari Landrover is gonna be going
- oh oh oh I don't know what to do - oh put

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.400
it on auto and your pictures are gonna
win, your pictures will get thousands

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.200
of likes and all that good stuff. Their's won't, their's will probably be a mess.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.670
Practice with your lobster. What else was
I gonna say? So you know that's probably

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.180
about all there is to say about it,
there's millions and millions of

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.000
free videos about all this stuff. If you
haven't understood fully what I was

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.870
doing like when I was changing the
distance and altering the Bokeh or blur

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.260
or whatever you want to call it in the
background. If you don't understand that

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.040
you've got to find out. There's millions of
free stuff available online where you

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.220
can do that, but also think about
investing in yourself,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.850
my Ultimate Beginners Course will take
you through all of this stuff - and so

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.850
much more. 
It costs so much less than a bit of used

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.410
equipment and it will be a massive
investment for you. Of course you can

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.100
look it up online for free, but how do
you know what to learn in what order?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.850
Which bit of information do you need
first to avoid getting completely

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.910
confused? This photographer said to do
this and I'm doing it and it's not working...

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.700
It's because you've got a bit of
information missing that should be in

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.540
the slot before you get to that. There -
that is what you're doing when you buy a

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.650
course. You're paying for me to be your
guide to give you a little push now and

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.900
then as well to help you get what you want.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.620
Of course I want you to buy of course, it's
how I make a living but it has to work

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.770
for you too and that's why they've got
guarantees and free samples so go and

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.680

it! That's the most important thing, so
hopefully this has been a value to you

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.220
and I'm sorry I've had a bit of a rant
and given you rather a lecture but you

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.260
know it's my job as a trainer and coach
to coach you, if I don't push you

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.790
then it's not gonna make any difference
is it? If you employ a fitness trainer

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.610
who just sits on the running machine
with you eating doughnuts

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.680
you're not gonna get any fitter are you?
You're just gonna get fatter like me eating blooming Bakewell!

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.930
So it's my job to push you to
be a little bit harsh sometimes and

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:13.130
all my free videos are available on my
website. They have free accompanying

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.250
articles with them as well, with some
useful links to other resources from

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.180
time to time. So if you'd like to sign up
to my newsletter which is also up here

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.500
popping out now, then I'll send you some
free tips each week and always let you

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.980
know when there's a new video with an
accompanying article on my website which

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.150
may be a better place for you to go and
have a look at it. So I'd love to hear
