00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.130
 As if black holes and neutron
stars aren't weird enough,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.330
physicists have very good reason
to believe that there are even

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.000
stranger stellar
remnants out there,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.445
stars made entirely of quarks.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.706
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.330
The mathematics
of modern physics

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.000
that emerged through
the 20th century

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.160
explained so much
about our universe.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.259
But the same mathematics
also hid some surprises.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.010
There are monsters lurking
in that math, predictions

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.470
of phenomena so
extreme and bizarre

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.650
that, as with any
monster, it was

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.860
hard to know whether to
credit them with reality.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.380
The most wonderfully
monstrous of these

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.070
are the remnant corpses
of the most massive stars,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.150
stellar zombies like neutron
stars and black holes.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.890
Einstein's general
theory of relativity

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.930
tells us that the
core of a dead star

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.200
must collapse under its
own incredible weight.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.950
What happens to the resulting
ultra-dense material

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.080
depends on quantum theory.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.600
We've already talked about
how quantum processes

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.390
save a neutron
star from collapse,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.020
but ultimately also
doom the most massive

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.990
to collapse into a black hole.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.860
But just shy of that
final transition,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.790
and on the fringe of our
understanding of the quantum

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.150
universe, a star may
become very strange indeed.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.830
Literally, I'm talking
about strange stars.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.080
Before we can understand
strange stars,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.060
we need to start with
a stellar remnant

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.280
that we know for sure
exists, the neutron star.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.110
These are weird enough
all on their own.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.840
They are created in the final
collapse of a very massive

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.010
stellar core after it has
exhausted all possible fusion

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.630
fuel supplies.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.090
In that collapse, most of
the electrons and protons

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.360
are crunched together
to form neutrons.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.920
At a radius of
around 10 kilometers,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.260
the collapsing core
is suddenly halted

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.470
when those neutrons hit an
absolute limit of density,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.180
which I'll come back to.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.970
The rest of the in-falling star
collides with the new neutron

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.510
star and ricochets outwards
in the most powerful explosion

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.710
in the universe, a supernova.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.940
The remaining neutron
star is millions

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.700
of Kelvin in temperature,
and may be spinning

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.980
thousands of times per second.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.500
Its immense magnetic field
drives jets of material

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.300
at extreme speeds.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.520
These jets may sweep
across the Earth

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.060
due to the spinning-top-like
procession of the neutron star.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.660
We see these as pulsars.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.110
Our understanding
of neutron stars

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.060
seems to fit the
behavior of pulsars

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.330
very well, at least
for most of them.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.600
But for some, we see hints of
weird things happening deep

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.690
beneath the star's surface,
which we'll get to.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.060
For ordinary neutron
stars, that surface

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.240
is a thin crust of iron,
which quickly gives way

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.080
to a fluid of almost pure
neutrons, neutronium,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.690
the densest known
substance in the universe.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.470
A cubic centimeter
weighs a billion tons.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.200
Like I said, this is the
absolute limit of density.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.160
Well, nearly, as we'll see soon.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.040
Neutronium is
degenerate matter, and I

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
don't mean that in the same
way that your parents probably

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.230
used the word.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.400
Degenerate matter
is so compressed

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.070
that particles can't
get any closer together

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.160
without occupying the
same quantum states.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.440
The Pauli exclusion
principle states

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.590
that this is forbidden
for fermions,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.650
the family of particles
that neutrons belong to.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.630
We don't know nearly
as much as we'd like

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.970
about the nature of neutronium.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.370
We can't make this
stuff in labs.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.350
And we certainly can't
test what happens to it

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.040
when subjected to the insane
pressures at a neutron star's

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.180
core.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.760
In those conditions,
individual neutrons

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.050
are packed so tight that
they begin to overlap.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.130
This may cause neutrons to
dissolve into their component

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.510
quarks.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.530
This so-called quark matter is
its very own type of bizarre.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.390
We think that a type
of gas-like quark

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.330
matter, a so-called
quark-gluon plasma,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.200
filled the entire universe until
around a millionth of a second

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.709
after the Big Bang,
the Quark Epoch.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.410
And we have good
reason to think that,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.590
because we can actually make
this stuff in our largest

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.360
particle accelerators.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.090
Minuscule flecks of
quark-gluon plasma

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.030
exist for tiny
fractions of a second

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.760
after very high-speed
particle collisions.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.580
We can study its nature
based on the particles that

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.160
decay from it.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.560
However, the quark matter
in a neutron star is forged

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.790
by insane pressures, not by the
greater-than-a-trillion-Kelvin

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.290
temperatures of the Quark Epoch
or the Large Hadron Collider.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.040
In that state, it forms
a superfluid rather than

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.020
a plasma, a superfluid even
denser than neutronium.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.050
We sometimes call a neutron
star with such a quark matter

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.490
core a quark star.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.020
Now, neutrons are comprised
of one up and two down quarks.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.460
Quark matter made
of these quark types

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.920
would need to be confined
by incredible pressures

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.070
to maintain stability
outside the atomic nucleus.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.710
So that probably rules
out having an entire star

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.680
made of this stuff, unless the
quark matter is also strange.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.990
It may be that when
neutrons disintegrate

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.380
under high pressure,
half of the down quarks

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.140
are converted to strange quarks.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.210
The result is strange matter.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.760
It's a special type
of quark matter.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.040
It has three quark
types instead of two,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.630
and that means more particles
can occupy the lowest quantum

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.550
energy states.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.060
It's as though the quarks trick
their way around the Pauli

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.300
exclusion principle
by having some of them

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.790
put on silly disguises.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.460
This lower energy state
means that strange matter

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.570
may be the most stable form
of matter in the universe,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.940
more stable even
than iron, which is

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.100
the most stable atomic nucleus.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.800
A star made entirely
of this stuff

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.900
should be completely stable.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.230
And if they exist, they
could exist forever.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.140
We call these strange stars.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.860
Not content even with this
level of weirdness, physicists

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.690
have proposed even more mad
ideas for neutron star cores.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.735
If the density is high enough,
the conditions at the core

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:37.250
may be so extreme that
they resemble the time even

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.305
before the Quack Epoch.

00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:42.290
At less than a billionth of
a second after the Big Bang,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.890
the fundamental forces of nature
were not as we know them today.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.350
The electromagnetic force
and the weak nuclear force

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.920
were unified as the
electroweak force.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.940
It could be that neutron
stars have an electroweak

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.120
core, an apple-sized ball with
the mass of two Earths in which

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.760
quarks themselves burn.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.450
The outflowing energy is
almost all in neutrinos.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.940
And those may provide
the final pressure

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.690
that halts the collapse of
some stars into a black hole,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.520
at least for another
million years or so.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.020
OK.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.610
This is fun stuff.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.830
And it keeps theoretical
physicists off the streets.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.670
But can we test any
of this madness?

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.050
Well, yes.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.190
Have we?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.900
Maybe.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.030
Take the case of 3C58.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.580
In the year 1181, Chinese
and Japanese astronomers

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.810
recorded a new star in the
constellation of Cassiopeia.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.940
It faded over six months.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.390
But nearly 1,000 years later,
after some small technological

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.240
advancements, we pointed
our radio telescopes

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.500
and then the orbiting Chandra
X-ray Observatory to that spot

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.310
and found a young pulsar,
a rapidly rotating neutron

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.640
star 10,000 light years distant.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.410
Now, this wasn't so unexpected.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.450
After all, the pulsar
in the Crab Nebula

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.940
was also observed as a supernova
by Chinese astronomers in 1054,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.010
except something was
weird in the case of 3C58.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.480
The x-ray data revealed a
surface temperature of a more

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.480
million Kelvin, much
cooler than expected

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.270
for a neutron star of its age.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.270
A possible explanation is
that a quark matter core

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.120
formed at the heart
of this neutron star

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.940
and is slowly transforming
into strange matter.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.390
As down quarks flip into the
more massive strange quarks,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.340
they have to absorb
energy from somewhere

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.380
to provide for that extra mass.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.909
That energy would be the heat
energy of the neutron star.

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:46.450
There are other
candidates that could

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.920
be quark and/or strange stars.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.030
Some appear a little bit
too small for their mass,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.820
suggesting quark
matter densities.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.760
Then there are supernovae
that appear way too bright

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.440
and last too long.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.270
And it's been
hypothesized that these

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.560
may be due to a second explosion
as the neutron star collapses

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.110
further into a quark star.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.080
Even the famous
supernova that exploded

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.930
in the Large Magellanic
Cloud in 1987

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.740
has been hypothesized to have
left behind a quark star.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.620
The dying star shouldn't
have been massive enough

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.680
to leave a black hole,
yet astronomers still

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.110
haven't found the
expected neutron star

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.330
at the location
of the supernova.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.050
Nothing is confirmed yet, but
there are tantalizing hints

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.220
that these exotic stars,
these monsters in the math,

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.350
may be very real.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.930
Who knows what other
strange denizens lurk in

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.660
yet to be discovered
laws of physics?

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.820
And who knows which
are actually out there,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.480
waiting to be discovered in
the expanse of spacetime?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.170
Hey, guys.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.150
Two exciting announcements.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.300
Number one, we thought
about it long and hard

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.870
and we decided that we want to
keep making Space Time forever

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.290
and ever and ever and ever,
and to keep making it better

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.100
along the way.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.100
That leads to number two.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.120
We could really use your
help with number one.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.340
And now there's a way.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.750
We're finally on Patreon.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.540
If you care to, head over
there and maybe throw a buck

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.470
or a few our way each month.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.700
It'll really help us keep
pushing Space Time forward.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.400
Also, there are some
pretty sweet rewards.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.740
But mostly, thanks for watching.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.270
That's incredible
support all by itself.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.360
So last week we talked
about a new study

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.640
that suggested that
dark energy may not

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.730
be all that we thought it was.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.280
Turns out dark energy
probably is still real.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.740
But it did provoke some
really interesting discussions

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.320
in the comment section.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.010
Now, pixel girl asks whether
in a curved 3D space, shouldn't

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.711
the triangles appear flat to us?

00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:52.210
OK.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.360
So this is a great
opportunity for me

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.170
to correct some misconceptions
that other people had.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.880
And I'll get back
to this question.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.540
So when I say that the
universe is flat, of course

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.740
I don't mean that it's
flat like a pancake.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.090
It's definitely spatially
three-dimensional.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.850
A flat 3D space
means that the rules

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.790
of geometry in that
space work just like on

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.030
an actually flat 2D surface.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.530
I referenced a
previous video when

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.750
I made that statement in last
week's dark energy episode.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.980
So if I say something
that sounds dumb,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.470
I encourage you to take a
second to make sure you at least

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.160
glance at the resources I
provide to justify or explain

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.450
that statement.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.000
If I still sound
dumb, by all means

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.670
hit the comments in
all caps, because I'm

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.620
sure I say a good amount
of genuinely dumb stuff.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.570
Anyway, back to you, pixel girl.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.690
So a giant triangle in
geometrically curved space

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.750
will definitely have weird
angles, less than 180 degrees

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.570
for a hyperbolic
geometry, more than 180

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.940
for a spherical geometry.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.450
But you are correct in thinking
that besides the angles,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.150
the triangles will
actually look flat.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.450
Your comparison was
for people living

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.000
in a 2D flatland universe
that has the geometry

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.430
of the surface of a 3D sphere.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.580
A flatlander analyzing a
triangle in that universe

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.760
would measure its angles to
be greater than 180 degrees,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.970
but would also not
see the triangle

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.330
curve over in the sense that
there would be no horizon.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.670
That's because light
would also have to follow

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.070
the curve of that space.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.540
Same with triangles in
a curved 3D universe.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.090
We wouldn't see the
triangle arc over.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.050
That arc occurs in an
imaginary fourth dimension

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.660
that is analogous to the radial
dimension of the 3D sphere.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.120
But it isn't actually
part of this universe.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.320
A lot of you asked for a video
on De Brogile-Bohm pilot wave

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.610
theory.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.500
OK, but only because
you asked nicely.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.980
Now, a lot of you,
and I mean a lot,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.480
also want me to talk about Erik
Verlinde's entropic gravity,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.180
and the possibility that it
might explain both dark matter

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.370
and dark energy.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.610
To do that, I'm going to have
to go through the black hole

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.240
information paradox, Hawking
radiation, some string

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.370
theory, the holographic
principle, other stuff.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.120
Fine.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.070
But don't say you
didn't ask for it.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.040
Pipe2DevNull suggests that the
finger slit light diffraction

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.340
test can be used as a secret
salute when the science

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.130
deniers finally take over.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.020
Stay strong, comrades.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.070
