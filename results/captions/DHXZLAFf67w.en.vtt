00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.754
THE ONLY THING TRUMP'S EVER
PRAYED FOR IS MORE BREAKFAST.

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:09.655 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
IN THE VERY FIRST WORDS OF HIS

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.423
SPEECH, TRUMP MADE A PROMISE.

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:13.959
&gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
I CAN SAY THAT.

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:16.328 align:start position:0%
NEVER.

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:17.930 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: DID THE PRESIDENT
JUST RICK-ROLL THE PRAYER

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:19.498 align:start position:0%
BREAKFAST?

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:21.634 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.103 size:81% position:41%
NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN
NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.572 align:start position:0%
DESERT YOU.

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:32.077 align:start position:0%
UNLESS YOU JUST GAVE BIRTH, THEN
I'M GONNA BOINK A PORN STAR."

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.347 align:start position:0%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY?

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.883 align:start position:0%
TOO FAR?

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:39.385 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
REALLY?

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:39.852 align:start position:0%
I'M SORRY.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.053 align:start position:0%
I APOLOGIZE.

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:44.890 align:start position:0%
I DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAD SO MANY
PORN STARS HERE TONIGHT.

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:46.926 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THEN HE LISTED WHAT OUR NATION

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.962 align:start position:0%
HAS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE POWER
OF PRAYER.

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:54.600 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR
NATION, MANY OF OUR GREATEST

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:59.104 align:start position:0%
STRIDES FROM GAINING OUR
INDEPENDENCE TO ABOLITION OF

00:08:59.137 --> 00:09:05.044 align:start position:0%
CIVIL RIGHTS...

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:16.055 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:19.325 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: ABOLITION OF CIVIL
RIGHTS?

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:20.559 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"OOPS, I ACCIDENTALLY READ NEXT

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
YEAR'S SPEECH."

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
HIS MOUTH ALSO SAID THIS --

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:33.138 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AMERICA'S POTENTIAL IS
UNLIMITED BECAUSE OUR

00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:37.943 align:start position:0%
EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE ARE JUST
SOMETHING THAT IS NUMBER

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:43.282
ONE...NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO.

00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HE'S TALKING LIKE

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.451
THEY SPUN HIM AROUND TEN TIMES,
PULLED THE BAG OFF HIS HEAD, AND

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:46.919 align:start position:0%
PUSHED HIM ON STAGE.

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:53.626 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"AMERICA -- AND I MEAN THIS FROM

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:59.565
THE BOTTOM OF IT -- AMERICA --
AMERICA ARE NUMBER ONE, WHEN

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:04.403
THEY WENT THE JOURNEY, LOVE AND
FRIEND, AND I'LL SAY THAT TO

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
ANYONE, WHERE AM I?"
( APPLAUSE )

00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:13.312 align:start position:0%
"THEN GAME MARCO -- MARCO --

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:15.581 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU ."

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:18.617 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
THEN CAME TRUMP'S LEAST FAVORITE

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.818 align:start position:0%
PART OF ANY SPEECH, TALKING
ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO

00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
AREN'T HIM.

00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:26.225
&gt;&gt; THIS SATURDAY, PASTOR BRUNSON
WILL WALK HIS DAUGHTER DOWN THE

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.861 align:start position:0%

CONGRATULATIONS.

00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:38.337 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HIS SPEECH JUST
BROKE NEWS TO HIMSELF.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.238 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
(AS TRUMP)

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.873 align:start position:0%
"AS YOUR PRESIDENT-- AM I STILL
PRESIDENT?

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.808 align:start position:0%
WOW, THAT LASTED LONGER THAN I
THOUGHT.

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:47.112 align:start position:0%
MUELLER HASN'T GOT ME YET?"
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:49.381 align:start position:0%
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:50.883 align:start position:0%
CHRIS PRATT IS HERE!

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:55.220 align:start position:0%

STICK AROUND!
