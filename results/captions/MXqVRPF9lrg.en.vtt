00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.100
Welcome back to the Hormone Healing Show.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.300
Today I'm going to show you
five easy, effective steps

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.700
to break through insulin resistance

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.580
and lose that belly fat.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.912
Stay with me because the
fifth step is the key.

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:38.240
Remember, insulin resistance means most

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.580
of your cells are not
allowing insulin and sugar in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.260
except your belly fat cells.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.290
Remember the insulin
meter from my last video

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.960
on insulin resistance?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.450
A simple blood test called hemoglobin A1c

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.910
measures how insulin resistant you are.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.770
Insulin resistance is your body's way

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.520
of adapting to stress.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.640
But all that insulin and
sugar floating around

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.170
in your bloodstream is very inflammatory.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.360
Insulin resistance leads to heart disease,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.720
infertility, even cancer.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.570
If you follow these five
easy hormone healing steps,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.830
you're going to reverse
insulin resistance,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.730
reduce inflammation, and get
your trim waistline back.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.650
Hormone healing step number
one: Move more than you sit.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.020
People who are sedentary
have a much greater risk

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.140
for diabetes, heart disease, even cancer.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.200
You need to start moving.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.710
If you're sitting eight
to ten hours a day,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.330
you're going to have
more issues with obesity,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.010
and even inflammation.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.200
So what I want you to do is every hour,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.900
get up for five to ten minutes.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.410
And I don't care what you do.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.470
You can walk, you can jog, jump rope,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.020
dance around, just move.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.140
There was a study that was actually done

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.450
on overweight women.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.230
And what they found is

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.970
if they had the women exercise ten minutes

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.840
three times a day, over a
six month period of time,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.050
versus those women who
exercised 30 minutes

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.950
in one fell swoop,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490
those women who exercised
frequently during the day

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.480
lost weight and kept the
weight off much longer,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.640
up to 18 months versus the women

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.790
who exercise 30 minutes a day.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.020
Why would that be?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.120
Because when you get
in the habit of moving,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.960
you're going to break
that sedentary position

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.910
that you're always in,
and that's going to break

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.700
your insulin resistance.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.770
Hormone healing step number
two: Don't eat carbs after dark.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.540
If there is one thing that I
tell my overweight patients

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.850
to do is once dusk hits, you should not

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.210
eat any carbohydrates.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.820
I mean no sugar, no
starches, no pasta, no bread,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.330
no potatoes, no yams,
no alcohol, no juice,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.380
nothing starchy, nothing sugary.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.290
Why?

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.850
Because what are you doing after dark?

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.930
Are you exercising?

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.880
Probably not.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.360
You're not going to burn those calories,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.160
you're just going to store them.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.040
So if you're going to break
through your insulin resistance,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.720
you got to stop feeding
your body energy foods.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.560
Just proteins and fats, and
vegetables that are not starchy,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.910
those are great.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.490
Insulin resistance is reversed

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.160
by the sleep hormone melatonin.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.320
You're not going to give
it a chance to reverse it

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.550
if you're storing extra
carbohydrate foods.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.710
Hormone healing step number three:

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.220
Go to bed within a few hours of dusk.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.080
One of the biggest things
that you need to do

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.700
is to sleep in the dark.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.370
If you stay up too late, you're going

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.100
to suppress your melatonin production.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.900
Literally, as soon as
your eyes and your skin

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.530
perceives that pink sunset,
your body gets ready

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.480
to start making melatonin.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.240
If you're watching television,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.950
if you're on a digital device,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.960
you're going to suppress
that melatonin production.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.740
You need to go to bed
within a few hours of dusk,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.720
so you have a good eight
hours of melatonin production

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.130
to reverse your insulin resistance.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.967
I show you how to do this in my

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.410
"How to Sleep Naturally" video.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.570
Hormone healing step number
four: Meditate every day.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.410
Meditation has been shown
to reduce inflammation.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.680
Calming your nervous
system through meditation

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.330
can help lower stress
hormones, especially cortisol.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.610
Cortisol is the stress
hormone that initially

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.680
tells your body to release stored sugar

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.480
when it's under stress so you can use it

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.820
for the fight-or-flight.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.890
But if the stress does not require energy

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.610
for you actually burn,
where is that sugar going?

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.610
It's going right to your belly fat.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.440
In my next video I show
you a great meditation

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.570
that you can help lower stress hormones,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.250
and reverse your insulin resistance.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.530
Hormone healing step number five:

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.360
Raise your metabolism by
supporting your hypothalamus.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.480
Your hypothalamus is
just trying to save you

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.020
by storing body fat for the winter.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.670
If your lights are on all the time,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.160
and you eat a lot of carbohydrates,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.630
your hypothalamus thinks
it's perpetual summer.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.550
Summertime is when animals,
mammals particularly,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.760
fatten up for the winter to come.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.670
Our hypothalamus does
the same exact thing.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.120
When you're exposing it
to light all the time,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.140
and when you're eating
lots of carbohydrates,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.640
you gain weight so that
when the days are short,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.560
the nights are long, and there's no food,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.630
you can live off that stored body fat.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.220
But since winter never comes,
we continue to gain fat

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.530
all year long.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.260
You need to reverse that metabolic issue.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.420
And the way you do that is by
supporting your hypothalamus.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.300
It needs the right amino
acids and phytonutrients

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.770
just like my special hypothalamic blend

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.400
found in Genesis Gold.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.120
When your metabolism stays high,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.570
your stress response is low

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.343
and your body is fit and lean.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.640
Now you know how to
reverse insulin resistance.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.200
Yet it's not easy to lose
that inflammatory fat

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.730
if the rest of your
hormones are out of balance.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.610
So I created the hormone reboot training

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.760
for you to discover how to balance insulin

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.900
and all your hormones naturally.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.930
It's free.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.190
Just click the link in the
description below this video.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.120
So what's one thing you're going to do

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.300
to help reverse your insulin resistance?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.680
