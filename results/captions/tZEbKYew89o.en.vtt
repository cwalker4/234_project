&gt;&gt; If you thought yesterday's

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.305 size:78% position:39% line:92%
r.kelly interview was

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:10.377 line:92%
disturbing, that was just the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.543 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
beginning.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.711 line:92%
Natalie is on assignment.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.147 line:92%
Here we go. &gt;&gt; Here we go.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.115 line:92%
He was taken into custody

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.416 line:92%
yesterday and remains in jail

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.819 line:92%
for failing to pay more than

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.721 line:92%
$116,000 in child support.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.856 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Second time in just two weeks

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.759 line:92%
that he's been behind bars and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.394 line:92%
today what we're going to do is

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.895 line:92%
bring in right now -- talking

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.230 line:92%
about the interview, body

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.100 line:92%
language of both R. Kelly's

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.203 line:92%
girlfriend and foremost body

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:45.345 line:92%
language expert, Stacy Kaiser is

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:45.478 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
with us.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.281 line:92%
Is there a common theme you're

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:48.448 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
seeing?

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.082 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; There is.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.084 line:92%
I worked behind the scenes with

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.353 line:92%
the survivors and discovered

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.754 line:92%
most of them they really love

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:55.021 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
him.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.289 line:92%
They loved him and they love

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:56.689 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
him.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.658 line:92%
An enso even though he's hurt

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.428 line:92%
them and he's now arrested and

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:02.662 line:92%
they're glad about that, there's

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.497 line:92%
a pain inside of them and this

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.099 line:92%
longing because of how they feel

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:06.199 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
about him.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.370 line:92%
&gt;&gt; We saw that very similarly

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.939 line:92%
with James safechuck and Robson.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Michael Jackson.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.543 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Wasn't until Oprah brought up

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.812 line:92%
how you become complicit in the

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.280 line:92%
abuse that you trick yourself

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.615 line:92%
into believing the lie of this

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.217 line:92%
is how love is shown, this is

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:28.288 line:92%
how I show love, this is how you

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:28.855 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
reciprocate love.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.790 line:92%
&gt;&gt; That's 100% correct and I

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.560 size:81% position:41% line:92%
think there's an added

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:38.298 line:92%
R. Kelly I'm told is when he's

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.133 line:92%
good he's very, very good and

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.635 line:92%
when he's bad he's horrid.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.904 line:92%
It's like a slot machine.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.307 line:92%
It pays you and you keep holding

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.942 line:92%
out for the win but you're

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.577 size:84% position:42% line:92%
losing, losing, losing.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.413 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Let's look at more of R.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.381 line:92%
Kelly going off about his

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:55.715 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ex-wife.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.150 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; 13 years.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.986 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Being married.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.858 line:92%
I flew in on a helicopter.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.927 line:92%
I flew in on a helicopter.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.194 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.430 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Yes.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.732 line:92%
Can somebody get him some

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.266 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
tissues?

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.168 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I don't want a tissue.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.036 size:84% position:42% line:92%
I believe -- look, man.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:17.303 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Look.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.105 size:75% position:38% line:92%
I'm telling you all.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.909 line:92%
I flew in on a helicopter with a

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:28.915 line:92%
damn puppy and I -- proposed to

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.317 line:92%
her whom I was in love with.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:35.021 size:84% position:42% line:92%
And told her, hey look.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.322 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I make mistakes.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.857 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I'm not perfect.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
We got married.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.062 line:92%
We had three beautiful kids.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.432 line:92%
Not once have I ever had a

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.934 line:92%
domestic violence call at the

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.236 line:92%
house and all this, that and the

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:50.403 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
other.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.472 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
It never happened.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:57.777 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Talking about his ex-wife

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:57.977 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
there.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.546 line:92%
Just looking at his body L

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.680 line:92%
language alone, what do you make

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.048 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
of that?

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.850 line:92%
&gt;&gt; When people are lying they're

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.219 line:92%
not looking people in their eye.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.288 size:84% position:42% line:92%
That's a strong sign of

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:08.555 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
deception.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.891 line:92%
We see this is shaking his head

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.328 line:92%
no saying don't believe me.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.564 line:92%
Don't believe a word I'm seeing

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.433 line:92%
and I see this is a guy who's

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.235 line:92%
scared, pleading for his life.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.836 line:92%
If you imagine someone with a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.006 line:92%
firing squad in front of them

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.942 line:92%
and on their knees and arms

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.743 line:92%
flailing and he doesn't want the

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.744 line:92%
tissue because you doesn't want

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.581 line:92%
to stop the flow of tears.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.782 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Believe that they're real and

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:36.916 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
wipe them away --

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.417 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.719 line:92%
&gt;&gt; It also seemed like he was

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:43.223 line:92%
maybe trying to figure out what

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.290 line:92%
he was going to say next.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.425 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; 100%.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.093 line:92%
Searching back they're searching

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.294 line:92%
in the back of the mind and part

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.996 line:92%
of what we're seeing, I think

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.598 size:84% position:42% line:92%
real tears for himself.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.433 line:92%
He is sad that he thinks he is

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.500 size:88% position:44% line:92%
actually in trouble now.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.536 line:92%
I also think it's manipulative

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.204 size:84% position:42% line:92%
tears for the audience.

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.606 line:92%
Don't give me a tissue because I

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.941 size:88% position:44% line:92%
need to put on the show.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:02.976 size:78% position:39% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Only the positive.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.977 line:92%
The helicopter and the puppy.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.812 line:92%
&gt;&gt; That's the highlight reel.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.081 line:92%
He has to go back 20 years to

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.949 line:92%
come up with something nice he's

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.651 line:92%
done with his ex-wife to say I

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:13.286 line:92%
did great stuff and she made a

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:16.155 line:92%
choice to be with me so this

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:16.589 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
can't be true.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.390 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.525 line:92%
His ex-wife Adrian tells a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.161 line:92%
pretty different story of their

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:28.468 line:92%
marriage in the "Surviving R.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:28.534 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Kelly."

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:31.304 line:92%
She said she went to the hotline

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.238 line:92%
and on the list of 17 questions

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.139 line:92%
about abuse, she claims only two

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.276 line:92%
that R. Kelly hadn't done to

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.010 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
her.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:40.747 line:92%
Here's when she was asked about

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.981 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Does Adrian not tell the

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.583 line:92%
truth she was abused by you?

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:43.850 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Slult.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.485 line:92%
She is not telling the truth.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.353 size:75% position:38% line:92%
I love her to death.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.821 line:92%
I have nothing against her

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:49.389 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
still.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.157 size:88% position:44% line:92%
That is my kids' mother.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.725 line:92%
&gt;&gt; She is making that up why?

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.927 line:92%
Why is she making that up,

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.764 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'm not disrespecting her by

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.766 line:92%
saying she's not telling the

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:00.066 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
truth.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.501 size:81% position:41% line:92%
I'm just being honest.

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.436 line:92%
Somebody sent me some of my

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:08.308 line:92%
phone saying that I hogtied her.

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.076 size:84% position:42% line:92%
I never hogtied people!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.912 size:84% position:42% line:92%
Why would I hogtie her?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.247 line:92%
My kids is listening to this.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.850 size:78% position:39% line:92%
All of this nonsense.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.752 line:92%
I don't spend no time with them.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:20.453 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
This is real.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.354 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
This is not a lie.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:26.759 line:92%
What kind of woman would tear

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:28.061 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
down a dad?

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.395 size:81% position:41% line:92%
Who's trying to have a

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.863 line:92%
relationship with their kids.

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.265 line:92%
You know how many kids need a

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.700 line:92%
relationship with their father?

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.901 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What is your relationship

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:35.535 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
with your children.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:37.737 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Oh my god!

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:38.838 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What is your relationship

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.408 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
with your children?

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.376 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.044 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.047 line:92%
&gt;&gt; But I know my kids love me.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.449 line:92%
I'm in love with my kids.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.651 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I love my kids.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.585 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I don't know where to begin

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.152 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
on this.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.388 line:92%
Maybe start with the looping.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.323 line:92%
&gt;&gt; He is having a hard time

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.225 line:92%
sitting in his own skin and hard

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.560 line:92%
to be him today and part of why

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.061 size:81% position:41% line:92%
you see that movement.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.996 line:92%
The other thing I want to point

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.966 line:92%
out is how he is kind of hiding.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.201 line:92%
He is -- what he is trying to

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:11.037 line:92%
say to us is I don't want you to

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.939 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
look at me rightow.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:14.340 size:75% position:38% line:92%
Because he is upset.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.144 line:92%
He really truly does believe he

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.078 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
is in trouble.

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.981 line:92%
Not a way of I'm a bad man but

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.750 line:92%
don't look at me because I'm a

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.917 line:92%
mess right now and this is not

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.653 line:92%
how we typically see R. Kelly.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.888 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; No.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:29.889 line:92%
Never seen him like this.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:30.423 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Confident.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:31.958 line:92%
This is a man who really thinks

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
he is in trouble.

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:35.094 size:88% position:44% line:92%
As I said earlier, he is

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:37.397 size:81% position:41% line:92%
pleading for his life.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.931 line:92%
&gt;&gt; In the documentary that you

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.800 line:92%
also worked on, she talked about

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.368 line:92%
the 17 questions and some of the

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.604 line:92%
questions are pretty -- I mean,

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.439 size:78% position:39% line:92%
it is pretty intense.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:49.275 line:92%
Does -- are you insulted,

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.210 line:92%
demeaned or embarrassed and

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.578 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
receive putdowns?

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:56.883 line:92%
Look at you or act in ways that

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:56.949 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
scare you?

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.084 line:92%
Stop you from seeing your

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.719 line:92%
friends or family members?

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.456 line:92%
Make decisions without your

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:03.589 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
consultation?

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:05.425 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Destroy your property or

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.659 line:92%
threaten to kill your pets?

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:09.495 line:92%
The things on the list are clear

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.164 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
signs of an abusive

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.431 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
relationship.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:13.900 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; A lot of control.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.802 line:92%
But part of what we see of

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.004 line:92%
people that are narcissistic, I

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.572 line:92%
haven't met him but I believe

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:22.675 line:92%
he's narcissistic, sociopathic,

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.410 line:92%
he believes his own tale and

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:27.146 line:92%
people helped him, who have been

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.981 line:92%
complicit in really making these

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.249 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
women be abused.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.851 line:92%
So that sort of feeds the beast

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.654 line:92%
of what I am doing is okay.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:35.655 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Because I'm me.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.490 line:92%
I love these people and I also

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.491 size:75% position:38% line:92%
buy them nice gifts.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.759 line:92%
&gt;&gt; They love me back, right?

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:40.326 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.327 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Gayle talked to the two women

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.998 line:92%
who live with R. Kelly at his

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:46.999 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Chicago home.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.835 line:92%
A 23-year-old and 21-year-old

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.837 line:92%
and tearfully spoke out in his

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:51.337 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
defense, actually.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:52.138 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What is your relationship

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.841 line:92%
both of you with R. Kelly?

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.809 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; We're with him.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.743 size:88% position:44% line:92%
That's our relationship.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.444 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; We are with him.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.512 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; We live with him.

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:04.951 line:92%
&gt;&gt; We are in a relationship with

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:05.017 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
him.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:05.518 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; You just said it.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.085 line:92%
&gt;&gt; A very both relationship.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:06.385 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Both of you?

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:07.386 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Most definitely.

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:10.623 line:92%
&gt;&gt; How do we say this without

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:11.224 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
being appropriate?

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:11.891 size:81% position:41% line:92%
Do you have a separate

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.360 size:81% position:41% line:92%
relationship with him?

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:14.827 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
How does this work?

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.196 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Both of those.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:17.463 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Curious.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.197 size:78% position:39% line:92%
&gt;&gt; We have individual

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.165 size:84% position:42% line:92%
relationships with him.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:19.398 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.501 line:92%
&gt;&gt; We all are family together.

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.903 line:92%
We have moments to sit and watch

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:24.403 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
movies together.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.640 size:88% position:44% line:92%
We go to amusement parks

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:27.707 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
together.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.909 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:32.478 line:92%
I'm talking about is it a

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.880 line:92%
three-way sexual relationship?

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.414 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Sexually, first of all I'm

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.149 line:92%
not here to talk about my

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:38.050 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
personal life.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.887 line:92%
I don't never share with anyone

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:41.954 line:92%
what I do inside or outside of

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.756 line:92%
the bedroom and I'm sure you

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.657 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
wouldn't either.

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:45.558 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.559 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; So okay then.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.493 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:47.827 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Next question.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:48.694 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I would not.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:51.230 size:88% position:44% line:92%
This is a very different

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.264 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
circumstance.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.265 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&gt;&gt; It is not a different

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:52.598 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
circumstance.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.066 line:92%
There are people all over the

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.002 size:84% position:42% line:92%
world who have multiple

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:56.035 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
girlfriends.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:56.903 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
It is no different.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.838 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Do both of you all believe

00:08:58.838 --> 00:08:59.972 size:88% position:44% line:92%
you're in love with him?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:00.740 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.674 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:01.941 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Yes.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:03.576 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:03.709 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:04.510 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.612 line:92%
Let's start with the young

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.914 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ladies' outfits.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.248 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
What does that say?

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.217 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I think they were well put

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.084 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
together.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.986 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Somebody helped them put

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:19.058 line:92%
themselves together, hepdslped them

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:23.429 line:92%
get poised and look official and

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:26.332 line:92%
well taken care of and wearing

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:26.832 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
expensive clothing.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:31.070 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Is it the tone they were

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:32.505 size:78% position:39% line:92%
striking to Gayle in?

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:33.439 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I get it.

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:34.774 line:92%
It's a personal question and how

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.609 line:92%
you relate to a significant

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.544 line:92%
other but did it seem odd the

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:39.445 line:92%
way they came back at her?

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.514 line:92%
&gt;&gt; They're super defensive and

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:46.118 line:92%
super angry and they don't need

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.253 size:88% position:44% line:92%
to be if they don't have

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:47.954 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
anything to hide.

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.889 line:92%
It tells me that they're trying

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:50.790 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
to hide something.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.857 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Here's part of what I think

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:54.160 line:92%
is sad about the clip with these

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:54.694 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
young women.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.128 line:92%
They believe what they're

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:56.462 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
saying.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:59.031 line:92%
I'm sure they do go to amusement

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.433 line:92%
parks and do good things with

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.602 line:92%
him and do love him and so a lot

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.004 line:92%
of -- they're doing the emphatic

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.106 line:92%
body lack wage with emphasis of

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.140 line:92%
the hands and the head because

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:08.841 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
they mean it.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:09.875 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
They feel it.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:10.743 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
It's real for them.

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.578 line:92%
A lot of the lines they were

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:13.479 line:92%
spewing are things that they

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:14.513 size:75% position:38% line:92%
have learned to say.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.382 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I was going to say, it felt

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.383 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
like coached to me.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.319 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Interesting, by the way, R.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:21.454 line:92%
Kelly wasn't supposed to be in

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.388 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
the interview.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.358 size:81% position:41% line:92%
He comes in during the

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:26.826 line:92%
interview, stood between them

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.127 line:92%
coughing so they knew he was in

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.128 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
the room.

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.964 line:92%
The parents say brainwashed.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.332 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Is it more control?

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:33.933 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Control.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.267 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Can you tell?

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:35.534 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.738 line:92%
I think it's a combination.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:39.438 line:92%
The control has made them

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.106 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
believe something.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:42.842 line:92%
It is a lot like what you hear

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:44.677 line:92%
happening in a cult where they

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.678 line:92%
start to believe this is what

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.879 line:92%
their life is and it's a real

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.514 line:92%
story because that's the story

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:51.350 size:75% position:38% line:92%
that it is for them.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.518 line:92%
As far as part of what we are

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.220 line:92%
seeing with the parents and that

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.022 line:92%
kind of going against, I believe

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:59.892 line:92%
that R. Kelly has almost become

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.227 line:92%
their parent and don't need the

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.695 line:92%
parents anymore and why they're

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.896 line:92%
rejecting them and the fact he

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.097 line:92%
came in the room I want to

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:06.899 line:92%
address that, anyone that's a

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.501 line:92%
parent or a boss knows if you

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.202 line:92%
have to step in and watch

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.138 line:92%
someone doing their work you

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.039 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
don't trust them.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:13.172 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.007 line:92%
&gt;&gt; And so, he's making sure that

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.876 line:92%
they stay in line by being in

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:18.711 line:92%
the room and I think he is so

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.212 line:92%
scored that they blow his cover

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.547 line:92%
because like I said all the rage

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:23.482 line:92%
we are seeing is coming out of

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.850 line:92%
fear that he needs to make sure

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:25.985 size:78% position:39% line:92%
they know he's there.

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:28.220 line:92%
&gt;&gt; The two parents of the two

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.090 line:92%
women claim K. Kelly brainwashed

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:33.025 line:92%
their daughters and that they

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.194 line:92%
have proof that he had sex with

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:36.762 line:92%
them under age and here's what

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:37.930 line:92%
the women said about that.

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.499 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Why would they want to lie

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.001 line:92%
about you, their daughters?

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:42.968 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:44.770 line:92%
When I first met Robert, my

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:47.306 line:92%
parents told me to lie about my

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:47.540 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
age.

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:50.376 line:92%
So when I met him, he thought

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:51.110 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
that I was 18.

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.245 line:92%
On top of that, when I was 17,

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.581 line:92%
my parents were actually making

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.750 line:92%
me trying to get me to take

00:11:57.783 --> 00:12:00.352 line:92%
photos with him, take sexual

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.721 line:92%
videos with him, all kinds of

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.254 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
stuff.

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:03.189 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait.

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:04.356 line:92%
They encouraged you to do sexual

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:06.926 size:78% position:39% line:92%
videos with R. Kelly?

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:07.927 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.995 size:84% position:42% line:92%
Because if they have to

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.363 line:92%
blackmail him they can use it

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:12.598 line:92%
against him which is exactly

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:13.733 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
what they're doing.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.668 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I see you nodding a lot with

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.535 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
what she is saying.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.738 size:84% position:42% line:92%
Why are you noddings in

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:19.271 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
agreement?

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.107 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Because everything that she

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.042 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
is saying is true.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.176 line:92%
Our parents are basically out

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.878 size:84% position:42% line:92%
here just to get money.

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:27.279 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Your father told a very

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:27.780 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
different story.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.714 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well --

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:29.615 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; To me last night.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.550 line:92%
&gt;&gt; He is the manipulator.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.452 size:88% position:44% line:92%
He is very manipulative.

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:35.287 line:92%
He's the one you need to watch

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:35.821 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
out for.

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:39.258 line:92%
But my dad and my mom, they're

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.960 line:92%
sending threats to both me and

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.895 line:92%
they said I'll put your pictures

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:43.796 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
all over the world.

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:45.731 line:92%
I'm going to ruin you, ruin him.

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.568 line:92%
If he doesn't send $20,000 to

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:50.703 line:92%
this bank account by Monday I'm

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.605 line:92%
going to put everything out

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:53.706 line:92%
there and then $10,000 after

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.407 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
that.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:13:01.046 line:92%
You're trying to solicit me like

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:01.347 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I'm a [ bleep ].

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:01.981 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I'm your child.

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:03.682 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.818 line:92%
&gt;&gt; You sound very angry with

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:09.321 line:92%
your parents and very pained.

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.257 line:92%
Tell me why you're crying.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:11.624 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Tell me.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.093 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'm crying because you guys

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.028 size:78% position:39% line:92%
don't know the truth.

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.831 line:92%
You guys believe the [ bleep ]

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.667 line:92%
That our parents are saying.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:22.601 line:92%
This is all [ bleep ] For money.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.103 line:92%
And if you can't see that you're

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:26.005 line:92%
ignorant and you're stupid.

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:26.605 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Bleep ].

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.274 size:84% position:42% line:92%
Because you want to be.

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:29.175 line:92%
All because that's the world we

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.743 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
live in.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.177 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Negativity.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.946 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.447 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Rumors are what sell.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.016 line:92%
&gt;&gt; This is more than gossip.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:39.785 line:92%
This is more than just rumors.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:42.454 line:92%
These are decades of allegations

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.355 size:78% position:39% line:92%
against Robert Kelly.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.391 line:92%
&gt;&gt; We're not here to talk about

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:45.558 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
decades.

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.326 line:92%
We're here to talk about what

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:49.028 line:92%
our parents are doing right now.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:49.361 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:50.963 line:92%
&gt;&gt; This is all for money.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:51.096 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.865 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What do you make of that?

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.700 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Looks like two little girls.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.701 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.603 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Who have no idea what is

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.071 line:92%
happening to them and why people

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:03.509 line:92%
are concerned about them react

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:03.809 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
so emotionally.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.511 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:06.145 line:92%
I believe because they believe

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.079 line:92%
what they're saying and told

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:09.281 line:92%
that the parents are asking R.

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.816 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Kelly for money.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:11.717 line:92%
They're being told the parents

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:13.652 line:92%
are doing this for financial

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:15.554 size:84% position:42% line:92%
gain and for attention.

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:17.389 line:92%
They're being told all of these

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:18.824 line:92%
things and they believe it.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:20.826 line:92%
Part of what they have sort of

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.161 line:92%
described is this is their

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.195 line:92%
family now and people are super

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.997 line:92%
loyal and protective about the

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:26.198 line:92%
family and that is what we are

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:26.465 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
seeing.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.734 line:92%
However, seeing the ladies talk

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.669 line:92%
some of the time they aren't

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:33.505 line:92%
able to keep eye contact with

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:34.473 line:92%
Gayle and that tells me they

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.342 line:92%
know they're lying and also some

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.344 line:92%
moments where they're sort of

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.079 line:92%
trying to defend themselves and

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.014 line:92%
their choices and that's because

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:43.449 line:92%
they don't want to be looked at

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:44.850 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
in a bad light.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.919 line:92%
What do they look like if they

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:52.858 line:92%
believe and we believe that they

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:53.492 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ooef

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.660 size:84% position:42% line:92%
have been fools to man?

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.096 line:92%
They have to assert everything

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.297 line:92%
is wonderful to continue to

00:14:58.364 --> 00:14:59.932 line:92%
uphold the view that they have

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.100 line:92%
of themselves which is that

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
they're okay.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:02.768 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What about the anger against

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:06.205 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
their parents?

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.807 line:92%
At 17, you put me in this

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:09.441 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
situation.

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.277 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:11.410 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Listen.

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:12.278 line:92%
I don't know what happened in

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.212 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
the beginning.

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:15.114 line:92%
In terms of did the parent --

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.416 line:92%
were the parents saying this is

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.485 line:92%
a possible career for you?

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:20.853 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Totally possible.

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:23.622 line:92%
Are they doing desperate things

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:23.656 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
now?

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.789 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Yes.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:24.857 line:92%
However, these are some of the

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.458 line:92%
moemtds when I saw her starting

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.294 line:92%
to look away and fish for

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:32.131 line:92%
information and makes me think

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:32.498 line:92%
that she was trying to remember

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:33.966 line:92%
the story that she's supposed to

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.534 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What's interesting, too, to

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:36.802 line:92%
know that Gayle was on this

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:37.937 line:92%
morning talking about she

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.673 line:92%
reached out to the camp of R.

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.474 line:92%
Kelly and they said this is a

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.509 line:92%
great interview an pleased with

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.643 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
the joutd come.

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:46.312 size:81% position:41% line:92%
Did that surprise you?

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.180 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's smoke and

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
mirrors.

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:50.115 line:92%
I think they're pleased with the

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.984 line:92%
girls but I certainly can

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:52.551 line:92%
imagine they didn't think that

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:56.655 line:92%
R. Kelly would be as outrageous

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:57.656 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Unhinged.

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.158 line:92%
&gt;&gt; If they tell us they're

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.693 size:84% position:42% line:92%
pleased then the people

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:01.794 line:92%
following him believe it.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.497 line:92%
&gt;&gt; It felt like it was talking

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:08.000 line:92%
to potential jurors and trying

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:08.467 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
the case in public.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.935 line:92%
&gt;&gt; That's part of what he is

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:10.035 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
doing.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.337 size:78% position:39% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:12.137 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Really good stuff.
