AZEMAR.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.133 line:92%
YOUR MOM'S MOM WAS IN YOUR LIFE.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.333 line:92%
AND SHE LOOKED WHITE.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.100 line:92%
BUT YOUR MOM'S DAD WAS NOT IN

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.800 line:92%
YOU DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.000 line:92%
BUT YOU ARE THAT MAN'S SON.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500 line:92%

FAMILY HE STARTED WITH GAIL'S

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.000 line:92%
MOM.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.166 line:92%
AND THERE WERE FIVE KIDS.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.233 line:92%

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:00.800 line:92%
DAUGHTER.

&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.133 line:92%
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:06.866 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THAT TOOK A LOT OF HOMEWORK.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.000 line:92%
AZEMAR, WHAT DID YOU BELIEVE IN

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.633 line:92%
TERMS OF YOUR DAD'S RACE AND

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:12.000 line:92%
YOUR RACE?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.933 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WE LIVED IN THE MOSTLY

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.333 line:92%
ITALIAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.233 line:92%
THERE WAS ONE ASIAN MAN AND IT

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:21.266 line:92%
WAS OUR FAMILY.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.900 line:92%
WE DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.500 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WAS YOUR DAD, DID YOU THINK

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.966 line:92%
HE WAS BLACK?

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.300 line:92%
HOW DID HE APPEAR TO YOU?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.466 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I KNEW HIM AS DAD.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.666 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SO, RACE WASN'T EVEN AN

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:34.966 line:92%
ISSUE.

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.733 line:92%
ONE OF THE MOST BIZARRE THINGS

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:40.566 line:92%
OF THIS WHOLE STORY, AS GAIL IS

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.433 line:92%
WRITING THIS BOOK, STEPHANIE IS

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.900 line:92%
WORKING ON A DOCUMENTARY

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.433 line:92%
CALLED --

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.333 line:92%
&gt;&gt; "LIGHT GIRLS."

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.600 line:92%
&gt;&gt; HOW LIGHT SKIN.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.300 line:92%
&gt;&gt; HOW IN AMERICA, LIGHT SKIN

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.700 line:92%
WAS PREFERRED OVER DARK SKIN.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.833 line:92%
AND I KNEW I HAD RACIAL PASSING

00:01:58.833 --> 00:01:59.700 line:92%
IN MY FAMILY.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.333 line:92%
MY DAD'S FAMILY, LOVE THEM.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.100 line:92%
BUT THEY HELD A LOT OF SECRETS.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.400 line:92%
WE DIDN'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.566 line:92%
ASK YOU ALL THE TIME.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.833 line:92%
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS?

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:08.466 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.866 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK AT THE FAMILY.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.000 line:92%
YOU SEE THE PICTURE, WE DIDN'T

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.300 line:92%
KNOW.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.200 line:92%
QUITE FRANKLY, WE'RE YOUNG, WE

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.733 line:92%
DIDN'T CARE.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:17.000 line:92%
THIS IS DAD.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.800 line:92%
YOU KNOW?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.600 line:92%
LOVE HIM.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.933 line:92%
&gt;&gt; FORTUNATE THING ABOUT OUR

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.766 line:92%
SOCIETY, IT MAKES YOU KNOW,

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:23.066 line:92%
RIGHT?

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:23.966 line:92%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:25.966 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOUR MOM MADE THE

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:26.633 line:92%
CHOICE SHE DID.

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:31.466 line:92%
AND ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS OF THIS

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:32.533 line:92%
BOOK, IS THAT RACE IS A SOCIAL

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.266 line:92%
CONSTRUCT.

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.500 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY TAKEAWAY.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.400 line:92%
&gt;&gt; EXPLAIN THAT.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.933 line:92%
&gt;&gt; HERE'S THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:38.500 line:92%
EXPLAIN IT.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.166 line:92%
I GIVE A LOT OF PRESENTATIONS

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.066 line:92%
AND PEOPLE SAY, HOW DO YOU

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.333 line:92%
IDENTIFY NOW THAT YOU KNOW OF

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:45.800 line:92%
YOUR BACKGROUND?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.900 line:92%
I SAY, I IDENTIFY, I'M A WHITE

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.666 line:92%
WOMAN AS A MIXED RACE HERITAGE.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.400 line:92%
I WAS SOCIALIZED AS A WHITE

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.700 line:92%
WOMAN.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700 line:92%
I GREW UP IN A WHITE

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.666 line:92%
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT'S WHAT I

00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:58.033 line:92%
KNOW.

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.533 line:92%
THAT'S MY UPBRINGING.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.133 line:92%
THAT'S A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT IN MY

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:01.433 line:92%
MIND.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.200 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WHEN A FRIEND OF YOURS SAW

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100 line:92%
GAIL ON "GENEALOGY ROAD SHOW."

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.033 line:92%
DID THEY KNOW SHE MIGHT HAVE A

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:09.766 line:92%
CONNECTION TO YOU?

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:11.333 line:92%
HOW DID YOU SAY I'M GOING TO

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:12.966 line:92%
SEND GAIL AN E-MAIL?

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:16.266 line:92%
&gt;&gt; OUR "LIGHT GIRLS" DOCUMENTARY

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.333 line:92%
HAD JUST AIRED ON OWN.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.033 line:92%
MY FRIEND CALLS.

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:19.833 line:92%
AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS CALLING TO

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.600 line:92%
SAY, HEY, STEPH, GREAT DOC.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.133 line:92%
SHE CAREFULLY LEADS ME DOWN THE

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:26.600 line:92%
ROAD, TALKING ABOUT HER FAMILY

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.033 line:92%
AND WANTING TO KNOW HER FAMILY

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:28.366 line:92%
HISTORY.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:29.833 line:92%
BY THE WAY, THERE WAS THIS WOMAN

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:30.933 line:92%
ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:32.266 line:92%
I WAS JUST FLIPPING THROUGH

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:32.633 line:92%
CHANNELS.

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:34.566 line:92%
AND SHE MENTIONED YOUR FATHER'S

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:34.866 line:92%
NAME.

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:36.433 line:92%
SHE IS LOOKING FOR HER FAMILY IN

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.033 line:92%
NEW ORLEANS.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.633 line:92%
AND SHE SAID, STEPHANIE, SHE'S A

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:40.200 line:92%
WHITE WOMAN.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.466 line:92%
AND I SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW,

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:42.966 line:92%
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:47.300 line:92%
AND I THOUGHT, WHAT THE HECK HAS

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.966 line:92%
DAD DONE?

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:51.066 line:92%
I SAID, I AM GOING TO HAVE TO,

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:53.600 line:92%
YOU KNOW, BUFFER THIS FOR MY

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.500 line:92%
MOTHER WHO WAS SICK AT THE TIME.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.566 line:92%
I SAID, LET ME GET IN FRONT OF

00:03:58.566 --> 00:03:58.866 line:92%
THIS.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:02.033 line:92%
AND I HURRIEDLY TRIED TO FIND

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.233 line:92%
THE DOCUMENTARY AND WATCH IT.

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:05.133 line:92%
I WATCHED IT AND SAID, YEAH,

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:05.633 line:92%
SHE'S FAMILY.

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:08.900 line:92%
I SAW THE PICTURE OF HER MOTHER.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.666 line:92%
AND I SAID, SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.766 line:92%
MY FATHER'S FAMILY.

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:12.166 line:92%
OF COURSE.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:14.000 line:92%
WE SHARE THE SAME GRANDFATHER.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.933 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AND GAIL HAD REVELATIONS IN

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:17.500 line:92%
HER OWN LIFE, TOO, WHERE HER

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.233 line:92%
DAUGHTER LOOKS MORE LIKE YOU.

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:22.466 line:92%
BUT YOUR SON WAS MORE OLIVE

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:23.566 line:92%
COMPLEXI

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:23.966 line:92%
COMPLEXION.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:24.300 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.066 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AND YOUR HUSBAND IS VERY

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:26.566 line:92%
FAIR, TOO.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.833 line:92%
YOU HAD AHA MOMENTS, TOO.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.866 line:92%
&gt;&gt; MY SON FAVORS MY MOTHER.

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:32.966 line:92%
AND SHE USED TO SAY, HE'S MY

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:34.900 line:92%
FAVORITE BECAUSE HE LOOKS LIKE

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.166 line:92%
ME.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.000 line:92%
AND NOBODY ELSE LOOKS LIKE ME.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.133 line:92%
SO, YEAH.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:38.533 line:92%
ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.400 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THE BOOK IS FASCINATING.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.700 line:92%
AND IT'S A COMMENT NOT JUST ON

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.333 line:92%
GAIL'S FAMILY AND THE

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.333 line:92%
SECRET-KEEPING BUT ON OUR

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.100 line:92%
SOCIETY AND ITS HISTORY WHEN IT

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.200 line:92%
COMES TO RACE.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.433 line:92%
THANK YOU FOR TELLING THE STORY.

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:50.200 line:92%
