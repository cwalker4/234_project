00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.560
Sid: My guest says he was so fearful he literally
shook 24 hours a day and could only sleep

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.700
one hour a night for three and a half years.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.380
Next on this edition of It's Supernatural!
[music]

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.900
Centuries have come and gone offering wisdom
and understanding throughout the ages.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.780
Today there should be nothing beyond one's
power to discover.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.820
But yet the strange, unusual and mysterious
world of the supernatural defies understanding.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.140
Stay tuned for a unique and powerful investigation
into a curious undiscovered universe only

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.380
on It's Supernatural!

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.820
[music]

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.440
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative
reporter. It's hard to believe.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.600
How can an intelligent family man, a manager
doing well in his business, a Christian, loves

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:06.940
the Lord, how does he just suddenly start
shaking with fear and it just doesn't stop

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.220
every day.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.159
I mean, were you really shaking or just, what
were you doing, Kris Vallotton?

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.742
Kris: I shook so bad I couldn't get a glass
of water to my face without holding it with

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:17.240
two hands.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.320
I just trembled like an alcoholic, but I never
drank a day in my life.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.160
Sid: How did it start?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.560
Kris: One night I came home from work, got
in the bathtub.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.820
When I went to get out of the bathtub, my
heart started pounding.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.259
I started shaking all over.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.460
I yelled for my wife.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.940
She came in the bathroom.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.899
She tried to help me out of the tub.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.020
I shook so bad I had no strength in my legs
or any of my limbs and that lasted three and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.210
a half years.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.220
Sid: But how do you survive on such limited
sleep?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.539
Kris: Oh it was terrible.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.259
I would get into bed at night and I was just
trembling all the time.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.350
Kind of like an Irish Setter, I'd just tremble
all the time.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.759
I'd get in bed at night and I would sweat
profusely so bad that my wife would have to

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.680
get up in the middle of the night.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.360
Finally, the sweat would cover her side of
the bed.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.820
It would wake up in the middle of the night.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.880
She'd get up two and three times a night and
just change the sheet because I trembled so

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.640
bad.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.220
You know how just looney you get when you
haven't slept.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.040
And I went like that for three and a half
years.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.300
Sid: Did you take any legal drugs for this?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.220
Kris: We called the doctor that night, of
course late at night, probably 10, 10:30,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270
11:00 at night, we called our family doctor
and he said, "Oh, it sounds like he's had

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.270
an anxiety attack."

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.400
And he told my wife, he said, "Go get him
some alcohol.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.840
It will calm him down."

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.219
Sid: Did you drink much?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.280
Kris: I never drank.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.960
I've never, I took a drink from my grandfather's
beer when I probably eight, nine years old,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.740
never took drugs, never touched drugs, never
smoked, never did dope, nothing.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.860
So we went out and we got, all we could find
was wine.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.660
It was so late at night.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
Got a bottle of wine.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.760
I drank half a bottle of wine.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.980
All it did was make me sick.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.540
I still shook.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.300
Went the next day to the doctor and he gave
me, he prescribed some tranquilizers.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.320
I took those one time and they just, they
slowed me way down, but my shaking still continued

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.640
and they really depressed me.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.880
So I carried them with me everywhere.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.910
In fact, I carried those pills in my pocket for
three and a half years and never took them.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.540
Sid: The pills depressed you.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.360
Kris: Oh totally.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.520
They took me to depression and just slowed
the trembling down.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.360
I carried them with me, but I never took them.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.220
Sid: How could this happen to you?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.260
Everything is going fine and you become a
mess in every area of your life.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.080
Kris: You know what happened?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.360
I'll tell you.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.960
When I was in the bathtub I had a thought.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.120
And this sounds crazy, but I had a thought,
and I don't know if anyone has ever had this

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.780
happen to them.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780
I had a thought that I was going to die.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.500
It was stronger than a thought, you know.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.600
It was like an obsession.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.840
Never had that before.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.300
Sid: It's kind of interesting.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.580
You told me that your dad died at a young
age.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.160
Kris: My dad, six months before he died,
every night he would wake up and tell my mom,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.780
"I know I'm going to die, I know I'm going
die, I know I'm going to die."

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.960
And my dad drowned when I was three years
old.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.200
My dad was a phys ed teacher.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.380
My dad for UC Berkeley, played football for
UC Berkeley, got drafted by the pros, but

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.540
chose to finish his degree.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.720
Went into teaching, taught phys ed and drowned,
as a phys ed teacher, in Anderson Dam, which

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:26.910
is like drowning in a 10-times Olympic size
pool, exactly six months after he started

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.900
waking up saying he was gonna die.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.000
Sid: So you just started getting this thought
and then this fear came all over you.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.900
So you thought if you went to a small city
maybe things would slow down the pace and

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.910
everything would be okay.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.840
How did it work out?

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.480
Kris: Yeah. I was living in San Jose, California.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.440
Everything was, of course the Bay Area is
just a busy, big city.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.280
I was managing a repair shop, 13 guys working
for me, and I thought, well my problem is,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.440
is that I'm under all this stress.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.000
So I moved to a town called Lewiston, California,
800 people in the Trinity Alps.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.300
And what happened was instead of it getting
better, it got worse.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.040
When everything around me slowed down, Sid,
all it did is magnify what was happening inside

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.820
of me.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.160
And when I got there, when I got to Lewiston,
California, I started having visitations from

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.960
demons.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.400
Sid: What do you mean by visitations from
demons?

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.600
Kris: I mean demons would actually come in
my room.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.580
I mean, I would see them physically.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.620
They would come in my room, they would lay
on my chest at night and I couldn't move.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.280
I would be totally incapacitated.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.600
I would be like paralyzed from the neck down
and I would be trying to scream and not able

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.220
to talk.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.860
My wife would lean over and when she'd see
me struggling, she'd say, "In the name of

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.180
Jesus, get off of him."

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.000
And all of a sudden, I could literally feel
them get off of me.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.920
They would move pictures in my room.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.840
They would move objects in my room.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.280
I mean, this was real.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.460
Sid: How did your wife put up with this?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.340
I mean, how did you put up with it, but how
did your wife put up with this?

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.000
Kris: My wife was amazing.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.640
She just kept saying, "You're going to get
well.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.080
You're going to get well.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.240
You're going to be fine."

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.740
You know, it's interesting.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.440
My wife, I met my wife when she was 12 years
old.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.300
We got engaged when she was 13.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.580
Sid: You got engaged at 13?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.700
Kris: We got engaged at 13.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.620
Sid: Oh my goodness.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.200
Kris: She waited five years.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.120
We waited five years to get married.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.340
We were married one year and she was pregnant
with our first child, and I had a nervous

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.320
breakdown.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.760
Just incredible.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.760
Sid: So how did you get out of this trap?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.120
I mean, it sounds, I mean, it sounds like
something you watch on TV.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.320
It doesn't happen in real life.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.080
Kris: It was, I prayed every day for the
Lord to take me home.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.740
I received the Lord at 18, Sid.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.240
I was Christian.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.020
And in the paradigm that I had been taught
in, Christians couldn't be demonized.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.200
So I had an incredibly bad problem.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.280
One, I had a problem with demons visiting
me.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.760
I had been taught that Christians couldn't
be demonized.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.100
And so I figured I was mentally ill.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.840
I had the worst thoughts.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.040
I would have actually visions in my mind,
40, 50, 60 times a day of murdering my wife,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.000
molesting my children, doing terrible, I mean,
and I'm playing it down, doing terrible bizarre

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.250
things would happen.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.380
I would have anxiety attacks.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.500
I would break out in sweat.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.020
This is 30, 40 times a day, I would break
out in sweat.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.860
I would soak my shirt, soak my pants just
from anxiety attacks.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.640
I got so fearful.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.610
I got claustrophobia so bad that we would
be driving down the street in the winter and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.000
I'd have to have all the windows in my car.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.300
My friends would come to my house and then
I'd go lock myself in the room and I'd tell

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.180
my wife, get rid of them, get rid of them.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.640
Sid: So you can relate and I can relate now
from what you're saying to me about these

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.800
mass murderers, these people who go berserk
because here you are a normal family person,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.080
everything fine, a Christian and you're getting
all of these thoughts.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.020
I guess the human mind can only take so much.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.860
Kris: It was incredible.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.740
One night I'm in Lewiston, California.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.720
There's almost no radio in Lewiston, California.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.000
All you'd get is just mostly get static.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.680
I couldn't sleep, which was my pattern.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.120
I'd get up in the middle of the night, I'd
pace the floor, I'd lay by the stereo, I'd

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.660
turn on the stereo in our house and I'd lay
there, and all I could hear was static.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.260
But there was a speaker on there and he was
saying something about fear, which kind of

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.000
caught my attention.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.600
So I'm laying on the floor and I'm laying
by the speaker, put my head right on the speaker,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.480
and he quotes a scripture out of 1st Timothy.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.940
He says, "God hasn't given us a spirit of
fear, but love, power and a sound mind."

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.060
Sid: Hold that thought.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.020
We're going to be back in just a moment.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:44.860
That one sentence from the Bible changed his
destiny.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.600
Be right back after this.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:09:02.920

reporter and it's unbelievable this Kris Vallotton.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.660
I mean, shaking 24 hours a day, not able to
sleep more than an hour or so every night.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.060
I mean, how long can this go on?

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:47.360
And one day he just through static, he picks
something up on the radio.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.520
He'd probably never find it again if he tried,
and it's this announcer said?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.780
Kris: He said, "God hasn't given us a spirit
of fear, but love, power and a sound mind."

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:04.560
When he said "the spirit of fear", all of
a sudden it was like a revelation, like somebody

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.260
pulled the covers back in Heaven and said,
"You have a spirit of fear."

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.280
And all of a sudden, I don't know how it happened,
it was like someone was talking to me, but

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.840
it was happening inside my mind.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.580
It was like the Lord said to me, "The thoughts
you're having are not your own."

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.500
You know, I was telling you about the visions
and all the destructive thoughts I was having.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.800
The Lord said, "The thoughts you're
having are not your own."

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.080
Sid: That's important to realize that all
thoughts that we have are not our own.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.980
Kris: That's right.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:33.480
That's right.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.040
And of course, later on the Lord began to
teach me that our thoughts come from four

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.720
sources. Our spirit, because we have a spirit. We're a spirit that has a soul that has a body.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.000
The Holy Spirit, which is God's Spirit.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.700
Evil spirits, which I was being troubled with.
And angels, which are spirits

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.640
in God's realm.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.820
And so but of course, I didn't hear that then.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.220
But I heard the Lord say, "These thoughts
that you're having are not yours.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.180
They are not your thoughts."

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.740
Well that was the first time I ever felt like
I'm not mentally ill.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.080
I'm under siege.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.180
I'm under attack.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.100
I'm oppressed by the enemy.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.740
And the Lord began to tell me that, and then
he said, "But I've given you a sound mind."

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.740
Remember, I thought I was crazy.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.260
I thought I was going crazy.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.100
So that night, I asked the Lord, "What am
I to do?"

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:26.340
And the Lord said to me, "You confess that
this fear is not from me and that it's not

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.740
part of your spirit, and you rebuke it."

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.140
I did that, it left.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.160
Just like that, it left.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.720
Sid: Just like that, after all this time?

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.160
Kris: Why didn't I do that three and a half
years ago?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.180
Sid: Yeah, why didn't you?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.180
Kris: I didn't know.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.160
My people perish for lack of knowledge.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.360
I did not know.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.040
Sid: It sounds too easy, Kris.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.960
Kris: Let me tell you what happened.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.960
The next night I'm coming home from work and
I'm like, I've had a whole day of peace.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.460
Right?

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.840
I have not had a day of peace in three and
a half years.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.300
The shaking stopped, my heart is not palpitating
and pounding, the sweats are gone and I'm

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.660
like, this is too cool.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.220
And I said, I'm driving home on a dark road,
no street lights.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.480
We're living in the Trinity Alps, in the mountains,
and I said, out loud, I said, "I'm going to

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.000
tell everybody about this.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.860
I'm going to tell everybody, you are a liar
and your power is coming out of illusion."

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.840
And a voice came to me, and he said, "You
tell anyone what's happened to you, I will

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.440
kill you."

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.460
And I started shaking, sweating, all the
symptoms came back.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.580
I pulled over.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.900
I couldn't drive.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.339
I pulled over on the side of the road and
I'm just trembling again, all over again.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.120
I'm like–
Sid: Right back to square one.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.240
Kris: Right back to square one.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.180
And all of a sudden this little tiny, small
voice inside of me said this, "Does the devil

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.000
hate you?"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.620
I said, "Yeah, he hates me."

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.820
He said, "How come he didn't kill you when
you received me?"

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.700
I said, "I don't know."

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.680
He said, "Because he can't.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.300
His power is an illusion and he's a liar,
and he's the father of lies, and he's controlling

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.540
you through his lying, but he has no power
to do anything he tells you he's going to do."

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.920
And I said, "You're a liar, you get out of
my life right now."

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.740
The shaking stopped, peace came over me and
it was the beginning of a new day.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.680
Sid: It sounds too good to be true, Kris.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.060
It sounds so easy.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.740
Kris: It was a war, but it's the truth.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:22.980
Sid: I'm saying the way you got free to just
come to the senses that it was an illusion,

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:29.300
that it wasn't you, it was a demon and then
to command it to go, and it left.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.020
Kris: Isn't that amazing?

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:30.520
Sid: Yeah.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.820
Kris: Jesus said this, he said, "You'll know
the truth and the truth will free you."

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:39.360
That word "truth" in the Greek is a word we
get our word "reality" from.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.220
A lot of us live in a virtual reality.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.100
We're living in a virtual reality.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:49.000
It feels real, it looks real, you know how
the enemy sets up the smoke screen around

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.580
us.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:56.780
It feels real, it looks real, he keeps us
controlled by that spirit, but it's not real.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.860
He keeps us controlled by a lie.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.560
Jesus said, "You'll know the truth and the
truth," the reality that Jesus, "greater is

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.440
he that's in me than he that's the world,
the truth will free you."

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.860
Sid: So I mean, some wonderful things happen
to you and your family.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.980
You became the pastor of church.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.540
And one day you're driving a van with a bunch
of children.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.200
How many children were in the van?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:20.780
Kris: Eight children.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.820
Sid: Eight children.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.560
And someone starting acting crazy.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.770
Kris: We're coming home from Santa Cruz,
California.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:32.860
We're taking the kids on their eighth grade
trip, a small school, all eighth graders,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.500
five girls in a van and three boys.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.860
We're coming home and this guy, we're coming
home in this 10-passenger, 12-passenger van.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.740
This guy pulls up next to me in a white Chevy
pickup and he says, "Pull over.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.240
Pull over."

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.960
I thought we had a flat tire.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.100
I start to pull over, and he pulls right
up next to me.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.300
And when I looked over at him his eyes were
glowing red, glowing red.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.020
Now I had seen those eyes before.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.520
Sid: Where?

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.940
Chris: I had seen, demons when they used to
visit me, they would be, their eyes would

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.460
be glowing red.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.160
So I looked over him and I said, "I'm not
going to pull over."

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.060
Just then I pulled back on the freeway and
he's telling me, "Get over, get over."

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.800
Just then, the Lord spoke to me and he said,
"There will be no loss of life and nobody

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.540
will be harmed in this van."

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:27.140
And this peace just came over me, unexplainable,
this incredible peace came over me.

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:31.130
And the guy pulls up next to me again and
he says, "Pull over" and I said, and I smiled

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.490
at him and I said, "Thank you very much."

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.900
And I waved him on.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.600
And then he just ran us right off the right
into, right into the gravel.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.680
We're driving along 60 miles an hour in the
gravel, and he just cuts right in front of us.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.920
And I stop, and he starts to get out of his
car, and I take off around him, and that

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.640
started a chase that lasted about 45
minutes to an hour down the freeway.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.100
At one point, he got, the traffic stopped
both directions.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.060
He got on the freeway sideways, pulled in
the side, on the freeway like this.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.120
We're coming out of the freeway like this,
and he's waiting for us to come so he can

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.300
ram us on the side.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:04.880
We stopped.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.700
Traffic stopped both directions.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.720
He gets out of his van.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.300
He starts running for, he gets out of his
truck.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.900
He starts running for the van.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.820
One of the girls yells, "He's got a gun!

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.520
He's got a gun!"

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.460
And so I'm like, what should I do?

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.560
If I wait until he gets right to the van as
close as I can, running, of course, on foot,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.400
and I take off.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.440
And he runs for his truck.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.100
He jumps in his truck and he tries to ram
us from the side.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.740
The whole time the Lord says, "There will
be no loss to life.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.520
Everything will be fine."

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.980
Sid: The children must have been hysterical.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.060
Kris: They were going nuts.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.780
One kid, he tried to jump out the window of
the van.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.020
He opened the window and he's trying to jump
out the window.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.980
Two of the other boys grabbed him, held him
down.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.780
So he's on the floor for a half an hour, two
boys holding him, screaming,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.580
"He's gonna kill us!

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.220
He's gonna kill us!"

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.360
My wife's got the window down and she's yelling,
"This man is trying to kill us!

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.560
This man is trying to kill us," yelling to
anyone who will listen.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.280
So we're going down the road and he's trying
to ram us from the side.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.720
He comes up over the freeway, gets caught in
a ditch when he tried to ram us.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.180
So we just went as fast as we could.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.040
He got up behind us.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.460
He tried to hit us from behind, from the side.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.960
Never hit us one time.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.240
This whole chase lasted 45 minutes.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240
Sid: Hold that thought.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.920
We're going to be right back after this.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.560
This maniac came after him.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.980
I mean, it's not supposed to happen except
in the movies, but he did.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.160
And when you find out what happened,
you'll be amazed, too.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.300
We'll be right back after this.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:43.180
[music]

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.780
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative
reporter and let's go to

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.800
Janie in the control room and find out
who's on next week.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.140
Janie, who do we have?

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.419
Janie: Sid, you'll be speaking to different
people who have seen angels in all kinds of

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.820
circumstances.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:04.100
One angel actually brought a woman a new heart
and another, and then a woman saw a whole

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.460
bunch of angels supernaturally protect her
house in a tornado.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.240
It's just really incredible and I'm also going
to tell you about my angel story, next week.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.640
Sid: Looking forward to it.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.280
Kris, you sure could have used an angel.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.320
I mean, you're running down the freeway.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.220
This maniac is chasing you.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.660
You're in a van with, what, eight children?

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.160
Kris: Yes.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.060
Sid: And he's trying to ram you.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.780
He wasn't successful.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.860
But now you're, were you stuck in traffic?

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.860
Kris: No. Traffic stopped in both directions.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.380
For a mile, both directions, traffic was dead
stopped on Highway 5.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.580
We passed a highway patrolman, he had somebody
pulled over, and my wife yelled out the window,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.660
"This man is trying to kill us!

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.440
This man is trying to kill us!"

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.040
So we pulled into the center lane and tried
to stay close to the highway patrolman, and he's

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.520
trying to figure out what to do.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.400
And we're driving back and forth in the center
lane.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.960
And this guy comes in the center lane and
tries to ram us right in front of the highway

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.120
patrolman in the center lane.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.440
He finally, and it's getting, it's starting
to get dusk and I'm driving back and forth.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.120
He jumps out of his truck and I'm losing sight
of him, like where did he go, where did he go?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.940
And I don't want to leave the highway patrolman,
so I don't want to drive off.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.700
So I'm just driving back and forth in the
center lane in the dirt like this.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.180
And all of a sudden one the girls yells, "He's
coming through the back window!"

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.580
And he had reached his hand back in the back
window and popped the door open, and he was

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.920
coming in the back window.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.920
And I saw, I could see him standing on the
bumper.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.020
So I took off.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.020
I gave him the ride of his life.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.860
We were driving back and forth like this.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.980
He finally falls off the back.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.299
One of the girls goes, "He's falled off!

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:37.960
He fell off the back!

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.160
He fell off the back!"

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.920
So a minute later I hear one of the boys yelling,
"He's got the side door open!

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.800
He's got the side door open!"

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.320
Now why the doors got unlocked, I guess from
all the nervousness.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.100
"He's coming in the side door!

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.060
Side door! Side door!"

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.800
So we gave him another ride, just about, he
falls off the side of the van.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.500
Pretty soon, I hear a cop saying, "Stop or
I'll shoot!

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.320
Stop or I'll shoot!"

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.160
And I'm like, all right, he's got him, he's
got him.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.680
Sid: Right.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.180
You're safe.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.740
Kris: Yeah. So I'm like, where is he, though? Where is he?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.500
So he says, "Stop or I'll shoot!"

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.500
A second later, the gun is in my face and
he's talking to me.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.100
Sid: Why?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.100
Kris: Because when my wife yelled out the
window, "This man is trying to kill me," he

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.700
runs across the street and the guy who's
trying to kill us says, "They have my daughter.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.140
He kidnapped my daughter."

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.940
Sid: The one that's chasing you. The maniac.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.780
Kris: It's the maniac.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.100
Sid: So he has his gun to your head.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:32.280
Kris: Yeah. He's going to kill me. So I, of
course, I don't know any of this.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.020
So I'm still trying to drive back and forth,
trying to make sure that he's got the guy.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.140
I come to a complete stop.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.380
He's got the gun right in my face.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.480
He says, "Get out of the van right now or
I'll blow your head off."

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.440
So I just undo my seatbelt.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.360
And as soon as I opened the door, he grabs me,
throws me on the ground, cuffs me and drags

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.460
me around the van, and he's got the other
guy cuffed there, too.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.980
And come to find out, you know, the story
I just told you, come to find out he thought

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.100
that I was the guy.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.240
Sid: Right.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.040
Kris: The next morning, and this was on a
Saturday, coming home on Saturday, the next

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.020
morning, the highway patrolman calls me,
6:00 in the morning on Sunday morning.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.860
Sid: He had realized what, he arrested the
maniac, not you.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.870
Kris: He arrested the maniac.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.450
Sid: He calls you the next morning.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.700
Kris: Calls me the next morning, 6:00 in
the morning and he said, "Mr. Vallotton, this

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.740
is the Highway Patrol," and he gave me his
name. I said, yeah.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.960
He goes, "Are you okay?"

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.640
I said, "Oh yeah, I'm doing great."

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.620
And he said, "Let me tell you something."

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.640
He said, "When your wife was yelling out the
window, I thought you kidnapped them, and when

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.400
you didn't stop," of course, I didn't stop because
I thought he was talking to him, of course,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.759
he said, "I squeezed the trigger on that gun,"
and he said, "first time in 17 years I ever

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.420
squeezed the trigger on anyone."

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.639
He says, "I squeezed the trigger on that gun
and right before the gun went off," he said,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.480
"I heard a voice say, “something is wrong
here, don't shoot that man.'"

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.980
And he says, "I've been trembling all night."

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.560
He said, "I almost killed an innocent man."

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.980
He's weeping on the phone.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.419
I said, "Let me tell you a little story,"
I said, "Before this chase started the Lord

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.100
Jesus, I'm a Christian, the Lord Jesus told
me there will be no loss of life and no one

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.400
will be harmed in this."

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.960
I said, "You could have pulled that trigger
and you would not have shot me."

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.960
Sid: The point of the matter is that he would
have pulled that trigger if he didn't hear

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.200
a voice say, don't do that.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.840
You know, God has more control over our earth.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.440
Kris: That's right.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.320
Sid: And over us than we realize.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.600
But there are many that are watching us right
now and you're harassed by fear.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.620
I know you are.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.120
Kris: That's right.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.580
Sid: And you don't know, even know where
to turn.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.100
Kris, tell them what they can do.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.760
Kris: You know what, the first thing you
need to do is receive Jesus Christ.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.020
If you don't know Jesus Christ, the Bible says,
you are under the power of the devil, and

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.880
for you, that's not an illusion, but it is
reality.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.779
But when you receive Jesus Christ he comes
into your life, and the Bible says, "Greater

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.660
is he that's in us," Sid, "than he that's
in the world."

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.620
Greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.080
What need to do, when we receive Christ and
we start having these things happen to us,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.780
we need to realize that we are in a battle.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:12.240
Ephesians 6 says, talks about the armor of
God, putting a helmet of salvation on.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.559
And we need to war against those things and
realize those thoughts are not our thoughts.

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:20.450
That's why Second Corinthians, Chapter 10
says, "The weapons of our warfare are not

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.300
carnal."

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:21.920
Sid: Question.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.880
Kris: Yes.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.380
Sid: Do you have fear?

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.480
Did you have fear when this maniac was going
after you?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.200
Kris: No.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.880
Sid: No?

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.540
Kris: No.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.600
Sid: A guy that shook for all those years?

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.760
Kris: The Lord Jesus healed me.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.640
Sid: Do you know what?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.260
God wants to heal you right now.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.700
First, ask God to forgive you.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.200
Kris: That's right.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.780
Sid: Because you're a sinner and ask that
the blood of Jesus wash away your sins.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:48.900
Then ask Jesus to come inside of you and become
your Lord, and I command in the name of Jesus

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.020
and the authority that he's given me that
the spirit of fear would leave you right now.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.060
Spirit of rejection, I command you to leave
in Jesus' name.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:06.100
Shalom, peace of God, the peace of God, I
surround you with the shalom and the peace

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.980
of God.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.680
That's, oh there it goes.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.260
That's God's peace that you're experiencing
right now.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.440
There is nothing separating you from the
love of God.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.940
This is your moment in history.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.780
Go all the way with God.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.160
He's letting you experience his love right
now.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.120
Why?

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.540
Because you're very important to him.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.560
Why?

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.700
Because he loves you.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.000
Why?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.040
Because this is your moment to know him, not
to just believe in him, but to know him.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.880
Get a little excited.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:48.760
