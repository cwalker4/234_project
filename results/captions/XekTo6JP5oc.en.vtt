00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.291
All right, here's how it works.

00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:02.850
Twitch is going to
read a category.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.190
We'll have five
seconds to name three

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.549
of those things in the category,
and then hit the buzzer,

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.590
and we'll see how much
time is left on the clock.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.510
It has to be less
than five seconds.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.430
Zoinks.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.890
All right, I will go first
to show you how it goes.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.390
Please.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.440
OK, Ellen.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.305
Name three costumes that
shouldn't have sexy attached.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.815
A nun, and a veterinarian,
and a plumber.

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:31.745
This is hard.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:33.030
I know, it's really hard.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.470
OK, Maya, three things
that get better with age.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.210
Butts, boobs and balls.

00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:44.523
No.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:45.972
It's the opposite.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.170
Not one of those things
gets better with age.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.900
You're not understanding
the game but--

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.550
I'm going to get it.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.490
No, but clearly those
things were on your mind

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.320
and they came out.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.629
I was trying to embrace
those things about myself.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.560
I see, OK.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.890
Including my balls.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.566
OK.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.460
Good.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.030
All right.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.110
As long as they're getting
better, that's good.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.800
So much better.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.300
OK.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.520
Ellen, three things
you have to unwrap.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.910
A present, a burrito, and--

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.260
what else would it be?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.425
A candy bar?

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.354
Damn it.

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:33.040
I never think of candy.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.270
OK, Maya.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.307
Three things Beyonce
would say at a party.

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:39.222
Hey, OK, what?

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.220
That was fun.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.450
He got that one.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.180
I got that one.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.060
OK.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.620
Ellen, besides your
spouse, three people

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.370
you'd like to drive
cross-country with.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.380
Oh, Maya, Oprah and you.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.310
That's great.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.820
Yes.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.100
I want to get in that car.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.470
All right, Maya.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.630
Three things you never
want to hear your kids say.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.300
I'm pregnant.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.626
I'm fat, and life sucks.

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:23.530
That was good, but out of time.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.714
But those were good.

00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:25.880
But it's still three to one.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.120
You're still winning.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.620
I am?

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.980
I'm winning?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.480
Yeah.

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:35.100
Ellen, three accents you can do.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.805
Oh, French, Italian, Swedish.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.000
Was that two?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.625
That was three.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:46.080
Those were three.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.566
My favorite part was, oh.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:50.510
That was French, right away.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.470
Everybody knows that's French.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.990
OK, Maya.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.850
Three things Oprah says
to trick or treaters.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.052
Boo, trick or treat,
happy Halloween.

00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:07.024
Boo.

00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:10.510
She says, boo.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.910
I was trying to
condense it for time.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.755
Yeah, because
normally it would be--

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:15.254
Boo.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.820
That's awesome.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.660
Ellen, three things you
think about in the shower.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.890
Oh, I'm clean now.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.110
And I got the--

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.460
Wait a minute.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.870
Oh, I'm clean now.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.310
Look at that soap.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.930
Darn it.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.150
I had others.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.510
I want to hear the others.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.450
Well, got to get the
conditioner out of my hair good.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.440
And then, where's the towel?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.780
I plan ahead.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.280
Next time I'm in
the shower, I know

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.222
I'm going to hear in my
head, oh, I'm clean now.

00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:05.770
This is great because, Maya,
it's the same question for you.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.561
Three things you think
about in the shower.

00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:09.356
Oh, I'm clean now.

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:11.220
Easy, does it.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.720
Don't trip.

00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:17.672
I don't want to fall.

00:04:17.672 --> 00:04:19.069
Slip, but not trip.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.152
That means you're running.

00:04:20.152 --> 00:04:21.640
It didn't work.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.950
I feel like you can say
anything on this game.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.510
Well, you can, but
they're not always--

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.813
but you won.

00:04:27.813 --> 00:04:28.779
I did?

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.194
Yes.

00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:34.575
Season One of Forever
is available now

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:36.770
on Amazon Prime Original.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.610
We'll be right back.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.400
Maya Rudolph.
