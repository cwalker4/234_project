00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:15.260
Have you ever had one of those buttons
pop up on your computer screen that says,

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:19.454
"Software update available.
Do you want to install it now?"

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:25.977
Our computers use programs
to process vast amounts of information,

00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:30.053
and programmers know
that if we are running faulty programs,

00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:31.843
we get faulty results,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.916
and this is why we have
the upgrade process for our computers.

00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:39.983
It turns out your subconscious
works much the same way.

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:45.974
In fact, our subconscious will process
up to 40 million pieces of information

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.911
every single second.

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:51.639
And in order to process
those huge amounts of information,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.683
our subconscious chooses programs.

00:00:54.684 --> 00:01:00.046
The thing is we've been choosing
those programs since we were a child,

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:01.693
and now as an adult,

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:07.216
we may still be running the same programs
and getting messy results in our life.

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:11.067
So who wants an upgrade button
for their subconscious programming?

00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:16.855
I have figured out how to access mine,
and that's what I want to share with you.

00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:19.416
I want you to play
with me here for a minute.

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:21.626
Everybody, fold your arms.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:27.395
Good, now look down
and see which arm is on top.

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:33.632
OK, unfold them, now fold them back
with the other arm on top.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.136
How does that feel?

00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:40.518
It's awkward, it's uncomfortable.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.148
This person over here
is like, "Arms do not do that."

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.528
(Laughter)

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:46.509
But what you're feeling there,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.029
in science, they have a term
called cognitive dissonance.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.240
Cognitive dissonance states
we can not hold

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:58.989
onto two conflicting ideas
without discomfort.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.359
Our brain can not hold

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.589
onto two conflicting
ideas without discomfort.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.379
You can all unfold your arms now.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.169
I don't want you to fold
your arms the whole time,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.959
but what you felt there
was the feeling of a conflicting program.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.419
So cognitive dissonance is
one of the parts that gives us

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.069
an opportunity to upgrade
our subconscious programming.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.231
And here's the other part:

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:26.202
when it comes to communication,

00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:29.539
there are three main parts
to our communication.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.710
There's the words that we speak,

00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.309
and then there's the tone of those words.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.961
Have you ever gotten in trouble
for your tone of voice?

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.150
Yeah, it has messages with it.

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:44.835
The third part is our gestures
or our body language.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:46.379
So when we don't know

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.208
what messages we are sending
with our body language,

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.946
and they don't match the words we speak,

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:58.786
people will discount the words they hear
to believe the gestures they see

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:04.465
because our subconscious understands
the difference between those two messages.

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:09.105
But and how can our brains send out
two different messages at the same time?

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.939
It's because your subconscious

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.617
is what runs the majority
of your body language,

00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:20.564
and remember, our subconscious
is working on programs.

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:27.455
Our subconscious or our whole brain
is inherently out to conserve energy.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.884
Our brain wants to conserve energy

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:31.675
and knows that it's easier

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:36.665
to maintain the current programs
than to adopt a new one.

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:40.545
So, when we put these two ideas together,

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:45.012
we now have access to this update
for our subconscious programming.

00:03:45.013 --> 00:03:50.594
Let me explain by telling you
where I was in my life not too long ago.

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:52.836
In fact, it was only about six years ago

00:03:52.846 --> 00:03:57.416
that I was at a place
where, let's just say, it was very hard.

00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.295
I tried to interact with people,

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:01.875
and I found people to be
very argumentative,

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:05.764
to be unpredictable,
to be hard to be around.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.366
It was just not fun,

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:11.314
and I decided that everybody
on this planet is just mean;

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:13.456
it's just the way it was.

00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:17.475
In fact, I got to where I would send
my kids to school in the morning,

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:20.286
and then I would hide inside the house,

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:23.735
and I wouldn't answer the door,
and I wouldn't answer the phone,

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:26.366
because no matter how hard I had tried,

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:29.604
the results I was getting
were not matching the effort

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:32.655
I was putting forth
to interact with people,

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.407
and I felt stuck.

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:39.045
So this is where I was,
and I saw people having opportunities,

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:42.085
but I couldn't seem
to catch one for myself.

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:43.775
So even though in my life,

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:48.155
I had worked as an engineer
in flight simulation and explosives,

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:49.846
this is the point in my life

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:53.993
where I changed and started studying
communication and body language.

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:57.305
As I learned these two parts
that I just told you,

00:04:57.306 --> 00:05:01.684
I started to recognize
they would give me a choice

00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:04.277
to change the way I interact with people.

00:05:04.278 --> 00:05:08.895
I began to put it into practice
because I wanted to understand

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:12.788
why some people could figure
these things out, but I wasn't.

00:05:13.468 --> 00:05:15.970
So let me teach you a little bit
about body language

00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:18.496
so you can understand
what's going on here.

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:22.107
When somebody feels weak, if I feel weak,

00:05:22.108 --> 00:05:25.548
I will use weak, closed body language -

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:27.410
my shoulders will come down,

00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.918
I'll fold my arms, I'll look down,

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.403
maybe even my weight goes on one leg,

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:34.277
because I feel weak.

00:05:34.278 --> 00:05:37.578
But by contrast,
when somebody feels strong,

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.856
their body language opens up.

00:05:39.857 --> 00:05:42.047
They might put their arms
down to their side,

00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:45.356
their shoulders go up,
their chin goes up, they'll smile,

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.676
their weight goes on both legs.

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:50.927
Now remember, in my life, at this time,

00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:55.668
I felt weak, but I wanted to be strong,

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.636
and so I decided
I was going to figure this out.

00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:03.646
I looked around me at people
who were successful.

00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:06.488
I looked at celebrities,
I looked at business owners,

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:09.168
I looked at people around me
in relationships,

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.646
who were having
very strong, powerful relationships,

00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:15.756
and I realized these successful people

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:19.147
were not behaving exactly the same as me.

00:06:19.148 --> 00:06:21.446
So, here's how it looked for me.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:25.522
Since I felt weak, and I was afraid of
the people I was interacting with,

00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:28.230
I very often folded my arms.

00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:30.140
I kept my arms folded a lot,

00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:31.833
and if anybody had asked me why,

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:33.033
I'd tell them,

00:06:33.034 --> 00:06:36.351
"Because I have nowhere else to put
my hands when I'm not using them.

00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:39.690
I don't want them just hanging out here.
I'm going to fold my arms."

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.722
But when I watched
these successful people,

00:06:42.723 --> 00:06:46.311
the majority of the time
when they were using their hands,

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:48.553
they'd put them down to their sides.

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.366
So I decided I was going to try it.

00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:53.856
And if you could have been
in my brain at the time,

00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:57.311
it would have been very entertaining
because as I walked around,

00:06:57.312 --> 00:07:01.100
I had this dissonance
going on inside of my head

00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:06.241
because my old program
was saying, "People are unsafe."

00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:08.911
But I was choosing to send a message

00:07:08.912 --> 00:07:12.680
that I felt strong, comfortable,
and open around people.

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.346
So I said, "My hands will go here
when I'm not using them."

00:07:16.347 --> 00:07:18.520
That doesn't mean
I walked around like this -

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.038
that would be very weird -

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.577
but it does mean
that when I wasn't using them,

00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:24.292
I put them away here.

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:28.440
But then my subconscious would say,
"It's more comfortable to fold your arms,"

00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.380
and I'd say, "No, I want my arms here."

00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:33.483
"Fold them", "Here", "Fold them,"
"Here", "Fold them," "Here." -

00:07:33.488 --> 00:07:35.464
that's what it felt like in my head.

00:07:35.992 --> 00:07:39.573
But after a little while, my subconscious
decided, "You know what?

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:40.901
It’s going to be easier

00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:45.111
to just adopt the new program
and not keep arguing with her."

00:07:45.112 --> 00:07:47.501
And I began to feel differently.

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.683
People around me started to notice.

00:07:51.883 --> 00:07:54.142
You can feel this with me right now.

00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:58.633
Some of you may have heard of
this scientific term, it's called gravity.

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:00.634
You heard of that one?

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:03.612
It pulls down on us really well,

00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:04.962
and during the day, it likes

00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:08.471
to pull down on our shoulders
and pull down on our chin.

00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:11.961
So, everybody, let your shoulders
come down and your chin come down.

00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:15.164
How does that feel?

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:21.473
People tell me it feels tired,
it feels burdened, it feels depressed.

00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:23.532
But now, instead,

00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:27.715
pull your shoulders back up
and pull your chin just above level.

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:30.253
How does that feel?

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:35.471
It feels empowered,
like, "I am awake, I can do it."

00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:41.144
You've just felt the difference
in changing or choosing a new program.

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:45.492
In fact, in 2009, there was
a study that was published

00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:48.343
in the European Journal
of Social Psychology,

00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:50.542
and in there, what they had done

00:08:50.543 --> 00:08:54.222
was they asked people
to fill out a self evaluation,

00:08:54.223 --> 00:08:56.701
and they did the self evaluation

00:08:56.702 --> 00:09:02.443
either in a slumped stance
or in good posture.

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:05.392
The people who had good posture

00:09:05.393 --> 00:09:09.072
rated themselves higher
on their self evaluation.

00:09:09.073 --> 00:09:13.811
It turns out your grandma was right,
because she was pretty smart,

00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:15.903
she kept telling us to sit up straight.

00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:22.031
But that is an opportunity
to feel different on the inside of us.

00:09:22.032 --> 00:09:26.653
So that's one of the things I did
to start changing my programming.

00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:28.815
May I share two more with you?

00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:31.773
What I noticed about me -

00:09:31.774 --> 00:09:34.394
actually, let's talk
about you for a minute.

00:09:34.395 --> 00:09:36.233
When it comes to body language -

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:41.654
I watch body language everywhere I go,
and I've worked with thousands of people -

00:09:41.655 --> 00:09:48.274
what I found is the majority of people
will use a lot of push-away body language.

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.154
They push away,

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:54.034
and then they wonder
why they are not getting job promotions,

00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:58.362
or raises, or opportunities,
or relationships in their life.

00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:00.873
But they're pushing things away.

00:10:00.874 --> 00:10:05.104
In fact, the fastest way to see somebody
use push-away body language

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.435
is give them a compliment.

00:10:07.436 --> 00:10:10.754
When you give somebody a compliment,
how do they respond?

00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:12.755
"Thank you."

00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:17.765
And they throw the compliment away,
or they'll explain it away.

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:20.536
I love it, I do little tests all the time.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:25.478
I'll give people a compliment then I watch
their body language after the compliment.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:28.983
And often, people suddenly
have to brush off their pants

00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:30.613
when they get a compliment,

00:10:30.614 --> 00:10:33.118
or they brush their shoulder.

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:38.440
Or my favorite was: once I gave a lady
a compliment, and she said, "Ohh, thanks."

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.580
(Laughter)

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.934
And I'm like, "So, that was
a disgusting booger

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.236
you had to flick off your finger."

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:50.464
When we have compliments coming to us,

00:10:50.465 --> 00:10:52.614
if we can't receive a compliment,

00:10:52.615 --> 00:10:56.081
how are we going to receive
other things coming to us?

00:10:56.082 --> 00:10:57.663
So I recognized this

00:10:57.664 --> 00:11:02.183
and decided I wanted to access
this program that was inside of me,

00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:03.985
whatever it was.

00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.308
And I realized the easiest way to do this

00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:10.594
would be to change
how I reacted to a compliment.

00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:13.565
So, now instead
of pushing compliments away,

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:15.997
I decided when somebody
gave me a compliment,

00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:20.438
I would scoop it up in front of me
and place it gently in my heart.

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:22.318
So I would just go like this

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:26.519
while using the magic words, "Thank you."

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.679
Have you heard these words? They're good.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.601
So try it with me, "Thank you."

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:34.736
Oh, do it again, that's fun.

00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:36.384
"Thank you."

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.814
Notice how a lot of your mouths,
the corners of your mouth,

00:11:39.815 --> 00:11:41.694
went up when you did that

00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:44.504
because you felt the difference.

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.435
You felt the difference.

00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:49.266
So when you use this body language,

00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:53.408
It's changing the program
in your subconscious.

00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:56.617
As I was doing this in my life,

00:11:56.618 --> 00:11:59.921
people started to notice
the difference in me.

00:11:59.922 --> 00:12:04.437
One of the people to notice the difference
was my teenage son.

00:12:04.438 --> 00:12:08.326
Because at this point in my life,
he was 13 years old,

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.925
and we had been moving around quite a bit,

00:12:10.926 --> 00:12:14.055
so he had gone
to four different junior highs.

00:12:14.056 --> 00:12:17.665
Anybody ever been the junior high?
Crazy place junior high.

00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:19.336
And he'd been to four of them.

00:12:19.337 --> 00:12:21.218
So he comes home one day

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:24.518
after the first day
in his fourth junior high.

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:26.285
Now I need a volunteer.

00:12:26.286 --> 00:12:29.807
Oh, awesome! Would you come up
and be my volunteer?

00:12:29.808 --> 00:12:34.768
So he'd just gone his first day
on the fourth junior high.

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:36.825
What I'm wanting from you

00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:39.996
is I need really great
teenage boy body language.

00:12:39.997 --> 00:12:42.377
Can you do that for me? Oh, nice.

00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:45.175
There you go.
Yeah, get that phone out there.

00:12:45.176 --> 00:12:49.354
Let's put that away for just a second,
but fold your arms for me.

00:12:49.355 --> 00:12:52.665
And just freeze, but turn this way
so that everybody can see you.

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:57.115
Has anybody ever seen a teenager before?
That's pretty good body language.

00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:58.165
(Laughter)

00:12:58.166 --> 00:13:00.242
Yeap, exactly.

00:13:00.243 --> 00:13:05.127
So here's my teenager,
and he's standing like this, and he goes,

00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:08.697
"Ugh! Mom, tell me
why the kids keep picking on me?"

00:13:08.698 --> 00:13:13.874
And I'm like, "Oh! Alright.
I'll tell you, I'll help you with that."

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:17.276
And he's like, "Is it body language?"

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:20.787
And I said, "Yes, dear, that's what I do."

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:24.147
And he goes, "Ugh, fine. Tell me then."

00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:26.046
I knew that with that attitude,

00:13:26.047 --> 00:13:29.465
I had time to only share one piece
of body language with him.

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:34.257
And I wanted to share something
that would send a different message out

00:13:34.258 --> 00:13:38.426
but also send a different message
to his subconscious.

00:13:38.427 --> 00:13:40.721
And so I chose legs.

00:13:40.722 --> 00:13:42.736
I asked him, I said, "At school,

00:13:42.737 --> 00:13:45.637
do you stand with your weight
on one leg like this?

00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:49.170
And he goes, "Yeah, mom, we all do. Duh!"

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.747
And I'm like, "Well, Mr. Attitude.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.972
Did you know when you stand
with your weight like this,

00:13:54.973 --> 00:13:59.227
it sends a weak message,
it sends a message that you feel weak,

00:13:59.228 --> 00:14:02.917
that you could be easily
knocked off balance."

00:14:02.918 --> 00:14:06.917
So, I said, " Instead, if you'll come
put your weight on both legs,

00:14:06.918 --> 00:14:10.056
when you're at your locker
or up in front of the class,

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:15.367
now this will send the message
that you're strong in your foundation,

00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:18.348
and people will treat you differently."

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:21.816
He rolled his eyes,
and he was like, "Sure, mom."

00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:24.855
So thank you.
Thank you for being my volunteer.

00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:26.396
(Applause)

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:32.938
So I waited, and I thought,
"Well, we'll just see what happens."

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:36.788
It wasn't maybe until two weeks later
that he comes home,

00:14:36.789 --> 00:14:39.279
and he walks in the house, when he saw me,

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:43.327
I could tell he had something
he wasn't quite ready to share with me yet

00:14:43.328 --> 00:14:45.498
so I just waited patiently.

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:51.630
And he comes over, he stands
next to me, and he goes, "Mom, it works,"

00:14:51.631 --> 00:14:53.440
and he ran out of the room.

00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:54.789
(Laughter)

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:56.936
But he tried it.

00:14:56.937 --> 00:15:01.128
At the end of that school year, I gave him
the option to change schools again,

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:02.451
and he said, "No, mom.

00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:05.268
I have more friends
and better results at this school

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:07.997
than in any of the schools I've been to."

00:15:07.998 --> 00:15:10.398
And the only thing I taught him was legs.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:16.799
But that teaching him of that helped him
access programs in his subconscious.

00:15:17.089 --> 00:15:18.648
So it turns out

00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:23.368
that you have an update available
for your subconscious programming.

00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:27.038
The question is
are you going to install it now?

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:29.379
Change your body language,

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.358
and change your results.

00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:33.301
(Applause)
