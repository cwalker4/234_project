00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
We moved to the country when I was 10 years old and my siblings were four six and eight

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.069
We absolutely loved the open spaces growing up here

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.309
Yeah, we were building all kinds of forts. We built a ship once. We used to all build forts together.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.259
I think that's kind of you know the whole way that we were raised. We really stay on the farm a lot

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.479
We would do our school and we'd get that done

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.660
And we couldn't wait to get out and be creative and build something

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.920
I think that desire to build and create has just kind of stayed with all of us. As we got older being the millennials

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.049
we are, we eventually discovered

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.229
Technology and when we did it was iPods and that was it. We were sold.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.649
When we were creative as kids, I think that creativity hasn't gone away kind of just gotten better. Our family has built a few earthbag buildings

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.960
So now it's time to put those skills to work once again.Build cheap buildings

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.920
Cheap buildings [laughter]

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.480
This is our biggest challenge so far. A recording studio

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.539
underneath and then there'll be a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.300
workshop on top. The price to Build it somewhere between five to seven thousand. Which is a pretty good price for

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.960
a building. These kind of buildings are really nice because it allows the whole family to work on the building

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.420
Let us take you on our adventure and show you how our family works together to build it.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.160
[music]

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.280
When we had Jeff out to dig a hole. We're really pre-planning to have the studio done

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.980
It's really really deep here. Maybe if we go this way here's the latter.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.420
And then I want to show you. There we got  the whole crater

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.180
We noticed that the walls were kind of starting to have fallen a little bit so we decided to lay that foundation layer

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.120
That would be I would say pretty close to the center. Just to ensure that it wouldn't get buried because it was going to be

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.340
quite a few months before we would start building on it. We dug a trench all the way around the outside edges of where our walls

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.340
are going to be.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.600
I'm taking the rock and putting it inside the foundation

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.209
We're going to be setting the walls on. We had originally planned to have a whole bunch of rock brought in so that we could

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.729
stack the two walls on top of each other and like a two-story building would be. We  changed our minds

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.440
we're able to expand the top section so that we could encompass the stairwell

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.639
It's your high-tech level mechanism using like two shovels and a string to level it all

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.489
Everything's good right here - I had gone through before and just kind of checked it

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.159
and eye balled it and it was level. Then the guys came in and they're starting to level it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.949
And it's getting less and less

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.449
Level and then they'd be like. Oh, it needs to go up, and I was just like

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
nooooooooooooo

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.960
We use some railroad ties for the entry and we just kind of buried them and then on the top we went ahead and cut

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.740
one shorter to put on the top. All right do you got the drill bit? Drill some holes.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.900
And then we took rebar and we banged it into it to hold the thing together and then that's going to go ahead and be

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.900
the entry downstairs. It's going to be a little bit challenging to get this thing in the ground. Get started huh guys?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.510
Yes

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:32.059
Bryson's got his new haircut. I'm cooler. Cooler because I don't have all the hair on me and I'm cooler because I look cooler

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.339
No comment over there popsicle girl

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.120
So why didn't you bring one for all of us?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.020
[music]

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.960
we've been really needing a sound studio and an art studio so I'm excited to have a place to work on my

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.429
costumes and family to work with

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.220
When we get around 18 inches high with the bags we lay the electric wire and boxes

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.360
[music]

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.520
Starting this right here

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.090
Yeah

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.569
We're gonna go ahead and put plastic around our building

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.820
We got some plastic here to act as a moisture barrier between the bags and the dirt. Is it pretty thick plastic? 6 mil

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.200
10-foot High

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.859
100 foot - should easily reach around the whole building

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.229
I'll keep pushing it out of our way as we grow, back filling, pushing it out of our way

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.250
You just want to make sure that you weren't involved in the mathematical calculation so  that you have no responsibility if it's wrong.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.520
It you just said, "ya" to make me feel better.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.560
we are

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.900
cutting out for the stairs. So is this is going to be inside or outside of the building itself. It's going to be inside.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.120
Okay. For sloping our steps down so that we can stair step them. Cut them out as we go along

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.570
And then we'll be building forms down here

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.360
at the base. We have a four-foot landing in front of a door that goes in

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.800
Where there are pockets of mostly sand the walls cave in but the clay like you see above doesn't budge

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.919
Colapses, what do we do?

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.919
Lay underneath it with your mouth open

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.000
Yeah, your eyes wide open and facing up. That's what they teach you in avalanche training.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.020
Go into the white smoke . Like a wave you know you go underneath it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.740
[music]

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.920
Bags here and plastic separating the dirt from our bags

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.900
[music]

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.440
So that was a good burn Bry

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.160
Totally

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.319
there's all kinds of

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.080
geography, I mean every place has deserts everybody has rainforests and living in a certain area requires a certain type of dwelling. Our

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.380
geographical situation is far different than that might be in the Pacific Northwest or eastern

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.180
states like New York, and the makeup of our ground is totally different. The amount of rain

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.749
we get. We're only looking at about a foot of rain compared to

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.930
25 inches or more in the Pacific Northwest. It makes a big difference in what type of soil we get. So we had to

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.389
take these same things into consideration when we were building our

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.959
underground studio out of the earthbags. One is how much water do we get. What type of soil do we have. It has a

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.609
great deal of clay in it. It has a ton of caliche. Which is a calcium

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.770
So we have kind of a hard soil, especially that first three feet of our soil

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.520
And you have to pickaxe through that stuff to get down

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.400
And then there are pockets of sand here and there. The caliche level is like this first

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.760
First three feet you get a lot of rocks in our soil. There's a lot of clay inside here too, so it's very hard

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.400
Very very hard. That's just after a rain. It's time to strengthen the wall to ensure safety. First we backfill

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.760
[music]

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.820
We're just going to fill it up

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.080
[music]

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.600
Whoa Diesel good boy. Yeah. Oh are you going to pull him out?

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.260
[music]

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.540
Hi Diesel

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:38.600
[music]

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.720
Come here Diesel

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.580
Yeh!!!!

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.460
[music]

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.880
Okay, so we're going to put in the deadman just to help the walls

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.280
from caving in. It might be a little bit of overkill because of the way the bags compress on themselves

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.640
But better safe than sorry and this really isn't that hard to do so I think we're just going to go like three foot in

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.880
And then put like another three-foot chunk

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.720
Right there where going to do one bag out, one bag over

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.380
Stake a rebar through the two to hold the two together. Might even put a rebar in on this side

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.900
I'm going to do three. One here. We've got another one over there, and then one more by the staircase

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.560
It's kind of interesting

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.560
We're about halfway up

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.740
and it feels like we're starting on ground level again because we've backed filled around it and

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.580
Our bagger is going to be able to stand on that and so are we

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:43.220
[music]

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.200
So we had to say

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.230
How do we retain a circle inside of the ground. We have some forces that work

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.300
We have the force of gravity which pulls straight down

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.160
So how we fix that is that our bags are stacked directly on top of each other

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.720
And we have tamped so they are solid. So you get to get the idea that if you can compact the soil

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.379
you're going to return back to the caliche or to the solid packed ground which doesn't move

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.400
we have used barbed wire to help with the shear strength and

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:23.040
three just by it being a circle it retains the same types of strength as an arch. You can

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040
Actually have an arch hold itself together

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.249
Throw it on side any forces that come from the outside in

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.980
Equally, press on the circle. Because all forces together - similar to the arch theory

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.560
The cool thing that this is, its rained because it means all of our dirt that we have been putting on the outside will settle nicely

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.120
That's why we put the plastic here. These are definitely solid.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.500
We keep going up. Building these walls like a tube of toothpaste. I've always wanted to say that.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:08.940
[music]

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.240
Cleats are placed to secure the bags to the doorframe

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
one more

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.200
We need several hanger cleats installed around the building in order to hang green screen and other background items on the wall

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.760
[music]

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:42.000
Do you know what it looks like? It looks like we're all standing on the same level. We are. Get on my level son.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.760
Shae, you've never stood on something this high you're getting very good look tall for you

00:10:50.340 --> 00:11:04.040
[music]

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.880
[music]

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.240
there you go, I

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.800
Find that if I stay in the air-conditioning all summer long

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.900
I don't really - the summer gets really super super hot so I find if I can get out and work in it.

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:24.820
And your body just seems to get used to it. So it's really important to get out early

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.020
It's really hot outside. It's not hot, just our brains

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.740
telling us it's hot

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.580
Are you ready?

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.700
Yes, I am. Wow, that's gonna

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.420
keep the sun off. It was only $25. I was like I couldn't say no

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:48.620
[music]

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.940
Go get it. Quick, I only have so much time before he come backs

00:11:52.220 --> 00:12:12.100
[music]

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.720
Here have some dirt. Will you scoot that way?

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.220
Look at that

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.460
It's the simple things in life

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.980
Bryson has always been a boy of wonder. We all wonder too - guys. I got a speck of dirt on me

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:38.680
[music]

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:52.100
[music]

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.980
What we're now calling the MusArt studio. Get it cuz this going to be an art and a music studio

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:05.289
For our steps here. We have a four foot opening going up. Our first actual going up. It's going to be right there

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:09.039
Is that cool? Bryson, Shell? How does that sound? Yes.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.790
Okay

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.469
And we want to have steps that are going to be about seven and a half

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.909
Inches high on the Riser and we're going to pour a 12 inch thread

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.750
but then we're going to lay the next step on an inch and a half so we'll have a

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:31.140
Ten and a half inch tread. We built one frame so that allowed us to just use that same frame throughout the entire build.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:38.940
[music]

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.980
All right good. Let's try with this. It doesn't need to be too sturdy. It's these that need to be fairly sturdy.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.980
But I think we're okay

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.240
[music]

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.539
The steps were rectangular however they needed to go in a spiral going up

00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:04.159
So you have one side that a bit little smaller on the other side larger. So that's the first step Huh? Yeah, this is the second

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.059
One step at a time

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:11.059
And then we tear the frame out on and set our next step and then put our next step in and then pull the frame

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:15.499
Out and keep using the same frames all the way up. So this overlaps onto the concrete

00:14:15.929 --> 00:14:19.309
An inch and a half this is number one two three four

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.020
five six

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.640
[music]

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.500
So you're just doing steps and suddenly ...what?

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:36.619
what the

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:43.849
Dog! Monday was at you? Was it you Monday? or Diesel? Who was it? Who put their paw in this?

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.959
And talk about feet print. I gonna put my foot in there.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.220
You feeling pretty good today?

00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:54.089
hundred percent

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:54.919
hundred percent?

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:56.879
so we went waterskiing and

00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:02.058
The sun kissed us and then my muscles wouldn't work. I couldn't get myself to haul in all this big heavy

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:04.729
Bottom out of the water. I'm a teenager and I can't move.

00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:09.349
You weren't the one skiing behind the boat. See. Smart.

00:15:09.869 --> 00:15:11.869
Perfect alright, we're done

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:14.959
We're done. We're done. We're done.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:29.229
Garen begins planning the layout for the upstairs circle. We wanted our bigger circle to be centered in our smaller circle and

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.500
the Center Circle has the staircase so we had to kind of account for that, so we move the reference pole over and

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.409
Put a little extension on it, so we could get higher

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:44.380
I got my pole in and draw it out then I'm going to level it off - start laying the next layer of bags

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.260
Won't we? Yes, we will

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:57.700
[music]

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:04.220
I'm taking a highest point in the bags so we can know where to put the top of the stairs  - actually the inner circle

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:28.488
We counted for a six-foot opening. The two front posts there that you see are for French doors that are going to go in

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.800
possibility of me putting a six-foot slider in

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.920
[music]

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.319
This is the desert for you. One second it'll be like hey

00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:43.428
It's all nice and sunny and the next it says now I'm going to pour rain on you

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.699
We're installing a a berm around just the side of the building - getting a little bit of pooling

00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:55.699
inside of our first layer. We need to be able to divert the water out of the foundation level. That's a common building problem

00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:59.719
That's not just us but any builder has to keep water out of their foundo.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.989
We're going to see how well this this holds up. Hi pig

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.069
It has made of our bags a little bit soggy on the outside so we had to let them dry out

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:12.349
They get that wet all the way through like a real mud - move them at all and then they just turn into this real

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.799
Mush and it can cause tons of problems all the way down

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:22.609
We don't touch the bags when they're that soaked. We just let them dry out naturally. I'm not playing. I'm sidetracking the dogs so Mom can video

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.609
So therefore. I am a key piece of

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:28.370
instrumental work

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.739
Sure rather than an adornment.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.140
I don't even know what that is. Like a decoration. Yeah rather than a decoration.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:44.500
[music]

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.590
We've put in about an hour a day

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.039
Maybe a little bit more on the circle to try to get in a row a day

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:56.430
We'll work in the morning when it's not raining and then cover the bags so that we get whatever afternoon rains come through

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.720
We won't soak our bags so bad. We'll be able to work the next day

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.580
[music]

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:10.200
It's amazing how fast it really goes when you just do one one row a day. That thing will be up in no time

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.580
[music]

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.020
The Walls continue to grow

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.240
Nice, whiny wheels. We see who's the squeaky wheel is this family.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.020
The guys begin to prepare for the electrical outlets?

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:37.800
We install the electrical boxes like you would a cleat. We just nailed the boxes right to the plywood.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.480
The duplex boxes we're using have nails on the box itself so it's like nailing it to a stud

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:50.300
[music]

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.760
She should be out here learning electrical. She could learn to wire her house.  You never know Bry.

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.579
Okay, so the question is I have one more outlet

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.029
Where would you want it? Three across there, rocket stove, one right there? I think it looks perfect, okay?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.280
We just run the wire in between the bags and make sure they're separated from the barbed wire so we don't get any

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.260
shorting going on. Inside or outside? Outside wire, inside barbed wire

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:22.460
It's easier than trying to pin it to the wall later and cob over it. Subscribe if you want to see more "U" nails

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:30.980
[music]

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.880
What's that one now Garen? Your light switch that you said we needed because you were right. We needed one.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.440
What's up with you being right today Mom?

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.220
[music]

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.170
When the kids get a room

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.739
they get a dog and Bryson hasn't gotten his yet when we finished his room four months back

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:54.140
I think he just wanted to kind of settle in. When the kids get up in their teenage years you know you no longer really

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.680
like when

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.230
they're little you hug them and you cuddle with them. As they get older you know you just don't do it anymore

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.110
That's tough when dad lays a big kiss on them

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.819
so we like them to have an animal when they get up in that age because

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:14.090
That just gives them something that they can they can cuddle with and love on. I was thinking more like a teacup poodle

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.960
For Bryson? Yeah.  Get a poodle. You want to get a poodle?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:24.230
Yeah, a poodle shaved all the way down to the skin with just its tail. They make...

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.560
God makes those. They're just called hairless poodle

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.189
Exactly. You wouldn't have to shave it. You can get a Great Dane took so it can tackle Diesel. I thought about that

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:39.739
I think you should get a not so Great Dane. Real small. I want a really hairy dog that doesn't shed or bark

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:46.190
Or eat or poop. I think you're talking about a statue. How about a cuddly toy like a plushy toy. They could cuddle that.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.940
It's now window level

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.620
We got the window wraps. I gained weight

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.030
Watch your toes!

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:03.649
This particular room has larger windows. We went with a three foot by five foot windows. Dad's nailing these

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.260
braces in to keep them square

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.760
So that you don't have a window. That's like

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.900
In Bryson's  building we used two by twelves on

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.289
Bree and Garen's building we used to two by tens so I went back to the two by tens

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.230
The cost of the Layout

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.269
I eye balled too much... We just wait while  dad and Garen plan out all the windows

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.460
Garen's bothered by that window right there. Dad likes it symmetrical. Garen is all like...

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.460
We can't do that

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:52.540
[music]

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.100
Diesel are you picking beans over there? Are you eating them?

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:08.380
[music]

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:17.780
These are tent poles, and we're going to use these to reinforce the walls between the windows. Like we've done in the past.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:25.640
Little bit of movement on this wall because of all the rains we've had lately.  Come over here. We get a shot of this. You can see a little bit of movement on the wall.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.669
We're out of plumb. The best way that fix these things is to brace them off. I was  hoping to avoid it

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:33.660
but that's what we have

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.360
[music]

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.400
Use the pole in the pole

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.589
and we run our circle around that way we get our

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.939
Perfect circle that we want. I take the rope pull it tight in this case

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.059
I'm just using a knot as my marker and just running around

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:55.309
do that mark that all the way around the building before I tamp it and then we just follow that all the way up the

00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:58.120
Building and then our walls are relatively straight

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:05.380
[music]

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.780
There was only half a brick

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.720
[music]

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:21.150
It rains like a lot. We had a giant storm come through. It gets the bags wet and blows off our tarps

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:26.740
Yeah, we have such a bad storm. They'll get wet lower down to so everything will be soaked

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:43.720
[music]

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.360
So we should go down and take a look at the underneath here

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:54.989
It seems like it is actually holding up really well. I mean, I don't see any like bulging, collapsing anywhere

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.040
Which is good

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.020
Oh you can see water is pooled down here definitely

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.730
We had a lot of rain

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.790
Yeah, it seems to be holding up really nice actually

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.580
as solid as ever

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:18.840
Hey look a little mesquite tree. Look at that. Hey, you know if we wait long enough, It can be the center post

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:27.870
After weeks of dodging rainstorms we finally get a reprieve.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.299
We quickly jump into work to reach the top of the window boxes with bags.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.240
What was it he got wrong?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.480
I don't know

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.420
[music]

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.570
One of the ways to help reach our goals sooner is to cut the top of the window boxes off

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.199
We wanted to go ahead and shorten the walls to accommodate the roof a little better

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.540
We decided to go ahead and drop them down one foot and that brings the whole roof down one foot. The wall height was just getting too high

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.040
after we add everything on top of the windows. It's going to be a skyscraper before we can get the roof on

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.480
[music]

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:13.380
In this building, I really wanted to do a lot of bottles. When you put them together

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:19.640
I don't want them to stick out too far beyond the bag because then you have cobb around and they stick out

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.599
so I'm trying to stay real close to the same width. Where do you think, Bry, right there?

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:24.360
Yeah

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.459
With bottles you can't just run barb over them and tamp over them like normal

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.840
because all the weight, when it starts building up will eventually break that bottle

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.200
So you have to like you put the bottle in and back up to it

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.909
and then do a thin layer over the top of it and then when you tamp, you only tamp up to it

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.390
Don't tap on top of it until at least you get the next layer on

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.360
Beer bottles

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.220
They're not beer bottles

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.680
[music]

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.960
I like this arch

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.960
[music]

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:08.800
When we first started the design process for this and everything, Dad really wanted to put in buttresses

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.079
We talked them out of it because we don't like the look

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.480
Because we didn't put the buttresses in. It is possible that we had more problems than we really

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.900
would normally have had.  If you too many layers too fast and they never get a chance to dry and harden

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.879
It's like a bag that can move even even with it just being damp. Once it gets hardened

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.929
the thing is Rock solid. A 30 foot circle on a 14 inch bag is

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:36.070
Absolute max

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:41.580
that you'd ever want to do. It really is. We didn't really know that going in and we didn't really think that far

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.809
We didn't even think it would matter really because we've had such good luck with the smaller circles

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:51.239
And then once we got to a certain height we had some issues with just

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:57.479
setting the walls and our center line got a little shorter at one point it brought the walls in and out and normally that would

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:57.970
be okay

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:03.449
But then we had a big rain come through. It soaked the bags all the way through down to the bottom one

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.419
It caused a lot of weakening to happen and then it started to buckle

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:10.049
I mean if we were put buttresses in, we wouldn't had these problems

00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:17.069
It was the worst place for something like this to happen, but it did right there. We noticed it was definitely moving

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:24.059
So we're going to try to fix it. We decided to use come-alongs. So we're at the base of the door downstairs

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.979
We're able to connect the come-along at the base, run a cable all the way up to the wall

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:35.610
We're able to run the cable through. We put a backing on the back of that.Back and around out to the come-along and then

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.130
use the come-along to bring the wall in

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:47.279
That is already a ton better. Look at this line. I'd go some more

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.549
He needs to be pushed in and I'm thinking we could tamp it and it would move it over and then tamp it down

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.010
So this isn't going anywhere

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.560
Got this, you know

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:05.700
[music]

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.720
It's really working good. Garen come out here and look. We are already at one hundred two and a half. So we're moving a lot

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.130
Dirt on the center bag here since we had that big rain - all the dirt is still damp - hasn't dried yet

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.070
So it's going to resettle really nice

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.480
And if it was all dry the wall would weaker. This "s" turn kind of thing we had going on

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.760
we were able to get that straighten out. When we were doing

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.499
this, one of our links in the wire we were using ended up popping, which,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.980
I guess you kinda always

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.169
You're always afraid of it. So you're always careful around it, but uh

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.240
It actually happened this time. Yeah it come out about six or eight inches. Didn't it? At least

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.550
The come-alongs work really good to pull the wall back to where we wanted it

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:55.289
I think what was was the spring effect where we had pulled it in. When it busted

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.539
It's just like whoa. It went as far

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.870
as it could go instead of just coming back to normal so it went a little bit past

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:05.100
We brought it back in and it's just unforeseen. We can't always - sometimes things break

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.299
It's actually a pretty good testament to what the bags - how sturdy

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:15.750
they really are. I mean to be able to spring back like that and hang out just at a crazy angle and just stop

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.059
I mean that's - it really is quite amazing

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.350
Dad's first thing was he just wanted to tamp it and I was like no no

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.899
No, you can't just tamp a giant section

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.910
Just does not work, and then you have to go over and I was out of ideas and so I was like okay

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.120
Dad's gone, we can test the tamp now

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.300
[music]

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.620
It looks better. It does.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.420
[music]

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.960
Don't tell Dad how we did it. Actually did end up working, a little. Was that hard to admit?

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.420
Yes. Look at that wall. Look at that wall.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.820
How beautiful is that?  Better than it was.  We managed to get it back in and get everything all put back together

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.480
[music]

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.380
We're digging some holes to put some posts here to hold up our murphy bed. So that worked really well

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.270
We not only get posts for the murphy band, but we also get posts for the wall - can help support it

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.480
[music]

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.880
Hey, didn't move at all. It's good

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.809
I've been thinking about some different types of roofs like this reciprocal roof thing kind of came up

00:30:30.809 --> 00:30:35.020
We needed to build a reciprocal roof as kind of an example - a reference

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.580
[music]

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.990
The guys bisect the circle, draw a line, and create eight equal segments

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:48.179
You went slow all the way across. I could of drawn six circles

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.969
I'll show you how its done. What do you call that?

00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:52.929
boom

00:30:52.929 --> 00:30:54.929
bi-section

00:30:54.929 --> 00:30:58.860
[music]

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.300
Look at that line! A little better [laughter]

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.939
So we were signaling outer space, weren't we? Our symbols in the ground

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.440
If you land here you can take us with you

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:21.060
[music]

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.120
Yeah, I think this will work pretty good. Dad is using an excellent method of attachment

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.189
Alright there it is. And it was strong enough that one of us got up there and stood on it.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.920
Gosh that is amazing guys

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.420
[music]

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.480
We went down purchased all of our wood -  got our great big

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.520
30-Footers. 30 foot 2 by 8. Eight of them.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.709
I wonder what kind of  trees they had to chop down to get those

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.280
at least 30 feet

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.880
[music]

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.980
Everything look good?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:06.800
[music]

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.765
So what is this? Dad, are you sure you got these right?

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.940
This one goes like

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.340
[music]

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.320
Hang on Hang on

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.840
And I'll going to figure it out. I thought I was going to just keep doing this over and over and it would work

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.240
It would work if we were doing that

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.820
We can create a

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.200
monster! We've created a master piece.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.120
This is not going on the video

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.360
[whispers] It's going on the video

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.520
[sings] We are the champions? Y'all go jo kim ah you better not me. I'm handling your eggs this thing in

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.220
[music]

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.280
the world's Heaviest Hula hoop

00:32:51.360 --> 00:33:11.680
[music]

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.840
I think we got it figured it out now. So all we've been doing today is just building sketchy scaffolding.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.580
It will work

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.069
The scaffolding looks like this crazy mechanism that was held up by one post

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.880
No, I it had four posts.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.520
Looked like it was one. It was scarier than heck but it was fun.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.240
No, it wasn't scary

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:39.680
[music]

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.920
Oh, my flailing system fun. I bet you wish you were up here

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.120
[music]

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.400
back a little more

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.120
[music]

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.900
Yes, that's it. Yeah

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.420
Intersection. Yes!

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.060
[music]

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.120
Ahh!

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.720
Did it fall?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.640
Then on top of that, they decided to put a ladder on top of all that

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.600
We couldn't quite get high enough - scaffolding only reached so far. So we had to get up on top of that

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.420
It's probably 25 feet

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.440
[music]

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:24.600
You're at the best view to see if this is level. Can you stand up to see if the  top of that is level? Do you feel comfortable?

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.710
There we go

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.700
See where we're at people

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.740
[music]

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.040
Push Push Push

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.850
um

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:39.959
He's on that edge, and it's just if he just takes one step back. There's like nothing

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.600
Nothing to catch him

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.370
It's so scary. They're, they're very brave

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.250
they're doing a great job is just

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.740
Look at that. It's so stressful

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.220
Just watching them. I can't stay out here

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:05.320
[music]

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.540
Hey, we got to see up in the air and thanks to Sam and Garen and Bryson

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.079
we got all our rafters up in the air and

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.380
Everything's looking real good. Ready to go

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.200
[music]

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.020
With the rafters placed, it's time to get leveling. It's about four foot across there.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.560
actually that one is our highest one

00:35:28.569 --> 00:35:33.039
we're just gonna go around and level and nail off all the rafters so that the roof is

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.800
is level

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.680
[music]

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.560
Someone chewed up our line level.  Yeah Bryson.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.120
What does this look familiar? Does that look familiar?

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.140
[music]

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.300
So that's your new line level right there.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.091
Yeah it's our new line level. It's top of the line.

00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:52.240
Top of the line [laughter]

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:58.689
Look at that beauty. It's so big for the hard of seeing.  Hard of seeing that's the wrong words

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.080
Visually impaired. It's bold.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.900
That way Dad can see it

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.200
[music]

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.420
This was a spot in the bag where the rain

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.559
It got so wet that it was oozing out of the bag and now it's like

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.880
completely solid

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:35.400
[music]

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:42.480
Here down here, you're looking up there - you're seeing this beautiful -  little wonderful curve that comes up

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:56.200
[music]

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.000
Here, I'll show you how they work

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.380
Sorry Bry

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:06.740
It's going to be boards that are going to come down here to help with these. They set up here like this this

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.750
to support the boards that are going to come out

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.220
We're putting in Jack rafters that fill in between the rafters

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.490
and that helps with the support

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.920
Yeah, some guy named jack did it.  I don't know why but they named him Jack.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.180
We named the monkey Jack

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.160
Arhhhh

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.000
Do you want to do the other ones now? I'll get this first 34 for you. Inside or out?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.188
It's inside.

00:37:29.188 --> 00:37:29.980
I got it

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.520
You know what's really cool is to

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:39.020
vave garen up there taking measurements and laying out and doing all that and then just hollering down

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.660
measurements for me to cut. Now he's going to be able to do it on his own

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.360
Over a little more a quarter of an inch - go back

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:55.640
[music]

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.440
The guys begin installing the Fascia - the face of the roof

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:05.420
[music]

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:12.620
We built the fascia in kind of a zigzag pattern which is the same width and dimensions of the rafters themselves

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.119
So it's kind of nice to be able to build it in that way

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:22.860
I know some folks will save money with using smaller materials, but I kind of like to match the tails with the facia material

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.220
[music]

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:26.720
Done

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.120
We're always really happy when we get to this point the bagging

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:38.550
We're on the last bay section, and then we're like, we're done for good and then it's cobbing and roof

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.100
This is victory my brother

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.240
We have won the battle but not the war

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:53.600
[music]

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.820
The kids they think they've done bagging but there's a little bit more that we're going to have to do but

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.439
They're feeling pretty good about life so I'm not going to say anything

00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:09.399
We first found this whole idea of the reciprocal roof from doing a little bit of research on the internet

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:15.639
I found this pdf of reciprocal roofs by a gentleman that's a designer engineer that's in Japan and

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.639
There was a lady, her name is Olga

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.309
Popovic. She had done a great little review of that particular process

00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:31.479
And how that was all done. The name of it called reciprocal frame architecture in Japan and check it out on Google

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:36.339
So it's very confident that this was a good process. Started cutting roof and designing it

00:39:36.339 --> 00:39:38.979
just like it was done in Japan. The idea, too

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.939
is that we have compression rings at the top and a compression ring at the bottom

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.889
It's very similar to a yurt or a teepee even for that matter you have a compression ring at the top

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:50.709
Where you rope around the tepee poles

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:58.620
I'm very happy with the results, and I've been building roofs for a long time and very fun - fits a circle just perfect

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:08.780
[music]

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:14.900
Dad wants to reinforce the frame with a cable system similar to a yurt. He heads to our metal junk pile

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.900
to look for needed parts

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.840
We'll look for a pipe for this.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.469
Here it is

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.940
perfect

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.210
If we run the wire through there it won't risk

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.200
Breaking eventually

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.159
okay now to make it pretty do you think we need to cut the other side off?

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.640
I don't think it needs to look pretty we're not seeing it right?

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.540
Yeah, this shows

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.680
[whispers] Oh, it shows

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.680
I say we do the four bend and clean them. I didn't realize we were...

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.660
you still can do the four bend

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:54.060
[music]

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.220
De-burring

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.120
Are you cold?

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.660
Yeah, I am cold. It's colder out here. I'm still in shorts.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.900
Freezing out here. It's not suppose to be cold.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.080
Garen's not in shorts but you always were the bright one?

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.520
Bright one what?

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.880
the smart one

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.180
oh [laughter]

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.800
Don't look over my work.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.220
I'm not looking.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.720
Yeah, right

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.020
we have enough in here

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.960
perfectionist

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.360
You're not going to see it from 40 feet in the air

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.830
just bring the pair of pliers and their cable thing you wanted

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.820
to do

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:32.300
[music]

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.300
What is your plan with these?

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.200
put these in here

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.300
And yeah, maybe against the wall, so it's all - looks the same

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:46.360
Just drilling a hole right there. Slamming this through - running our cable. We only have eight to do it shouldn't take that long. Does that sound good?

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.360
Yeah, that sounds good

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.200
[music]

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.300
There we go. That's one

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.080
[music]

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.020
Cable that we're installing now, is something similar to a compression ring

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.160
which holds all the bottoms of the rafters in and it's kind of an extra measure of

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.960
I haven't built one of these before so I'm kind of going with something a little extra at the bottom - like a yurt

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:23.420
[music]

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:30.960
the cable is going to be below the ceiling level so we do get the opportunity to tighten it and use it as a

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.860
Hang Banners or something from. It'll be fun

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.320
[music]

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.680
That's all I need. Nice.  That's the insurance right there baby. That's all I need.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.080
[music]

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.920
We went down  to get our plywood for the roofing section, but then I usually like to buy the plywood

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.820
But the wood has become so much more expensive than I went with the osb

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.360
It should be eight feet

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.300
it's not it's a little too long though

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.430
It's happening

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.480
Yeah

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.480
One Bay complete

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:12.360
[music]

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.420
It's looking good. Coming together

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:30.240
[music]

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.260
the last Mellon. That's it!

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.940
[music]

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.540
This is the top plate that the curve will set on

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.000
[music]

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.000
Dad made a seven sided polygon. I'm gone like the wind

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160
you didn't measure the right distance

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:59.220
Well, let's just pull this one and cut off another one that's a half inch longer.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.680
three fails this morning

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.720
Well third time's a charm right?

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.160
Fourth times a charm

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.680
Fourth? All right, then

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.900
[music]

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.600
Perfect. You are a genius.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.800
We knew you had it in you, dad. We always believed you

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:23.560
[music]

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.360
Through the hole

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.980
[music]

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.240
Well, I missed it

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:44.100
We receive a surprising call from Susie, an Ondura representative offering us materials to use on our roof. Today it arrives

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.900
[music]

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.840
push

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.920
box of nails

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:56.140
We're sure thankful that they gave us some product and we're all set. It's awesome

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:00.440
It's really awesome very excited very grateful these guys so willing to do this.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.220
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.600
Tar paper time

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:13.240
[music]

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.640
We're gonna go ahead and tarp it

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.520
He's going up. He's going up!

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.640
He's going up

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.240
He's not moving

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.040
Right up there

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:41.080
[music]

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.480
That's good enough. We can figure this out now

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.520
Okay, you can change this. You can slide it up and down.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.050
Yeah

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:53.739
Start putting up the first bay kind of figuring out where we want everything and how we want to start laying them out. Wind starts

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.680
Picking up - looking like it's gonna rain

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:01.880
[music]

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:09.120
Your width measurement now if you could give me that?

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.340
Let me nail this so that I don't move it.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.540
What we need to do is sight these

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:16.000
Yeah, go to the right at the top just a touch. That's it right there

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.879
Back a little bit - there. That's it that's perfect

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.260
At one point it blew even some of our sheets off.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.240
well, they're tough

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.120
yeah, they are

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.640
throw together the one bay that we got

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.340
okay, I'm I'm going for it right now

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.140
put things away and wait for tomorrow to finish it up

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:48.480
[music]

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.720
ut oh. injury

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.760
suppose to hammer the nail not your finger

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.700
tell that to the hammer

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.760
It's the hammers fault

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.100
yeah, it's the hammer's fault. It's out of balance

00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.280
unbelievable

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.960
sorry Garen. It's called training

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.040
poor Workman blames his tools

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.360
Garen

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.449
Our good friend Marvin came out to help us out and we're very excited to have him out here

00:47:11.449 --> 00:47:13.440
he's quite - quite the carpenter

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:36.080
[music]

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.960
now I've seen a lot of kids with saws and crews the stuff that I've run and

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:46.039
It's amazing to watch these guys use these saws. They're so confident. They're using them properly

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.120
safely

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.120
very impressed

00:47:50.240 --> 00:48:02.140
[music]

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.840
So we're trying to figure out a solution to this skylight

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.560
And I think we might of found one

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.060
I think it's the best idea so far. If it leaks...

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.480
I think it's Bryson's fault regardless

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.620
[laughter]

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.980
Now it's time to put the skylight on

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.560
[music]

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.640
Skylights on my friend. That means our job is done

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:32.120
[music]

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:39.780
The guys decide to start from the bottom up. They head inside and downstairs to start the soil cement floor

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:45.629
we set the grade by taking two bricks for leveling and putting one in the center of the floor and

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.099
at the seal of the door

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:54.300
And then we level it from the seal to the middle of the room.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.969
We want to have the right grade, the right amount of dirt

00:48:56.969 --> 00:49:01.980
So that we put it in the cement everything gets mixed in there. We don't have to pull anything out

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.240
There he is. We were fortunate to have everybody marvin come out and help again

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:15.140
[music]

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.400
I've joined the Marvin, Bryson, Shae team

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:29.280
[music]

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.860
Is he trying to pull it up?

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.540
He's trying to help you

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.560
Diesel, pull on it. Go that way

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.380
Come on Diesel. Good boy. Pull!

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:47.800
[music]

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.620
First time we turn this entire thing

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.020
I turned the whole thing by shovel first and then you guys did the tiller

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.860
[music]

00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.799
the young guy in the room

00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:03.929
Bryson, was able to like do twice as much work for us because you know

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.619
We're seasoned carpenters you know and so

00:50:07.869 --> 00:50:11.240
We weren't as apt at a shovel as he was so

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.760
poor workmen blames his tool.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.619
I'm not blaming the shovel

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.200
I'm just blaming the bodies of the two old guys that you are working with

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.860
you didn't know you were coming over for this did you Marvin.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.640
No

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.720
Yeah

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.840
[music]

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.700
[laughter]

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.280
There's something really enjoyable about that

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:40.760
[music]

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.660
So we use the water to actually dampen and keep the dust at the same time and then I got a chance to spray

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:48.440
Bryson every now, and then which was fun.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.750
He only did it once surprisingly I expected more

00:50:50.760 --> 00:51:05.560
[music]

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:10.480
When we lived in the city. You know we were putting the kid's in activities

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.679
Which is great. Ativities are great

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:19.160
But I think those moments that we spend working alongside each other are probably the most valuable

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:25.159
moments, we have with them. It allows us to build that relationship with them

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:30.679
You know they get to see to how we handle problems. And how we don't handle problems very well

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.360
So they'll see some of our mistakes, and they'll say that

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.540
we're not as perfect as we think we are. So it's humbling

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:41.160
And it's enjoyable because you're sharing and the kids get something out of it

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.040
I get something.I learn all the time

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.800
and you, you're good leveler.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.349
I mean with Dad. Not taking Dad out. Just helping

00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:53.929
We get to see how our kids handle stressful situations

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.640
The rock bent the tine?

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.839
on how they handle situations when they are tired

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.780
It just allowed us these moments to intervene

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.360
Try this again, I'm almost done with my crop circle

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.960
Did you hit another rock?

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:13.860
yes

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.520
Oh no

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.340
[laughter] It's huge

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.700
[music]

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.140
Call that done hey?

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.120
Gonna rinse this thing off

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.400
[music]

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.300
Now we got to focus on leveling it.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.740
and then we tamp it

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:43.780
[music]

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.540
Oh no. Diesel you're gonna get me in trouble.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.500
Don't make any paw prints.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.620
quick quick

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:03.560
We need to find and cut down some good tree limbs to replace the temporary posts for the entryway of the studio

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.180
We're at the pile of potential

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.260
posts

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.420
[music]

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.380
Want to help me pull this out?

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.100
Yeah, let me

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.500
wait, hold on

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:25.740
[music]

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.600
What do you think of these two? This one? That one? How fun

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:39.900
[music]

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.340
Dad makes plans to frame the floor

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:49.200
Put my double two by ten and then come out to about four feet and then cantilever back over the top of this

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:55.780
[music]

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.740
and so after the cleats are built we take twenty foot two by Tens and

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.599
Clap them together and then put them across the long distances - the longest part of the circle

00:54:04.599 --> 00:54:07.929
And then we'll just shrink it down from there and just put singles

00:54:08.509 --> 00:54:09.700
Bring it down here,

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.380
Bryson can practically push it

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.998
I can push it flat

00:54:12.999 --> 00:54:14.040
Yeah, he's amazing.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.660
you can nail that end in...

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.540
Show them Bry. Show them your strength

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.440
[music]

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.800
Because it doesn't have a brain it can't defeat us. Right boys?

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:30.680
[music]

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.680
The one that's going to determine the height

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.660
I think is going to be that one over there. The one next one over

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.960
or this one right here

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:44.180
we're going to put them in but not nail them and then decide

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.380
[music]

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:57.860
We basically lifted up the sides of the cleat so that we got a nice level floor

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:02.490
I think that's pretty dead-on

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.930
Exactly

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.700
Our goal is to finish the floor this week, so the guys continue installing the floor joists

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:15.500
[music]

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.760
four five six seven

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:27.440
[music]

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.520
We'll go ahead and block it up so they can work on it

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:36.360
When Bryson and Dad are filling in the sections on the floor, us gals are bagging in between the joists

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:44.580
[music]

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.960
We were asked if us girls use power tools.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.160
I use power tools

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.920
It can't stick up

00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:01.480
[music]

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.740
That is a hack job

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:08.220
the bags are like Adobe Bricks, but with nails in between them to secure the floor

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.480
[music]

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.560
I think I may have too much in here

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:19.780
[music]

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.220
can you get out?

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:22.320
Are you stuck?

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.420
[music]

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.680
Yeah, please take it

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.540
There we go

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.840
but hang on, it's wrapped like three times around

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.920
and you call yourself safe?

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.840
hang on

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.800
you are scaring me

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:40.740
and that is why we don't show us using power tools

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.440
That was dumb

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.980
you didn't get that on video did you?

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.520
No

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.260
okay

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.590
I don't want you to see that

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:55.260
We can do a couple of these before it gets too dark

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.860
all the way to the wall

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.520
okay

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.400
We're going to take these 8-footers and  we're going to run them out over the top of the stairwell

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.940
cantilever them out

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.500
we're going to party like it's...

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.720
we're going to party

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:19.180
[music]

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.680
Hi Buddy

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:26.520
[music]

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.680
Now, what are you going to do?

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:59.100
[music]

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:04.500
Hey, we're selecting our posts now for stair railing.Does this look like a great post?

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.899
It has some memories too into it - from our tire swing

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.640
Oh yeah

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.740
Kind of excited to do a mesquite stair rail

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.360
What's good about a post that's secure is if you can actually make it part of the floor

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.560
so it can bolt it down

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:25.400
[music]

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.820
That's what's cool about Mesquite is that it's really twisty.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:33.280
It's all over the place. It's not like plywood. Straight

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:41.260
[music]

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.880
We bolt it right to the two by tens

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:51.850
We're going to run that at 38 inches on the post height and maybe like 40 for the top

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.980
section after we get the railing piece on.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.399
and then bag right up against it and then put some blocks in

00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:01.269
so that makes really nice strong posts as opposed to just like

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:04.800
Attaching it with a bracket or something to the top of a deck

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.080
[music]

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:12.140
Now that the main stair posts our in, we're going to head downstairs

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.440
laying down from our electrical

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:13.940
yep

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:19.600
Doing the three-way switch, so we turn the lights on and off upstairs and the fan, too

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:28.860
[music]

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.320
Okay, so we are doing wall prep.

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.200
Not a lot of prep though right guys just a little bit?

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.800
What you're seeing is the aftermath

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:44.740
I was carrying this on my shoulder, then when it got right to shoulder height, it went "boop" like this.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.740
The plan you guys are doing

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:49.460
is mixing mud with perlite

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.340
[music]

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.240
One to one for right now - kind of see how it turns out

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.820
We're going to add some water probably just a little bit.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.560
I wouldn't add too much

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.140
Alright, should we go test it?

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:07.720
Yeah

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.400
[music]

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.460
Okay, let's pour some in Dad. Want to help me?

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.930
We got it to a peanut butter

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.180
Mixture that was their first one then I went to pancake batter. I wanted it a little bit thinner

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.620
What do you think of that Bry?

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.960
Well, it's sure a texture

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.159
that's soft

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.569
Yeah. More?

01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:31.820
Okay this is yours. I gotta go make more.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.429
Sound moves in a straight line until it hits something and

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:38.149
then the more times it hits something, the weaker the sound gets

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.099
So the idea was with the rolls of the bag we get a little bit of deadening. Also to

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.220
it reflects off of the little pieces of perlite so that it bounces off something.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.130
The more bouncing we can get in there really

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.059
Is the better. If  I can get all kinds of different angles and soft material

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:57.710
then that causes the sound to deaden, and that's we're trying to get  is a dead sound

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:03.019
Sounds good when you're standing in the middle like this. When you move over here is really does get quieter

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.160
over here

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.100
are we going to paint this down here too?

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:07.600
Yeah

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.940
Isn't this perlite for gardening?

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:10.440
yes

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.580
Do you want more water?

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:13.500
Yeah

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.920
The test  - think pancake batter

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:18.220
No

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.780
no?

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.300
I was thinking about something else.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.760
He was thinking of food. When I say pancake, it was like, "cool dinner time!"

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.340
actually I was thinking about food

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.540
[laughter]

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:35.680
[music]

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.320
So we have our fans

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:44.049
and we got our piping. The dog stuck his head in here, and it got jammed on his head [laughter]

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.889
This was kind of broken and kind of hanging off

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:50.950
And so we're trying to get it off. Dad get over here

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:51.800
I need your help.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.740
You need to run.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:02:00.040
Hopefully, we can salvage it and get some pipe out of it and basically our fan hooks up to this piece

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.539
this pipe to supposed to stretch out to eight feet but

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.570
it's got a few feet missing

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.580
Diesel you did not learn the first time? Do not stick your head in there. I think he might of enjoyed it

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:25.860
[music]

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.060
putting the air vent in now

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.880
Is going to be our draw so it will draw air from down there and push it up in here

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:39.549
It's got to go up that high. If we can grab the lowest, coldest air down there

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:43.539
Which is at the very very bottom right and pull that up so what we'll do is

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.199
We'll just run that four inch by 12 inch pipe

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.560
They make this like this, and we'll just go right straight down alongside the wall

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.140
you always need good airflow down there

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.400
It also gives good airflow.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.340
Yes, and get fresh air

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:02.860
[music]

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.920
Shelly and I were just like traveling around one of the hardware stores

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.220
And we bumped into this architectural glass we picked up a couple of these and we'll be installing them in the floor

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.080
[music]

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.740
You want to put it in?

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.240
Can I?

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:17.740
yeah

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.880
Think that that can handle the weight of a person?

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.440
yeah, why don't you step on it and see?

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.680
Easily.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.180
Glad my foot didn't go through that would been a disaster

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:45.640
[music]

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:53.560
This goes in here in the wall, collects light from the outside, but it all has to come through this hole

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:05.280
[music]

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:10.160
This week we'll start by doing some painting downstairs

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:20.600
[music]

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.760
Hi Buddy

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.199
Kind of like a grayish

01:04:25.199 --> 01:04:25.919
I like it

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.900
The plan today is to put in the can light.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.520
You can do it!

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.000
camo-ing to put the can lights in

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.420
Oh yeah

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.420
For people like me.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.300
Who make simple mistakes

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.600
well, that's ridiculous

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.980
It is

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.180
re-duck-ulus

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.300
Is that a head holder?

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.740
Yeah

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:55.100
Where were you when I put mine in?

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.340
you know it doesn't matter to have that crooked

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.060
does to me now.

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.460
doesn't matter to

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.180
be honest

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.440
[music]

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:14.520
If you think the guys were the only ones working then we're going to give you a sneak peek of a future video. Follow me

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.840
[music]

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.640
Whoa are those little dragons?

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:28.200
Yes. This is a dragon rocket stove which is built over the dirt foundation in the corner of the MusArt studio

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.220
We have a separate video that documents this build

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.300
We start the acoustic ceiling downstairs

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.959
We have some landscaping cloth here that will be running underneath the floor joists

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:42.720
And this will help keep the insulation that we're going to want to put between the rafters

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:47.020
Held into place we pull a ceiling tile down. We don't get a face full of insulation

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.760
[ringing] Hello

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.780
Bryson, where are you? We need you?

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.760
I'm literally right here

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:57.260
Really because like we need you. Dad's already like - I think he's almost done

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:07.920
[music]

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.700
so we ran into town

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:14.260
We picked up our tongue and  groove for our decking and we got all of our insulation too

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.570
kind of made out of jeans material

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.420
and that kind of stuff. So it has better sound quality

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.760
Wow

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.160
[music]

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.240
It usually has this grid system

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.200
and I didn't want to lose any ceiling so we decided right up on the bottom of those rafters

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.000
Dad found a

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.460
really really interesting way of holding the acoustic tiles

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.900
I thought it was spectacular.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.360
[music]

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.260
It already sounds like the recording studio

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.400
[music]

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.740
Last piece going up

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.740
All right trim is done

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.790
And it's looking beautiful

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:04.880
We're going to do this whole circle with this insulation because this is right above the sound studio

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.439
And this is supposed to have higher sound qualities because it's made out of recycled jeans

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.760
And I guess recycled cotton and that stuff

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.630
When you stick your hand in here, and you're like

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.720
brushing stuff out, it feels like petting something and all the hairs are falling off of it

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.400
ew!

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.400
ew!

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.060
What a picture that paints

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.090
we decided to put a mask on because

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:34.261
I think we're moving at blazing speeds so all the dust is coming up. Don't you think Shae?

01:07:34.261 --> 01:07:35.870
yes, sure

01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:40.040
There is actually a blower for this installation

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:45.890
But we live too far from town to go rent one and a have to go take it back. Too much driving

01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:48.499
So we're doing it by hand, but it's cool

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.720
We got this

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.979
The guys jump in to help a little bit with the insulation

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:55.960
Everyone comes up with their own unique way of busting up that insulation.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.620
This is just our tool

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.620
we've been using for sculpting and

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.560
putting cob up - trowl

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.720
And then I just kind of scratch at it

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
and it just gets a

01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:16.100
lot faster than tools or

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.839
Really anything

01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:22.789
So I think I found very best way break up the insulation

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:25.849
You can do like half a bag at a time and just put it in there

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.080
Pinch off the top with your hands just slam into the ground

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.080
breaks the whole thing up in a couple hits

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.299
half bag a time

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:38.460
[music]

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.000
We're ready to screw that one down

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.200
[music]

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.380
We're also using screws, and we're going really close together. We're using a lot of screws.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.540
And the floor feels really solid because of it

01:08:54.020 --> 01:09:04.120
[music]

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:10.420
There's a big difference between putting a floor down in a square room where you're using square materials and here

01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:13.860
we are trying to actually put a square peg in a round hole

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.069
It did make for some interesting cuts.

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:21.259
We had interesting things happening around and yeah, it was a lot of fun actually

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.260
[music]

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.040
We're gonna Dance on this floor. My baby and me

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.220
[music]

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.800
This week it's time for windows and doors

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.960
[music]

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.060
All right

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.040
[music]

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:55.700
Good boy good boy. Yeah, this is bullet. He's my new dog. He is a good doggy

01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.560
[music]

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.100
It's interesting too with the bag building as you tamp the bags down

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.500
any frames you put in place

01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:09.940
you have to make sure they are dead level

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.740
And either nail them or level then in as you go

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.750
because as you put those bags in and tamp those back down your frames

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:17.750
can shift around a little bit

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:20.159
There's a crack

01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:25.860
That's a kind double pane. So double pane because we have to take it back.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.640
I was just gonna say pain. ahhhhh

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.680
you're such a pain Bryson

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.120
[music]

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.060
Putting in some trim around the windows

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.700
easy peasy

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:42.300
nail them down, cut the sides. pew pew

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:49.360
[music]

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.400
We were out enjoying our cobbing session, singing.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.380
As usual

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.160
Singing. Normal. Laughing, enjoying each other's company

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.100
and then

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:09.639
Bryson joins us and our wonderful little session turns into an argument about measurements

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:13.389
you treated her like she didn't know anything so I will respond

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:15.540
What is that even

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:20.889
I know all sorts of measurements because I work in like you know like stuff and I'm like

01:11:20.889 --> 01:11:22.889
Huh. You wanna go?

01:11:23.239 --> 01:11:26.140
Do you know what a cubit is? No, but I know what a cupid is.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.819
Do you know what a centimeter is

01:11:28.489 --> 01:11:32.329
And I was like no, Bryson. I don't know what a centimeter is

01:11:32.329 --> 01:11:33.759
but in the end

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.900
I won because he didn't know what a cubit was

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:40.200
that Shae, I mean, she did not know what a cubit was

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:45.220
I wanted to move onto other things 'cuz you know, I can ace a lot of things, but measurements aren't one of them

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.860
Okay move over that way a little bit

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:52.360
the doors are really sensitive things. A centimeter off and it won't shut so it's like

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.500
They're really difficult yo

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.800
Get right

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.900
get one corner 90 and  the rest of its lines up. On double doors

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.920
It's a little more complicated because you got six foot. We want that to be even all the way around

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:09.630
You know it looks really good

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.140
Our door is finished

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.820
It shuts and locks

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.300
It's done

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.420
It feels good to finish it

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.720
[music]

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.520
Last week while we were working on the outside my friend Esther came over and she was a big help

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.600
And we were all just kind of singing songs

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.000
Esther do you mind being in the video?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.060
No

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.180
I give you my consent to put my beautiful face on the screen

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:50.260
Let's just say men of his stature are in short supply

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.800
You may have to "lower" your expectations

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:59.640
Recently, we've all really gotten into a movie on Netflix called Shrek the Musical and we've all been

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.300
singing the songs, quoting the lines

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.140
[singing] Now he lives in squaller

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.480
Me and Bree were really happy when

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.780
Esther saw the show with us. So that she gets all of our jokes now and understands our quoting

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.580
But you have to be this tall to get in

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.620
What can I say?

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.820
It is  almost Gru, it's a little weirder.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.560
I don't even know what I think

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.040
I don't have time for Diesel antics

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:39.700
[music]

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:44.200
In the next three days things are really going to get serious

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.840
We do not have everything done that we would like to have done. So we've been really putting in an extra effort

01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:05.160
[music]

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.040
We're going to be bringing out a hopper that we used in my room for the cob and we're going to be putting stucco through

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.420
it and stuccoing the walls with it.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.459
It' a modified

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.840
mud hopper or sheetrock actually

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.470
the technique that worked the best for keeping the mud on the wall

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.269
is to actually use a method where we wet it down to almost a liquid

01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:33.260
Bryson would throw his thumb over the top of the hopper hole, I guess, and then when he's ready to release the air

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:35.510
He would just pull his thumb away

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.450
I think thicker or two coats. That's what I say

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.103
I wanted it really wet and Dad wanted it really dry.

01:14:46.103 --> 01:14:48.020
So like a slurry Dad

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.580
Try something like this. You are probably right.

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:57.379
It pours out, but it sure goes on nice

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.559
we were on opposite ends of the field and

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.880
Bree comes in and says, why don't you guys just make an in-between batch.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.109
This is slightly thicker, okay?

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:11.320
just to ease both you and Dad. Happy medium.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.880
Okay, go get it. See what happens. I'm game for something new

01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:19.370
Leave it up to her for the logic

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.640
looks like water

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:29.100
[music]

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.580
Nice huh?

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.820
Good?

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.540
Yeah

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.300
although I still think it should have been wetter

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.940
[music]

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.300
I need windshield wipers

01:15:49.300 --> 01:16:02.520
[music]

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.200
Every once in a while, my dog would lose sight of me

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.280
and howling and howling. M dog is so attached to me

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.260
I'm right here.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.700
What you doing buddy?

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.400
You have to get better at tracking Dude.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.680
I can't go anywhere without him howling for me if I lose him

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.640
Don't worry about it. I got you.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.380
[music]

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.600
All right, point out spots Dad

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.800
Because I know you probably got a thousand of them

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.360
We get done covering the main coat of the building and then I hear Dad

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:39.013
And he goes, I want to do another batch.

01:16:39.013 --> 01:16:39.660
Pretty tired.

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.420
You were pretty tired

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.760
I was not very happy at that. But, I knew that we had to do it because, you know

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.760
a few spots we needed to fix up

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.880
[music]

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.800
Mom was watching me clean off the bottle and how the light would just like shine through in the room would get

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.600
a smidgen bit lighter and it was really, it was really kind of cool

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.660
Before we start painting we need to clean off some of the stucco. Shae found the perfect tool

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.100
I get to sweep the eves

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.100
Sounds productive, am I right?

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:20.640
[music]

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:31.880
The guys get out there, and they paint a section on the building and I'm just not liking the color

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:36.680
Part of winning is experimenting.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.649
That meant a trip to the store real quick to pick up some green, but we did find some

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.510
By the time I got done mixing all of this paint up and getting this new color for Shelly, Bryson is gone

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.100
It's computer problems

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.180
Bree's computer crashed, and that's kind of an important computer for all of us

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:55.010
with the livestreams and with her own work

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:58.680
So Bryson's in there doing some first aid on her computer.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.680
And I'm left to paint this thing by myself

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.300
[music]

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.940
If you painted the eaves of a home before, it's like totally frustrating. And having an air sprayer like in your hand, doing the eaves

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:14.950
is the coolest thing

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:21.169
I feel really bad because Gary, he's trying to accommodate the fact that I didn't like the color

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.819
But I'm still not liking it. I'm thinking well, maybe when Gary takes that plastic down

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:31.610
I'll actually like it, but it's just not happening. I look out there and like okay. Yeah, I like it

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:34.100
I like it, and then as the day goes on

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:34.650
I

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:35.880
just I just

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.460
I don't know what to say

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.940
It has to be right if you're not going to like the color, you're not going to like looking out there

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.069
It's a pretty color

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:49.580
I just don't think it fits into our desert scheme because it looks to me like it belongs on the beach somewhere

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:52.080
Aqua Blue - there is a lot of blue in that color

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080
Ocean. Surfing

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.720
I start looking into other ways to change the color

01:18:57.270 --> 01:19:00.470
Sponging, ragging, rolling, anything. I'm searching online

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:04.180
When it comes to the outside Mom's the final decision

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.540
We're going to go with the dark green

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:09.560
and then Bree is going to put a little bit of white over it.

01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:11.990
I think I'm going to like this a little more

01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:16.140
It's kind of toned that down a little bit, so I'm really hoping I'm going to like it

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.060
The trim color, too

01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:19.100
It's going to be really fun it.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.289
I think it  looks like chocolate mint ice cream

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.320
mmm I like the way you think

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.330
I really like this look - I think it adds. It's kind of a organic and creativity of of

01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:35.149
these shapes and textures, and it hides a lot of the bumps and blemishes in these buildings

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560
I'm liking it

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.700
[music]

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.020
I thought you had your headsets on. I thought I was safe to say that out loud

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.300
What have you done

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.380
um it's between my toes

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.160
ewww [multiple voices]

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.420
That's not comfortable.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.220
That was a "wow"

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.600
That was magical

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.020
I think I'm finally really happy with the color

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:13.840
It actually looks more deserty. It now has that little texture.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.020
granite, marble type of texture yeah, yeah

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:20.340
And it's hidden a lot of the blemishes. I like that too.

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.119
If you look at it with your eyes closed

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:23.600
it disappears.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.979
That's true. That's probably what I should of done before and then we wouldn't of had to do the ragging

01:20:27.650 --> 01:20:30.800
The family heads back inside to work on the stair rail.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.200
We decide to de-bark the stair posts.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:33.920
What are you doing?

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:34.569
Look away

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.200
It's not flattering let me I'll make myself look better here

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.230
no, just chips off the old block

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:49.660
I got this tool. Which is the good tool if we're honest

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.000
You know Shae, I really have quite an advantage with this tool

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Oh, yeah, optimism

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.840
Shae, are you shaping?

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:08.180
I don't personally think that Bree should be able to film anymore because all she can do when she comes over to film us is

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:10.180
pun after pun

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.440
You need to get out of here. Now

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:19.680
[music]

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.940
A bigger bark than it's bite? [laughter]

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:24.060
You're not welcome in the workspace anymore

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:29.080
Did you get some? He's de-barking that little piece right there.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:34.620
[music]

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.140
Hand railing that I'll be putting around here

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:41.768
You can imagine that you have this curve, and you have pieces that are really curved

01:21:41.769 --> 01:21:42.219
I mean

01:21:42.219 --> 01:21:44.649
they're the pieces of Mesquite

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.980
Twisted and turned and so on

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:50.109
It's a puzzle to be able to put them all together in a railing like this

01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.889
So that was a lot of fun

01:21:50.889 --> 01:21:56.259
I think what I'm going to go ahead and do when I put the railings together is to just go ahead and overlap them

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.020
Then run a bolt right through the middle and down into the post

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.420
[music]

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.460
This is so beautiful Dad

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:11.380
This giggly person here is my friend. She's gonna help us with the work today.

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.080
Hi

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.500
she actually volunteered

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:26.760
[music]

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.660
I got brown chicken pox.

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:33.260
so much easier and more fun to work with a friend because

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:34.800
you can sing

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.660
[singing] All I can say is "your welcome"

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:42.640
I hope to come back during the summer and help you guys build more

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.020
yeah free labor

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.620
thank you for your help too

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.280
of course

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:53.860
[music]

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.060
I left the door open

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:05.980
[music]

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:09.980
What have you done?

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.700
nothing

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.600
Nothing at all

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:21.660
[music]

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.420
Are you going to do a lot of those little ones?

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.800
Yeah, they're supposed to be designed for like, kids

01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:28.820
So they don't stick their heads through and stuff

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.460
So you put them real close together.

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.680
So I figure if we leave the stickers on, the  kids won't even what to touch them

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:34.100
true

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.060
Yeah, good thinking

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.800
[music]

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.400
What is that?

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.120
That's an ocotillo

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.400
I didn't even recognize it

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:50.140
[music]

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:56.560
That's pretty good wood down there. So just getting down to that white wood. We're ready to go

01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.260
I use my draw knife

01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:02.510
Yeah

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.280
see the top on it?

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.460
so that you have a slat so the distance between

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.980
the bottom of that hole and the top of this hole is greater

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:19.519
So that you can just push it in on the top, slide it in and pull it down, put a nail right there

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.540
So let the determination of how far apart these are

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.820
I just don't want Diesel to be able to fit

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:33.040
[music]

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.580
Diesel proof.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.740
It looks like it's Gonna work.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.960
Yeah good boy

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.060
We have this

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:47.060
section beside the stairwell that goes on down that's on the left hand side that is unused space

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.199
Perfect spot to put

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.480
to put storage, cabinets and

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.380
fill that up with as many cabinets as we could afford and just for one

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.310
Cabinet is a little over $100. See if we could find some used ones

01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:03.439
I find this deal of these looks like a lot of cabinets. We're going to go look at them and

01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:07.120
Really to our shock. They didn't come out of a kitchen.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.020
No. They didn't. They were all custom cabinets.

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:12.060
Oh, thanks Dad, I don't know if we could of handled that one

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.600
Big I know

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.600
very nicely made very strong. Maybe even better than what I could have put together

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.560
no. never

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.140
They were really good.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:24.760
when gary and I were going in to purchase them - we'll try to get them for $75

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.540
this is going to save us a ton of work

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.980
But when we got there, I looked over at Gary. I'm like

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.300
No don't offer any less. It was too embarrassing.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.610
It so much cabinets. It was already such a good deal

01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.040
And the guy was just great too.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.750
Yeah, he was a wonderful man

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.640
They're really nice too.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.440
very well built

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.060
fuchsia

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.360
I can 3D print dragon heads for them

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.400
that would be cool

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:56.299
Took two trips because one of them filled up the whole bed in the back

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.240
Every time you can close something down behind closed doors. The place...

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.749
Can't see it from my house

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:03.660
You know what I mean

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:11.760
We're just putting a white base coat on and then we'll go back through and antique it. It will look totally different.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:21.160
[music]

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.600
[singing] Your so vain, you probably think this building is about you

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.800
You're so vain

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.680
He's like, what is going on?

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:47.040
[music]

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.560
Shae has painted this all white now

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.680
it's really cool

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:53.720
Keep antiquing.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.540
What's the word on the cracks mom?

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.800
Well you can see now. They are actually coming through we were worried

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.180
They weren't going to come through and that was one of the things we wanted.

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.420
It's the coolest color

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.269
It does have a lot of texture. That's for sure

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:13.409
Yeah, it totally it totally matches the fun kind of shape and theme that we have going on in here

01:27:13.989 --> 01:27:17.609
Love this idea here. It's kind of a leathery

01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:25.679
stone look or cave wall. I just love this - dark spots, light spots - it has a nice texture to it

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:31.040
The cracks lead credence to some kind of bricks or something. It's nice. I like this

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:39.280
[music]

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.780
The guys get started installing the cabinets

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:47.760
[music]

01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.820
That was very cool

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.880
We decided to go with the two, long 53 by 42

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.780
we put the two of those together, and then a taller one that is 80 inches by 32

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.360
we drilled holes and we put bolts through the

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.120
connecting pieces at the

01:28:06.219 --> 01:28:08.759
Because it's a round wall and square cabinets

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.600
So wherever they connected we stuck a bolt in there

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.290
now that I have the arrangement

01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:15.000
We'll just go ahead and take the cabinet doors off

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.100
so I'm going to sand everything down and we're going to match the stain that we're going to use for the railing

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.820
One coat of Red Oak

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:27.800
Gary's idea is to do just a long streak. So we just do one long streak

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.100
[music]

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.360
How are you standing there? Are you on the edge?

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.060
I built scaffolding

01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:38.220
Oh do I dare look?

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:38.940
Yeah, Look

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.140
Then if I get bored

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.620
Gary Stop.

01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:45.360
Well, I'm wearing safety gear

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.100
what?

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.940
I have shoes on

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.760
You know those two you just put in

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.340
Oh yeah

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:03.620
[music]

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.040
3 and 5/8ths

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:06.760
Watch your finger

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:23.080
[music]

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.600
That's when I discover something we hid from you last time.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.620
We didn't show it because it's a secret

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.380
Now it's not secret anymore.

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.000
Hey will I fit in there?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:33.840
yeah

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.680
don't fall down to the third floor

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.940
Ya! Just kidding

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:44.180
In those old movies when they open up the shutters and they start yelling

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.880
She's very organized the way she sweeps each step separately

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.700
Don't judge me

01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:57.320
I love the way you sweep

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.640
I'm so sweepy

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.629
at least I'm cleaning

01:30:01.449 --> 01:30:02.600
That's true you are working.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.941
you have a very sweeping personality

01:30:03.941 --> 01:30:04.649
We're getting ready

01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:09.040
to cob-arooney. My strategically placed bucket.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.279
If we have empty space under the stairs

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.920
We can name that Harry Potter's room.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.760
it looks like something from hogwarts

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:34.280
[music]

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:41.440
Back at it again. We're trying to get our railing in for our stairwell

01:30:45.670 --> 01:30:47.160
How's it going Dad?

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.080
It's going great.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.171
Oh, Hi Bree with camera

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.000
What's up?

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.940
[music]

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.320
A year from now you'll wish you started today.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.380
You don't know who said it

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:01.160
nope

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.000
[music]

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.060
That's it

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:16.780
[music]

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:24.920
Secure the handrail right here. This is nice and secured. This is secure and that will be secured down here

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:33.400
[music]

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.740
Dad and Garen begin planning for the murphy bed

01:31:41.130 --> 01:31:45.160
And just started watching, looking, drawing

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.520
this whole section here

01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:48.480
Is going to be right in here

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.030
and then we  spent a couple hours

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.060
figuring out exactly what we wanted to do

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:56.900
My son has designed a little bracket that will fit our situation and I'm

01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.100
trying to determine

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:01.100
how to build the frame

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:05.600
There is plenty of room to get on either side of the bed

01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:10.010
Cob-a-knobbing

01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:14.780
Ellie's Gonna come to help us out

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.120
I'm going to go ahead and put a can light downstairs

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.880
What are you thinking right here?

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.080
that looks good

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.020
Hey, Dad do you want to come down here for a sec?

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.980
Cost you a dollar. Got a buck?

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.880
That mark here, I put it right in the center

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:40.000
perfect absolutely perfect. That will be a nice light down here

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.360
Yeah, you found me? good boy

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:53.240
The mirrors for down below as someone very kindly gave to us. Thank you Pam is going to be awesome

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.880
Jet mirrors

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.620
How should I attach these things?

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:07.000
[music]

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.060
It's not like you would expect.

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.980
It's actually soft

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.040
We have a solar light - nothing like seeing yourself everywhere

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:22.520
So we're good now or shut off lights and see how much brighter is is right?

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.090
yeah

01:33:24.450 --> 01:33:27.980
Wow, that is a whole ton better.

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.860
Yeah look it's even reflecting off the wall

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:34.520
[music]

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800
Perfect, we're done

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:40.400
[music]

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.980
This is going to be for our Murphy bed

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:47.780
We found somebody who had a great design to make the frame in the box

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.080
Today we put together the box

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:55.920
It was simple a couple pieces of plywood - nails or screws

01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.460
glued

01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.370
this is

01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:04.070
the bottom piece or actually the right side piece. It's going to go up onto the right side

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:07.099
And it should fit right up here against the wall

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:10.540
And be the right side of our murphy bed

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.120
hard to make a round cut with a straight saw

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:19.880
[music]

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:27.080
We're going to do the same thing we did in my room. Which is using these floor panels as ceiling panels inside of the stairs

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:35.700
[music]

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:38.020
That's nice. Just like there's a light up there

01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.090
That's really cool

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:43.761
We found a seat swivel for a boat

01:34:43.761 --> 01:34:46.999
it's a six inch plate with a nice swivel

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.740
And that's the main mechanism for both sides

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.770
it will sit here

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.120
[music]

01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:57.460
It will be comfortable.

01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:59.380
This pieces are going to need quite a bit of cleaning

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.320
[music]

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:07.700
Just an L bracket with a spring offset on the L bracket

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.880
and then the seat swivel will be offset as well

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.260
That way we'll get tension when the bed's coming down.

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.270
So it doesn't just fall

01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:18.609
We're going to get these two hinges installed and finish up the murphy bed

01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.740
Is your arm in there?

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:24.760
It's out. I'm okay

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:27.720
should we squish the dogs?

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.640
we don't need them right?

01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:35.260
And the good thing is that if it's wrong, we'll just unscrew and fix it

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:40.240
This will send down. Yeah. This can go up. This is that

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:48.800
[music]

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.180
Hold it

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.800
Go up with it

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:55.960
okay stop

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.380
Okay, we need to get it up past this. We have to go through it

01:36:01.559 --> 01:36:03.100
Alright bring it down. Let's see what happens.

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:04.720
Counterweights it really nicely

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:05.749
it does

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.360
There, it's good. Okay. I have a spring?

01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.360
Let me jump out

01:36:18.329 --> 01:36:20.329
how's that feel Bry?

01:36:22.559 --> 01:36:24.320
Get two of those bad boys.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.120
It was fun. There was a lot of thinking that went into it

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.600
I like that

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.200
It turned out to be a lot simpler which was which was really good.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.920
Yeah, I'll be able to do that

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.720
We got functionality on all the mechanical

01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:46.720
parts of this thing built.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.140
the springs are in, the hinges are in.Iit's going to work really good.

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.820
Hey all right

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.820
Oh yeah that's easy peasy

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:56.760
The material for the ceiling arrives

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.200
we got some canvas here for the ceiling

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.909
Oh, well, not exactly canvas

01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:06.000
100 yards of burlap

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.060
there it is

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.880
we love the look of the reciprocal roof.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:11.640
It's got this cute little design

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:16.460
It's a shame to think that we might have to cover that up, so we started thinking about

01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:18.640
how could we do that?

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.000
we could could put stuff in-between there

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.240
Still be able to see the design

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.899
we're going to staple this up in between the boards so that we'll still have the boards

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.957
showing and then we'll have little sections of burlap with the insulation underneath it.

01:37:31.957 --> 01:37:33.619
We're hoping it's going to work

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:37.939
We're doing nothing more than the little top part right here

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:43.369
That's my job while Mom and Bryson have been putting up the burlap and the insulation

01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:47.600
I have to stay ahead of them because we wanted to be stained before we put it up there.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.039
Duct tape it with a rag Shae

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.040
so doesn't drip

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.420
[music]

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:57.460
We're gonna have a finish line to work for

01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.080
If we set up the goal of finishing up the MusArt studio

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.540
It would be so overwhelming it would be

01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:03.560
miserable

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.180
yeah, so we set up small goals

01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:10.020
which is what we did on the ceiling and I think I got a little over ambitious on this one

01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.380
Tuesday and Wednesday, and so on all the way to the top

01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.919
today's Wednesday, which we're suppose to be on this layer

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.340
and we're still on Tuesday

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.720
We need to  catch up.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.310
I think the kids thought I was a little ridiculous this time when I named the rows

01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:24.340
Tuesday's done

01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:27.500
Now we're sitting at the Thursday, and I don't know

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.320
Still fun to have the goals and try to achieve them

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.830
but if we miss them

01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:35.720
Like in this case. There's a pretty good chance we're not going to make this one

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:40.000
Every once in a while her goals get a little ambitious

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:45.319
And if they're just barely ambitious, typically us kids are like. Oh, no, Mom

01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:47.360
No, this is where our goal is.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.320
But if there extremely ambitious, we're like okay

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.039
Come here, I would like to brush your hair

01:38:53.190 --> 01:38:56.600
Hmm.This is one time I'm going to deny your request

01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.300
just lean would you?

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:06.580
[music]

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.220
And eventually Mom's like

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:12.460
This was a giant goal!

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:16.300
[music]

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:22.680
What's kind of fun about these projects is I really enjoy the time that we come out together as a family

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:27.595
And we spend an hour of our day when we're all together working side by side

01:39:27.595 --> 01:39:28.759
On this project,

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:34.190
We couldn't really all be out there together as a family because we only have one staple gun

01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:38.060
We picked up this air gun for the job, and oh it's so worth it

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.860
This is a good investment.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:45.349
We took turns working in pairs or three of us would go out at various times

01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:49.300
It's some of the best ways to build relationships with each other

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.769
whether it's family or even friends

01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:56.569
I think that when you have to work with someone it's even more of a test to that

01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:59.460
friendship or relationship

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.100
How are you keeping up there?

01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:03.460
Watch this magic

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.800
Put up the cotton candy from hell

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:15.199
There's also you just have to kind of build off each other a lot in a work space

01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:17.779
You can't endanger someone when you're working

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:20.200
You have to know  where everyone's at

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.260
and you have to communicate

01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.980
Those frustrating moments you have to work out

01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:24.480
A lot of

01:40:24.719 --> 01:40:29.178
compromising when it comes to ideas - a lot of middle ground. It's like okay. Let's

01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:30.920
compromise here

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.140
That would be one way to learn

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:46.200
[music]

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.160
Bryson?

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.320
He has been 3d printing these little

01:40:50.949 --> 01:40:53.339
dragon heads. We're going to use them like...

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:59.219
Well, just like this in the music studio. Cabinet door handles

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:05.600
So we ordered some black plastic online to replace the pink knobs that are on the cabinets now

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.320
Hi Buddy

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.640
So we started out printing on Garen's printer because my printer was broken down at the time.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.240
It's finished

01:41:16.659 --> 01:41:18.460
kind of like a frog

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.120
It just needs to have all the support stuff taken off

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:22.920
It's cute, isn't it?

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.520
It's very cute. Gosh. It's just silky, beautiful

01:41:30.159 --> 01:41:32.189
To supposingly keep our hands safe

01:41:33.909 --> 01:41:36.045
But I don't want to smash this or ruin this

01:41:36.045 --> 01:41:36.989
Take a drill bit and

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.280
I was showing Shae how to drill the holes into the back of them

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.240
Oh my goodness

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.400
I'm gonna go get the old knobs

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.680
Let me get a screw here and see if I can get it

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.340
I'm not in my pajamas

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:54.200
What?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:57.800
[whistles]

01:41:59.510 --> 01:42:01.040
Ahahaha

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.040
It's not easy

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.050
Maybe if I held it on this side

01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:11.050
We used the same method that the other knobs did where the screw simply screws into the back

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.500
First ones done. Look at that

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.400
From it's ears.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.760
sure is a process though

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.000
Looking Good Shae

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.000
So our original number is 12

01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:34.920
But we may end up printing more depending on how many cabinets

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.790
We may put some

01:42:37.190 --> 01:42:40.040
larger ones for the murphy bed

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.880
going to keep all my fabrics in here.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.240
Keep my equipment in here.

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320
Oh Yeah

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.980
Wow, you're booking away on this

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:59.520
[music]

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.960
We ran out

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:03.720
We'll have to finish this up later

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.840
You know one of things that's

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.880
always with every project

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.120
is how do we get enough time to do all the things that we need to do

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:21.360
And I travel for work sometimes so it requires me to be out of town for three, four, sometimes five days

01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:24.969
You know it's frustrating knowing that everybody's here at the house

01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:28.520
working real hard like they're working on the ceiling.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.286
I'd really long to be with them too

01:43:30.286 --> 01:43:31.749
and be there. When I am away

01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:33.080
It's really

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.080
reassuring to know that

01:43:35.239 --> 01:43:38.589
Bryson and Garen are here, a part of the family

01:43:39.199 --> 01:43:44.049
upholding and I know that both boys really step up to the plate when Dad's gone

01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:47.080
And I just like, okay good. I feel better on the inside.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.080
These are the spindles for the headboard

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.880
dry out a little

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:58.630
It's so cool to come back and be able to play here and create and

01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:03.940
have a lot of fun. That to me. It's like one of the coolest things about what we're doing here

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:08.180
[music]

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.120
I really like the stain that Dad is putting on.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.880
Ooh, I didn't even see the railing. That looks so cool

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:36.480
[music]

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.800
We are driving towards the goal of completing the underground music studio

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.400
With several finishing touches still needed to be completed, the family heads downstairs to see what's next

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.920
Ooh, it's really dark in here.

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.660
The gap between the ceiling and the wall still needs to be filled

01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.900
okay this looks really ridiculous

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.380
But we did this on Bryson's room

01:44:58.830 --> 01:45:01.580
it goes between the ceiling and the wall

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:04.960
and we'll trim it off and paint it purple

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.760
and it will look halfway decent

01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:09.200
I use this spray foam stuff

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.920
I do not

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.780
take responsibility for my fallage

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:20.940
troublemakers

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.340
you want a different color

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:33.160
[music]

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:35.560
This is where Dad supposedly fell through

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:42.040
Yeah, he said he fell through all the time, but he really just stepped

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.890
a small step

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.410
Should I cut it out just exactly like he fell out?

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:55.660
You should  just put a bandaid on it and have that sign it

01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:58.460
okay, do you have a tape measurer?

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.160
No, it's upstairs

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600
He puts them away in "Lost"

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.840
Maybe he put it in the house

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.689
With so many of us working. We're always misplacing the tape measure

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.800
Where's your sense of adventure Bryson?

01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:16.530
Gosh, so unfun

01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:18.440
We only have so many of these

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.860
be a little careful

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:21.520
Can I cut it?

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.440
Yeah, please do

01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:29.260
[music]

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.780
Actually Mom I think we were both right

01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:33.480
All right. Go make us proud

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:41.720
[music]

01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:44.680
Were going to try to trim this off

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.511
to make it look like it is part of the wall

01:46:46.511 --> 01:46:48.850
it just look like it's part of that stucco wall

01:46:48.850 --> 01:46:52.180
And then Shae will come back and paint it with a purple

01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:55.990
And then it will blend in a little bit better

01:46:56.630 --> 01:47:00.980
I slipped and  kind of tripped and did that. Isn't it beautiful?

01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:01.940
Yeah

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:03.300
it's like my

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:03.981
signature

01:47:03.981 --> 01:47:04.500
yeah

01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:09.300
[music]

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.060
I don't have a light down here.

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:14.860
Working?

01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:15.360
Yeah

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:19.100
[fan starting up]

01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:24.700
I wired up the fan so that they'll work off just a normal plug in

01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.500
mainly because we just wanted to test them and

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.480
we needed to get some airflow down there

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.280
and they're working great.

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.860
Oh, yeah, I can feel it

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:34.560
There's already changing temperature in here

01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:39.480
Bryson and I - we were on the electrical for the building

01:47:39.490 --> 01:47:41.320
We started on all the outlets

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.990
Got them them in. We banged that out pretty quick

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.560
Where the tape measure? I need the tape measure.

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.759
Getting the height of the light is the challenge part. They all are a little different

01:47:55.730 --> 01:47:57.680
What are you wearing?

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.440
Army pants, flip flops and...

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.780
Isn't that kind of uncomfortable with that in your toe like that

01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.140
Very comfortable

01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:09.020
[laughter]

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.100
[music]

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:15.480
Why are you filming me?

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.360
What are you doing?

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.180
Putting in lights

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:36.280
[music]

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.860
The can lights were already in right?

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.000
The can lights were already in, we just put in the caps

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:41.860
we got light bulbs

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.160
This is the  unboxing and drop test

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.900
[laughter]

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:49.260
oh sweet oh

01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.460
I'm so much faster than you

01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:54.440
What's this Bryson? Why are you messing me up?

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.220
I'm not messing you up. You said you can do it faster

01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:58.640
Serious

01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.920
Yes I'm serious

01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:02.540
Are you serious?

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:03.980
Yes I am serious

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.440
Screw in a lightbulb Bry.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.820
Okay, I'm gonna go plug it in

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:12.040
Okay let's see if this thing works

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.320
The testing at the end was

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.293
everything worked

01:49:16.293 --> 01:49:17.480
Which was

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.200
See that, that is so cool

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.980
good. It means we did it right

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.620
It looks so cool

01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:25.880
Let's go downstairs Bree and check it out

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.440
Where's the switch?

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:29.700
Let's see. That's the fan.

01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.140
Really lights this room up pretty good.

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.260
Yeah, it does

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:36.440
it looks great guys wonderful work

01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:43.209
Got home from work today, and I'm so excited the boys went ahead and got all the electrical hooked up

01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:46.760
It's all working so good, so I'm very excited. They did a great job

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:49.800
The last thing needed for this building project is the floors

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.680
[music]

01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.880
you too sir

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.520
Our burlap came so we will be able to finish that

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.180
and look over here too, our flooring material

01:50:01.579 --> 01:50:03.240
So we are ready to go

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:04.900
Whoa!

01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:11.000
[music]

01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.900
Shae what you doing?

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.140
I'm cleaning the steps that we can fill in the holes

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:21.840
and chisel of the weird little things

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:44.660
[music]

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.200
Yeah, I got this one

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:52.180
[music]

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:54.220
This is Marvin. He's back.

01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.340
What are you guys up to today?

01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:57.453
Trying to get some pad laid down

01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:59.360
Marvin has graciously

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.280
donated some carpet

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.940
we took it right out of his house

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.320
so they don't have any carpet in that room now

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.580
He said you could do without for a few months. No big deal.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.680
I like perfect

01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:11.300
It looks good. It looks good all the way down

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.489
pick up a little stragglers

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:29.100
[music]

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.440
It is so silent in here

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:36.900
[music]

01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:38.860
I'm going to get the iron out

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.840
that one little piece almost covers the whole thing

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.340
yeah

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.580
[music]

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.960
Testing out the new carpet

01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:47.540
sick

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.240
So I get to mess up if we mess up.

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:50.960
Yeah

01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:54.120
I do kind of like the red tint.

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:54.959
I think I do too

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:57.480
I like that a lot. Much approval Mom.

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.300
Do you want me to sweep it for you and then you come back through and paint it?

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:01.060
Yeah

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:07.739
I'd like to make a point that Mom has started painting at the top of the step which is clearly a wise decision

01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:10.240
When there is no other exit

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.200
I'm only going to do half down and half back up.

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.489
You just you got this figured out

01:52:15.130 --> 01:52:17.130
Obviously, I don't

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:20.680
[music]

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:26.280
Get some new blades on our tools

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.200
[music]

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:36.100
Gary has this idea to put foam floor on the upstairs floor

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.620
Should we see what it looks like?

01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:41.700
I didn't want a big gray floor up there

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.420
I like the foam idea

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:46.699
to our surprise we found out that they made foam in patterns

01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.300
three-quarter inch plank

01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:55.069
And the only place we're going to use a straight edge is in front of the door

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.460
Yeah, everything else is cut.

01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:58.250
Bring it  over. Let's get started

01:52:58.890 --> 01:53:00.590
Once we get this first layer down

01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:02.400
We can all just get going on it

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.279
so ebay we found our best price

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.540
And they had a marble pattern

01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.800
I would prefer that but for whatever reason, it was a lot higher price

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:12.380
so we just went with the lightest flooring that we could find

01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:14.180
I think we want to glue

01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:17.140
this down like around the edges

01:53:17.610 --> 01:53:19.610
I don't think so. We can always do it if we need to

01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:22.020
Shelly, you should come up

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:23.320
Yeah, come up and look.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.340
You're going to like it.

01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:25.090
Oh, I love it

01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:30.420
Wow, they're big. I don't know why I would realize they're so big

01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.260
they're fun to have under your feet though

01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:35.336
there's a top hard plastic coating to the top of this

01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:36.760
it's not like foam

01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:39.560
This floor is going to clean up real nice

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:40.480
when it's laid there

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.070
I thought it would look really corny

01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:45.369
But I thought well at least it would be pattern, easy to clean and it's got the foam

01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:46.400
and it's not gray.

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.829
Can we get a drill too and we'll

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:51.000
open up our thing and see where we need to cut

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I'm going to build a square

01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:54.100
trim Dad right?

01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:55.700
on inside of here

01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:00.660
[music]

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.340
Should I start just laying down?

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:03.000
yeah

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.860
I'll peal the ends off and set them there

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:10.060
I think of all the jobs that we've done on this building so far

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.440
this one's my favorite.

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.300
Maybe you can play like

01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:14.280
I don't know

01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:18.460
[music]

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:19.920
Awwww

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:20.700
What?

01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:21.860
I just cut this one in wrong.

01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:24.400
The grains of the wood is going the wrong way.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.400
That's okay

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:27.020
It's gonna be because

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.820
yeah, we're not going to notice.

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:32.100
That's a really ocd cray cray dude

01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:35.829
I'm having a heart attack. It's singing off key

01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:39.440
You know what the cool thing about someone singing off-key is?

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:39.940
what?

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:40.989
it makes you realize how

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.480
good the people singing on-key are

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:46.800
yeah, it also makes you lament that one person is in the choir

01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:54.240
[music]

01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.760
This is amazing

01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:58.400
I love this

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.780
To my surprise it actually

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:03.909
looks really good. It  has a vinyl top on it

01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:07.360
So you can kind of clean it off you need to and so that's the nice thing

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.260
you can walk on it

01:55:08.290 --> 01:55:09.300
You clean it.

01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:10.300
It sweeps up nice.

01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:12.420
It's not very expensive, and I think too

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:14.649
if one gets ruined, you just replace it with another

01:55:14.650 --> 01:55:16.840
I don't know how you know how long it will last

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:18.960
and how well it will hold that, but I guess we'll see

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:19.740
Let's give it a tr

01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:21.140
that's what we're about

01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:22.200
Dude, this is so cool

01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.340
not to much left

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.160
We got to trim around those

01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:30.320
[music]

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.640
How do you like the new floor? Huh?

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:39.900
notice these and and those

01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.260
Been cutting some metal here getting ready

01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:45.200
to create the brackets that are going to hold

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:45.970
the murphy bed up

01:55:45.970 --> 01:55:48.380
just getting fabricated now

01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:49.280
will get cleaned up

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:51.040
and then the bracket will go from here over and

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:53.240
then we'll tie them together and put them on

01:55:53.660 --> 01:56:00.800
[music]

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:06.380
[music]

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:07.820
Don't fall in the hole

01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.540
What hole?

01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:09.040
Awwww

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:09.580
That hole

01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:10.140
Unwrapping it?

01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:10.640
Yeah.

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:12.080
Hey it fits

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.180
This is comfy

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:23.280
[music]

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:26.220
Notice how the crossbars is wood?

01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:28.360
Yeah, Dad likes it a lot better than metal

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.420
[music]

01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:32.920
Oh No

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.060
Yep, Dad is going to be really mad at himself

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.300
Push

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:42.500
Ut oh

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:44.900
Ut, ut oh

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.460
Daddy did a boo-boo.

01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:52.280
Can you fix it Bry? We won't even tell him

01:56:52.800 --> 01:57:26.560
[music]

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:42.240
[music]

01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:45.920
We just finished our MusArt studio. Let's go take a look around

01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:49.600
[music]

01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:52.480
Welcome to my MusArt studio

01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:54.420
Riighht

01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.420
Shae, would you like to show off your corner?

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:03.539
Technically this is my work area and that is my work area, but we like to say that is everyone work area

01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:05.700
But this one's specifically designated to moi

01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:07.460
Are you sure that's not the boyfriend

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.300
communication station

01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:10.380
BHQ

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:11.480
Boyfriend headquarters right here

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.480
[music]

01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:16.740
This is the rocket stove here

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:21.000
that Shae and Dad designed and put together and this baby's going to keep us warm

01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:23.120
during the winter time

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:26.039
We have a vent. We can vent to people now.

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:27.080
Just why!!!

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.540
You said I could vent on it right?

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:31.980
You don't even need my therapist anymore

01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:34.620
This is our Murphy bed

01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:38.920
Our cousin Ashton was actually the first one to sleep in the murphy bed

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.460
[music]

01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:45.660
You love it don't you

01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:50.580
[music]

01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:51.500
Sleep good

01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:52.460
okay.

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:55.720
Let's rock and roll downstairs to the studio part of the studio

01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.660
[music]

01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:03.980
You'll actually probably notice the sound difference from upstairs to here

01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:06.740
So we're still putting in furniture

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:08.100
and now we'll do the narrating

01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:09.030
The MusArt studio

01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:11.500
We begin with down tones

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:14.300
Can't get enough of my buttery voice?

01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:16.120
Wait, wait, wait. Here we go.

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.480
What are you doing?

01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:20.160
I'm just showing how beautiful you guys look in this light.

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.560
Can't always count on that light

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:24.010
Is there anything else?

01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:28.110
Look at this. This is our most beautiful editor in the world

01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:30.280
Our most beautiful mom

01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.600
Give me the camera please

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.269
Thank-you. That was delightful

01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:36.960
Where's the big screen TV and the refrigerator?

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.920
This is not a guy den

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.840
man cave

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:42.260
Oh, that's what it is. A man cave

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.580
[music]

01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:50.396
It has this olden, artistic feel to it. I love the curtains and colored bottles.

01:59:50.396 --> 01:59:51.800
I like being in here

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:57.180
I just really like it and just the skylight at top just a beautiful look

01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:59.119
it still has that modern feel though

01:59:59.429 --> 02:00:01.120
It's creative and fun.

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:04.219
The purpose of this building to have a place where we can think creatively

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.749
And a place to work

02:00:05.749 --> 02:00:09.200
You don't really realize how huge this building is

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.409
It's bigger on the inside. I didn't make a Dr. Who reference. What right?

02:00:12.409 --> 02:00:14.400
So let's go outside

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:18.420
[music]

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:22.820
Reflects light and reflects it on the inside at the bottom of the stairs.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:25.900
Oh and here's a little bit of cob on our window

02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:28.380
[music]

02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:33.240
We installed a patio here. Actually, it an entry way ramp.

02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:38.680
[music]

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.060
So that wraps up for this building

02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:42.440
Put it on repeat.

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.660
Put it on replay.

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.199
you can wash all your dishes to it

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.200
Thanks so much for being here. Bye

02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:49.040
See ya

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:55.040
Our family moved from the city to the country. Thanks for taking part in our adventure
