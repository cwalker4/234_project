00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.757
Hello.

00:00:05.757 --> 00:00:10.120
Today, I want to tell you a story
that's very interesting to me,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.457
which is that when Charles Darwin
published his Origin of Species in 1859,

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:20.628
the world was, on average, a much more
religious world than it is today -

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.731
the world has become much more secular.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.828
And, of course, his one book 
didn't have that much evidence,

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.429
but within 10 or 15 years,

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.130
the scientific debate
over evolution was over.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.850
Darwin's book was victorious

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.507
and the international 
scientific community accepted

00:00:38.507 --> 00:00:42.142
that evolution was a fact, by the 1870s.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.180
Now the question is,
How could that have happened

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.789
in a world that was so against evolution
and so religiously conservative

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:54.691
whereas today, where the world is
relatively speaking much more secular,

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.451
and we have billions of times
more evidence,

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.530
many people seem to think
that evolution is controversial?

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.523
These two things to me 
don't seem to make sense,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.846
but I think the history of how evolution
came to be uncovered in the first place

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:09.919
can clear this up.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.680
So, of course, centuries ago,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.711
people believed that the Earth 
and the animals and plants in it

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:20.222
had been created by a supernatural deity,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.359
rather as is depicted in this illustration
from Luther's Bible from the from 1530s.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.593
A century later,

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:32.758
Archbishop Ussher from Ireland
tried to estimate the age of the Earth

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:37.131
by counting the number of generations
of particular people named in the Bible.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.162
He came up with an age
of about 6,000 years

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.993
for the age of the Earth.

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:47.937
But, of course, there are
things in the Earth called fossils.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.470
Fossils have always been known.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.470
They are not new.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.400
Even the ancient Greeks and Romans
knew about fossils,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.669
and they explained them

00:01:55.669 --> 00:02:00.649
as the remains of the giants
and monsters from their mythology.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.272
So here's an image 
of one of such of these monsters.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.510
In more recent centuries, 
particularly in Europe,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.899
things like this were very common.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:15.250
This shell-like object, which we now know
is related to a type of oyster,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.199
was explained as the devil's toenails.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.031
And apparently the devil has some
pretty nasty problems with his toenails,

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:26.080
but anyway - and needs a pedicure.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.680
But these were dropped in the millions
all over the world.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.140
This was a folkloric explanation -
similarly for these objects.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:36.903
These were believed to be lightning bolts
that had hit the ground.

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.930
When lightning strikes the ground 
it makes one of these.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.450
These were called snake stones

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.330
for the obvious reason
that they look like a coiled up snake.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.125
There's just one problem 
with that explanation, of course:

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.770
none of these snakes have heads.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.060
But some local craftsmen
were able to fix that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.950
(Laughter)

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.500
by carving some heads onto them.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.676
Here's another very common type.
These were called tongue stones.

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:05.810
I'm not sure why. They don't
look much like a tongue to me.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.848
But anyway, it was tongue stones

00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:11.610
that first unlocked the secret
of what fossils actually are.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.710
And it was this man,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.640
a Danish Bishop named Steno,
who first established

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.030
that the reason these tongue stones
looked just like the teeth of sharks

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.377
is that they are the teeth of sharks,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.710
only that they are fossilized.

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:31.010
And that got him to think
very seriously for the first time,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.070
How could an object -
part of a dead animal, like a tooth -

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.830
become embedded in the middle of a rock?

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.180
I mean, that shark's tooth 
was once in the sea.

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:45.630
Well, he discovered 
various things about stratigraphy.

00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:49.240
That is that in places in the Earth
where the rocks are sedimentary,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.260
they began as mud or silt

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.090
and settled in a horizontal fashion
on the bottom of the sea or a lake

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.810
and that any hard objects 
that fell in that mud

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:00.640
would slowly be buried,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.160
and if more and more
sediment accumulates on top,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.530
eventually those layers become compacted,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.080
and they become shale or sandstones.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.970
But one of the important revelations
of this work, of course, is that

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.740
that means that layers settle
sequentially on top of each other,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.610
which means that
the lower layers are older,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.150
and the upper layers are newer.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.060
And thus it was possible
to start to unlock

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.960
the mysteries of the history of the Earth

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.730
by examining the Earth itself.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.600
A hundred years later,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.920
the Scottish geologist Hutton
was able to use such studies.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.600
Like in this diagram here,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.910
he's describing something
called an "unconformity."

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.920
The layers at the bottom
also originally accumulated horizontally,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.379
but somewhere in the depths of time,

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:55.396
they have become tilted up vertically,

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:58.770
then they had been raised up above the sea

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.470
so that the top above them has eroded away

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.520
from the erosion from being
on the surface of the land.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.080
Then, at some time after that,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.110
it had all gone down under the sea again,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.900
and new layers were deposited on top.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.220
He said that this sort of thing showed

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.960
that the Earth must be practically,
from our perspective, eternal.

00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:23.280
It is unimaginably ancient.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.300
What about the fossils?

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:30.460
Well, it's one thing to say that
a little oyster shell or a snake stone -

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.890
well, if it really is
the remains of a living thing,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.280
they could still be in the ocean -
it's very deep -

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.660
or maybe they live in a remote region
that we haven't discovered.

00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:43.190
But fossils like this,
you couldn't dismiss in the same way.

00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:45.730
This is the fossil of a mastodon,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.250
discovered around the beginning 
of the 19th century.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.350
And the great French 
comparative anatomist Cuvier

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.690
is the person to establish
for the first time

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.680
something that was 
until then very objectionable.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.760
That is that living things can go extinct.

00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:06.350
Those shells, you could argue,
"Well, they might still be alive."

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.259
But you couldn't argue that
about a gigantic elephant creature

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.170
running around North America.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.120
Nobody, for centuries, had seen any 
of these giant things running around.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.780
They were not hiding 
behind a bush or a tree.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.100
They were extinct,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.670
and he also proved they were related 
to the living species of elephants.

00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:27.310
This species, called 
the Megatherium, big beast,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.500
was discovered in Brazil.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.885
Cuvier established once again,

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:35.360
okay, this animal was the size of a car.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.832
But from its bones and teeth,

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:41.150
he was able to prove
that it was related to a sloth,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.950
which lived uniquely in South America,
where this fossil was found.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.120
This also is just way too big
to be hiding somewhere.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.420
They were extinct.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.910
So extinction became 
an accepted principle in science.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.260
Cuvier also conducted 
very extensive examinations

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.090
of the Paris Basin, with his colleague,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.990
and was able to prove

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.660
that there had been many different eras
in the Earth's history,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.320
in this particular region.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.140
There had been different ecosystems
with different plants and animals

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.380
which had been followed
by some sort of flood or disaster.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.889
Then there had been another age

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.040
with different plants 
and different animals.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.090
And that also had been wiped away.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.490
And yet another age.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.190
All of those species
were different in each era.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.730
And once they vanished,
they never appeared again.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.029
They went extinct.

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:36.169
These images on the side there

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.390
are some of his reconstructions
of what these animals looked like.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.770
They were mammals,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.440
but they weren't like any mammals
that were alive today.

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:45.209
They were unknown types.

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:46.809
Then these were found.

00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:49.940
Gigantic ocean-living creatures.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.539
At first they were thought to be fish,

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:57.139
but their bones and teeth demonstrated
that they were in fact reptiles.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.630
The one on the top they called
an ichthyosaur, fish lizard.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.000
They didn't have very -

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.470
They gave all the best names 
away at the beginning.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.560
Big Animal, right?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.340
Could have used that later, too bad.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.130
And the lower one was a plesiosaur.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.130
These were also obviously extinct.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.250
No fisherman had dragged up any of these.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.350
They also were found in deposits 
with these bizarre objects.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.949
They were scattered in millions

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:24.709
in the same rock layers 
as the ichthyosaurs.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.660
And indeed, with close examination

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.565
they were even found inside 
the fossilized bodies of the ichthyosaurs.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:34.539
And soon they figured out what they were.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.760
These are nothing less than fossil poo.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.120
Or fossil feces, if you prefer.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.220
This is ichthyosaur poo.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.730
And what it showed was 
that ichthyosaurs were carnivores.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.390
By slicing open these coprolites,
as they are called,

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.979
they contained fish scales

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:57.160
and the crunched up bones
of smaller ichthyosaurs.

00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:00.540
Which led some people to claim 
they must have been carnivores -

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.620
not carnivores ... cannibals, yes.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.970
So this allowed people to start 
to reconstruct a very realistic idea

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.219
of what this ancient world looked like.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:15.580
And this is the first depiction 
of the ancient Earth.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.450
You've all seen something 
like Jurassic Park, etc.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.810
Yes, yes. Very fancy computer modeling.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.249
This is the first one,

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:24.859
the first image of an ancient Earth,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.850
and there they are: ichthyosaurs, etc. -

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.020
munching each other and presumably
producing lots of coprolites.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.520
(Laughter)

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.368
And shortly after that,
the dinosaurs were discovered.

00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:39.290
The so-called extinct family,
with which we are most familiar,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.640
of giant creatures.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.280
Well, all of this
was put together by the 1830s

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.300
to a picture that was something like this.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.600
The world was unbelievably ancient,

00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:51.020
and the fossils that had appeared in it

00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:55.440
had appeared in a sequential
story of progress.

00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:59.500
That is to say that in the earliest rocks
were the most primitive creatures -

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.540
shells, mussels.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.990
Later they were fish.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.818
After that, the reptiles appeared,
and after that, the mammals appeared.

00:10:07.185 --> 00:10:10.690
This was universally accepted 
by all these men of science,

00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:13.090
long before Darwin 
or evolution were on the scene.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.000
Because this was not evolution for them.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.740
This was simply the history of the Earth,
and these were all religious men,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.070
as you can see from
the Reverend William Buckland,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.570
whose book we're looking at.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.430
This is a close-up of the same diagram

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.640
just to show you that nowhere
in this history of the Earth

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.720
were any human remains ever found.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.320
All of human history is composed

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.900
of that tiny little white layer 
of scum at the top.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.371
So there was no doubt at all

00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:44.830
that these ancient worlds existed
before the appearance of human beings.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.860
And so this is the way

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.830
these pre-darwinians
depicted the history of life on Earth.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.810
It was a story of
progressive change over time.

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:56.980
Presumably they thought
it was a series of new creations,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.800
one era after another.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.900
This is another one.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.250
You see that most ancient Earth 
is at the bottom,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.530
and you come up 
towards the age of mammals.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.750
Then of course there are the animals

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.180
that were being found alive 
in the world today.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.520
The diversity of living things 
was mind-boggling.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.960
It was far beyond what had 
been expected centuries before.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.030
And so this became 
a very fashionable subject to study

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.570
and try to figure out what was 
going on with all of these living things.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.180
And they began to categorize 
them in ways like this,

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.060
which to our modern eyes looks like
an evolutionary tree, but this is not.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.610
This is simply a diagram

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.860
arranging different kinds 
of mollusks according to groups.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.770
It's a bit like say, mammals.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.760
You have dogs, cats, mice.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.303
Those are all different groups,

00:11:41.303 --> 00:11:43.720
but they're underneath
one group: the mammals.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.850
And then, of course,
we meet Charles Darwin.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.670
Recent graduate 
of the University of Cambridge,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.970
he had the opportunity
to travel around the world

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.710
on a government ship,
the Beagle, as a naturalist.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.240
He made some amazing discoveries,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.150
including his own fossil animals.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.920
This one, the glyptodon, on the top, 
was an extinct giant mammal -

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.000
also almost as big as a car -

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.310
found in South America.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.300
And it struck him immediately
that this mammal - not a dinosaur -

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.530
this mammal with bony armor plating
on its back was strikingly similar

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.810
to the only other mammal in the world
with bony armor on its back,

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.080
the armadillo,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.310
which lives in the same place.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.370
Similarly, he discovered this one, 
called the Macrauchenia patachonica,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.950
"the big neck of Patagonia,"

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.700
which he was told - 
it later turned out to be incorrect -

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.030
that it was a giant extinct llama.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.140
And the same thing was true for Australia.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.727
They found giant extinct kangaroos,
"killer kangaroos."

00:12:44.109 --> 00:12:45.730
Their fossils were found in caves.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.320
Again, the same kind of creature 
from the ancient past as in the present.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.560
Of course most famously,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.650
Darwin went to the Galapagos Islands,
and he saw some pretty little birds.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.640
What was interesting is that he noticed

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.100
there seemed to be different 
types of birds on different islands.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.150
Why should that be?

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.830
Darwin as a geologist knew

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.308
that these islands had erupted
as volcanoes out of the ocean.

00:13:10.312 --> 00:13:13.145
They were sterile and naked and dead.

00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:14.970
Species had colonized them.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:16.790
As an expert of South America,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.150
he knew these birds were obviously
South American - sort of - birds,

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.240
but they were different species.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.386
It was obvious in those days
that a local variety could emerge.

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:30.060
You could take, say, 
cattle and horses from Europe,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.080
take them to America,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.670
after a hundred years or so,
they were a bit different.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.090
That wasn't evolution; that was just
the formation of a local variety.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.780
They were sure there was a sort of limit
beyond which things couldn't change.

00:13:40.793 --> 00:13:42.940
What about those in the Galapagos?

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.790
There they are, 600 miles away
from South America -

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.720
they obviously came from South America -

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.990
but did each species independently 
arrive at its own island and no other?

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.260
Of course not.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.000
It's much more likely that they
arrived somehow to the Galapagos

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:58.570
and then diverged.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.420
And Darwin figured they must have evolved.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.690
When he got home,

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.690
he took a little bit of time off
from theorizing to get married,

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.996
and the consummate naturalist that he was,

00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:11.140
these are his notes
on whether or not to get married.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.730
(Laughter)

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.800
Pros and cons: marry - not marry.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.610
I don't have time to read them to you,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.650
but I will just point out
that on the on the positive side here -

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.235
a constant companion, 
a friend in old age,

00:14:23.516 --> 00:14:25.337
one to feel interest in one,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.225
an object to be beloved 
and played with.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.160
Well, but then he writes above that line:

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.060
"Better than a dog, anyhow."

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.739
(Laughter)

00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:37.699
Okay, he was not a romantic,
he was a scientist.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.100
(Laughter)

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.380
Around the same time,
he drew this notebook sketch,

00:14:42.826 --> 00:14:46.344
which was the first time that
a real evolutionary family tree was drawn

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:51.399
to represent how living things
can descend from common ancestors

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:54.019
and diverge into many family groups.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.435
So this is the same diagram with the dogs.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.810
I've photoshopped the dogs
onto Darwin's diagram.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.600
To explain, from the common
ancestor of the dog groups,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.020
you have all of these possible descendants
with lots of them that have gone extinct.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.810
So, how to explain 
that some groups are very similar,

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.670
but others are rather different?

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.650
It's from differential relatedness.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.820
Similarly with his idea of natural 
selection - his most famous idea.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.390
But I won't go into that so much

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.910
because it actually had very little to do
with the acceptance of his idea,

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.670
which was that all individuals vary,

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.600
some survive and some die.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.390
But other evidence was equally powerful
for Darwin's theory, such as embryology.

00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:42.610
Embryos. The embryos of animals 
do not start out as little tiny adults,

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:45.730
that just get bigger and are born.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.400
Embryos go through a weird set 
of stages and shapes,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.260
which all resemble each other

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.450
despite them being 
completely different adult organisms.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.310
So in this diagram: a turtle, 
a chicken, a dog and a human.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.260
Their embryos all look 
remarkably similar at the same stage.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.120
Why? Because they are related 
by common ancestors.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.450
Similarly with homologies,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.560
the same structures in the bones 
of all of these different animals.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.160
There was no other explanation,
and there still isn't,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.870
whether they share common ancestry.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.730
Why should the wing of a bat
or the paddle of a whale

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.370
have the same identical bone structure.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.700
Then there are vestigial organs.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.260
Why should the manatee
have fingernails on its flippers

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.840
or whales that are born with no teeth

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.600
when their embryos 
have teeth in their jaws

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.830
or birds that are flightless 
that have wings?

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.619
Well, this young man, 
Alfred Russel Wallace, came along,

00:16:42.073 --> 00:16:43.770
had identical theories to Darwin's

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.070
and prompted him into print
after 20 years of working on it.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.170
He published the
Origin of Species in 1859.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.120
Shortly after that,
even more evidence arrived.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.990
A new fossil: the Archaeopteryx,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.330
still one of the most famous
fossils in the world,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.330
halfway between
the dinosaurs and the birds

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.579
because it has a dinosaur's skeleton, 
but it has feathers.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.258
And this is the shocking point:

00:17:07.258 --> 00:17:10.200
you've always been told 
that the dinosaurs are extinct.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.678
That is not true.

00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:14.190
One family of the dinosaurs 
never went extinct.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.089
They are called birds.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.618
So, the next time you have chicken, 
remember you are eating dinosaur.

00:17:21.618 --> 00:17:23.439
(Laughter)

00:17:24.138 --> 00:17:28.228
So, Darwin's theory is often called
"The survival of the fittest,"

00:17:28.228 --> 00:17:29.628
as a sort of shorthand.

00:17:29.628 --> 00:17:31.495
It's not a very good shorthand.

00:17:31.554 --> 00:17:36.060
I think probably a better shorthand is
"It's often survival of the luckiest."

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.240
Thank you very much.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.890
(Applause)
