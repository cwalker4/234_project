00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.340
From the fires of a sun’s birth, twin planets
emerged.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.420
Venus and Earth.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:24.610
Two roads diverged in our young solar system.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.880
Nature draped one world in the greens and
blues of life.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.990
While enveloping the other in acid clouds,
high heat, and volcanic flows.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.440
Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.960
And what light can Earth’s sister planet
shed on the search for other worlds like our

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:05.509
own?

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.479
For as long as we have gazed upon the stars,
they have offered few signs that somewhere

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.329
out there are worlds as rich and diverse as
our own.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:24.460
Recently, though, astronomers have found ways
to see into the bright lights of nearby stars.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.420
They’ve been discovering planets at a rapid
clip, using orbiting observatories like NASA’s

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.909
Kepler space telescope, and an array of ground-based
instruments.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.600
The count is almost a thousand and rising.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.569
These alien worlds run the gamut, from great
gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:03.039
to rocky, charred remnants that burned when
their parent star exploded.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.330
Some have wild elliptical orbits, swinging
far out into space, then diving into scorching

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.150
stellar winds.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.280
Still others orbit so close to their parent
stars that their surfaces are likely bathed

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:39.069
in molten rock.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.629
Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing
hints of water or ice, ingredients needed

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.580
to nurture life as we know it.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.110
The race to find other Earths has raised anew
the ancient question, whether, out in the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.750
folds of our galaxy, planets like our own
are abundant, and life commonplace?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.840
Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden
in a barren universe?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.519
With so little direct evidence of these other
worlds to go on, we have only the stories

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.890
of planets within our own solar system to
gauge the chances of finding another Earth.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.959
Consider, for example, a world that has long
had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.849
Except for the moon, there’s no brighter
light in our night skies than the planet Venus,

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.700
known as both the morning and the evening
star.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.670
The ancient Romans named it for their goddess
of beauty and love.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.300
In time, the master painters transformed this
classical symbol into an erotic figure, then

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.940
a courtesan.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.269
It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified
planet Venus, charting its phases as it moved

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.329
around the sun, drawing it into the ranks
of the other planets.

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.230
With a similar size and weight, Venus became
known as Earth’s sister planet.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.840
But how Earth-like is it?

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.240
The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught
a tantalizing hint in 1761.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.300
As Venus passed in front of the Sun, he witnessed
a hair thin luminescence on its edge.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.370
Venus, he found, has an atmosphere.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.919
Later observations revealed a thick layer
of clouds.

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.840
Astronomers imagined they were made of water
vapor, like those on Earth.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.190
Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.030
And did anyone, or anything, live there?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:06.509
The answer came aboard an unlikely messenger,
an asteroid that crashed into Earth.

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:15.950
That is, according to the classic sci-fi adventure,
“The First Spaceship on Venus.“

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:26.140
A 
mysterious computer disk is found among the

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.300
rubble.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:42.231
With anticipation rising on Earth, an international
crew sets off to find out who sent it, and

00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:43.590
why.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:53.930
What they find is a treacherous, toxic world.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:03.860
No wonder the Venusians want to switch planets.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:11.790
It was now time to get serious about exploring
our sister planet.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:20.110
NASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962, in the
first-ever close planetary encounter.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.610
Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing
at all like Earth.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:31.970
Rather, it’s extremely hot, with an atmosphere
made up mostly of carbon dioxide.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:39.599
The data showed that Venus rotates very slowly,
only once every 243 Earth days, and it goes

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:44.440
in the opposite direction.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.060
American and Soviet scientists found out just
how strange Venus is when they sent a series

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.139
of landers down to take direct readings.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:00.120
Surface temperatures are almost 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.100
the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea
level on Earth.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.259
The air is so thick that it’s not a gas,
but a “supercritical fluid.”

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.979
Liquid CO2.

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:19.500
On our planet, the only naturally occurring
source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.580
environments of undersea volcanoes.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:33.000
The Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures
showing that Venus is a vast garden of rock,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.069
with no water in sight.

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:41.870
In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface
of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.720
would be just 3 centimeters deep.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:58.120
Compare that to Earth, where the oceans would
form a layer 3 kilometers deep.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.580
If you could land on Venus, you’d be treated
to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.580
in orange hues.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:11.341
The winds are light, only a few miles per
hour, but the air is so thick that a breeze

00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:14.660
would knock you over.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.069
Look up and you’d see fast-moving clouds,
streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:22.830
per hour.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:30.220
These clouds form a dense high-altitude layer,
from 45 to 66 kilometers above the surface.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:36.950
The clouds are so dense and reflective that
Venus absorbs much less solar energy than

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.700
Earth, even though it’s 30% closer to the
Sun.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.370
These clouds curve around into a pair of immense
planetary hurricanes as the air spirals down

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:53.500
into the cooler polar regions.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.950
Along the equator, they rise in powerful storms,
unleashing bolts of lightning.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.700
Just like earth, these storms produce rain,
only it’s acid rain that evaporates before

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.410
it hits the ground.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:17.720
At higher elevations, a fine mist forms, not
of water but of the rare metal tellurium,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.690
and iron pyrites, known as fool’s gold.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:34.220
It can form a metallic frost, like snowflakes
in hell.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.550
Scientists have identified around 1700 major
volcanic centers on Venus ranging from lava

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:47.880
domes, and strange features called arachnoids
or coronae, to giant volcanic summits.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:55.310
The planet is peppered with volcanoes, perhaps
in the millions, distributed randomly on its

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.640
surface.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:04.070
Venus is run through with huge cuts thousands
of kilometers long that may well be lava channels.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:12.230
Our sister planet is a volcanic paradise,
in a solar system shaped by volcanism.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:18.710
The largest mountain on Earth, Hawaii’s
Mauna Kea volcano, measures 32,000 feet from

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.440
sea floor to summit.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.089
Rising almost three times higher is the mother
of all volcanoes: Olympus Mons on Mars.

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:33.519
Jupiter’s moon Io, is bleeding lava.

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:39.010
It’s produced deep underground by the friction
of rock on rock, caused by the gravitational

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.060
pull of its mother planet.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:48.120
Then there’s Neptune’s moon Triton, with
crystals of nitrogen ice shooting some 10

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.470
kilometers above the surface.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:58.970
Saturn’s moon Titan, with frozen liquid
methane and ammonia oozing into lakes and

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.089
swamps.

00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:06.700
On our planet, volcanoes commonly form at
the margins of continents and oceans.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:13.630
Here, the vast slabs of rock that underlie
the oceans push beneath those that bear the

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.940
continents.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:24.529
Deep underground, magma mixes with water,
and the rising pressure forces it up in explosive

00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:26.740
eruptions.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:33.450
On Venus, the scene is very different.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:39.029
In the high-density atmosphere, volcanoes
are more likely to ooze and splatter, sending

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:45.991
rivers of lava flowing down onto the lowlands.

00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:50.860
They resemble volcanoes that form at hot spots
like the Hawaiian islands.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.949
There, plumes of magma rise up from deep within
the earth, releasing the pressure in a stream

00:11:56.949 --> 00:12:04.019
of eruptions.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:11.420
To see a typical large volcano on Venus, go
to Sappas Mons, at 400 kilometers across and

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.570
1.5 kilometers high.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.830
The mountain was likely built through eruptions
at its summit.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:23.910
But as magma reached up from below, it began
to drain out through subsurface tubes or cracks

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:30.380
that formed a web of channels leading onto
the surrounding terrain.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.310
Is Venus, like Earth, still volcanically active?

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:40.860
Finding the answer is a major goal of the
Venus Express mission, launched in 2005 by

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.290
the European Space Agency.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:50.589
Armed with a new generation of high-tech sensors,
it peered through the clouds.

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:55.120
Recording the infrared light given off by
several large mountains, it found that the

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.100
summits are brighter than the surrounding
basins.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.990
That’s probably because they had not been
subject to as much weathering in this corrosive

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.990
environment.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:13.480
This means that they would have erupted sometime
within the last few hundred thousand years.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.140
If these volcanoes are active now, it’s
because they are part of a deeper process

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:25.010
that shapes our planet as well.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:30.529
On Earth, the release of heat from radioactive
decay deep in its mantle is what drives the

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:34.060
motion of oceanic and continental plates.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:43.610
It’s dependent on erosion and other processes
associated with water.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:49.540
With no water on Venus, the planet’s internal
heat builds to extreme levels, then escapes

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.139
in outbreaks of volcanism that may be global
in scope.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:59.279
This may explain why fewer than a thousand
impact craters have been found on Venus.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:07.620
Anything older than about 500 million years
has literally been paved over.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.980
So why did Venus diverge so radically from
Earth when it was born in same solar system

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.230
and under similar circumstances?

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:21.649
There is growing evidence, still circumstantial,
that Venus may in fact have had a wetter,

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:24.700
more Earth-like past.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:32.350
One of the most startling findings of the
early Venus missions was the presence of deuterium,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:38.390
a form of hydrogen, in Venus’ upper atmosphere.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:43.490
It forms when ultraviolet sunlight breaks
apart water molecules.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.640
Additional evidence recently came to light.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.579
Venus Express trained its infrared sensors
on the planet’s night side, to look at how

00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:58.880
the terrain emits the energy captured in the
heat of the day.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.480
This picture is a composite of over a thousand
individual images of Venus’ southern hemisphere.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:11.770
Higher elevation areas, shown in blue, emit
less heat than the surrounding basins.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:20.029
That supports a hypothesis that these areas
are made not of lava, but of granite.

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:25.790
On Earth, granite forms in volcanoes when
magma mixes with water.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:35.380
If there’s granite on Venus, then there
may well have been water.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.850
If Earth and Venus emerged together as twin
blue marbles, then at some point, the two

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:46.040
worlds parted company.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.000
Earth developed ways to moderate its climate,
in part by removing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.949
gas, from its atmos phere.

00:15:56.949 --> 00:16:04.290
Plants, for one, absorb CO2 and release oxygen
in photosynthesis.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:09.300
One square kilometer of tropical jungle, for
example, can take in several hundred tons

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.269
of co2 in just a year.

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:16.020
That’s nothing compared to the oceans.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.829
In a year’s time, according to one recent
study, just one square kilometer of ocean

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:26.759
can absorb 41 million tons of CO2.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:29.459
Earth takes in its own share of CO2.

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:35.160
When rainfall interacts with rocks, a chemical
reaction known as “weathering” converts

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:42.860
atmospheric CO2 to carbonate compounds.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.790
Runoff from the land washes it into rivers
and the seas, where they settle into ocean

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:55.949
sediments.

00:16:55.949 --> 00:17:02.890
With little water and no oceans, Venus has
no good way to remove CO2 from its atmosphere.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:08.920
Instead, with volcanic eruptions adding more
and more CO2 to the atmosphere, it has trapped

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:17.420
more and more of the sun’s heat in a runaway
greenhouse effect.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:22.350
Venus is so hot that liquid water simply cannot
survive on the surface.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:32.280
Nor, it seems, can it last in the upper atmosphere.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.780
The culprit is the Sun.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:43.220
The outer reaches of its atmosphere, the corona,
is made up of plasma heated to over a million

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.500
degrees Celsius.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.420
From this region, the sun sends a steady stream
of charged particles racing out into the solar

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.580
system.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.710
The solar wind reaches its peak in the wake
of great looping eruptions on the surface

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:22.190
of the Sun, called coronal mass ejections.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:48.090
The blast wave sweeps by Venus, then heads
out toward Earth.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:19:02.500
Our planet is fortified against the solar
blast.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:09.410
Plumes of hot magma rise and fall in Earth’s
core as it spins, generating a magnetic field

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.480
that extends far out into space.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.850
It acts as a shield, deflecting the solar
wind and causing it to flow past.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:25.520
It’s this protective bubble that Venus lacks.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.010
Venus Express found that these solar winds
are steadily stripping off lighter molecules

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.520
of hydrogen and oxygen.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.640
They escape the planet on the night side,
then ride solar breezes on out into space.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:46.840
All this may be due to Venus’ size, 80%
that of Earth.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:52.460
This prevents the formation of a solid iron
core, and with it the rising and falling plumes

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.970
that generate a strong magnetic field.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:04.660
There may be another reason too, according
to a theory about the planet’s early years.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:12.750
A young planet Venus encountered one or more
planet-sized objects, in violent collisions.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:21.060
The force of these impacts slowed its rotation
to a crawl, and reversed it, reducing the

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.800
chances that a magnetic field could take hold.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:34.820
This theory may have a surprising bearing
on Earth’s own history.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:42.220
Scientists believe the sun was not always
as hot as it is.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.880
In fact, going back several billion years,
it was cool enough that Earth should have

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:54.820
been frozen over.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:01.560
Because it was not, this is known as the faint
young sun paradox.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:10.170
Earth’s salvation may well be linked to
Venus’ fate.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:16.130
The idea is that the Earth occupied an orbit
closer to the Sun, allowing it to capture

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.050
more heat.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:26.330
The gravity of two smaller planets with unstable
orbits would have gradually pushed it out

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.340
to its present orbit.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:41.120
The pair would eventually come together, merging
to form the Venus we know.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:51.000
As dead as Venus is today, it has brought
surprising dividends in the search for life.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.430
On its recent crossing between Earth and the
Sun, astronomers were out in force.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.640
In remote locations where the viewing was
optimal, such as the Svalbard islands north

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.890
of Norway.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:12.830
The data gathered here would be added to that
collected by solar telescopes on the ground

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:20.310
and in space.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:46.370
To object for most was to experience a spectacle
that will not occur again till the year 2117.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:53.980
It was also to capture sunlight passing through
Venus’ atmosphere.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:23:02.050
Today, the Kepler Space Telescope is searching
for planets around distant stars by detecting

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:10.500
dips in their light as a planet passes in
front.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.630
Telescopes in the future may be able to analyze
the light of the planet itself.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:26.670
If elements such as carbon or oxygen are detected,
then these worlds may well be “Earth-like.”

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:34.990
Venus provides a benchmark, and some valuable
perspective.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:40.490
So what can we glean from the evolution of
planet Venus?

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:49.070
As we continue to scan the cosmic horizons,
the story of Venus will stand as a stark reminder.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:57.960
It takes more than just the right size, composition,
and distance from the parent star, for a planet

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:05.110
to become truly Earth-like.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:11.030
No matter how promising a planet may be, there
are myriad forces out there that can radically

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.210
alter its course.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:23.410
For here was a world, Venus, poised perhaps
on the brink of a glorious future.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.900
But bad luck passed its way.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:33.350
Now, we can only imagine what might have become
of Earth’s sister planet?

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.590
