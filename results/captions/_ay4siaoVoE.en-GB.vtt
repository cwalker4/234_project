00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.940
The time has come for
all of us to act.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.100
The time has come for
our European partners

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.920
to stop undermining
US sanctions against this

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.880
murderous revolutionary regime.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.599
The time has come for our
European partners to stand with us

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.230
and with the Iranian people,
our allies and friends in the region.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.039
The time has come for our
European partners to withdraw

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.320
from the Iran nuclear deal
and join us as we bring

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.620
the economic and diplomatic
pressure necessary

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.610
to give the Iranian people,
the region and the world

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.300
the peace, security and
freedom they deserve.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.380
We call on the European Union
to step forward for freedom

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.440
and recognise Juan Guaido
as the only legitimate

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.280
president of Venezuela.
[Applause]
