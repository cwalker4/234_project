00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.470
This video is a combination of all the parts
from the “All Stormtrooper Types and Variants”

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.389
series for easier viewing.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.100
Because we combined 4 parts into one video,
the list numbering will reset every now and

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.200
then.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.199
First are the standard stormtroopers.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.079
They were the most common soldiers of the
galactic empire, and served as ever present

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.480
reminders of the absolute power of emperor
palpatine.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.789
They wore all white armor that was designed
to instill fear into the enemy.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.000
It protected them from the environment and
gave them limited protection from blasters.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.440
The standard issue weapon for them was the
E-11 blaster rifle.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.840
They each also possessed a thermal detonator
attached to their lower back.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
Standard stormtroopers were usually used to
attack the enemy straight on with speed and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.910
with overwhelming numbers.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.780
Second are the desert stormtroopers, also
known as sandtroopers.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.250
They were equipped with modified armor and
equipment to withstand the harsh climates

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.660
of desert planets like Tatooine.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.289
They had additional training in specialized
areas and advanced cooling systems in both

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.270
their helmets and suits that offered them
protection from extreme heats.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.400
Their armor was slightly different from regular
stormtrooper’s, having a distinctive diamond-shaped

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.820
left knee plate, non-ribbed chest and back
plate connectors as well as reinforced abdominal

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.820
plating.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.970
They also wore a SD-48 survival backpack..

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.490
Third are the cold assault stormtroopers,
also known as snowtroopers.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.860
They were trained to operate in arctic climates
and wore armor that was specialized to the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.610
climate extremes of frozen worlds such as
Hoth.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.780
To ease breathing in extremely cold atmospheres,
a breather hood enveloped the snowtrooper's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.570
faceplate and fed into the suit liner.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.930
Each trooper was equipped with terrain-grip
boots, a standard utility belt containing

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.270
high-tension wire, grappling hooks, ion flares,
additional blaster ammunition, a survival

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.330
kit, and ration packs.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.430
The troopers' backpacks carried the main heating
unit, main power cell, communications unit,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.480
and a homing beacon.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.590
Fourth are the Incinerator stormtroopers,
also known as flametroopers or incinerator

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.590
troopers.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.030
They wore stormtrooper armor with red markings
that was exceptionally heat-resistant, able

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.170
to withstand high temperatures.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.310
They were equipped with flamethrowers.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.060
Imperial flametroopers were sent on missions
where an example needed to be made.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.750
They would march into settlements and burn
them to the ground, leaving nothing standing

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430
and would often burn bystanders alive as well.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.000
Fifth are the Zero-G assault stormtroopers,
also know as spacetroopers.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.061
They wore a two-meter tall set of Zero-G armor
that interfaced with standard stormtrooper

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:39.061
armor.

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:43.310
The suit provided a hermetic seal against
the vacuum of space and propulsion that allowed

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.319
spacetroopers to move and fight in space for
extended periods.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.370
They were trained to capture enemy vessels
intact.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.430
The suit allowed them to carry heavy firepower,
turning each trooper into the equivalent of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.100
a light tank.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.430
There was another style of this armor that
was lighter, and was used during the building

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.280
of the first death star.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.240
It was basically standard stormtrooper armor
vacuum sealed, with a rebreather unit and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.760
a back-mounted jetpack.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.580
Sixth are the Aquatic assault stormtroopers,
also known as seatroopers or aquatic troopers.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.130
They were used by the Galactic Empire to maintain
a presence on the many aquatic worlds under

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.430
its rule.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.690
The armor of the seatrooper was based on the
lightweight scout trooper design.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.030
It was worn over a two-piece environmental
body glove that provides protection from toxic-water

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.030
environments.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.120
The seatrooper's armor was pressure-sealed
to a maximum of ten atmospheres and included

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.330
a rebreather that allowed them to stay underwater
for more than an hour.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.140
Seatroopers usually used the SG-4 blaster
rifle which was capable of firing miniature

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.490
harpoons underwater.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.480
Seventh are the Imperial jumptroopers, also
known as skytroopers or air assault troopers.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.740
They were assigned to the battlefields with
the most treacherous terrain.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.550
They wore standard Stormtrooper armor, though
their shoulders were black and had patches

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.220
of red paint on them.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.820
Their armor design was similar to the armor
worn by Commander Cody.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.160
They were equipped with an AJP-400 Hush-About
personal jet pack that allowed them to burst

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.930
through the air in short spurts of about 20
seconds and allowed them to hover over a location

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.090
for an extended period of time.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.189
They also were also sometimes seen wearing
standard stormtrooper armor with a jetpack.

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:25.160
Eighth are the Scout troopers, also known
as biker scouts.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.199
They were usually used as reconnaissance troops,
spies and survivalists.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.490
They were especially excellent marksmen, and
thus they were regarded as the finest snipers

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.860
in service to the Galactic Empire.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.770
Their light armor allowed them to be more
mobile than regular stormtroopers, but offered

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.770
less protection.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.650
They usually used blaster pistols or sniper
rifles, depending on their assignment.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.009
Last for Part 1 are the Imperial shock troopers.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.749
They served as elite frontline forces of the
Empire, and also as bodyguards for Emperor

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.550
Palpatine himself.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.289
They wore extra heavy plate armor, which provided
them great protection from blaster fire.

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.909
Their armor styles would vary, with the red
markings being the most distinctive style

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.189
of the shock troopers.

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.199
They would usually carry heavy blasters and
rocket launchers.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.650
In some cases, Imperial shock troopers wore
Clone Wars era shock trooper armor.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.350
First are the Magma stormtroopers, also known
as magma troopers.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.939
They were responsible for crushing revolts
and other actions on volcanic mining planets

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.810
such as Mustafar And Sullust.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.469
Magma trooper armor was specially designed
to withstand extremely high temperatures,

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.740
including some direct contact with volcanic
magma.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.400
Depending on the planet, they sometimes wore
red armor as camouflage.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.129
They usually carried heavy blasters and flamethrowers.

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.300
Second are the Riot stormtroopers, also known
as riot troopers.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.500
They were specialized in containing and defusing
insurrectionist scenarios on disobedient worlds.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.409
They were trained for close-combat, and thus
were armed with electro staffs, made from

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.159
lightsaber-resistant cortosis.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.669
They were trained along side of the Imperial
Royal Guards, and were just as loyal to the

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:01.669
Emperor.

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.249
Third are the Wetland assault stormtroopers,
also known as swamp troopers.

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:11.409
They were trained and equipped to operate
in forested wetlands and other semi-aquatic

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.349
environments, such as lakes, rivers, and settlements
built on or near waterways.

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:21.819
They wore upgraded, green armor that allowed
them for easier operations in humid and poisonous

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:22.819
environments.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.779
Their armor was tinted green to allow for
camouflage in forested wetlands.

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:32.439
They were equipped with FC-1 flechette launchers
and also carried rebreathers that allowed

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.610
them to breath underwater for a short amount
of time.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.749
Fourth are the Stormtrooper Grenadiers.

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:41.819
They were specialized in the use of grenades
and were equipped with grenade launchers.

They wore a red pauldron and a black bandolier
across their chest.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.099
Another version of Stormtrooper grenadiers
wore regular stormtrooper armor with a backpack

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.589
that contained grenades, ammunition, and bacta
products.

00:06:55.589 --> 00:07:00.779
Instead of a grenade launcher, they were equipped
with a SE-14 blaster pistol.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:05.399
Fifth are the Radiation zone assault troopers,
also known as radiation troopers.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.229

They wore silver and black battle armor, that
protected them from radiation, as well as

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.659
biological and chemical exposure.

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:18.839
They were usually equipped with a blaster
carbine.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.690
Sixth are the stormsurgeons.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.539
They were tasked with performing dangerous
medical operations in the field, and in combat.

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.779
They wore a red pauldron.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.719
Seventh are the Bomb squad stormtroopers,
also known as bombtroopers.

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:35.899
They were trained in the activation and deactivation
of explosive charges.

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:41.309
Bombtroopers wore specially modified heavy
fire-resistant armor for flame precautions.

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:47.029
The armor was strong enough to withstand controlled
explosions and high-velocity shrapnel.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:52.379
They wore a long hood that covered their faceplate,
and they all wore safety helmets.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:56.909
Eighth are the EVO troopers, also known as
environmental troopers.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:00.789
They were equipped with heavy enhanced armor
with breathing tubes, which allowed them to

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:06.360
survive and operate in the most hazardous
of conditions such as extreme heat, acid rivers,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360
and lightning.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360
They were equipped with FA-3 flechette launchers.

Last for Part 2 are the dewback troopers,
also known as dewback riders.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:16.340
They were specialized in riding on the backs
of dewbacks, and were used in destroying lightly

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.360
defended buildings and defenses, as well as
attacking hostile combat vehicles.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.779

First are the shadow stormtroopers, also known
as shadow troopers or Blackhole stormtroopers.

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:32.920
They wore all black stormtrooper armor that
gave them great protection against blasters,

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.380
and they carried cloaking devices that rendered
them invisible for a short period of time.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.659
Shadow stormtroopers were specially trained
in infiltration and ambush tactics, and were

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.800
often assigned to extremely classified missions

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.889
Second are the shadowtroopers, not to be confused
with the shadow stormtroopers seen previously.

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:54.930
These shadowtroopers were stormtrooper-Dark
Jedi hybrid soldiers.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.260
They were armed with lightsabers powered by
synthetic Sith crystals.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.319
They wore armor made out of cortosis, a mineral
that resisted lightsabers.

00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:07.210
Their armor also had limited stealth capabilities.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.839
Shadowtroopers possessed some force abilities,
like force grip and force lighting.

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.740
Third are the Phase zero dark troopers.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.190
These soldiers were aged-veteran clones from
the Clone Wars, who had their limbs and organs

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.650
removed and replaced with cybernetics.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.700
Many troopers could not cope with the state
of being more machine than man and attempted

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.199
suicide.

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:33.860
Dark troopers wore a jump pack and typically
carried a blaster cannon or ARC caster.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.420
Fourth are the Phase one dark troopers, which
were imperial droids.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.000
This droid was little more than a skeletal
frame equipped with a vibrosword attached

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.600
to its right arm and a blast shield on its
left.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.589
They possessed basic artificial intelligence.

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:53.880
Though rarely used in combat, they were mainly
used as guards for imperial installations.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.410
Fifth are the Phase two dark troopers, which
were an upgraded version of the phase one

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.269
dark troopers.

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:04.010
These droids were equipped with a jump pack
and an assault cannon.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:09.470
They were heavily armored and were also capable
of being loaded into hyperspace pods for transportation.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.019
They could also be used as an exoskeleton
for regular soldiers as well.

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:20.200
Sixth are the Phase three dark troopers, which
were the last and most powerful dark trooper

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.200
droids.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.180
These dark troopers were intended to later
be made into exoskeletons and become the new

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.759
armor for the next generation of stormtroopers.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:32.910
These exoskeletons were supposed to give its
wearer increased firepower, strength, and

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.589
durability.

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:39.940
They were armed with a large handheld assault
cannon and two shoulder-mounted seeker missile

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.180
launcher racks that were hidden under the
suit's shoulder plates when not in use.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:52.459
They wore extremely powerful armor that was
nearly indestructible, even against lightsabers.

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:57.740
Seventh are going to be dark trooper class
variants that are very similar and really

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.620
only differ by name and how they look.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:06.959
These will include the Glory-class dark troopers,
Triumphant-class dark troopers, Exogen-class

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:14.740
dark troopers, Victory-class dark troopers,
Oppressor-7 class dark troopers, Oppressor-9

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:21.800
class dark troopers, Black Hole dark troopers,
Urban Assault Dark Troopers, and Inquisitorium

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.899
dark troopers.

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:28.579
They were primarily used as city guards, and
relied on a wide variety of weapons, like

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:38.290
the E-11 blaster rifles, EE-3 carbine rifles,
and DXR6 heavy carbines.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.269
They were typically droids, with a few of
them being cyborgs.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.040
They were heavily armored.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.410
The Glory-class dark troopers were one of
the most feared troopers by the rebels, and

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:53.649
the Inquisitorium dark troopers primary worked
with the Inquisitorius branch.

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:58.870
Eighth are the Darktroopers, not to be confused
with the phase zero through three dark troopers,

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.330
or the class variant dark troopers seen previously.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.189
These darktroopers were specially trained
stormtroopers empowered with the Dark side

00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:07.379
of the Force.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:09.080
They wore black armor.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.370
Not much else is known about them.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.050
Ninth are the Knighthunters.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.040
They were personally trained by Sith Lords,
and learned to defend themselves against Jedi

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.519
force powers.

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:23.130
They were able to block lightsaber attacks,
negate the effects of Force powers, and counter

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.310
the extreme athleticism of Jedi.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.800
Knighthunters were usually sent to kill or
capture Jedi.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.829
Tenth are the Novatroopers.

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:35.660
Novatroopers were stormtrooper honor guards.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.689
They wore distinctive black and gold reinforced
stormtrooper armor.

00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:44.529
They were assigned to either historically
significant locations such as the Sith burial

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:48.129
grounds, or to guard captured enemy starships.

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:53.920
They were also used as commandos in special
missions, such as infiltrating enemy bases.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.310
Eleventh are the Dark Novatroopers.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.439
They were droids and were programmed with
expertise in boarding operations against enemy

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:05.800
ships and as such were commonly used to board
Rebel Alliance corvettes.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:12.290
They were heavily armored and were armed with
heavily modified DC-15A blaster rifles.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.300
Twelfth are the Purge Troopers.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.310
They wore a heavy suit of armor similar to
that of the Phase II dark troopers.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.779
They were used to enforce the Empire's rule
in the Anoat sector on behalf of Governor

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:24.350
Adelhard.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:28.709
Another version of the Purge Troopers was
an early design of the Imperial Dark Trooper

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:29.709
Project.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.259
They were meant to be used against Force-sensitives.

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:37.250
Their primary weapon was an energy blade extending
from their left forearm, along with a shield

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.250
to block attacks.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.579
They also possessed a missile launcher on
their right shoulder.

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:48.910
They wore armor made out of Duranium and Cortosis,
which gave them great protection against lightsabers.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.800
Thirteen are the Terror Troopers.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.329
The Terror Troopers were created as cyborg
experiments.

00:13:55.329 --> 00:14:00.300
Their masks were designed to invoke the appearance
of General Grievous from the Clone Wars.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.120
They possessed a stun blaster and a cloaking
ability.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.730
They had extremely fast reflexes, which allowed
them to dodge most melee attacks.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.850
Terror Troopers were usually sent into hostile
environments in order to quickly dispose of

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.410
targets without leaving a trace.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.070
Fourteen are the Shadow EVO Troopers.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.120
They wore an experimental armor which mixed
elements from both the EVO trooper armor and

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.860
shadow trooper armor.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.689
This allowed them to operate in the most hazardous
environments while also having the ability

00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:29.410
to turn invisible.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.410
Although they were rarely used, they were
usually sent on operations on worlds which

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.999
involved menacing the local inhabitants and
assassinating resistance leaders.

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:43.189
Last for part 3 are the Hazard stormtroopers,
also known as Hazard troopers.

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:47.370
They wore a very heavy suit of body armor
that offered complete immunity to temperature

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.259
extremes, immunity to acidic damage, as well
as invulnerability to small-arms fire.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:58.779
The armor was also a functioning space suit
which could keep the wearer alive in a vacuum

00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:02.579
or underwater environment for up to three
days.

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:06.700
Their armor had limited protection to lightsabers
as well.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.709
Hazard stormtroopers, like phase 0 dark troopers,
were cyborgs.

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:16.350
They were usually equipped with either an
Imperial heavy repeater or a Stouker concussion

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.350
rifle.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.569
First is the Imperial Commando Special Unit.

00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:23.449
This unit was comprised of clones, and was
one of the most elite units in the Imperial

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:24.749
Military.

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:29.029
They were mainly used in hunting down surviving
Jedi and clone deserters.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:33.579
Their armor provided far better protection
than regular Stormtrooper armor, and included

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:35.790
special features like deflector shields.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:40.430
They usually were equipped with the DC-17m
rifle.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.809
Second are the storm commandos, also known
as Imperial commandos or shadow scouts.

00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:52.699
Storm commandos were tasked to instigate uprisings
on enemy systems and to subdue insurrections

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:54.959
on Imperial-held worlds.

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:59.339
They relied on stealth over brute force during
their operations.

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:03.930
Their armor was based on the scout trooper's
light armor and was usually black.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.569
They carried a cloaking device, that allowed
them to turn invisible.

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:12.699
They sometimes wore shock trooper armor when
protection was valued over mobility.

00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:17.860
They usually were equipped with an E-11 blaster,
and also used flamethrowers if the situation

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.100
required it.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.059
Third are the Imperial Navy commandos.

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:27.540
They were lightly armored soldiers that were
trained for patrol, guard, and monitor duty.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.050
Their armor was sort of like a combination
of regular stormtrooper armor, snowtrooper

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.110
armor, and scout trooper armor.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.670
Their primary weapon was the E-11 blaster
rifle.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.249
Fourth are the Imperial Marines.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:44.459
They were primary stationed on Imperial naval
warships and Star Destroyers.

00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:48.709
They utilized cutting lasers and explosive
charges to breach enemy vessels, and were

00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:52.300
generally the first to board on captured starships.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:17:00.370
Their primary weapons included an E-11 blaster
rifle and a MiniMag PTL missile launcher.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:04.410
Fifth are the heavy stormtroopers, also known
as heavy weapons stormtroopers.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:10.400
They wore slightly better armor than regular
armor and were armed with a rapid-fire blaster.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.740
The weight of their armor and blaster limited
their mobility.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.800
Sixth are the Imperial heavy troopers, not
to be confused with the heavy stormtroopers

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.200
previously.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.080
These soldiers were large warriors that were
trained for melee combat.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.030
They were highly trained, and were capable
of killing even a force user in close combat.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.480
Their armor provided limited protection from
lightsabers, and their weapon of choice were

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.130
electro staffs.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.790
Seventh are the Field stormtroopers, also
known as field troopers.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.710
They were higher ranking stormtroopers with
superior field experience and weaponry.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:48.300
They were recognizable by their multi-colored
pauldrons, which related to what their expertise

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.520
were.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.280
Orange pauldrons were equipped with E-11 blaster
rifles, Yellow pauldrons were equipped with

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:00.010
rail detonators, and Red pauldrons were equipped
with Imperial Repeater Rifles.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.240
Eighth are the Stormtrooper Commanders.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.180
They were regarded as the Empire’s best
soldiers, and had command over most other

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.050
soldiers, even Shadow Troopers.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.710
They wore upgraded armor that had blue markings.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.200
They were equipped with blaster cannons.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.050
Ninth are the Armored Stormtroopers.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.820
They are distinguishable by their heavy armor,
orange shoulder pads, and a red monocle-like

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.100
device on their right eye.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.510
They were also known to utilize heavy weapons.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.830
Tenth are the Clone Stormtroopers.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.620
They were Jango Fett Clones from the Clone
Wars who became the very first Stormtroopers.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.010
Although they possessed the same armor and
weapons as regular Human stormtroopers, they

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.420
typically performed better than them due to
their superior training and vast experience

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.970
from the Clone Wars.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.200
They would slowly be replaced by regular Human
stormtroopers and would end up being a small

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.170
minority in the Imperial military in the later
years of the Galactic Empire.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.440
Eleventh are the Imperial Coruscant Guards.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.890
They had similar duties to the previous Republic
Coruscant Guards, which included protecting

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.410
government buildings and policing the Senate
District.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.960
They wore distinctive crimson red heavy armor
that protected them from a majority of weapons

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.420
they were expected to encounter.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.560
Their helmets also allowed them to see in
complete darkness.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.190
Twelfth are the Stormsnipers, also known as
Stormtrooper snipers.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.560
They specialized in the use of long range
weapons, especially snipers.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.680
They wore a blue pauldron and sometimes had
a black bandolier strapped across their chest

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.740
plate.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.690
Thirteen are the Sniper troopers, not to be
confused with the Stormsnipers seen previously.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:42.160
Sniper troopers were trained to effectively
use the E-11s sniper rifle and wore gray scout

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.030
trooper armor.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.390
Fourteenth are the Crowd Control Stormtroopers.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.050
They specialized in suppressing crowds and
crushing uprisings.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.260
Their crowd control equipment allowed them
to easily fend off large crowds.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.610
They were also equipped with a thruster pack,
which mounted a heavy blaster module, a capture

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.430
claw, and a supercharged taser.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.510
Fifteenth are the Death Troopers.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:09.800
These troopers were undead stormtroopers accidentally
created by an Imperial biological weapon codenamed

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.690
Blackwing.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.660
They possessed only primitive feral instincts
but were able to communicate and learn from

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.620
each other through what seemed like unintelligible
screeching.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.050
Despite being zombies, they still were able
to use weapons and perform tasks they possessed

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.660
before they turned into zombies.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.080
Last for Part 4 are the Guardsmen Stormtroopers,
also known as the Emperor’s Royal Guard

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.000
wearing stormtrooper armor.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.820
They were used for field operations that required
special combat armor.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.310
This armor was vastly better than regular
stormtrooper armor.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:45.350
Because they were a part of the Royal Guard,
these soldiers had excellent training in combat.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.790
Thanks for watching the last part of this
series.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:52.420
We will be doing a similar series for clone
troopers and other star wars factions, as

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.150
well as go over other Imperial branches like
the Imperial Navy branch.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.770
I hope you guys enjoyed this series, and let
us know in the comments what other factions

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:11.030
you want us to do a similar series on!
