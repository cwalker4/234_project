00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:07.490
From lost worlds that float in the sky, to
abandoned places frozen in time, here are

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.460
10 of the most mysterious places on Earth.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.579
10.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.631
Mount Roraima
This giant plateau soars up into the sky and

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.930
is often surrounded by a sea of clouds.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.500
It has its own very unique ecosystem with
many tall waterfalls and highly specialized

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.680
plant and animal species such as pitcher plants
and the Roraima bush toad.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.460
Located on the border of Venezuela, Guyana,
and Brazil, 75% of the mountain is in Venezuelan

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.540
territory.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.570
Also called “the floating island, the cliffs
rise about 400 meters (1300 ft) into the sky.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.780
Made famous by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his
1912 novel, The Lost World, he writes that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.930
a group of explorers find dinosaurs and other
extinct creatures are still alive on this

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.930
mountain.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.489
And some people believe that’s still a possibility!

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.739
But before Doyle, there were the Pemón indigenous
people, that say that Mount Roraima is the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.799
stump of a mighty tree that once held all
the fruits and most of the vegetables in the

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.799
world!

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.649
They also believe that it was knocked down
by Makunaima, the trickster/creator god (depending

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.060
on who you ask).

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.469
This is the beginning of life as we know it
as when the tree crashed to the ground, life

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:21.689
was released.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.840
The mountains are sacred and no place for
the living to be as it is full of gods and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.000
spirits.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.159
Many say that Mount Roraima inspired the Hallelujah
Mountains of Pandora in Avatar as well as

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.140
Paradise Falls in Up!

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.719
See, Adventure is OUT THERE!!

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.729
9.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569
Pripyat
Following the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.780
in 1986, thousands of people were evacuated
from the neighboring city of Pripyat.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.009
Over 30 years later, most of the town is still
there, frozen in time and left to decay.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.429
The city had over 15 schools, a large hospital,
pools, amusement parks, gyms, apartment buildings,

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.240
everything a growing community needs and everyone
was evacuated in just 3 hours.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.789
Pripyat looks exactly like it did in 1986,
and the clocks are all frozen at 11:55- the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.980
time electricity went out.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.040
Now, over 10,000 tourists go and visit the
power plant and Pripyat every year.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.970
The government has created an Exclusion Zone,
a restricted space with a 19 mile radius that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.920
surrounds the blast area.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.700
No one can touch any of the items or sit down
on anything in this area and everyone is checked

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.570
for radioactive particles before they leave.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.670
While tour guides are happy to take you around
and claim that the area is safe, but Ukrainian

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.330
officials warn the area won’t be habitable
for another 20,000 years.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.900
The lack of people has been good for wildlife.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.080
Elk, moose and boar are now flourishing, along
with their predators the wolves and the lynx.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.260
The city of Pripyat itself serves as a warning
for us all and is one of the creepiest, and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.400
most mysterious-looking cities in the world!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400
8.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.750
McMurdo Dry Valleys
The McMurdo Dry Valleys are a row of snow-free

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240
valleys in Antarctica.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240
What?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.260
No snow in Antarctica???

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.560
That’s right.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.780
The Dry Valleys have extremely low humidity
levels and the mountains around the valley

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.520
prevent any ice from flowing down around it
from glaciers.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.940
There is loose gravel covering the bottom
of the valleys but no ice or snow.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.370
In fact, it is one of the most extreme deserts
in the world, with its only lakes being saline

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.370
lakes.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.570
No living organism has been found in the permafrost
here.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.840
Researchers believe it is as close to Mars
as we can get!!

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.430
However, more recently, water samples of Blood
Falls have revealed metabolic processes never

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.370
before witnessed and some bacteria has also
been discovered.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.790
It is believed that cold, dense air is pulled
downhill by the force of gravity.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.010
These katabatic winds are so strong, they
can reach speeds of up to 200 mph.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.480
When they descend , they heat up, evaporating
any moisture that may be present.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.260
Any life found here is quite the miracle and
these mysterious microbes and unique bacteria

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.460
might just defy all odds!

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.280
Who knows what else is out there in this harsh,
inhospitable environment?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280
7.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.570
Abandoned Military Hospital
Beelitz-Heilstätten is a district in Beelitz,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.690
Germany that is made famous by a hospital
complex that contains almost 60 buildings.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.639
At first, the complex was built to treat TB
and then became a sanatorium . But at the

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.630
beginning of the first war, it became a military
hospital.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.300
While some of the buildings have been restored,
most of them are in terrible condition, and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.569
are pretty spooky.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.960
In 1916, even Hitler was treated here as he
recovered from an injury in World War I.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.749
Most of the area is now shut down today, but
the neurological rehabilitation center and

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.020
an area researching Parkinson's disease remains
in operation.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.210
For those working there, rumor has it, it
is haunted.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.599
This may be the stories of the cruel treatment
of those housed there that triggers the hallucinations.

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.819
Or…it could really be haunted as most of
it is still abandoned.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.810
As the hospital lived through so many years
of turmoil, the place has seen many dark deeds.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.680
Now it is often used as a set for movies such
as the Pianist and some of Valkyrie.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.770
Also there is no shortage of videos of urban
explorers and drones going over the place

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.199
on YouTube!

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.229
6.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.419
Travertine Pools of Pamukkale
Pamukkale means "cotton castle" in Turkish

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.080
which makes sense, once you see the pools
in this place!

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.840
They are made up of hot springs and travertines
which are terraces of carbonate minerals left

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.330
by the flowing water.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.940
From the hills on the opposite side of the
valley, you will see the ancient Greco-Roman

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.570
city of Hierapolis, built so that the people
could enjoy the health benefits of the hot

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.570
water.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.500
For over 2000 years, people have been attracted
to these springs.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.779
Deep in the earth, the water is heated by
volcanic lava!

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.310
It dissolves pure white calcium and then spills
out of the surface of the earth where it seeps

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.779
down the hillside.

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:54.069
As the calcium cools, it creates these formations
making the hillside look kind of like a castle.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.219
While it looks like ice from a distance, it
is actually the white calcium.

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.400
Of course in a place like this that has been
around for so long, there must be a legend

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.009
to go along with it.

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.539
No one wanted to marry this Turkish girl because
everyone thought she was ugly, so she threw

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.289
herself off the travertine.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.689
However, she survived the fall and became
beautiful and of course, caught the attention

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:15.689
of a lord.

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.449
So now, everyone thinks that it is great for
your health, AND can make you more beautiful!

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.449
5.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.210
Richat Structure
The Richat Structure or the Eye of the Sahara

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.330
is a mysterious round formation found in the
Sahara near Mauritania.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.960
It appears to be some sort of sci-fi experiment,
but it is actually a deeply eroded, slightly

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.439
elliptical dome that is 25 miles wide.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:43.069
This erosion of resistant layers is said to
have created high-relief circular slopes,

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.930
giving it the illusion of an Eye from space.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.199
At first, scientist thought it was an asteroid
impact structure due to its shape.

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.839
However, the erosion theory is now the likely
answer.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.199
Even now they are still testing and studying
the strange formation, and many people still

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.289
have a lot of questions about it.

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.550
There are also extra-terrestrial studies still
being conducted in case some aliens had something

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.810
to do with it, you know, just to be safe!!

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.259
Unlike scientists though, most of us just
enjoy the beauty and wonder of the formation,

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.710
no questions asked…though that alien thing
seems pretty interesting.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.710
4.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.069
Shicheng, China
Shicheng City or China’s Atlantis or Lion

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:26.029
City, is an underwater city in the Chinese
province of Zhejiang.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.340
This city is strange for two reasons!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.580
It was forgotten and lost for thousands of
years…and it has survived remarkably well

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.020
underwater!

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.830
At one time, it was a maze of white temples,
large buildings, and beautiful sculptures.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.060
But in 1959, the Chinese government built
a new hydroelectric power station and they

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.869
flooded the ancient city.

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:51.229
Now, it is under the manmade lake and can
only be visited by divers.

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.949
For over fifty years, the lake was simply
known as Qiandao Lake.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:59.090
The government actually forgot about the city
and the fact that they had covered it up.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.229
Somehow, the city was discovered again accidentally.

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:06.409
How it took fifty years is unknown since it
is simply 130ft underwater!

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:11.689
But the place is beautiful and there are many
dramatic pictures out there of this lost city

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:12.800
underwater!

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.900
3.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.460
Fly Geyser
Likely the most beautiful geyser in the world,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.490
Fly Geyser can be found in Washoe County,
Nevada.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.259
It is just 5 feet high, by 12 feet wide.

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:25.639
So why is it is amazing or mysterious?

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:26.770
Well look at it!

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.350
It isn’t natural, but rather the result
of a test site after a geothermal power company

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.930
drilled into the rock.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.140
No one knows how what happened next to create
this unique formation, but it was likely one

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.269
of two reasons.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:41.899
The well was not capped correctly, or it was
left unplugged.

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:46.830
Soon after, minerals started rising and accumulating,
creating the travertine mound.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.769
This is where the geyser sits today, growing
slightly every year.

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:56.250
Now these deposits have become 3 large mounds
that rise out of a field on fly ranch.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.639
The geyser’s trio spew scalding hot water
and it is now famous for its amazing rainbow

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.639
coloring.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:03.639
2.

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:07.100
The Maunsell Sea Forts
From afar, these guys look kind of like oil

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.430
rigs or something, but they’re really just
old sea forts known as the Maunsell Forts.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.399
These were built during WWII to help defend
the UK.

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:21.779
Each fort has built-in firearms and were originally
used by both army and navy personnel, a rare

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:22.779
occurrence.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:26.480
Each of the forts were built as a cluster
of seven stilted buildings that surrounded

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.740
the central tower.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.290
At one time, catwalks connected each of them
to form one large base.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.839
In the 1950s, they were decommissioned and
got taken over by pirate radio broadcasting

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:42.540
stations and one is the unrecognized Principality
of Sealand!

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.540
A micronation!

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.620
Today, they are nearly completely abandoned
and decaying to the point of no return.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.270
Why they weren’t taken down, demolished,
or repurposed is unknown.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.290
1.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.440
Door to Hell
If the name isn’t enough to scare you, wait

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.380
till you hear the story behind the Gates of
Hell.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.120
Officially known as the Darvaza gas crater,
the “door” is actually a natural gas field

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.190
in Derweze, Turkmenistan.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.430
When seen up close, which you never ever really
want to be, you will see fire, boiling mud,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.380
and orange flames in the hole.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.540
The crater itself is over 200ft wide and over
60ft deep.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.029
It was first identified by Soviet engineers
in 1971.

00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:25.180
That’s when drilling begin and a natural
gas pocket was discovered.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.160
The drilling created fissures throughout the
ground that caused the ground around the pocket

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.320
to collapse and release the gas.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.060
With the release endangering nearby towns,
the engineers decided to light it on fire.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.470
They believed it would only take a couple
of weeks for the fire to stop burning.
