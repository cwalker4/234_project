00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.439
hello everybody welcome back to our

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
channel we're Eamon and Bec and for the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.890
last year and a half we've been living

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.930
in our own self converted Sprinter van

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.489
if you know us you might be thinking

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.200
that this is our van that that is not

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.629
the case this is actually my dad's van

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.270
and we spent about 30 days a few months

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
ago converting it from nothing so today

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.809
is the day you've all been waiting for

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
we're gonna give you a full tour of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.870
bob's van all right without further ado

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.300
let's introduce Bob hi I'm Bob and I'm

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
65 years old I now live in a van that's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.430
60 square feet and what inspired me was

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.619
my son and his fiancee they've been

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
doing it now for about a year and I've

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.119
seen their community and what life has

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.740
been like living in a van and it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.229
actually fantastic so now I've been

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
doing it for I think about three months

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.799
now before I give you a tour of my van

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.650
what I'd like to do is introduce you to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.590
my roommates this is Batty/ Batman and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.409
this is Lucy and finally we've got the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
granddaddy of them all Barkley and by

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.229
the way Barkley happens to be 18 years

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.210
old or 106 human years so now what we

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.759
would like to do is give you a little

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
tour of the van so Bob's van is a 2008

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.750
Sprinter van and we chose that because

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
that's the same year and van that we

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.079
have ourselves we're super comfortable

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.390
with layout we thought we'd build

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.770
something very similar for my dad so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.450
you'll notice even a lot of the design

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.240
aesthetics are really similar to what we

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.060
already have this is the captains area

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.130
here and this here is what I call the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.049
perch or the copilot's area we've got

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.170
two co-pilots on staff today

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.090
of course Batman and Lucy so I thought

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.590
that this had to be built up high enough

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.590
we can take it apart in two seconds if

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.660
there's a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.459
human passenger with us how I built this

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.099
is just it's just a platform we've got

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.709
two sides that fold down right so this

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.450
part comes apart there's a bolt here

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.640
that comes apart and then there's a wire

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.349
that I've got hooked here to the frame

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.390
that comes here so that holds it up here

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.069
that can't fall down and then I can just

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.700
take it apart put it behind the seat and

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.410
take this pole out and it's now the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.849
seats ready for a human passenger so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.910
it's important to keep a nice clean van

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.160
so I've got my I got a special on some

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.530
dishwashing detergent so I've got my

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.670
three pack container here and of course

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.480
it's always important to have a little

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.220
treat for the pups this is my kitchen I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.140
think it's five square feet thanks to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.090
Eamon and Bec and their experience

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.480
they have a small stove *fridge in their

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.730
van and they suggested to get a much

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.030
bigger one hundred and ten liter I believe

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.890
and a big thanks to the Dometic for

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.519
hooking that up because I love it it's

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.379
just fantastic is it two burner stove

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.299
right here works great I'd have to turn

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.930
on the fuel but it's not on right now I

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.400
felt that the counterspace being used to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.170
living in the house the counterspace was

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.180
a little tight and at my 10 square feet

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.310
kitchen so I thought we would build this

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.380
little thing which is a cutting board

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.480
and I could use that if I wasn't cooking

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.670
anything I can use that to add to the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.889
counter space so and that seems to work

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.480
out very well and I can cut things up

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.370
here and make sandwiches or whatever

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.380
propane tank is housed underneath here

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.690
this just slides over it covers off the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.040
fridge rather than have something come

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.500
out like that I thought that would be

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.750
more convenient I've got a grey water

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.329
container here a normal barbecue propane

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.970
tank and then we happen to have just a

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.459
grey water and going directly through

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.440
the van and onto the ground if it's just

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.510
like dishes or something like that water

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.430
system is that I think a 12-volt pump

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.049
and has to switch you on here safety

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.400
switch to turn it on and off you know I

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.720
don't think you want to leave your pump

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.579
on all the time in case there's a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.840
problem with the water it's used to work

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.329
well and then you've got a filtration

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.829
system here for pure water so the water

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.079
filter he's talking about is the same

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.880
one that we have it's a two-stage water

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.739
purification so it's a carbon and

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.570
sediment filter because you can fill up

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.000
from any hose it just adds a little bit

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.719
of extra purification and safe to drink

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.120
out of

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:27.849
when you live in this environment you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.300
really are grateful for you know for

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.650
what you have because you realize how

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.330
much waste you go through when you're

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.680
not living in this kind of because

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.389
you're bringing all the water and the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.029
first time I was here I sort of filled

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.279
up the sink and realized that I just got

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.930
rid of like a hundred pound jug of water

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:46.240
that I had to go and get and bring back

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.620
into the van so after that you put a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.029
little bit of water in a bowl and you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.469
put a little soap in there and you end

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.639
up doing the dishes and it's a little

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.669
weird in the beginning but eventually

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.009
it's becomes normal got this magnetic

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.229
knife holder which is why find fantastic

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.509
you know exactly where your scissors are

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.340
all the time or your fancy knives and

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.779
then this is our cupboard worth of food

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.110
we got lots of room here how about that

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.729
light oh yeah the light Rodeo Drive man

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.759
yeah we got a we're gonna put a

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.680
shout-out to Eric for that Eric is is a

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.300
friend of ours that helped us out

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.129
putting in the electrical stuff in

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.800
cupboard lighting as soon as you open

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.469
the door there's a little switch right

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.159
here and it turns it on automatically

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:34.210
which is super handy Thank You energy do

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:36.550
you have that no I've just got my my

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:42.279
pantry here got some oatmeal some rice

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:45.219
some nuts and spices and then some

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.649
cereal stuff I've got you know a one pot

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.419
and one ball and one cup that makes it

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:52.000
easy for storage I think I have more

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.129
more tea towels than I have posting cups

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.439
oh and also I didn't tell you about my

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.159
fan here it's a maxi fan with a remote

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.779
control

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.939
now this thing what if you're not

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.669
careful it could zoom you up Scotty okay

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.680
be like suck it I'll just give it to

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.360
where you just turn it on and then it

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.189
goes in reverse to so it could suck the

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.169
air out of the cabin and a hot day you

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.149
would do that on a cold day if you

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.740
wanted it if you wanted some air come in

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.980
think Avenue and turn like turn it

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.680
around and have the air

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.900
I'm not really a carpenter but I you

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.850
know I'm willing to try something so it

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.310
took me a while but we finally got this

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.080
drawer and it's a cutlery drawer and it

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.180
works extremely well it works for a

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.430
bachelor I've got one plate actually I

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.380
got two plates here and I think a fork

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.780
in a knife so that works very well how

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.580
it locks into place so it doesn't roll

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.560
when you turns I've got a like a

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.810
male/female kind of adapter underneath

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.340
here so the male fits into the female

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.140
and it said it locks into place

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.750
six LED lights and that's more than

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.430
enough to light up this cabin and it

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.590
hardly takes any energy on a dimmer

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.130
switch and you turn it on you turn it

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.980
off and you can get like a romantic mood

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.210
at night and stuff if you're inclined

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.380
and the last overhead compartment is

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.760
clothing right now and you can see that

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.980
I probably need to get that a little

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.080
more organized but in time I'll have

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.370
that specifically span something that I

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.960
picked up or anything is pretty cool

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.600
it's a paper towel thing that doesn't

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.940
unravel the towels it's on some kind of

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.100
suspension here clips and then you can

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.420
just take one sheet at a time and I

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.040
think it looks neat it's out of the way

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.330
and you've got lots of paper towels

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.670
so now we'll jump into a little bit more

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.380
information about the electrical so for

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.240
this van layout we actually partnered

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.340
with go power they're a Canadian company

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.200
based out of BC but have international

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.720
shipping to a number of different

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.040
countries and the reason why we are so

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.960
excited about this partnership is

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.760
because of their customer service so I'm

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.740
not a professional when it comes to

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.910
electrical by any means but having a

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.020
company that you can actually pick up

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.270
the phone and call and ask them

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.310
questions was incredibly useful so to

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.990
run you through what we've done all of

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.240
the electrical is actually house right

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.980
in here and this is where the design

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.080
starts to change a little bit compared

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.060
to our van we made this box a little bit

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.240
bigger and a little bit taller we fit

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:05.270
our 250 amp hours worth of batteries

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.690
we've got a 2000 watt pure sine wave

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.700
inverter and charger and display so I

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.110
don't think we're going to be needing to

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.290
access this because I think it's very

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.300
reliable but if we do we can just take

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.580
out these six screws here and this whole

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.560
panel slides out and we can access the

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.420
front of it if you have to just look put

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.340
your arm in and make a and do something

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.150
minor you can come in from the top and

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.409
that's why we built this

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.879
we almost forgot to tell you about the

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:32.130
heater because it is still so hot

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:34.919
beautiful here in Canada but we did

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.690
install a s bar d2 heater and just like

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.639
our van we mounted the heater underneath

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.349
the passenger seat so it just blows the

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:42.810
hot air directly into the back of the

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:44.130
cab we briefly touched on the electrical

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.600
cabinet here where we're going to open

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.360
it from the top there's two other

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.910
sections one being the laundry which you

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.889
can see the laundry is here and it's not

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.800
cleaned and it's not folded next one

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:57.750
being the dog compartment which we must

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.850
have all the doggie stuff and that

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.519
consists of the dog bowls and their food

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.170
and toys and a lot of kind of stuff so

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:06.630
there's a couple other areas in the van

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.060
I haven't showed you one is really

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.920
really important to me and enter my

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.860
roommates and that's that we call that

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.329
the Batcave and it's underneath the bed

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.250
there it seems to work out very well at

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:18.209
night everybody sort of scuttles under

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.310
there and goes to sleep

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:22.019
alright guys so now we're in the bedroom

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.790
there's one other section that we're

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:26.639
missing from the mattress so we actually

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:29.820
bought a full double size mattress and

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:31.380
we cut it in half so that extra piece is

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.300
just at the seamstress we're getting

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.160
them to put like a nice cushion on the

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.870
back so once that in that's in place

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.670
you'll be able to sit back here a little

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.490
bit nicer more like a couch more like a

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.829
couch and then we also designed this van

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.500
to be able to sleep two people in case

00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:48.480
you do get a boyfriend or girlfriend

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:51.329
whatever you decide never no we actually

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.819
did allow for the pulled out slot design

00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:57.089
very similar to what we did so he's got

00:09:53.819 --> 00:09:58.709
this just on logs and then we broke it

00:09:57.089 --> 00:10:00.810
into two sections so it's much easier to

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:02.550
do as a single bachelor and the couch

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.930
back support will come over here in the

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.170
daytime and that's exactly or in the

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:10.470
night time that's 17 inches so it's a

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:13.079
full to finish this side of the bed we

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.060
put a track below and a track above put

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:17.010
these inexpensive panels on that are

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.810
slidable that just you can close them up

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.250
or open them up however you want you can

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.240
even take them all the way out so you

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.790
can access whatever you want

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.380
a bit I just got my water and that's

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.149
that's where my water we ran a line

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.430
because of my back I don't have a grade

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:32.440
back we thought Amon and BEC have their

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.330
water underneath the sink and it's a

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.940
little more difficult to bend over and

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.130
unhook it and put it back in so because

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.680
of my back Amon had an idea to run the

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.260
line back here and I can just take the

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.890
tanks out from the ground position that

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.600
was brilliant

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.250
and that works fantastic and I agree

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.490
that was brilliant one other thing that

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:53.740
we did just like on our belt guys is we

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.060
did these on quick disconnects so a lot

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.310
of people ask us where you can get these

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.440
we bought these at Home Depot but we'll

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.209
also put a link in the description below

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.399
they're actually just gardening hoes

00:11:01.209 --> 00:11:05.800
quick disconnects I found a nice little

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:07.149
place to have tools I think that when

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.649
you have a fan you need your tool bag

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:10.330
and there's always little things you

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:11.709
need to fix there's things you need to

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.810
tighten up and all that kind of stuff so

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:15.520
my tool bag that Siri got this from the

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.260
side of the road which is a great place

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.080
to pick up some stuff if you want to

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.910
save some money and it'll be a little

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.500
creative so just I'll hook that up on

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.029
the side similar to Amanat backs I'm

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:28.089
started copying everything that they do

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:29.890
why not they're good and that just comes

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:33.520
down like that and then I have a little

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:35.880
thing that will hold it up here so it'll

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.820
be level and then I can sit here and

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.829
type or eat breakfast or just use the

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.170
table as I wish so I think my dad's

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:46.839
biggest concern before he moved in the

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.180
van was AC he's a big AC guy he likes it

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:51.850
nice and cool so how was the summer

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.410
summer was great and I think the main

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.480
reason mid summer was great because we

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.940
have two ways to get the air in and out

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.800
of the van without AC so that's a big

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.420
thing that I think we might actually try

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.399
and figure out another solution is

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.020
another air intake two vents right in

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:07.450
the roof so this one is just a manual

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.579
roof vent with screen there's no fan on

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:12.550
that but that really helps create a nice

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:14.230
draft in this space now this was a

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.440
little bit more tricky to configure

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.390
because we wanted the two vents we had

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.550
to configure the solar around there so

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:27.070
on the roof we've got 100 watt flexible

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.779
go power solar panels and those are

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.670
amazing because we just literally tape

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:31.810
them down around this fan

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.130
figured out there's three of them

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.200
there's three of them and it was super

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.540
easy to connect we just got the extra

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.840
connectors yeah and it was just female

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.930
male area here is our control panel area

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.470
and it consists of the Espar heater

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:50.290
remote control dimmer switch for the LED

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:54.150
lights up top it also houses the fully

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:56.950
functional informational gold power

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:59.140
station that tells me that the batteries

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:02.260
are 90 percent charged apparently that's

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.360
as high as you can get batteries charged

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.900
as ninety percent and it tells me how

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:10.840
much voltage is is being used at any

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.310
time and where the low-voltage is and it

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.090
gives you everything you really need to

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.330
know it's really so easy and I also have

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:23.920
a place to charge my cell phone I guess

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:30.250
a USB port my laptop and a DC power

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:33.430
outlet here and AC double AC outlet so

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.110
on this end here is these is the control

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.930
for the inverter which is that big box

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:42.220
here and what that does is that changes

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:45.520
from terms of electricity into AC and it

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.710
also charges the batteries with shore

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.540
power so once I plug in shore power this

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.100
little box here is charging the

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.130
batteries then if I want to plug in my

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.410
toaster it turns the DC power into AC

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.940
power allows me to do my toaster and I

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.800
also happen to have and this is how you

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.090
control it here it's real simple it

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.620
automatically turns on when you put on

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.840
shore power but you can control it here

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.750
with the on and off switch and I also

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.090
have a beautiful recycling box

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.310
well thank you everyone for touring

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:15.010
around my van I hope you enjoyed the

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.350
tour so guys we completed this van in

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.330
just over 30 days we have a full build

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.850
series if you're interested in learning

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.320
how we actually built the van and we

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.540
have lots more information on our

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.080
channel about fan life and that kind of

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.330
content

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.210
we're also linking below all of the

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.890
items that we purchased for Bob's build

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.990
so if you guys have any specifics that

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.790
you're interested in checking out it'll
