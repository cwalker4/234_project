00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.433
&gt;&gt; OKAY...

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.266
LET'S GO....

00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.533
&gt;&gt; IT'S ROUNDUP TIME AT KERR

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.734
WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA...

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:06.934
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SHHHH.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:07.967
&gt;&gt; ...NOT FOR CATTLE,

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:09.600
BUT FOR TRAPPED FERAL PIGS.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
&gt;&gt; LET 'EM FIND THE HOLE.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.533
&gt;&gt; HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT,

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.567
JUST HOLD BACK.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.633
(pig grunts)

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:14.467
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE WILDLIFE

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:16.500
BIOLOGISTS AND TECHNICIANS,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.633
THIS IS NEW FOR US.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.000
WE'RE LEARNING A LOT FROM THESE

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800
PIGS ON HOW TO HANDLE THEM...

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.900
...AND WE'RE ALWAYS UPGRADING

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.734
OUR FACILITIES.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.767
&gt;&gt; WHILE THESE ANIMALS HAVE

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:27.934
DESCENDED FROM DOMESTIC

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:29.867
LIVESTOCK, TODAY THEY ARE

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:31.500
COMPLETELY WILD, WHICH CAN

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.533
MAKE THEM A LITTLE DANGEROUS.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.333
(crash)

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.600
&gt;&gt; THEY ALMOST ALWAYS TRY TO

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.567
GET AWAY FROM US, HOWEVER,

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.133
THEY CERTAINLY CAN HURT YOU

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.700
IF THEY DID CHARGE YOU.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.100
WE CAN BOTH GO IN IF YOU WANT.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.233
&gt;&gt; YEAH, LET'S GO IN.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:45.767
&gt;&gt; CORRALLING WILD PIGS IS A

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.900
RISKY AND INEXACT SCIENCE...

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.266
&gt;&gt; NOTICE HOW CLOSE WE STAY TO

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.233
THESE FENCE POLES.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:52.400
&gt;&gt; ...BUT THE SCIENCE OF FERAL

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.033
PIG CONTROL IS WHAT BRINGS

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.834
JUSTIN FOSTER AND CREW HERE.

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:58.166
&gt;&gt; THE RESEARCH THAT WE ARE

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.433
CONDUCTING HERE IS AN

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.433
INVESTIGATION OF SOME PIG

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.633
TOXICANTS FOR WILD PIGS,

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:04.867
FERAL HOGS.

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.667
&gt;&gt; A TOXIC BAIT, SUCCESSFULLY

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.433
TESTED, COULD HELP KEEP FERAL

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:10.567
PIG POPULATIONS IN CHECK...

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.367
&gt;&gt; HEPPA! HEPPA!

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:13.333
BETTER FIND A TREE!

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.667
(laughs)

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:15.900
IT WOULD CERTAINLY APPEAR THERE

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.433
IS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH GOING ON.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:19.700
&gt;&gt; ...THE FACT THAT A HUMANE PIG

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.166
PESTICIDE IS EVEN BEING EXPLORED

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.734
IS A MEASURE OF THE PROBLEMS

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.333
THESE ANIMALS POSE,

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.900
ECONOMICALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.667
&gt;&gt; HERE THEY GO,

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.467
GOING INTO THE GATE.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:32.633
&gt;&gt; CLOSE IT!

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:33.433
(pig charges into fence)

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.400
&gt;&gt; WHEW!

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.667
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.166
&gt;&gt; FERAL HOGS HAVE PROVEN

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.467
TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.100
THROUGHOUT TEXAS.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.266
YEARS AGO, FERAL HOGS WERE

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.500
MAINLY IN SOUTH TEXAS, ALONG

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.066
THE COAST AND IN EAST TEXAS,

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.233
BUT THEY'RE BASICALLY ALL

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.867
ACROSS THE STATE NOW.

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:51.600
(pig grunts)

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.433
&gt;&gt; TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.367
AGRICULTURE ESTIMATES THAT PIGS

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.233
PRODUCE $52 MILLION A YEAR IN

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:59.533
AGRICULTURAL DAMAGE ALONE.

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.934
THOSE ESTIMATES GO WAY HIGHER

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.066
THAN THAT WHENEVER WE START

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.967
TALKING ABOUT ALL THE DAMAGE

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:06.767
THAT IS INCURRED ANNUALLY.

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.433
THE IMPACT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:10.400
&gt;&gt; AFTER A GOOD RAIN WHEN IT'S

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.600
NICE AND SOFT, THEY'LL COME

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.333
OUT HERE AND ROOT IT ALL UP.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.166
THESE ARE PRETTY MINOR.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.066
&gt;&gt; HOG HUNTERS,

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.367
LIKE PHILLIP KOGER,

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:18.934
HAVE SEEN IT ALL.

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:20.133
&gt;&gt; ONCE THEY DO THIS,

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:21.400
IT TURNS THE ROOTS UP

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.867
AND IT DOESN'T GROW BACK.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.200
&gt;&gt; HELPING PREVENT DAMAGE TO

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.900
PASTURES, CROPS, AND FENCES

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.033
IS PART OF THE APPEAL

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.266
FOR PHILLIP...

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:29.500
&gt;&gt; CAN SEE WHERE THEY'VE TORN

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.800
THIS FENCE UP, COMING THROUGH.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.700
TEAR UP YOUR FENCE, THEN YOUR

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.667
COWS GET OUT, THEN YOU'VE

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:37.300
GOT ANOTHER SITUATION.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.934
&gt;&gt; ...BUT PURSUING PIGS ISN'T

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:40.800
JUST DAMAGE CONTROL.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.266
&gt;&gt; STOP 'EM ALONG HERE.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.100
&gt;&gt; THE THING THAT'S NICE

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.133
ABOUT HUNTING HOGS IS THAT

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.100
YOU CAN DO IT YEAR-ROUND.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.633
THEY'RE GOOD ON THE TABLE,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.867
THERE'S NO BAG LIMIT,

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:50.100
SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GET ONE

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.834
AND YOU'RE DONE FOR THE YEAR.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.934
THEY'RE A WORTHY ADVERSARY.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.400
&gt;&gt; ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.367
THE ADVERSARY REMAINS HIDDEN,

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:58.567
WHILE PLENTY OF DEER

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.633
TAKE THE BAIT.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:02.033
&gt;&gt; WRONG SPECIES.

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:03.200
&gt;&gt; BUT BY EVENING,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.967
IN THE PASTURE NEARBY,

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:06.500
PHILLIP SEES A HOG.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.834
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOT.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.834
(rifle shot)

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:14.834
THAT'S A DEAD HOG.

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:16.734
(music)

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:17.633
&gt;&gt; PHILLIP ESTIMATES HE HAS

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:19.367
TAKEN TWO TO THREE DOZEN FERAL

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.133
HOGS FROM THIS PROPERTY,

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.600
ONE TIPPING THE SCALES

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.333
AT 265 POUNDS.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.700
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A BIG HOG.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.467
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY NATURAL

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.467
PREDATORS, OTHER THAN ME.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.033
&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS FARMERS

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.300
AND RANCHERS NEED ALL THE

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.834
HELP THEY CAN GET.

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:37.533
&gt;&gt; THEY JUST WANT THEM GONE.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:38.734
I'VE GOT ABOUT THREE OR FOUR

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:40.433
OTHER PROPERTIES I HUNT ON WITH

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:41.400
DIFFERENT OWNERS AND THEY ALL

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.166
FEEL ABOUT THE SAME WAY.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:44.533
A FEMALE CAN HAVE THREE LITTERS

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:46.467
A YEAR, AND IF HALF OF THOSE ARE

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:49.533
FEMALES, IT GETS EXPONENTIAL.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:50.700
THEY CAN DO SOME SERIOUS

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.100
DAMAGE OVERNIGHT.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.934
(camera clicks)

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.166
&gt;&gt; EVEN DEDICATED HUNTERS

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:58.700
DON'T BELIEVE THEY ALONE CAN

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.600
OVERCOME THE AMAZING ABILITY

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.700
OF HOGS TO REPRODUCE.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.567
(hog grunt)

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:05.767
&gt;&gt; THEY SAY THERE'S TWO KIND OF

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:07.567
COUNTIES IN TEXAS, THOSE WITH A

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:08.900
HOG PROBLEM AND THOSE THAT ARE

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.600
ABOUT TO HAVE A HOG PROBLEM.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.233
AND UH, CENTRAL TEXAS

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:15.266
HAS A HOG PROBLEM.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.633
IT DOESN'T HURT, BUT WE'RE

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:17.967
NOT GOING TO ERADICATE THEM,

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.033
HUNTING THEM.

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:20.200
NOT WITH TRAPPING

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.667
OR TRADITIONAL HUNTING.

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:23.934
&gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH TRAPPING CAN BE

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:26.734
SUCCESSFUL ON A LOCAL LEVEL,

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:28.567
UH IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.567
VERY WIDE IMPACTS.

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:31.700
(pig grunt)

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.734
&gt;&gt; AND THAT IS WHY THE

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:34.033
RESEARCH BEING DONE AT THE

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:35.367
KERR MANAGEMENT AREA COULD

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.633
BE SO IMPORTANT.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:37.900
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO, PIGS.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.133
(clapping)

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:40.867
NATIONWIDE AND INTERNATIONALLY

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:41.667
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.867
WORKING ON THIS TOPIC.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.967
AND WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC.

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:48.200
&gt;&gt; READY FOR PIG NUMBER TWO?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.333
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:50.166
&gt;&gt; WHEN WE PUT THEM

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:51.000
IN THAT PEN...

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.100
&gt;&gt; SEND THAT ONE TO PEN 21.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.033
&gt;&gt; ...WE TRY TO WORK THEM AS

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.133
EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN TO

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:59.100
REDUCE STRESS ON THE ANIMALS.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.266
(pig grunt)

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:04.066
OUR TECHNICIANS HAVE COME UP

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:06.233
WITH A WAY TO WORK THESE HOGS

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:07.633
INDIVIDUALLY.

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:09.600
&gt;&gt; THE ANIMALS ARE SEPARATED

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.500
INTO DIFFERENT RESEARCH GROUPS.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.633
&gt;&gt; HE STAYS HERE.

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:13.834
&gt;&gt; TO IDENTIFY THEM,

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:14.934
SOME ARE ALSO MARKED

00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.800
WITH A NON-TOXIC PAINT.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.734
&gt;&gt; GIVE ME AN X ON THAT

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:18.834
FRONT ONE.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:20.000
IT CAN BE QUITE A RODEO

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.867
AT TIMES.

00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:23.233
(pig snaps)

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:24.100
&gt;&gt; OOOOH.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.266
&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT A "Y"?

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:26.367
&gt;&gt; WE'RE MARKING THESE HOGS

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.233
SO THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHICH

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:29.567
HOGS ARE AT WHICH FEEDER

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:30.734
AND FOR HOW LONG.

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:31.367
(pig snaps)

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:32.800
&gt;&gt; TO DANIEL'S CREDIT IT IS KIND

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
OF HARD TO PAINT 'EM WHEN

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.734
THEY'RE FIXING TO SNAP

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:37.400
YOUR ARM IN TWO.

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.233
(clapping)

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:41.900
(squeal)

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.734
&gt;&gt; WHETHER IT BE A PLACEBO BAIT

00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:45.900
OR AN ACTUAL TOXIC BAIT,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.367
THE IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.700
INDIVIDUAL PIGS HELPS US TO

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.533
EXPLAIN THE EFFECT OF OUR

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:53.033
TREATMENTS.

00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:58.500
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW WE'RE ENTERING INTO

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.233
SOME TASTE TRIALS, BASICALLY

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:02.166
TO SEE IF THIS IS

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.200
SOMETHING THAT THOSE HOGS

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.567
WILL READILY EAT.

00:06:05.567 --> 00:06:09.133
(opening and pouring feed)

00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:11.033
WE HAVE REMOTE CAMERAS SET UP,

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:12.233
SO AS THEY COME INTO THOSE

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:13.734
FEEDING AREAS, THOSE CAMERAS

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:15.633
BEGIN TO TAKE PICTURES.

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:16.667
&gt;&gt; IT ALLOWS US TO GET SOME

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.100
SLEEP AT NIGHT, BUT IT ALSO

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.166
ALLOWS US TO SAMPLE THOSE PIGS

00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:23.633
IN MORE OF A NATURAL SETTING.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.233
THERE SHOULD BE A STRONG

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:27.066
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE AMOUNT

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:29.133
OF TIME SPEND CONSUMING THE

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:33.066
BAIT AND A LETHAL EFFECT.

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:34.567
&gt;&gt; IN MANY WAYS, THE ACTIVE

00:06:34.567 --> 00:06:36.200
INGREDIENT BEING TESTED

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.100
APPEARS IDEAL.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.300
&gt;&gt; INTOXICATION BY SODIUM

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.867
NITRITE WOULD BE CONSIDERED

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.300
CLINICALLY HUMANE.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.300
THERE'S NOT LOTS OF

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.066
VOCALIZATION, IT'S VERY RAPID,

00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:49.734
SUB-LETHAL DOSES DON'T REALLY

00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:51.500
APPEAR TO HAVE ANY LONG-TERM

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.767
EFFECTS.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:53.834
&gt;&gt; THE INGREDIENT IS ALSO

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:55.633
INEXPENSIVE, AND HARMLESS

00:06:55.633 --> 00:06:57.200
ENOUGH TO HUMANS TO BE USED

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.333
AS A FOOD PRESERVATIVE.

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.867
BUT AT HIGH DOSES, IT BLOCKS

00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:02.333
THE UPTAKE OF OXYGEN IN THE

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:04.700
BLOODSTREAM TO LETHAL EFFECT.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.300
SO FINDING A WAY TO DELIVER

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.800
IT ONLY TO PIGS IS ALSO

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.200
PART OF THE STUDY.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.433
&gt;&gt; TARGET-SPECIFIC DELIVERY IS

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:14.000
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
WHENEVER WE'RE DELIVERING

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.834
A TOXIC BAIT.

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:18.767
THE HOG HOPPER KEYS ON THE

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:20.667
NATURAL ROOTING BEHAVIOR OF THE

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.600
FERAL PIG BY USING A VERTICAL

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.900
SLIDING DOOR.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.367
AT THE SAME TIME THE WEIGHT OF

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.667
THE DOOR LIMIT OTHER NON-TARGET

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:32.266
SPECIES FROM ACCESS.

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:33.767
THIS PROJECT HAS LOTS OF

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:35.834
COLLABORATORS, THE TEXAS

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:37.600
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.700
THE USDA, OUR COUNTERPARTS

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.266
IN AUSTRALIA.

00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:42.867
&gt;&gt; THE RESEARCH CONTINUES, WITH

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:44.667
THE HOPE THAT, IN YEARS TO COME,

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:45.967
IT WILL PROVIDE A NEW MEANS

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.266
OF CONTROLLING FERAL PIGS;

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:49.333
MORE EFFICIENTLY

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:51.066
AND AFFORDABLY THAN EVER.

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:52.533
&gt;&gt; TRAPPING FERAL PIGS

00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:55.767
CONSUMES A LOT OF TIME.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.400
FLYING A HELICOPTER IS VERY

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.967
EXPENSIVE.

00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.367
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL,

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:02.533
FOR PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:04.467
AND RESOURCE MANAGERS TO HAVE

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:05.867
ACCESS TO ANOTHER TOOL

00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:07.600
IN THE TOOLBOX.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.700
&gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF RESEARCH

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.467
OUTCOMES, HUNTERS AREN'T LIKELY

00:08:10.467 --> 00:08:12.166
TO RUN OUT OF LANDOWNERS LOOKING

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.667
FOR HELP CONTROLLING WILD HOGS.

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:15.900
&gt;&gt; THE WILD PIG IS CERTAINLY

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.333
HERE TO STAY.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.433
&gt;&gt; SO FOLKS LIKE PHILLIP

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:20.400
CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY CAN,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.033
ONE HUNT AND ONE BARBEQUE

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.567
AT A TIME.

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:25.333
&gt;&gt; IT'S A LOT MORE FUN THAN

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:28.100
GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.567
YOU ALWAYS HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS.

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:30.467
NOT SO MUCH WHEN IT COMES

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:31.367
TIME TO CLEAN THEM,

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:32.367
BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:34.066
TO PULL THEM OFF THE SMOKER.

00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.000
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.967
WHO'LL SHOW UP THEN.
