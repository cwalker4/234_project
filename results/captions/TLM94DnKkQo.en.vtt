00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:11.005
well, if you are you might be dating a narcissist

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.225
I am here to tell you how to spot a signs of a narcissism

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:15.185
is a Dr. Ramani.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:16.955
Dr. Ramani thanks for being here to talk with us

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:19.695
about dating a narcissist

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.145
My pleasure, thank you my favorite kind of topic. Why is this

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:25.755
your favorite kind of topic? You know what is it

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.795
It's a curiosity to me. I started working with a lot of

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.605
clients who were i hate the word

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.555
,,victimize" but who really hurts by this relationship

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.000
and I saw a pattern and I though

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.015
wow we got to help this people but in a systematic way

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:43.025
so not only did i really get to helping them

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.605
but it all culminated in a book

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.395
that was meant  to help everyone who is struggling with this issues

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:50.905
but it was remarkable to me to look in a narcissistic

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.155
relationship and essence

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.125
it's like looking into the mirror and nothing is looking back at you.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:58.405
U, good metaphor.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.285
Am ,,Should I stay or should I go'' is your book

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:03.635
about narcissism. What is,

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:07.045
or what define someone to be a narcissist?

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:11.665
A narcissist is, lets talk about in terms of sort of the key or kinds of pillow

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.725
it's a person who lacks empathy

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:16.285
who is really entitled, meaning that they expect

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:19.575
special treatment to be giving to them but nobody else

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:22.695
They are very grandiose they harbor a huge of fantasy

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:25.805
they only want to affiliate with people they think as

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:28.085
cool or as interesting as they are. They are

00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:31.085
very superficial. They are very concern about their appearance

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.875
and the appearance of the people around them. I've always thinks of them as

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:36.875
beautiful facade with not a lot behind them.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.820
They don't regulate their emotions very well

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.960
They are very prone to thrown a tantrums, getting angry very quickly, specialy if they dont get their way

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.620
and they can be really hipper sensitive to criticism

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.000
So those are some of the key elements we see

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.885
in a person who is narcissistic. And just because someone has

00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.755
one or even maybe a two of those does it make them

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.895
a narcissists. In fact in my book I have 30 characteristics

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:05.965
so we can go all the way.

00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:08.185
So then how many would I have to

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.445
have to be a narcissist.  I would say that six I

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:14.165
gave you I expect to see all the six really to

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:16.885
call someone a narcissistic and the longer list for example

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:19.855
they tend to be jealous, they engage in something

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:22.745
called ,,Gaslighting'' where they literary doubt your own reality

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.735
leaving you feeling  like you are gone crazy

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:28.455
they don't tend to be very loyal, they do tend of

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.445
throw temper tantrums, they get pleasure out of misery

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:33.925
in other people. They are kind of mean - Lets

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:34.555
explain Gaslighting

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.985
a little more. What is that look like?

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:39.995
Gaslighting looks like literary like I said when

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.995
somebody kinds of denies your reality, so

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.915
you might say something like

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.135
I feel really sad that you really say that to me,  and they said something like

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.325
you have not rights to say that

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:54.255
you have no rights to feel  that way or

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:57.275
they say something you are having an argument with them

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:59.155
and they will had said something terrible to you

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:02.115
couple of days before and you say, Listen when you said that,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.565
they will say I've never said that

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:06.855
and so it's literary like they denies your reality

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:09.895
and when somebody says I never said that

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:13.105
most normal people tend to question of themselves - Mmm..

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:16.235
And so, in fact I've always say one of the ringers

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.540
that you're in a relationship with the narcissist who is

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.620
gaslighting you is you started to feeling the need

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.260
to voice record your conversation with them

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.200
so you can play it back to them,I always say when you feel like you need

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.100
a voice memo in your relationship it maybe time to get out

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.100
-Ok.

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:33.375
I have been

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.785
in a relationship where I thought

00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:40.120
I am gonna record our next conversation because You are just

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.360
not believing that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.060
what has been said has been said. Gaslighting. Wow. But that not necessarily

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.565
mean that that person was a narcissist. No that

00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.860
can be a lot of parts. But yeah but it could be a key indicator

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.740
Yeah this is hard for a lot of people I feel like because we do

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.755
in our society throw around that term all the time You know

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.780
You get mad at somebody and say..well they're being narcisist

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.900
well, they want to have dinner at eight, they are narcisista, no they just want to have dinner at eight,you know...-right.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.415
so this type of factors

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.920
really help people

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.600
narrow it in when they're narcisists

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.100
i'm really curios

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:17.585
on... when two narcisists date each other

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.560
in your practice, you're a clinical psichologist

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.720
you talk always people what is that relationship look like?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.080
it's basically a psichological cage fight

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.700
i mean obvously..- ahahahahahha

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.900
i souldn't have been laughing, because it affects lot of people

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.795
i know it's fascinating because what ends up happening is

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.580
nobody's empathic,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.640
nobody's listening,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.520
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.640
and they're not playing with each other

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.840
 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.840
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.700
they're kind of playing by themselves

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.940
everything actually goes well for a while

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.080
because they really care that the other one looks good

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.360
so they can deliver on that- they only care that the other one

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.520
looks good ..because it makes them look good

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.420
this... this is like the guy "i need a hot girlfriend"

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.540
you know .. it's that kind of a modelo

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:11.985
of ...like.. i need to look good, my partner makes me look good

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:15.145
so, it's a sort of .. almost

00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:18.335
is larger than life kind of... almost toopretty couples

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:21.555
that you sometimes...make you wonder  what is a .... looking so good?

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:24.715
don't... don't we want a partner who makes us look good?

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:27.765
no. we want a partner who makes us feel good. -mmm

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:30.895
there's a difference. - there's a big difference

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:33.775
so i think that what ends up happening is that when

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:36.795
the first time one person  made up two narcisists togheter

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.915
frustrates the other then

00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:42.945
it  all breaks lose

00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:45.995
so it gets to be .. when the fireworks go

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.015
they go.. big.in this kind of relationships

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.340
i always say let the narcisists al cobreed

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.295
then we kind of ... get them out of normal dating supplies

00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:58.375
just don't reproduce

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:01.255
ok so... you have this two narcisists

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:02.340
that are dating toghether.-right. -

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.275
have you ever seen a couple

00:06:04.515 --> 00:06:07.915
each of them were a narcisist and they both admit it

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:11.395
that they were both a narcisist.-absolutely

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:14.425
did those relationships succeed?- no.

00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:17.485
no i'll tell you what happens is that there's...

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:20.235
a point wich, i will tell you, there's a number of people i work with who have admitted

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:23.525
straight up "i'm a narcisist"i know it

00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.815
and now i can see how is affecting ...usually it would be kids...

00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:29.855
or family relationships or their

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:32.555
intimate relationships

00:06:32.555 --> 00:06:35.595
and they wanna do the work but they don't recognize

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:41.425
having almost childlike

00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:44.415
 

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:47.455
 

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:50.085
 

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:53.035
 

00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:55.135
 

00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:58.595
 

00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:01.105
 

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:03.845
 

00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:06.435
 

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:09.315
 

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:12.345
 

00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:15.775
 

00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:18.775
 

00:07:18.775 --> 00:07:21.735
 

00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:24.285
 

00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:27.325
 

00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:30.265
 

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:33.165
 

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:36.205
 

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:39.115
 

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:42.525
 

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.555
 

00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:48.585
 

00:07:48.585 --> 00:07:51.745
 

00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:54.835
 

00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:57.705
 

00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:00.915

00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:09.935
 

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:13.615
 

00:08:13.615 --> 00:08:16.745

00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:35.105
 

00:08:35.105 --> 00:08:37.525
 

00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:40.635
 

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:43.375
 

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:46.175
 

00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:49.255
 

00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:51.805
