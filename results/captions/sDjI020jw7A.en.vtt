00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.420
In America, for less than $200, you can go
get any business registered at the City Hall

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.320
and call yourself a CEO.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.860
You can even get a business card and call
yourself a CEO and give your business card

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.430
away and say, "Man, I'm a CEO."

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.779
But you know when you're a real CEO?

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.910
When hundreds of other people call you a CEO.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.450
Because you've earned the right for other
people to see you as a CEO.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.880
So today, today, before you become a CEO,
one must act, behave, walk, talk, think like

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.800
a CEO before you become a CEO.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.090
Way before I became a CEO, I worked on thinking
like a CEO, walking like a CEO, asking myself

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.190
how I'd make a decision like a CEO, and then
I became a CEO.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.750
And then once I was called a CEO years later,
other people started seeing me as a CEO.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.050
Then the rest was history.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.390
So, today, qualities of a great CEO.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.690
And I'm telling this from a lot of my personal
mistakes on what can help you out for one

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.280
day being a CEO and maybe one day you aspire
to become a great CEO, but regardless of whether

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.969
you plan on becoming a great CEO or not, you're
going to learn a lot of things you can do

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:08.560
to help yourself with your leadership abilities.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.841
So I have 19 different points to give you,
and I'll get right into it.

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:18.710
Point #1: Great CEOs know how to manage their
ego.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.859
Let me explain.

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.400
Nobody becomes a CEO who doesn't have an ego.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Nobody.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.030
Not a single soul becomes a CEO who doesn't
have an ego.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.939
Nobody becomes the President of the United
States without being a little bit mentally

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.100
off to believe you have the best processor
to make decisions.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.420
You've got somewhat of an ego.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.420
Right?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.070
So you've got to realize, people who don't
have egos don't want to be presidents.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.670
So there's nothing wrong with having a big
ego.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.979
But you've got to learn how to manage your
own ego, because if you don't control your

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.039
ego, you're definitely in trouble.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.149
Let me explain why.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.579
When you become very successful, and you start
making a lot of money, and everybody knows

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.770
you and you have fame and all this other stuff,
there's something that happens.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.520
And let me tell you what that one thing is.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880
It's called you are flooded with compliments.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.020
You are flooded with compliments.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.479
Let me give you the compliments.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.269
Oh, you're so amazing.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.750
You're so ridiculously good.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.849
Oh, you're better than this.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.189
Oh, you're better than that."

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.519
And so many people are going to feed you this
stuff because you're surrounded by people

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.880
that are afraid of the decisions you could
make to fire them, so everybody wants to tell

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.480
you how amazing you are, right?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.910
Let me tell you, 90% of it is lies.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.450
I just want you to know that.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.900
Because most people are not going to tell
you what you need to hear.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.700
If you have a small circle of people around
you that are telling you the truth, you need

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700
that.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.190
Because that's going to help you manage your
ego.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.300
If you no longer talk to the guys that tell
you off, and are not afraid to tell you things

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.209
you need to hear - and I'm talking about a
small board that you have, or mentors that

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.640
you have that are willing to sit with you
and tell you otherwise, you're going to be

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640
in trouble.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.670
I've seen this happen in sales many times.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.930
I've been dealing with sales people for a
long time.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.180
They start making money.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.640
Everybody starts telling them how amazing
they are.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.670
They're no longer coachable, not willing to
learn.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.069
They don't listen to anything.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.410
They know every single thing because they
already know it.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.730
They forgot how to manage their own ego.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.730
Now that's step number one.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.810
Let me tell you step number two of a great
CEO.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.810
They have a way of finally realizing that
they need to get a touch of humility in them.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.810
Here's why.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.940
You know why humility helps?

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.610
Because other people want to work with you.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.580
If you don't have humility, you can't bring
people together.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.340
If you don't have humility, people who disagree
with you won't want to do business with you.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.840
If you don't have humility, you can't have
an environment with a lot of different personalities.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.500
Because they have to be in a certain set of
personalities to be able to work with you.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.900
Humility is extremely needed.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.239
Point number three.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.069
CEOs are extremely driven.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.180
What I did last week, can you give me that
packet right there, the bag right there.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.209
Just give me the whole bag.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.609
So, I brought, all the, [Edgar, you can say
hi to everybody.

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.360
This is Edgar, a new teammate of ours for
about a month and a half.]

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.540
So, two weeks ago I invited some of the biggest
insurance companies in the world, CEOs, all

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.549
these different people showed up.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:11.690
We took them to a nice dinner, at Capital
Grill, in Dallas, at Cresent, which is my

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.230
favorite building in the world is the Cresent.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.090
The last five years I wrote a book.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.090
It's a fiction book.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.739
It's my first fiction book I've ever written.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.860
The entire book was inspired by this building,
The Cresent.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.150
The setting is at a building that looks like
The Cresent.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.750
So we had dinner at the Capital Grill and
I brought up to dinner, and normally in the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.720
insurance industry, they pay for our dinner.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.110
I paid for everybody.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.450
That's not a cheap dinner, a few thousand
dollars.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.009
Then the following day, The Cresent has a
17th floor, it's a club, where President Bush

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.290
goes and other presidents - many different
presidents, both on the left and right have

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.970
been to this club.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.360
And there's a lot of strong billionaires,
oil people that go over here.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.880
I rented the entire room, and I took them
over there.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.920
We had lunch.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.120
From 8:00 in the morning till noon, I presented
to them with the 2017 vision.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.220
When we had this meeting, and it's a room
filled with a lot of egos, full of a lot of

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.560
egos, and everybody is products - we sell
their products.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.360
And they're all multi-billion dollar companies,
ranging from a $10 billion company to a $300

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.740
billion company, they're all in the room,
and we're presenting all this stuff that I'm

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.750
sharing with all these guys.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.690
This is how the meeting got started, the first
thing.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.130
I said, "I got a gift for you."

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.330
Typically, these meetings start in a different
way.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.440
But I got a surprise for you.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.020
I said, first, we need to realize that ego
is the enemy, and we all need to set aside

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.229
our ego.

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.930
If we don't lead with humility, and we lead
purely with ego, nothing's going to get done.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.350
If you're willing to set aside your egos,
we're willing to set aside our egos.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.970
Hopefully we can do something big together.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.750
This doesn't mean I'm going to stop negotiating.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.759
Because I'm going to ask for a bigger contract,
but this [ego] needs to be set aside.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.180
It's as simple as that.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.160
I gave it to everybody.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.280
We laughed, we had fun.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280
They enjoyed it.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.849
Then I gave them the next hat here.

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.979
And this hat, doesn't say "Make America Great
Again."

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.090
Obviously, we're trying to have some humor
with these guys.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.819
It says "Make Insurance Cool Again."

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.050
Make Insurance Cool Again.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.130
The reason why I gave them these hats is because
there's nothing cool about life insurance.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.449
If you've ever been to a life insurance traditional
convention, with all these insurance companies

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.600
go to, it's pretty bad, when you go to it.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.810
So we gave them this hat, everybody starts
laughing, and we took a picture, everybody

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.229
took a picture again, together, and I said,
"We've got to make insurance cool again."

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:34.460
What's the likelihood of doing that?

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.870
It's very difficult for a lot of other people,
but we're doing it.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.870
We made it cool.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.569
Millennials love working for our firm.

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.300
We have multi-culture, the average agent in
our company is a 34-year-old Hispanic female,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.509
while America right now is struggling to get
Hispanics, multiculturals, and millennials

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.320
and gen x-ers to become agents.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.530
And we're very good at that.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.830
So I gave them this hat.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.229
And everyone starts laughing.

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.470
The next thing we gave them, was a phone charger.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.620
The phone charger said, "Every single time
you charge your phone, I want you to think

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.069
about that we're going to power up the entire
industry.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.479
That's what we're going to be doing.

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:08.099
So next time you charge your phone, think
about us.

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.569
Because we're probably out there growing the
industry."

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.130
And last but not least what I gave them was
the following.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.770
Here's what I gave them.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.050
We gave them two cigars, Romeo and Julietta,
okay, two cigars.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.330
And the reason why we got them these two cigars
for them, I said the following.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.660
I said, Look, in business, sometimes, we end
up spending more time, with people, we're

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.909
in business with, than our own family.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.270
Because that's just kind of how business works.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.240
You're traveling and doing all these other
stuff.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.330
I said, "It's even greater if you can enjoy
doing business with people that you enjoy

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.810
being in business with."

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:47.270
And I said, "I hope we can take our business
relationship from what it is today to a friendship

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.030
by sharing many different cigars together
so you and I can get to know each other so

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.050
we make tens of millions of dollars together,
but at the same time we establish a relationship

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.240
with you as well.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.270
Are you open to that?"

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.270
Yes.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.270
Then we kicked off the meeting.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.360
That's how the meeting got started.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.639
Now why am I telling you this?

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.169
Here's why I'm telling you this.

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:05.889
We're extremely driven.

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:07.240
Everybody in that room is driven.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240
Everybody's got ego.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.990
But we have to figure out a way to set aside
the ego and manage this [humility] and lead

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.760
with this for everybody else to open up and
say, fair enough, let's do business together.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.560
This is one of the things that a CEO typically
has to start with a lot of this [ego], because

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.770
this is what survives, and you just want to
kill everybody and compete and all this stuff,

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.550
and then you realize, sometimes you're killing
your own allies.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.800
These are your friends you're killing.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.940
You know how sometimes you play those video
games and you kill the wrong person and you

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.940
lose?

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.940
You're killing your own allies.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.940
That's not smart.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.210
Because your ego.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.640
We need to lead with this [humility] and you
need to know how to manage your ego, while

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.880
still being driven, while still knowing you're
going to be dealing with a lot of other driven

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
people.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880
#4: Care for their people.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880
Great CEOs care for their people.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.170
If you ask any of the CEOs, like I got a call
the other day from a guy I worked with a long

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.170
time ago.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.170
His name ______________.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.170
Let me tell you what he called me and told
me.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.880
He called me and he and I were speaking about
something on the private side.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.481
I haven't talked to this guy for the longest
time and I was mentoring him way, way, way

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.519
many years ago.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:06.480
He was like family.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.570
I protected this guy.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.570
I looked over him.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.490
I wanted to make sure he had a very good life
and enjoyed himself.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.220
I enjoyed the company of his mom, dad, sister,
everybody with his family.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.760
Now, certain things happened.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.760
He called me.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.570
He said, "Pat, every single time I make a
decision, I say the following.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.000
I say, what would Patrick so in this situation?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.440
Some of the best times I had in business was
working with you.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.399
I haven't learned as much as I learned, except
when I was working with you."

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.529
Let me tell you why it's so important to care
for people.

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:38.649
I got another call from a guy named Danny.

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:39.680
I won't tell his last name, Danny.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.000
He called me in tears.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.130
He called me a year and a half ago, and he
was in tears.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.720
He said, you have no idea how reluctant I've
been about calling you because it's been a

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720
decade."

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.269
I said, "Danny, what's going on?" because
it's been a decade.

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:53.630
I remember everything, the people that worked
for me, I know their stories, because I care

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.610
for the people, I know their stories.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.760
And he said to me, "Pat, I got to tell you
something, man."

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.149
He's quiet and I'm like why is this guy crying?

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:04.450
I haven't talked to you for 10 years.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.250
He said, "I'm now the president of the bank
I work at.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.170
I'm doing very well.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.170
I am married.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.860
I am so happy I can't even tell you.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.320
I'm making a multi six-figure a year income.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.230
And I'm here to tell you, everything I'm putting
in this leadership position, is the stuff

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.250
I learned when I was working in the business
with you."

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.190
You may be watching this and you're in Malaysia.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.190
You're in Brazil.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.190
You and I will never meet each other.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.519
The possibility of us meeting each other may
be never, right?

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:35.050
But you may realize that the only way you
will be called a great CEO is if you realize

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.870
the most important product you will ever have
as a CEO is the people around you.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.240
If you forget that, you're in deep doo doo.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.360
Let me tell you.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.440
They make you look good.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.680
Without them, you're not existent.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.850
So if you think the world revolves around
you as a CEO, you're in deep trouble.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.850
Without them, nothing happens.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.200
And by the way, there's fake care, and people
can tell.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.180
And there's real sincerity, and authenticity,
about you truly caring about the people around

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.180
you.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.620
By the way, most people know how to read through
the BS.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.389
You truly got to care about your people.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:07.390
So ask yourself, how often do you care about
your people?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.720
Do you think about their dreams, their goals,
what they want their purpose to become a reality.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.660
Are you thinking from that standpoint?

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.440
If you are, you're going to end up becoming
a pretty solid CEO one day.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440
Number 5.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440
Human nature.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440
You've got to study human nature.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440
Why human nature?

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.690
Great CEOs understand human nature because
they realized a very, very long time ago their

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.500
number one product is not technology.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.490
I was at a Dallas Cowboys game.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.490
They lost to the Packers.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.889
Tough game, man, let me tell you.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.779
We were at the game, we had box seats.

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:36.761
We were with this technology guy and doing
a bit of negotiation with them and the CEO

00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:39.850
of this company they did about $100 million
last year.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:45.160
So, Tom, asked them a question about, hey,
how long have you been coding?

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.730
He said, "I've never coded in my life."

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:53.670
Wait a minute, we cut a massive check to you,
and you've never coded?"

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.420
He said, "I've never coded in my life.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.230
Him, and the biz dev guy have never coded
in their life.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.930
But they were both good in one thing.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.430
Human nature.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.779
Human nature.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.290
Because the number one product is not coding.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.430
The number one product is not insurance, annuities,
all this other stuff.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.730
By the way, if you're a CEO and you know your
products very well, you got an edge on everybody.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.260
So don't take this for a moment for you to
say, well, thank God, because I know nothing

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.480
about my product.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480
I'm not giving you an out.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.480
So don't take the out there.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.480
Hang on.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.480
Come back here.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.480
You've got to learn the product.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.949
But the number one product of all, is human
nature.

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:30.459
You got to know what happens when people are
down, why this person's not all in, why this

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:33.389
person's being a little bit forgetful, what's
in the personal life.

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:36.180
You've got to take them out to lunch and talk
to them and say, "Is everything okay?

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.910
How's your wife doing?

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.380
Are the kids good?"

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.370
This is all the stuff you got to know about.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.080
Because it's relationships.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.930
Business is purely relationships.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.690
#6, comfortable handling contradictions.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.339
This is very difficult for a lot of people.

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:51.459
Let me explain.

00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:56.120
So any time I try to develop somebody into
becoming a CEO or an entrepreneur, somebody

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:02.329
that's running their own business, they're
so like, I'm a black and white type of person.

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:04.760
And it's the only way I do business, black
and white.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.709
I'm like listen, I wish life was black and
white.

00:13:07.709 --> 00:13:09.300
But life is not black and white.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.470
Life is blue sometimes, it's white sometimes,
it's black sometimes.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.310
Sometimes it's pink, green, purple, sometimes
it's colorful.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.980
Sometimes it's very weird.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.810
So if you go into business expecting just
black and white, you're going to miss out

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.209
on 80% of the opportunities.

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:31.360
There are some gray areas in business and
it's about learning how to deal with contradictions.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.330
What am I talking about with contradictions?

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.070
On one side, one can say, hard work!

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.560
You got to work hard to go out there and be
successful.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.560
100% true.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.000
The key is working smart to become successful.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.709
And these guys may be true.

00:13:45.709 --> 00:13:47.390
Sometimes people say no, it's only about working
hard.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.130
No, it's only about working smart.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.529
Of course you need to work smart and have
tools.

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:55.470
But if I got a guy that knows how to work
hard and manage his energy and his health,

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.880
and he knows how to work smart by having the
right tools and people around him, he's going

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.300
to kick the other guy's but that only thinks
about working hard or only thinking about

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300
working smart.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.480
So you got to learn that there's a lot of
contradictions in life and in business.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.340
"Success, happiness is about living a balanced
life."

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.380
Okay, okay.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.800
I mean, what is so balanced about being pregnant
and having a kid, and 24/7 a woman all they

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.820
have to think about is pregnancy.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.990
Nursing.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:26.220
We have several, I'm okay with people that
want to bring their kids here to work.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.949
They're pumping milk all day long.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:31.590
So what is the balanced life about it when
you're nursing the kid seven, eight times

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.839
a day and they're pooping.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:34.620
Your life is not balanced.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.300
Let me explain to you, one of the biggest
highs is having a kid.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.320
"But life is about being balanced, right?"

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.329
You got a person that's chasing to win a championship,
a Super Bowl, plays in a movie six months

00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:46.899
they're shooting, it's not a balanced life.

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.390
So what is balance?

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.230
Is this like certain balance is supposed to
be 9-5.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.579
You got to know how to live with contradictions
as a CEO and you got to dance with contradictions.

00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:58.410
And don't be stiff when you're dancing with
contradictions.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:04.060
Just kind of dance with contradictions and
be okay with it when you're dealing with contradictions

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.100
because if you don't, you're going to have
a lot of anxiety attacks and you're going

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.240
to be having a lot of migraines if you try
to control all these contradictions.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.240
Number 7.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.240
They think outside the box.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.800
Solid CEOs, they think outside the box.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.449
It's not always one way of doing anything.

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.230
They think outside the box.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.980
They regularly think outside the box.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:28.080
One of the videos I did on thinking outside
the box is how to think big as an entrepreneur,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.190
that's a video you ought to watch.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.180
It has to do a little bit with how to think
outside the box.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.560
But they don't just look at one thing and
say, "we have to do this, this, this, this."

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.370
They're very good at looking at this and saying,
you know, connect the dot, I think it's.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.550
. . Yeah, I never thought about that.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.550
Yeah, it's this.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.550
We need to focus on this.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.550
We've never done this before.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.970
And they're willing to think a little bit
different than most people would think.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.209
#8, they have a reputation.

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:49.540
Let me explain to you what I mean by a reputation.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.860
They can't be pushed around by competitors.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.860
Typically strong CEOs, I was watching this
one president of a company and he went up

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.459
there and he was being pushed around by Elizabeth
Warren.

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:06.190
And this was a financial firm company I was
watching.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.959
And she was just pushing him and pushing him.

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:11.069
And I'm sitting there saying, where is your
spine?

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:12.069
Stand up already!

00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:13.069
It wasn't Wells Fargo.

00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:14.069
I said, stand up already!

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.220
Stand up for your industry!

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.270
You're making everybody look like they're
doing something wrong.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.269
Have some backbone.

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:21.269
Say something!

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:22.670
He's just sitting there like this, shaking.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.920
Because he's worried about his $6 million
bonus.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.089
Say something already!

00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:28.519
He's no longer the president.

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:30.399
I wouldn't have him as a president.

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.410
Voice your opinion a little bit.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.410
You can't be a CEO representing the industry
and you don't have a backbone to share your

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.050
thoughts and opinions because you're worried
about regulators and the government.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.450
You've got to say stuff a little bit.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.130
I'm not talking about being disrespectful.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.829
But you can't just sit there and take it all
the time.

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.840
A CEO can't be pushed around.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.500
You can't bully a CEO.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.500
They stand up.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.640
One of the most respectable CEOs I ever met
was named Bob Benmosche.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.269
We established a relationship together.

00:16:54.269 --> 00:17:01.190
At a conference in 2015, I will never forget
he died that night during our awards ceremony,

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.190
he had died that night.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.240
The was the former CEO of MetLife.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.980
He retires, very wealthy, goes to Croatia,
which is my favorite place in the world, and

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.460
he buys a vineyard.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.370
And all he does is make wine.

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.840
And one day his son is over there, and it's
2008.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.990
AIG's about to go bankrupt.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:21.090
I'm having dinner with the CEO of AIG, David
Herzog and they call him.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:23.260
They said, we need you to help us out.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.260
He said, "I'm not coming."

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.260
They said, we need you to help us out.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.260
He said, "Look, I'm good.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.480
He has three years to live.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
He's got cancer.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480
He's dying.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.520
He's got three years to live.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520
AIG calls him.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.930
Bob Benmosche gets up, out of retirement,
is on his death bed, three years to live.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.380
On steroids all the time because he's dying.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.960
He gets out of retirement, comes to AIG, starts
working, promotes David Herzog, believe from

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.260
American General from AIG CFO, they go to
the government, they ask for $183 billion

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.840
check.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.480
And when I'm having dinner, I'll never forget.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.570
They said, every day we were getting hounded
by regulators about our debt.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.130
Finally, Bob Benmosche calls.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.700
Hey, this money we took from you, we're not
GM.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.700
We're going to pay you back.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.020
You're not going to bully us on a daily basis.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.170
I'm going to tell you right now, not a single
call.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.430
I'm going to let you know exactly what we're
doing, but not one more single call.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.790
Whoa.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.130
Bob Benmosche comes, sells off all the companies
they didn't need.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.110
Some of them he held a little bit longer to
sell.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.040
AIG's a very big company.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.020
He pays back $183 billion plus another $23
billion in interest or so.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.170
Then he pays that back.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.280
GM still hasn't paid back.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.090
So many other people haven't paid back.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.090
AIG paid back.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.680
AIG's credibility comes back in the marketplace.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.160
Six months after that, he died.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.860
It was a Friday night when this man died.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.560
And all I remember about Bob Benmosche, every
time he and I were together, all I remember

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.960
is a man with presence, with leadership, with
backbone, that people wanted to follow.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.480
He wasn't liked all the time.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.650
But there's one thing everybody knew.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:53.000
If that dude's at the helm, he's leading it
as a CEO - you're going to be fine.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.530
He's a general, the way he led the company.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.040
And not everybody has his personality.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.830
But generally strong CEOs, they can't be pushed
around.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.920
Next, number nine.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.290
They're great at asking questions.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.440
They're great at asking questions.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.420
When they don't understand something, they're
going to ask questions.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.920
When they want to find the deeper issues,
they know how to ask the right questions.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.200
A lot of times people don't ask the right
questions.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.470
You can ask questions, but then it's asking
the right questions, that gets the right answer,

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.280
that solves the bigger problem, not the smaller
problem.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.600
Great CEOs are very good at asking the right
questions.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.670
Study great CEOs on what questions they generally
ask and you'll tell yourself, man, I was thinking

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.990
about the surface.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.610
This guy's thinking here [deep].

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.620
These are the questions I want to be asking
about.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.820
That's what you want to be thinking about.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.540
Number 10, they want feedback.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.540
What do you think?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.540
What are your thoughts?

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.540
What do you think about this?

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.540
What do you think about that?

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.950
And they know who to get the right feedback
from, and they're constantly asking for feedback.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.100
Number 11, they raise standards.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.750
They're always raising standards.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.340
It's uncomfortable being around strong CEOs,
great CEOs.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.840
They're always raising standards.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.380
Most people believe it or not, don't even
like working with great CEOs.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.210
Because it's not comfortable.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.750
It's always raising standards.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.130
Almost a feeling of it's not enough.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.130
It's not enough.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.130
It's not enough.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.130
We're not there yet.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.130
We're not there yet.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.130
It's always a standard.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.500
"Every time I get somewhere, you move the
marker."

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.720
That's the job of a leader.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.340
"Every time I feel like I go, you move it
a little bit more.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.120
When are you going to be fully happy?"

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.730
That's what makes them so special.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.560
That's why history books are going to favor
Bob Benmosche and when he died, a bunch of

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.170
people go and buy his book because they wanted
to know what made him so special to save AIG

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.130
from a major debacle or major issue that we're
going to be facing.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.130
Right?

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.500
Because they know how to raise everyone's
standards.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.850
I remember when in Napa Valley, and Bob Benmosche
walks in, and there's a meeting going on,

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.570
everybody in that room that reported to him
was uncomfortable.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.900
It was so funny just watching everybody.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.260
They were uncomfortable, because he was a
leader.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.260
He raised the standards.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.950
He told everybody, here's how the meeting
to started, and he had just become a CEO three

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.950
months ago.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.060
He said "This Napa Valley thing," he told
everybody, this is not going to happen for

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.060
six years.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.360
We got money to pay back.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360
We got money to pay back.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.450
That's how he started the meeting.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.610
This stuff, not happening anymore.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:56.610
We got money to pay back.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.090
And he looked at all of us and he says, hey,
we know we haven't been good, but we need

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.680
your business.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680
We need your business.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680
We need you to work with us.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680
We need your business.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.680
Flat out.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.870
I've got a lot of respect for a man that talks
like that, and is very open about it.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.370
Number 12, they build strong alliances.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.250
Remember when I talked about humility?

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:18.750
They build very strong alliances, because
look, you can only go somewhere, so far, by

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.750
yourself.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.310
Amazon, if you read Amazon's case study from
Harvard, if you type in Amazon case study,

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:34.470
and you type in Amazon, Toys R Us, if you
study what Amazon did in '01, if Amazon doesn't

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.290
build an alliance with Toys R Us, forget about
Amazon.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.950
There is no Amazon.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.480
He gets credit for what he did with Toys R
Us.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.670
So how did he do that?

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.000
Building strong alliances.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.420
How did Steve Jobs, when he was about to go
out of business, go to Microsoft, Bill Gates,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.960
his biggest enemy and the meeting starts like
this - we have been under this impression

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.860
that in order for Apple to win, Microsoft
has to lose.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.960
He says this in his talk.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.020
Just type in Steve Jobs, speech, Microsoft
has to lose.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.020
He says this.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.020
He says that's not true.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.010
He had to go to Bill Gates and say, "I need
$300 million."

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:10.450
Bill Gates, his biggest enemy gives him $300
million but imagine if he doesn't build that

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.450
alliance.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.270
They're out of business.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.280
Everybody in Silicon Valley, Palo Alto's saying
a guy from here went to Seattle to raise money

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.750
from the enemy.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.750
That's called building an alliance.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.490
Today you and I use our iPhone or all these
other great devices because somebody was strong

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.490
at building alliances.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.490
Number 13.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:27.490
They speak different languages.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.490
What do I mean by that?

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.301
I'm not talking English, Spanish, I'm not
talking about that.

00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.790
I'm talking about they speak different languages.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.980
Let me elaborate.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.350
They know how to talk to employees different
than the way they talk to executives, different

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.890
than the way they talk to salespeople, different
than the way they talk to investors.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.020
Different than the way they talk to media,
different than the way they talk to their

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.020
family, different.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.760
. . They know how to speak these dif - and
let me tell you.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.950
It ain't the same language.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.050
It is not the same language.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.541
You cannot go talk to the front desk clerk
at a company that you're the CEO and then

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:59.370
talk to that person as if that person's a
full on executive.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.370
You can't.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.370
Because it's a different language.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.450
So you got to know how to speak these different
languages.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.140
You can't go to an investor and just kind
of be lollygagging with them, while they're

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.030
expecting returns on their tens of millions
of dollars that they give you.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.630
And I walk into these rooms, it's different
conversations, regularly.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:17.450
I did a video that's called seven different
audiences CEOs talk to, I think it's seven

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.550
different audiences CEOs talk to.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.330
Let's put the tab up here, Edgar make sure
we put it up there, and the link on the bottom.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.850
You have to watch this video.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.970
It's seven different audiences a CEO speaks
to.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.800
That will help you out on understanding how
they speak to those different customers.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.010
Next, number 14.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.990
They know their strengths, very well.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.990
But guess what?

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.680
They know their weaknesses even more.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.680
Here's why.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.110
They're very comfortable being weak.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.440
They're so comfortable being weak.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440
At least the great ones.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.790
At least the great ones are very comfortable
being weak.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:47.610
Because what they do with the weakness is
they recruit the weakness.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.170
So whatever they're weak at, they bring somebody
who's strength is in their weakness.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.170
Simple.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.280
And the sooner you identify your weaknesses,
the sooner you're going to be able to leverage

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.270
your abilities to focus on your strengths
and not have to worry about your weaknesses.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.750
You can always recruit your weaknesses.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.210
By the way, everyone's got weaknesses.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.210
Focus on your strengths.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.910
Next point, number 15.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.930
They know what they know, and they know what
they don't know.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.080
Let me say it again.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.530
They know what they know, and they know what
they don't know.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.450
Similar to weaknesses, but it's not.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.470
Meaning, whatever they don't know, they know
the person who can get them to the answer

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.600
of what they don't know.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600
It's simple.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.570
If it's a question that's technical, ask this
one.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.850
I know who to call to get me the answers to
stuff I don't know about.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.130
And they're fine with it.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.410
So they know what they know and they know
what they don't know.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.970
#16: They're very decisive, they make the
decision, boom.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.850
I had Tom the other day told me, Pat, when
you want to fire somebody, it's like [snap]

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.850
that quick.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.850
I said, I'm good.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.440
The moment I know somebody doesn't fit in
a, and I've seen a trend of three times, I'll

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.600
typically give someone three chances.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.460
But if I notice somebody just is not fitting,
and it happens like this [up and down] over

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.630
and over again, gone.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.350
They have to go to a different place.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.370
It's like a relationship.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.110
That doesn't mean that person's a bad person.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.240
They're not going to fit in a place like this.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.370
Because for whatever reason this culture doesn't
fit with that person, that constantly keeps

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.370
coming back.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.430
That person may go to a completely different
place and be happy.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.430
Just not on this team.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.500
We have a certain set of culture here that
we have to follow through.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.580
#17, timing.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.280
Timing in business, timing in statements,
timing in comments, timing in marketing campaigns,

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.900
timing in breaks, timing in initiatives, timing
on stuff for the associates and employees,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.160
and sales.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.370
Everything's about timing.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.360
They're very good at timing.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.850
#18: They're very strong drivers.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.460
If there's an initiative, they will be driving
it over and over and over and over again,

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.460
until you do it.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.650
They will drive the initiative nonstop.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.120
That's what makes these guys special.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.120
They drive.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.130
They're going to drive the initiative.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.720
And the moment you thought they forgot about
them, they're about to give you a speech on

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.200
driving that initiative, why everybody should
be focused on that.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.380
They're nonstop drivers.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.430
And 19, last point here, they're very good
at rallying the troops.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.110
They're very good at rallying the troops.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.650
They know how to get the troops going.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:59.120
If it's sales, if it's team, if it's home
office, if it's support, they know how to

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.730
rally the troops.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.700
So that's 19 different qualities of a great
CEO.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.520
And by the way, if you're watching this and
saying, "Oh my gosh, I got a lot of work to

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520
do.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.650
All this stuff's going to take years.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.220
Don't expect to be good at this overnight.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.460
It's just good to look at it, and say I can
improve in the following areas to become a

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.720
better CEO myself.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.490
One day, where other people start looking
at you as a CEO instead of just going out

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.790
there and paying a couple hundred dollars
and getting a Vista Print business card just

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.640
to call yourself a CEO.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.670
With that being said, if you've got any questions
and thoughts, comment on the bottom.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.600
If you have not subscribed to the greatest
channel on YouTube for entrepreneurs, we need

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.730
you to subscribe to the greatest channel on
entrepreneurs.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.910
And we challenge you.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.220
I'll put it out there to you.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.030
I put it there out to you.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.590
Go tweet and message anybody else and see
if they can stack against our channel on YouTube

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.590
for entrepreneurs.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.600
We're that comfortable in what we're doing.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600
We're constantly improving.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.690
A lot of great initiatives that we've got
coming out with here.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.110
But there are a lot of channels that are purely
about motivation and regurgitating the same

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.110
thing.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.270
We want to make sure we bring you fresh content
and we're just getting started.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.990
Wait until you hear what's coming out here
soon about stuff that's going to be just purely

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:09.010
innovative, that no one's ever done before,
because we believe the world's a better place

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.030
the more entrepreneurs we can give birth to,
the world just keeps becoming a better and

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.030
better place.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.560
The more innovators, the more disrupters,
this place keeps getting better and better

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.560
and better.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.350
And we need your help to becoming a better
entrepreneur.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.550
And we need your help to spread the message
of Valuetainment to other people.

everybody.
