00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.540
From the possible site of the legendary Garden
of Eden to an island that may be covering

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:19.269
an Alien Base -- Today we look at the 9 Most
Mysterious Islands On Earth

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.340
Number 9.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.289
"Island of Socotra"
Off the coast of Somalia in the Indian ocean

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.839
is an island that seems as though it belongs
on another planet.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:36.420
Socotra Island has long been theorized as
a location for the biblical Garden of Eden,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.570
and just by looking at pictures of it you
can see why.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.640
The island is home to several species of plants
that are can’t be found anywhere else on

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.640
Earth.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.789
There are the Dr. Seuss looking Adenium socotranum
which have big bulbous trunks and tiny gnarly

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.700
branches that sprout from their tops and bear
flowers that are a marvelous shade of pink.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.949
There odd appearance makes them kind of look
like giant root vegetables.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.630
Then there are the Dragon’s Blood Trees
which look like perfect natural umbrellas.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.159
The have trunks that resemble that of an average
tree but their thick tightly bunched branches

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.610
shoot upwards and form a mushroom like crown.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.800
Socotra is also home to three geographically
unique species of bird: the socotra sunbird,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.720
socotra grosbeak and socotra starling.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.540
There aren’t many other creatures that inhabit
the island other than that of bats and insects

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.480
and the last time it was home to man was around
the year 100 A.D.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.320
Adding to the mystery, the island has been
the site of dozens of shipwrecks over the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.320
years.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.670
Number 8.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.770
"Palmyra Atoll"
Though technically not an island but an atoll

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.520
that formed from coral the mysterious nature
of Palmyra Atoll cannot be ignored.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.159
Also known as Palmyra Island, the breathtakingly
beautiful ringlet sits between American Samoa

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.159
and Hawaii.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.070
Though it is full of lush vegetation and appears
unblemished by man the island has long be

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.930
the subject of superstition and folktales.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.640
There have been several cases of violent shipwrecks
and mysterious disappearances of ships on

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.300
and around the island.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.580
Those who have observed the island and survived
to tell their tale have claimed having seen

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.800
some extremely bizarre sights like that of
floating lights, ghosts and sea monsters.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.530
It is also reported to be the home of an incredible
amount of sharks who may have developed a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.130
distinct taste for humans.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.230
There is also the story of lost Incan treasure
that may still be on the island.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.240
These tales and others which cannot be discussed
do to their graphic nature have made Palmyra

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.900
the stuff of legend amongst sailors and Pacific
Islanders for centuries.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.110
Number 7.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.580
"Vulcan Island"
Vulcan Island in the Philippines isn’t necessarily

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.310
an island that is shrouded in mystery but
it definitely is a mindblowing locale.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.860
On the northern Philippine island of Luzon
there sits a lake named Taal and in that lake

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.940
there is an island called Taal Volcano, inside
this island is the world’s largest crater

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.360
lake and inside of this lake there sits yet
another island, known as Vulcan Island.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.270
Not only is Vulcan Island one of the most
fascinating of natural recursion it happens

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.080
to be located on one of the most active volcanoes
in the entire Pacific Ocean.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.840
Because of this fact it is incredibly dangerous
to visit Vulcan Island as it has been quaking

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.170
and bubbling since 1991.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.470
Number 6.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.460
"Easter Island"
The world renowned Easter Island still attracts

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.140
tourists, anthropologists and archaeologists
to this day who are both perplexed and in

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.260
awe of the statues left behind by the ancestors
of the native Rapa Nui peoples.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.610
Though the mysteries behind these statues,
called Moai are now mostly solved, they aren’t

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.370
the only puzzle that is confounded visitors
to the small island off of Chile.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.040
Scientists recently answered one of the biggest
questions surrounding the Moai which was ‘how

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.540
did the Rapa Nui move these massive stone
idols?’

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.640
They found out that these statues were specifically
designed to have pot bellies so that they

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.040
could be rocked back and forth until they
were eventually wiggled to where they wanted

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040
them.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.320
But the mystery that still remains unsolved
doesn’t have to do with the Moai but rather

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320
the people that built them.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.850
The Rapa Nui have been found to have a completely
separate genetic heritage to that of nearby

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.520
native South American peoples.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.840
In fact their closest genetic relatives actually
came from Pacific Islanders that live near

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.900
Southeast Asia.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.450
So what is the mystery?

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.460
Well despite being located in the Pacific,
Easter Island is still thousands of miles

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.990
away from the Rapa Nui’s nearest relatives.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.940
So how did they get there?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.670
And how did they build such advanced structures
and invent their own agricultural system at

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.880
such an early period in history despite being
geographically isolated from civilizations

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.880
with similar advancements?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.050
Number 5.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.580
"The Island of The Dolls"-The Mexico City
borough of Xochimilco is steeped in Mexican

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.580
history.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.040
Because it has long been the hub that connects
the various canals and lakes of Mexico it

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.950
has been the cultural melting pot of the country.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.800
One particular ‘floating garden’ on the
canals of Xochimilco may be eerie to outsiders

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.810
but it’s origins come from a caring place,
in line with Mexico’s tradition of honoring

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.590
those who have passed from this life to the
next.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.660
The legend goes like this, one day a man found
the body of a young girl who had met with

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.440
a tragic fate in the waters of one of the
canals.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.001
When he later returned to the spot he found
her he spotted a doll floating in the water

00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:13.680
and believed it to have belonged to the girl.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.250
In order to pay tribute to the girl he tied
the doll to a nearby tree.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.600
As the days passed he still felt like the
girl’s spirit wasn’t at rest so he started

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.420
to bring more dolls and hang them on the trees.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.980
Though no one knows if this story is more
than myth, it has become a tradition to hang

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.100
dolls on the trees of the floating garden
which is now known as ‘La Isla de las Munecas’

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.670
or ‘The Island of the Dolls’.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.260
Although this tradition comes from the heart,
it is still quite a frightening sight as the

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:53.800
dolls are in various states of decay and some
have even told tales of them coming to life.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.280
Number 4.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.389
"Poveglia Island"-Just off the coast of Venice,
Italy lies Poveglia Island which may have

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.610
one of the most twisted and horrifying histories
of any island on Earth.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.300
During the devastating Bubonic Plague outbreak
of the 14th century the government of Venice

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.870
decided to try and quarantine the infected
by sending them to Poveglia Island where they

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.640
would live out the rest of their days.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.540
Because of this, even after the plague subsided
the site became basically a national lazaretto

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.130
and used anytime an outbreak of disease occurred.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.860
Poveglia would being to serve a new purpose
in the 1920s when a mental hospital was built

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:36.080
on it and the terrors that the patients were
subject to at the hands of their caretakers

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.690
only added to the haunting history of the
island.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.800
The island has since fallen into dangerous
level of disrepair and the Italian tourism

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.380
bureau technically has forbidden people from
visiting unless they go through an extensive

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.520
application and interview process.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.639
But that hasn’t stopped ghosthunters and
thrill-seekers alike from finding alternative

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.510
ways to sneak onto the spooky island.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.510
Number 3.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.910
"Isla Bermeja"
From the 1500s up until the late 1900s there

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.760
existed an island off the Yucatan Peninsula
in the Gulf of Mexico, at least according

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.080
to maps there was.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.830
The islet of Bermeja was long used as the
geographical boundary for Mexico’s section

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.220
of the Gulf but several mapping expeditions
in the 20th century that went looking for

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.850
the island frankly couldn’t find it.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.449
There are several theories as to how an island
could appear on maps for the better part of

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:32.650
four hundred years but then suddenly disappear.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.810
Most modern day experts believe that the island
never existed at all and may have been the

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.150
result of a cartographic mistake that went
uncorrected.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.620
Some say that the island, which was described
as being the color of strawberry blonde hair,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.450
did exist but sank into the ocean.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:56.210
This theory is backed up by British maps dating
back to the 1840s which describe the island

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.740
being slowly swallowed by the sea.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.920
However, there are those who believe that
the island’s disappearance and the fact

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.270
that it had political significance are not
mere coincidence.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.900
Because the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most
oil-rich regions on Earth some have theorized

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:18.580
that the island’s existence was only perpetuated
by the Mexican government in order to strategically

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.260
extend their claim.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.500
On the flipside, there are also conspiracy
theorists who believe the island did exist

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.380
but was destroyed by the United States government
for the same reason.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.330
Other conspiracies claim that the island still
exists but that the evidence has been wiped

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.350
from maps due to it being the site of top-secret
activities.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.350
Number 2.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.510
"Floating Eye Island"
While surveying the Parana Delta of northern

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:52.180
Argentina in 2016 with the hopes of finding
the perfect setting for his upcoming film,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.210
Argentinian filmmaker Sergio Neuspillerm found
one of the most peculiar places in the world.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:04.270
Deep in the misty marshlands Sergio came upon
a lake that appeared to be shaped like a perfect

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.400
circle.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.279
Not only that, but there was an island in
the lake that was exactly the same shape and

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:16.840
it filled up the majority of the lake, leaving
only a thin ring of water around it.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.820
Sergio was fascinated with the island that
would come to be called ‘The Eye’ and

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.339
quickly returned with a small research party.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:26.640
His team reported some strange findings.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.020
They found that the island was actually floating
in the water and appeared to rotate around

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.680
the lake on its own axis.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.480
They also say that the water was astonishingly
cold and clear and the bottom of the lake

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.990
was significantly harder than the rest of
the ground in the area.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.870
Because of these mysterious observations Sergio
decided to scrap the initial film project

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:52.160
he was working on in favor of shooting a documentary
on ‘The Eye’.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.040
Since the word got out on Floating Eye Island
several conspiracy theories with it at the

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.140
center have arisen.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:05.240
The most popular of these is that the island
is covering a secret alien base.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.690
Number 1.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.520
"Diego Garcia"
In the middle of the Indian Ocean is Diego

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.080
Garcia Island which has been shrouded in conspiracy.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.690
The island, which is part of the Chagos Archipelago,
was uninhabited when it was settled by French

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:25.190
colonists in 1793 who brought hundreds of
slaves to the islands to work their plantations.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.680
The island would eventually fall under British
control as a result of the Napoleonic Wars.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.320
After slavery was abolished, the freed slaves
(who had established their own cultural identity)

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.310
stayed at the island and continued to till
the land.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:46.080
But the Chagossians, as they had come to be
called, were forced out of their home in 1971,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.640
in order to make way for a United States Naval
Base.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.350
The US and UK had come to an agreement allowing
the US Navy to take control of the island,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.970
but the base that the Navy wanted to build
required the Chagossians to be unwillingly

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.380
relocated.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.540
The arguably unethical methods the United
States used to get the islanders to comply,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:12.490
such as slowly cutting off their supplies
or euthanizing their pets would only add depth

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.630
to the conspiracy theories that would subsequently
arise about the island.
