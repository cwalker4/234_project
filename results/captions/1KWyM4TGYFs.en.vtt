00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.890
Fermilab is one of the preeminent particle
physics laboratories in the world.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.680
You might well have known that.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.950
But you might not know just exactly why I
can say that with such confidence.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.400
It turns out that there are a lot of reasons,
from having some of the finest accelerator

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.520
and magnet experts on the planet, to conducting
research at the highest energies accessible,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.480
to searching for the cosmically-elusive dark
matter and dark energy.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.800
But it is Fermilab’s neutrino research program
in which it is the unquestioned leader.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230
Fermilab currently can generate the most intense
neutrino beams on the planet and use them

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.960
to study subtle behaviors of the universe’s
legendarily shy particles.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.809
And Fermilab is the host laboratory for an
experiment called DUNE, which will send a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.780
beam of neutrinos to a massive neutrino detector
that will be located in South Dakota.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.820
Neutrinos interact very rarely with ordinary
matter.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.370
That’s their defining signature.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.580
And yet, studying them has led to many surprises
over the last 50 years.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.070
We’ve learned that matter and antimatter
have different behaviors, and we’ve found

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.200
that neutrinos can actually change their identity
in a cyclical pattern that we call neutrino

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.280
oscillation.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.000
Researchers are confident that neutrinos haven’t
yielded all of their secrets, which is why

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.440
many members of the Fermilab scientific staff
have devoted their time to neutrino research.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.909
With neutrinos, energy isn’t the name of
the game.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.759
That’s because high and low energy neutrinos
exhibit the same kinds of behaviors.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.150
Instead, what matters is the number of neutrinos
traveling in your beam per second.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.220
The reason is simple.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.720
Neutrinos interact extremely rarely.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.560
To give you a sense of scale, for every hundred
billion neutrinos that hit a typical detector

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.650
located on the Fermilab campus, only one interacts.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.709
The only way to get more interactions to study
is to simply generate more neutrinos.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.029
The way you make a beam of neutrinos is to
accelerate a beam of protons to very high

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.409
speeds and smash them into a target.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.249
Protons in, and after a few intermediary steps,
neutrinos come out.

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.620
That’s how it works.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.629
I even made a video on the process.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.209
So Fermilab scientists started looking into
how they could generate more intense beams

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.090
of protons.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.269
As you might expect, the discussion was very
technical.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.840
By the way, I’m going to talk as if we simply
accelerate protons throughout the complex,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420
but it’s more complicated than that.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.290
Maybe I’ll make a future video on those
details.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.389
For now, imagine that the beam is only protons,
but realize that there’s more to the story.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.650
We talk of the Fermilab accelerator as if
it's just a single thing, but it actually

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.420
consists of four very distinct accelerators,
each designed to work at different speeds.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.579
We have the low energy accelerator, called
the preaccelerator.

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.029
We have the medium energy accelerator, called
the linear accelerator, or LINAC.

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.640
We have the high energy accelerator, which
is called the Booster.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.879
And we have the very high energy accelerator,
which is called the Main Injector.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.359
When each accelerator was evaluated, it was
immediately apparent that the one that was

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.809
limiting the ability to make intense beams
of protons is the LINAC.

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.299
That’s not so surprising.

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.450
The LINAC is one of the first devices that
operated at Fermilab.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.700
It first saw beam in 1970 and the technology
is from the 1950s and 60s.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.499
It was never designed to perform under the
conditions required by an accelerator operating

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:04.059
in the 2020s and beyond.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.499
There was no way to make small modifications
to the existing LINAC.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.760
In order to perform as required, it needed
to be replaced by an entirely new device.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.850
We call this effort PIP-II, short for Proton
Improvement Plan.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.300
PIP-I was an earlier effort that made smaller
improvements to the facility.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.669
Those tweaks resulted in the world class accelerators
Fermilab hosts today, but a different approach

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.199
was needed to take it to the next level.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.970
PIP-II will entirely replace the old LINAC
with a new one.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:44.080
And, to maximize the increase in performance,
we’ll replace the preaccelerator as well.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.050
So how will the PIP-II LINAC be better?

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.490
Well, perhaps most importantly, the core technology
will be modernized.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.180
Particle accelerators all work more or less
in the same way.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.759
Strong electric fields are used to push electrically
charged particles and make them go faster

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.810
and faster.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.120
Radio waves are beamed into devices called
cavities.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.800
When the radio waves enter the cavities, they
make extremely strong oscillating electric

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.110
fields.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.500
By the way, the jargon for this is RF cavities.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.389
RF stands for “radio frequency,” but it
just means radio waves.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.610
For technical reasons, the fields have to
oscillate.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.479
If you want to know why, you could look at
the video I made on it, or you can just trust

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.080
me here.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.699
The original LINAC cavities were metal, and
they operated at room temperature.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.960
However, when the radio waves entered the
cavities, those waves induced electrical currents

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.610
in the walls of the cavities, which caused
them to heat up.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.169
It’s not all that different than if you
put a spoon in your microwave.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.590
If you did that, you’d find that the spoon
would get extremely hot.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.719
Don’t do that by the way- it’s very bad
for it.

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:04.879
And, when you think about it, all that energy
that is going into heating up the metal doesn’t

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.439
go into accelerating your beam.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:11.870
So, first, it’s wasted energy that you have
to pay for, and second, it’s possible to

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.440
heat up metal so much that it will simply
melt and become useless.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.689
So you have to cool the cavities.

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.700
And you turn on and off the radio waves to
give the cavities a little time to cool off.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.629
It’s really not the best way to do it.

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.220
In PIP-II, scientists make cavities out of
superconductors.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.419
Superconductors are metals that have no resistance
and thus don’t heat up when immersed in

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.139
radio waves.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.810
So essentially all of the radio waves shot
into the cavities can go into accelerating

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.169
the particles.

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.479
This also means that you don’t have to turn
the radio waves on and off.

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:55.710
You could leave them on all the time and constantly
send beam through.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.060
Because of considerations arising from other
accelerator components, we won’t send beam

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:07.090
through PIP-II constantly, although we’ll
keep the radio waves on all of the time.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.380
The PIP-II LINAC will be double the energy
of the existing facility- 800 million electron

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.319
volts instead of 400.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.939
So what’s the bottom line?

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:20.889
How is the new facility going to compare to
the old one?

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:24.659
Is it as different as this- and this?

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:27.990
Well, no, of course not.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.470
And that’s a trickier question to answer
than you might think.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.389
It depends on the measuring stick.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:40.050
For instance, one number is that the new LINAC
is capable of accelerating nearly 200 times

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.669
more protons per second compared to the existing
one.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.909
If other things didn’t matter, that'd be
the answer.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:49.349
But other things do matter.

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:54.969
There’s an entire accelerator complex and
other limitations must be taken into account.

00:07:54.969 --> 00:08:00.970
When we step back and look at the entire facility,
perhaps the right way to look it is to simply

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.669
ask how many protons are available to do research.

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:11.550
The current accelerator complex can deliver
0.7 megawatts of proton power.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:17.960
When the PIP-II upgrade is complete, it will
deliver 1.2 megawatts, or nearly double.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.740
When you get to that much power, limitations
in the fifty year old booster accelerator

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.650
start to come into play.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:29.729
Fermilab’s accelerator scientists are already
thinking about ways to build a modern booster.

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:35.750
When that is accomplished, the Fermilab accelerator
complex will be able to deliver 2.4 megawatts

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.919
of power, or pushing four times what we can
do today.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:45.310
And this will then result in generating the
world’s most intense beam of neutrinos,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.160
which we will study in the DUNE experiment.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.269
It’s probably worth asking how this is all
going to happen.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:55.680
Is this ambitious upgrade something we know
how to do?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.010
Well, first, I should say that the Fermilab
accelerator experts are second to none.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.430
So yeah- yeah.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.930
We can do it.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.360
But I should also say that the project is
technically very challenging and there is

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.240
nothing a good scientist or engineer likes
more than technically challenging project.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.710
Because of that, other groups of world-class
accelerator experts are collaborating with

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.120
us.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.000
Researchers from France, Great Britain, India,
and Italy, and other countries are already

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.940
making important contributions.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.990
Some of those scientists have moved to the
U.S. to immerse themselves in the project.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:40.620
They’re still employed by their home institution,
but they want to be where the action is.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.310
From a project point of view, some of the
replacement RF cavities exist and are being

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.410
qualified.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:52.630
PIP-II consists of five distinct different
types of cavities, each optimized to work

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:58.490
at a different velocity as the beam moves
to about 85% the speed of light.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:04.730
Each different set of cavities acts like a
gear in a car.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.490
A working prototype of the preaccelerator
is undergoing evaluation.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:14.810
And, in the spring of 2019, groundbreaking
will occur for the buildings that will house

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:20.360
this fantastic upgrade to an already world-class
facility.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.450
Thinking more broadly, the technology being
developed for the PIP-II upgrade has an incredible

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.440
amount of applicability in industry, in such
fields as medicine, nuclear energy, and material

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.070
science, as well as, of course, other laboratories
who want to use it to perform basic research.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.600
Fermilab is a legend in the particle physics
world and has been for fifty years.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.589
With the PIP-II upgrade, Fermilab’s future
is looking even more fantastic for its second

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:49.589
half-century.

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:51.820
Well, that was fun.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.110
It’s always amazing to see a scientific
facility take a huge step forward.
