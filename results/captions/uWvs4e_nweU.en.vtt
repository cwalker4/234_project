00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.750
Speculation as to what the government might
be hiding from us is an easy way to bring

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.250
a conversation to an end.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.170
But very often the truth is stranger than
fiction.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.150
Here are ten declassified secrets—things
our governments actually did then went out

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.430
of their way to cover up–that make many
conspiracy theories look tame.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.110
10.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.789
Operation PBSUCCESS

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.990
In 1997, the CIA finally declassified proof
of their grubby involvement in the Guatemalan

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.990
coup of 1954.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.329
But the 1,400 self-incriminating documents
were just a fraction of the 100,000+ thought

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.949
to be in secret archives.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.039
Even the CIA’s own historical review panel
described their release–part of a wider

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.829
dump of Cold War era documents–as “a brilliant
public relations snow job.”

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.569
The coup had been nothing short of evil, violently
reasserting capitalist oppression in a nation

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.699
just beginning to recover from years of tyrannical
rule.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.199
By the mid-20th century, governmental corruption
had led to an obscene concentration of land

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.320
ownership among a tiny minority of people–many
of whom weren’t even Guatemalan.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.969
The US-based United Fruit Company, for instance,
had acquired 42% of the land while paying

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.909
zero tax and duty.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.930
Things began to change in 1944 when the country’s
first democratically elected president, Juan

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.430
José Arévalo, took office.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.290
Introducing a series of progressive reforms–in
health care, social security, and the protection

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.289
of indigenous (Maya) rights–Arévalo was
for most a light at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.380
In 1951, the second democratically elected
president, Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán, continued

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.840
this progressive reformist agenda by reclaiming
land for the people.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.170
At this point, despite receiving compensation
for the land they had to give back, the United

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.799
Fruit Company went crying to President Eisenhower.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.130
And in response the US government (covertly)
went to war, arming and training paramilitary

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.979
thugs to overthrow the peaceful, democratically
elected government.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.159
Although Árbenz actually offered to meet
with the US president to discuss a peaceful

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.990
resolution, he looks to have been ignored.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.660
Ultimately, he was overthrown and replaced
with yet another American-controlled dictator.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.800
9.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.890
Compulsory sterilization

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.530
It’s a little-known fact that Sweden forcibly
sterilized Romani women as part of its ethnic

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.640
cleansing program.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280
But they didn’t stop there.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.530
From 1934 to 1976, female Swedes as young
as 15 were forcibly sterilized for having

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.000
“no obvious concept of ethics.”

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.730
Rebelliousness, promiscuity, “low intelligence,”
and mixed race heritage were all grounds for

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.730
sterilization.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.480
One young woman was sterilized simply because
she couldn’t read a blackboard and was therefore

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.010
assumed to be stupid.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.490
As it turned out, however, she only needed
glasses.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.460
Although Sweden may have had the most extensive
program of this type, neighboring Norway and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.890
Denmark had similar programs of their own,
sterilizing 40,000 and 6,000 women respectively.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.060
Canada and the United States were also into
eugenics; North Carolina alone sterilized

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.230
as many as 7,700 women before 1973—and most
of them were black.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.390
It wasn’t until 1999 that Sweden finally
began compensating some of its victims.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.160
Many, having
“internalized the establishment view of

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.970
themselves as useless,” had remained silent
for years.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.890
Yet the same politicians who publicly denounced
the program when it came to light continued

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.520
to support compulsory sterilization of transgender
women until as recently as 2013.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.660
8.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.730
1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.420
Barely 15 years after the US nuked Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, two nuclear bombs–each one

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.740
hundreds of times more powerful than those
dropped on Japan–were dropped on American

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.740
soil.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.740
Who was to blame?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.740
Who else?

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.360
The usual culprits when it comes to dropping
nukes on civilian targets: The US military

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360
itself.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.170
Apparently, the B-52 aircraft carrying them
had broken up mid-flight due to a right wing

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.990
failure and released the two Mark 39 bombs
into freefall over North Carolina.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.900
One of them landed with the aid of an emergency
parachute; the other hit the ground at terminal

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900
velocity.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.350
But the force of the crash had initiated the
fuzing sequence–a mechanical procedure usually

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.170
requiring human action–on both.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.990
Of the seven steps needed to detonate them,
the first bomb was down to the last.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.610
Specifically, the arm/safe switch was still
in the “safe” position.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.530
However, on the other bomb, the arm/safe switch
was in the “armed” position.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.140
By rights it should have exploded—killing
tens of thousands of people immediately—and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.030
nobody seems to know why it didn’t.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.410
Unnervingly, documents declassified in 2014
include a 1959 report from Sandia National

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.700
Laboratories stating that “absolute” safety
when transporting nuclear weapons is an illusion–a

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.160
necessary sacrifice for designing effective
nukes.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.600
The report also noted the likelihood that
accidental detonations like this one would

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.700
trigger a worldwide nuclear war.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.970
In other words, the United States would probably
have interpreted their own mistake as an enemy

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.010
attack and launched nuclear missiles on other
nations.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.010
7.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.010
Operation Northwoods

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.430
That the 9/11 terror attacks were evidently
planned by the US government is often mocked

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.370
by the establishment media for being unthinkably
absurd.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.510
However, this politically correct position
is essentially just one of faith–a rather

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.990
desperate assumption that Uncle Sam would
never plot to harm American citizens, no matter

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.170
how much he stood to gain.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.670
But it wouldn’t have been the first time.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.120
In 1959, when Fidel Castro came to power in
Cuba, tired of American corruption, he booted

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.870
out the oligarchs for good.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.660
In response, having lost their favorite brothel
and casino paradise, the US wanted revenge.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.840
Specifically, they wanted to invade; they
wanted some reason–any reason–to remove

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.590
Castro as head of state.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.590
(Sound familiar?)

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.860
But even the arrival of Soviet missiles on
the island could only be seen as a reasonably

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.920
justified response to America placing its
own missiles on the Soviets’ borders first.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.480
By 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had had
enough.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.200
If Cuba wasn’t going to do anything wrong,
then America would just have to frame them.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.060
Ideas actually committed to paper as part
of their proposal to the Secretary of Defense

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.740
included (in their own words):

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.610
“We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo
Bay and blame Cuba.”

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.220
“Exploding a few plastic bombs [in Florida
and Washington]”

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.130
“Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause
a helpful wave of national indignation.”

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.740
When he saw them, President John F. Kennedy
was reportedly appalled and rejected the plans

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.290
outright–which may have been among the reasons
for his assassination the following year.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.530
Meanwhile, Castro “got to thumb his nose
at the US for four more decades, a constant

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.420
reminder … of the limits of US power.”

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.420
6.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.420
The Nazino affair

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.380
In the spring of 1933, 3,000 prisoners (some
of whom had died en route) were dumped on

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.490
Siberia’s remote Nazino (or Nazinsky) Island–a
narrow, flood-prone strip of land in the frigid

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.490
river Ob.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.830
They were given next to nothing–no tools,
no shelter, and only a couple of handfuls

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.320
of rye flour each once every 4-5 days.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.340
This they tended to consume right away, either
dry as a powder or mixed with river water

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.340
in their hats.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.880
Needless to say, the malnourished prisoners
had little strength for anything, let alone

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.340
building a self-sufficient community from
scratch–the official reason for them being

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.340
there.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.960
Some became so sick and numb that they slept
too close to fires and burned to death in

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960
their sleep.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.940
But those who tried to escape were shot on
the spot by the guards.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.169
It wasn’t long before cannibalism took hold.

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.020
Women, in particular, appear to have been
targeted, many having been tied to trees so

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.020
the flesh could be stripped from their breasts,
calves, and other body parts.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.270
It was “just like shashlik [kebab meat],”
said one of the surviving cannibals; “we

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.250
made skewers from willow branches, cut [the
meat] into pieces … and roasted it over

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.250
the campfire.”

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.850
Tragically, many of these “settlers” had
been sent to the island for little more than

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.120
failing to produce identifying documents when
asked by the secret police.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.570
And despite this sadistic “social experiment”
being doomed from the start, officials continued

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.840
to supply thousands more “settlers” until
the project was exposed in the summer.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:38.540
By this time, of the 6,700 sent there, only
2,200 remained alive—and only 300 were fit

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.830
for further work.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.639
Based on the crusading, investigative reports
of local Communist Party head Vasily Velichko,

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.020
the island was evacuated within months.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.680
But it wasn’t until 1993 that Velichko’s
reports were finally declassified for the

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680
public.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.680
5.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680
Vietnam war crimes

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.210
The My Lai Massacre is one of the ugliest,
most unforgivable stains on the conscience

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.210
of the US Army.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:06.370
On March 16, 1968, American soldiers raped,
mutilated, and slaughtered more than 500 innocent

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.880
civilians, including 173 young children, in
a village in South Vietnam.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.050
Army officials tried to hide the war crime
from the public, but it was exposed the following

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.050
year.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.820
Before taking his story to the press, the
soldier who blew the whistle, Ron Ridenhour,

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.639
had attempted to raise the issue with President
Richard Nixon, the Pentagon, the State Department,

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:29.100
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several congressmen–all
to no avail.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.830
Crucially, the massacre was not committed
by rogue soldiers.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.149
They had actually been ordered to wipe out
the village–despite meeting with no resistance

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:38.979
and finding no military-age males therein.

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:43.360
Only one of the American soldiers was imprisoned,
but he was released three years later; his

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.100
commanding officer was never tried for the
crime.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.259
Thankfully, the massacre contributed to anti-war
sentiment not only among the American public

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:52.970
but among other US soldiers as well.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.360
However, it was far from the “isolated incident”
that officials claimed it to be.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.889
According to an archive of more than 9,000
declassified documents, hundreds of similar

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:05.670
attacks took place–again on orders from
above (such as “kill anything that moves”).

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.610
Slaughters of ordinary Vietnamese families
were commonplace and included the rape and

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.680
torture of men, women, and children.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.740
Very few of those responsible were court-martialed
or convicted, but not for a lack of evidence.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.100
And those who were sent to prison were generally
acquitted before serving their full sentence.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.899
An interrogator who sexually assaulted a 13-year-old
girl, for instance, served just six months

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.069
of his 20-year jail term.

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.839
But the cover-up continues.

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:34.639
After The LA Times reported on the archive
in 2006, the government reclassified and closed

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.639
it to the public.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.649
It’s not entirely clear why.

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:41.110
But perhaps it’s because such war crimes
continue to this day (including the rape and

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:46.550
murder of a 14-year-old girl by American soldiers
in Baghdad before she, her 5-year-old sister,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:52.130
and the rest of her family were shot to death),
exposing something twisted and dark at the

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.610
very heart of US foreign policy.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.610
4.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.879
Human radiation experiments

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:02.600
Between 1944 and 1974, the Atomic Energy Commission,
Department of Defense, National Institutes

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.360
of Health, and other government agencies deliberately
exposed millions of US citizens to nuclear

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.829
fallout and other dangerous radiation without
their informed consent.

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:16.660
The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate
the risk faced by nuclear scientists working

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.250
on the Manhattan Project.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.490
Naturally, they were shrouded in secrecy–often
to the point where those administering the

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.149
radiation to subjects were not even aware
they were doing so.

00:10:26.149 --> 00:10:30.930
When Eileen Welsome, a journalist for The
Albuquerque Tribune broke the story in late

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.170
1993, it caused public outcry and forced the
Clinton administration to release 1.6 million

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.730
classified documents pertaining to the tests.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.490
The details were extremely disturbing:

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.449
In Tennessee after the Second World War, hundreds
of pregnant women were fed radioactive iron,

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:51.259
resulting in the early deaths of their children
from conditions such as synovial sarcoma and

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.379
acute lymphatic leukemia.

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:58.119
In Massachusetts, MIT scientists fed radioactive
iron and calcium to students with learning

00:10:58.119 --> 00:10:59.119
disabilities.

00:10:59.119 --> 00:11:03.410
In New York, terminally ill patients were
fed radioactive calcium and strontium.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:08.439
Highly regarded hospitals throughout the country
injected patients with plutonium during otherwise

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:09.749
routine check-ups.

00:11:09.749 --> 00:11:12.629
Orphanages gave radioactive material to children.

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:17.259
And the corpses of the victims were secretly
snatched from cemeteries for testing.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:22.319
Most subjects were disadvantaged in some way,
whether that meant physically or socioeconomically.

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:27.730
It was, for example, common to prey on the
elderly and sick, as well as prison inmates

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.879
(although many of those deemed terminally
ill had in fact been misdiagnosed).

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:33.779
However, some weren’t even American citizens.

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:38.670
One subject, codenamed CAL-2, was a four-year-old
Australian boy flown in to UC San Francisco

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.339
to receive “special treatment” for bone
cancer, only to be injected with plutonium

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.149
that killed him eight months later.

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:49.129
Whatever justification might be offered for
these tests–such as the stresses of the

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:52.860
Cold War era, or the ends (scientific knowledge)
justifying the means–they were in clear

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.779
violation of the 1949 Nuremberg Code.

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:58.449
This set of research ethics principles had
been laid out to ensure that no-one ever repeated

00:11:58.449 --> 00:12:02.289
the atrocities of Nazi “doctors of death”
like Josef Mengele and Aribert Heim.

00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:06.439
If their scientific contributions failed to
justify the means, there’s absolutely no

00:12:06.439 --> 00:12:13.300
reason (besides American exceptionalism) to
forgive the US its directly comparable crimes.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.300
3.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.430
Operation Sea-Spray

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.870
In addition to dropping nukes on, irradiating,
compulsively lying to, and terrorizing their

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.269
own citizens, the United States government
has also–repeatedly–used germ warfare

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:25.269
against them.

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:30.989
From September 26, 1950, a US Navy minesweeper
ship spent just under a week spraying Serratia

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:35.610
marcescens—a bacteria with a bright red,
easily detectable pigment—into the air two

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.129
miles off the coast of Northern California.

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:42.429
The aim was to simulate and measure the effects
of a bioweapons attack, and in particular

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:45.800
the susceptibility of big cities like San
Francisco.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.629
After the bacteria had been sprayed, the military
covertly collected samples at 43 sites to

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:51.629
track its spread.

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:56.160
And they found that most, if not all, of the
city’s 800,000 residents had been infected.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.230
And the virus had also made its way out to
the suburbs.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.150
Naturally, the military hadn’t bothered
to ascertain the safety of S. marcescens before

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.949
using it so indiscriminately.

00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:08.629
Although the scientific literature hadn’t
linked the bacteria to disease, neither had

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:11.040
it conclusively found it to be harmless.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.470
One week after the test, 11 San Franciscans
were hospitalized with urinary tract infections,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.279
and one man actually died.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:21.940
Furthermore, the test apparently left a permanent
scar on the region’s microbial ecology.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.379
And since the military didn’t own up to
their blunder, civilian scientists wasted

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:29.430
a great deal of time trying to figure out
the cause of the outbreak—the first of its

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.279
kind on record.

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:36.029
Even so, it wasn’t until 1969 that President
Nixon finally brought a halt to such testing

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:40.199
(although Operation Sea-Spray wasn’t declassified
until 1976).

00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:44.250
In the intervening years, the military conducted
hundreds of similar tests in cities across

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.250
the country.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.670
They sprayed bacteria and chemicals from trucks
in Minneapolis, from airplanes over the Midwest,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.959
and released germs into the New York City
subway system—exposing millions to potentially

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:55.860
deadly viruses without their permission or
even their knowledge.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.579
As The New York Times has noted, such tests
weren’t even scientifically justified; the

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:00.999
results were blatantly obvious.

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:05.060
And, since the Army didn’t monitor its victims
long-term, it’s unclear whether anyone else

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.060
was harmed.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.420
Interestingly, the British did the same to
their own citizens—not only with S. marcescens,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:18.499
but with other bacteria to simulate anthrax—leading
to birth defects and miscarriages throughout

00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:19.499
the UK.

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:20.499
2.

00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:21.529
Stargate Project

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:26.100
Stargate was one of a number of projects set
up to investigate whether psychics could be

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.389
used by the military.

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:32.540
Evidently, the CIA, DIA, and other government
agencies took telekinesis, telepathy, and

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.610
especially clairvoyance or “remote viewing”
seriously enough to continue funding the research

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.910
for at least 23 years (1972-1995).

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.139
By the (official) end of the project, the
CIA concluded that psychics had no military

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:50.549
value; but that didn’t mean their powers
had been debunked—far from it.

00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:54.879
All it meant was that psychic abilities were
too unconventional for use in military or

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:56.380
intelligence operations.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.429
In fact, the research strongly supported the
reality of psychic phenomena and convinced

00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:02.199
many of the researchers involved.

00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:07.209
From describing hidden objects in detail and
the interiors of enemy bases to spying through

00:15:07.209 --> 00:15:11.699
space and time, remote viewers’ observations
were often surprisingly accurate.

00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:17.009
Two psychics even detailed the appearance
of Jupiter, independently describing the same

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:22.670
thick, rolling gas clouds and “tremendous
winds” all before Pioneer 10’s 1973 fly-by

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.389
returned the first ever close-ups of the planet.

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:29.819
Such accuracy makes some of the psychics’
other, at-present unverifiable observations

00:15:29.819 --> 00:15:30.850
all the more compelling.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.579
In 1984, for instance, one of the psychics—Joe
McMoneagle—described the surface of Mars

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:36.899
circa 1,000,000 BC.

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:41.480
Among his observations were vast pyramids
and other structures at a time of geological

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.649
upheaval—severe dust storms, climate change,
and the extinction of organized life.

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:49.709
At first, he saw only the “shadow” or
vague perception of beings that had ceased

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:50.739
to exist.

00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:54.949
As he regressed to an earlier time, however,
he saw the beings solidify; they were tall,

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:58.139
thin, and dressed in light, close-fitting,
silk-like garments.

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:02.359
The researcher instructing McMoneagle also
gave him a series of oddly precise coordinates

00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:07.160
to investigate and wrote down what he saw
at each: warren-like caverns; an enormous

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.769
obelisk; reflective squares; channels cut
into valleys; and shelters for hibernation.

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:15.509
McMongeagle was also instructed to approach
one of the beings and ask them what was going

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:16.509
on.

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:19.069
“They’re ancient people,” he related,
“They’re … dying … they’re looking

00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:21.560
for … a way to survive and they just can’t.”

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.379
According to the being he spoke to (who considered
McMoneagle’s astral form to be a hallucination),

00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:29.709
they were waiting for the return of some kind
of scout ship sent to find another habitable

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:31.059
planet to move to.

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:35.239
When McMoneagle turned his attention to where
that scout ship had actually gone, he described

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:39.309
a “really crazy place with volcanos and
gas pockets and strange plants.”

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:44.790
Of course, it’s easy to dismiss such an
unverifiable account as mere fantasy—or

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.809
it would be were it not for one important
detail: McMoneagle wasn’t told to go to

00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:49.809
Mars.

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:51.489
The target and time period (“The planet
Mars.

00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:56.119
Time of interest approximately 1 million years
B.C.”) were written on a small card in a

00:16:56.119 --> 00:17:00.149
sealed envelope that remained unopened until
after the session was complete.

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:04.110
McMoneagle later told a journalist that he
thought he’d been looking at Earth and was

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.299
deeply confused about what he was seeing.

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:10.799
In fact, had he known the actual target beforehand,
he probably would have refused to view it—just

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:14.089
as he had done when asked to mentally examine
a UFO.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:19.290
Apparently, he deemed such unverifiable targets
useless for the purposes of the Stargate Project.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.039
As for the precise coordinates, and the interest
in prehistoric Mars in the first place, they

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:25.139
had come from an unnamed official in the Army.

00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:29.480
The session had been especially requested
by this individual and sprung upon McMoneagle

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.150
while he was napping in the “black box”
containment room at Virginia’s Monroe Institute.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.150
1.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.420
Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program
(AATIP)

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.760
For many, the holy grail of declassified secrets
would be the disclosure of extraterrestrial

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.760
life.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.380
Hence a lot of people were excited when, in
July this year, the British government finally

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.370
released the (alleged) last of its files on
UFOs.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.870
Unfortunately, there was no proof of aliens—but
the reports do show how seriously these unidentified

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.340
aerial phenomena were taken.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.049
In fact, the UK operated two dedicated desks
for decades—one to receive calls from the

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:04.809
public, and the other to investigate sightings.

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:05.809
They were both (officially) closed in 2000,
despite there being no let-up in convincing

00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:06.809
reports from the region—such as this one
from just last month.

00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:07.990
The US government, meanwhile, apparently continues
to investigate.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.980
As it turns out, they have been secretly funding
the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.720
Identification Program to the tune of $22
million a year—despite having officially

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.440
claimed to have shut the project down in 2012.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.139
And Luis Elizondo, the official in charge
of the department, found the evidence so compelling

00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:28.360
that he became frustrated with the government
for not allocating more resources to its study.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.429
Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,
who helped to set up the program, agreed—even

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:36.490
going so far as to request heightened security
to protect what he considered extraordinary

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.490
discoveries.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:42.330
These have included strange metal alloys and
other materials recovered from UFOs (and stored

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.590
at Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas).

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.850
Researchers studying these items claim to
have experienced certain “physical effects”

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:48.990
from their encounters.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.309
One likened their bewildered approach to the
materials to “what would happen if you gave

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:56.760
Leonardo da Vinci a garage-door opener … He
wouldn’t know anything about the electromagnetic

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.990
signals involved or its function.”

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.490
Another official declared that “what was
considered science fiction is now science

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.490
fact.”

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.500
And, alarmingly for some perhaps, he went
on to admit that the United States is completely

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:24.710
incapable of defending itself against some
of the technologies found.
