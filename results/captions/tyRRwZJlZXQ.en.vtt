00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.340
For most writers, there’s a feeling of catharsis
that accompanies having a book published.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.500
You had something to say, and now it’s out
there for the world to view.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.150
It may become a bestseller or it might move
five copies, all to your mom, but either way,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.530
you created something meaningful.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.840
Your high school classmates were wrong about
you, just like you always knew!

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.610
But sometimes that euphoric feeling doesn’t
last.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.830
Sometimes it turns to downright loathing.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.980
Here are 10 writers who hated, hid, or simply
pretended books they wrote didn’t exist.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.050
10) Ian Fleming, The Spy Who Loved Me

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.210
1961-62 was a good time to be Ian Fleming.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.280
His James Bond novels were consistent bestsellers;
production had begun on the first Bond film,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
Dr. No.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.920
Despite all this, Fleming wasn’t happy after
learning his adult thrillers were increasingly

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.379
being read by schoolchildren who idolized
James Bond.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.260
So he resolved to write a book showing his
famous spy from “the other end of the gun

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.880
barrel,” sort of a cautionary tale about
a civilian who gets caught up in Bond’s

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.880
world.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.950
The result was The Spy Who Loved Me, told
from the perspective of ordinary woman Vivienne

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.500
Michel, who chronicles such espionage staples
as losing her virginity in a movie theater,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.320
becoming a secretary, aborting her boss’s
child, and managing a failing motel until

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.030
mobsters try to torch it (and her) for the
insurance money.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.909
Bond himself doesn’t appear until two-thirds
of the way into the book to dispatch the thugs,

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.520
seduce Vivienne, and leave before the final
chapter.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.240
Whatever Fleming was going for, it didn’t
work — critics panned the new Bond novel,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.880
in spite of such ultra-progressive dialogue
as “All women love semi-rape.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.200
They love to be taken.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.030
It was his sweet brutality against my bruised
body that had made his act of love so piercingly

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.329
beautiful.”

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.170
Reviews were not so piercingly beautiful,
and Fleming, stung, declared the experiment

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.469
a failure and requested that no paperback
version or hardcover reprints be issued.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.229
The next novel proceeds as if TSWLM never
happened, and Fleming would only allow the

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.170
title to be used for a movie if it had nothing
to do with the book’s plot.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.221
For all that, it did give us one lasting contribution
to the Bond canon: Horror, a gangster with

00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:17.170
steel-capped teeth who inspired the infamous
film henchman Jaws.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.690
9) Stephen King (as Richard Bachman), Rage

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.500
It’s easy to make fun of Stephen King these
days for the sheer volume of his body of work

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
and some of the more, well, hokey concepts.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.910
(Killer trucks?

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.400
Really, Stephen?)

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.860
But it’s also easy to forget how many of
his books, especially the early ones, were

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.600
genuinely terrifying; and in one instance,
tragically prescient.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.970
The first novel King ever wrote, Rage tells
the story of a high schooler who brings a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.370
gun to school, kills two teachers, and holds
his class hostage, only for them to begin

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.880
empathizing with him in a creepy Tyler Durden-esque
fashion.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.280
The reason for the book’s censorship is
unfortunately obvious — after the spate

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.150
of school shootings in recent years, a novel
told from the perspective of the killer is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.530
not something King wants serving as possible
inspiration.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.670
At least one real-life shooter was reported
to have had a copy of Rage in his locker,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.900
so King and his publishers jointly agreed
not to publish any future editions.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.230
Considering he wrote the story when he was
still in college, he’s probably just lucky

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.890
he didn’t get flagged as a potential risk
case himself by school administrators.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.500
8) Martin Amis, Invasion of the Space Invaders

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.060
If you’ve never heard of Martin Amis, don’t
feel bad: it just means you’re an uncultured

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.380
semi-illiterate, at least according to The
Times, who rated him as #19 on their list

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.440
of The 50 Greatest British Authors Since 1945.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.850
(His father Kingsley Amis was #9, meaning
the old guy can literally claim to be twice

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.750
the author his son is.)

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.730
These days Martin writes serious books and
gets into pissing matches with other authors

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.720
about things like radical Islamism.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.650
Which is probably why he’s not eager to
claim credit for 1982’s Invasion of the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.680
Space Invaders: An Addict’s Guide to Battle
Tactics, Big Scores and the Best Machines.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.540
It’s exactly what it sounds like, a guide
to early video games that Amis is extremely

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.590
reluctant to discuss or even acknowledge writing.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.650
Hard to imagine, since it boasts an introduction
by Steven Spielberg and is filled with fantastic

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.600
bon mots like: “Do I take risks in order
to gobble up the fruit symbol in the middle

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600
of the screen?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.690
I do not, and neither should you.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.811
Like the fat and harmless saucer in Missile
Command (q.v.), the fruit symbol is there

00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:26.050
simply to tempt you into hubristic sorties.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.050
Bag it.”

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.060
And: “PacMan player, be not proud, nor too
macho, and you will prosper on the dotted

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.060
screen.”

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.880
A reporter once suggested to Amis, possibly
in jest, that it was one of the best things

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.880
he’d ever written, then noted “The expression
on his face, with perhaps more pity in it

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.410
than contempt, remains with me uncomfortably.”

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.570
7) Don DeLillo, Amazons

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.760
Don DeLillo is a renowned author and playwright,
part of the Postmodern literature movement

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
in the U.S.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.980
In recent years, noted critic and pretentious
guy Harold Bloom described him as one of only

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.360
four living American novelists who are still
writing and deserve our praise.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.630
Be that as it may, the one book of DeLillo’s
that you would probably enjoy the most is

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.910
the only one you won’t find on his official
list of published works.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.860
That would be Amazons, which DeLillo co-wrote
in 1980 after a string of six well-reviewed

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.030
but financially disappointing novels.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.570
A humorous faux autobiography, Amazons tells
the story of Cleo Birdwell, the first woman

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.890
to play hockey in the NHL, which apparently
largely consists of sleeping with your coaches

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.000
and teammates.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.910
By all accounts it’s actually pretty funny,
but DeLillo has never publicly acknowledged

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.610
writing the book and specifically asked to
have it left off his official bibliography.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.070
Which is a shame, because if more award-winning
geniuses took occasional breaks from their

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.590
serious works to do something funny and low-brow,
the other 99% of us would probably pay more

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.210
attention to the rest of their stuff.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.880
6) Dante Gabriel Rossetti, most of his poetry

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.890
As the name implies, Dante Gabriel Rossetti
was born into an artistic lifestyle — his

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.250
uncle created the modern vampire story, his
siblings all became writers, and his wife

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.350
Elizabeth Siddal was a prominent artist’s
model, posing for Ophelia and other works.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.500
Dante himself founded a prominent artistic
movement, but between painting and writing

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.830
poetry, also found time to sleep with plenty
of women.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.210
Surprisingly Elizabeth was not down with this
(chicks, right?), and her husband’s infidelities

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.590
contributed to her depression and possibly
intentional laudanum overdose.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.430
Rossetti was devastated, but his response
was juuuust a bit extreme: he slipped a notebook

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.430
full of poems he had been readying for publication
into Siddal’s hair in her coffin, then had

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.660
it buried with her.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.840
Which is creepy but slightly romantic, if
you squint hard enough.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.990
Except unlike some of the others on this list,
Rossetti eventually changed his mind; and

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.620
if you think you know where this is going,
congratulations on being right!

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.480
Yes, several years later he had Siddal exhumed
to recover the notebook.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.290
While worms had eaten through parts of the
pages (you only wish we were kidding), the

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.330
poems were eventually published, albeit not
to any great critical acclaim.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.580
Meanwhile, Rossetti reportedly felt wretchedly
guilty over violating his wife’s grave for

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.240
the rest of his life.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.470
As one does.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.780
5) Herge, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.300
When it comes to a Tintin book kept under
wraps, everyone thinks of the same thing:

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.430
Tintin in the Congo, where everyone’s favorite
Belgian reporter engages in casual racism

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.550
and slaughters half the animals in Africa.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.840
But as uncomfortable as that volume is to
modern eyes, writer/artist Herge had no problem

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.820
with updating and reissuing it years later
alongside his newer Tintin books.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.730
In fact, there’s only one of his early works
that he refused to redraw to match his later

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:37.380
style: the very first Tintin story of all…
in the Land of the Soviets.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.590
But why?

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.790
Mainly because the first couple of Tintin
stories were forced on Herge by his editor,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.419
an ultraconservative priest who wanted to
educate kids about things like the evils of

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:48.419
communism.

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.880
And by “educate” we mean “make up a
bunch of stuff” — Herge took everything

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.850
he knew about Russia from one sensationalistic
book aimed at criticizing the communist regime.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.170
Due to some of the extreme examples depicted
— things like fake factories designed to

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.650
trick people into thinking industry was strong,
and elections held at gunpoint — Herge would

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.010
later call the story “a transgression of
my youth.”

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.940
(Ironically, historians would later note that
his depictions were pretty accurate to how

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.230
terrible living conditions in Russia actually
were at the time.)

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.680
Regardless, Herge kept Tintin in the Land
of the Soviets off shelves for years, only

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.120
relenting when bootleg copies began flooding
the market, because you might as well get

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.120
paid, right?

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.300
Even then, he would only allow the original,
crude black and white strip to be reprinted,

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.460
without any colorization or updating.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.360
Although we’ll be mighty disappointed if
some fanboy isn’t working on that even as

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360
we speak.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.909
4) Nikolai Gogol, Dead Souls II and III

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.590
These days a guy named Nikolai Gogol could
only be a Russian mobster or a video game

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:52.460
boss (and really, “Dead Souls” sounds
exactly like a first-person shooter), but

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.490
150 years ago it was also an acceptable writer’s
name.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.710
In fact, Gogol was one of Russia’s most
influential authors, going on to inspire the

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.640
only two other Russian writers you’ve ever
heard of, Nabokov and Dostoyevsky.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.000
He was already famous when he penned his masterpiece
Dead Souls, a modern updating of Dante’s

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Divine Comedy.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.100
Despite being hailed as his greatest work,
Gogol saw it as “a pale introduction to

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.920
the great epic poem which is taking shape
in my mind and will finally solve the riddle

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.020
of my existence.”

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.360
He intended to write a complete trilogy that
would prompt social reform and actually save

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.570
Russia from itself, because writers like melodrama.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.910
So what happened?

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.760
Zealotry, plain and simple.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.700
While working on the sequel, Gogol came under
the sway of Matvey Konstantinovsky, a fanatical

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.660
priest who convinced him that his creative
work was an abomination to the Lord.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.460
Thus, on the evening of February 24, 1852,
Gogol burned the nearly complete manuscript

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.820
of Dead Souls II and any notes he’d made
for the third volume; only a few scraps escaped

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.820
the flames.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.589
He then immediately ceased eating and died
nine days later, proving that you don’t

00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:59.891
have to be mentally unbalanced to destroy
your life’s work, but it helps.

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.910
3) Mark Twain, 1601

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.050
You may be wondering what Mark Twain, a man
known for holding absolutely nothing sacred,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.600
could possibly have written that he would
want to bury.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.510
A story about incest?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.420
A cookbook for human flesh?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:18.190
The reality is almost disappointing: a bunch
of fart and sex jokes.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.860
1601: Conversation, as it was by the Social
Fireside, in the Time of the Tudors is a pastiche

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:28.140
Twain wrote to try his hand at archaic writing
and to skewer those who believed the Elizabethan

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.870
era to have been a time of strict propriety.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.760
It chronicles a fictional fireside chat between
Queen Elizabeth, several noblewomen, Shakespeare,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.520
Sir Walter Raleigh, and others.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.160
To give you an idea of what we’re dealing
with, here’s a sample line: “In ye heat

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.870
of ye talk it befel yt one did breake wind,
yielding an exceding mightie and distresfull

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.741
stink, whereat all did laugh full sore.”

00:10:51.741 --> 00:10:58.130
Okay, so not his most mature story, but why
publish it anonymously and wait 26 years before

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.339
acknowledging authorship?

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:03.880
At one point Twain was apparently proud of
1601, writing to a friend “…for between

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.320
you and me the thing was dreadfully funny.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.920
I don’t often write anything that I laugh
at myself, but I can hardly think of that

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.290
thing without laughing.”

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.910
(Of course, years later he would say “if
there is a decent word findable in it, it

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.180
is because I overlooked it,” so take your
pick.)

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.180
Written in between his two best-known works,
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, it’s likely

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.470
Twain didn’t want potential bad press over
a relatively minor story to cast a negative

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.790
light on his recent and upcoming masterpieces.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.420
Probably smart, since 1601 was considered
unprintable by mainstream publishers from

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.970
1880 all the way until the early 1960s, when
Elizabethans making jokes about pubic hair

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.250
became more socially acceptable.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.450
2) William Powell, The Anarchist Cookbook

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.080
If you fall anywhere on the spectrum between
“a little wild in my youth” to “currently

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.290
stockpiling munitions in my private bunker,”
you’re familiar with the 1970 book The Anarchist

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:03.000
Cookbook, a veritable how-to guide on everything
from mixing explosives to concealing drugs.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.610
Though many of the explosives recipes were
later found to be inaccurate (some dangerously

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:13.209
so), it maintains a cult appeal and continues
to sell well to this day… much to the chagrin

00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:14.870
of its author, William Powell.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.030
You see, Powell wrote the book at age 19,
angry at the prospect of being drafted to

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.980
fight in Vietnam and looking to lash out at
The Man.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.250
And just as no one has ever looked back at
their teenage self and thought “I was a

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.029
clear, rational person whose actions still
make sense to me today,” Powell — now

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:35.310
a father and a teacher — would like nothing
more than for his infamous book to go away

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.310
forever.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.990
As he writes in the Amazon.com review where
he begs people not to buy it, “The central

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.420
idea to the book was that violence is an acceptable
means to bring about political change.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.730
I no longer agree with this.”

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.620
Unfortunately for Powell, he doesn’t own
the rights, so the most he can do is give

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.520
interviews and raise awareness about that
thing he wants everyone to forget.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.510
And you thought you felt bad about all those
mailboxes you smashed.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.330
1) Franz Kafka, everything he ever wrote

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.910
If you ever lamented having to read The Metamorphosis
in high school, bite your tongue — it could’ve

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.630
been much, much worse.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.390
Kafka, considered one of the greatest writers
of the 20th century, was ruthlessly self-critical

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.980
and is estimated to have burned an unbelievable
ninety percent of everything he ever wrote.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.490
Not content with making future scholars weep,
on his deathbed Kafka asked his friend Max

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.780
Brod to destroy all of his remaining writings.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.399
Thankfully, Brod interpreted this as “do
the exact opposite of what I just asked,”

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:34.209
publishing several of his friend’s books
in the ensuing decade and even smuggling a

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:38.190
briefcase full of Kafka’s papers on the
last train out of Prague before the Nazis

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.959
closed the border.

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:43.170
Amazingly, that’s not even the end of the
story, as the remaining writings and sketches

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.830
passed on to Brod’s secretary and in turn
to her daughters, who are currently embroiled

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.980
in a lawsuit with the Nation of Israel.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.910
You know, over ownership of 100-year-old papers
that were supposed to be incinerated in the

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.910
first place.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.010
Meanwhile, Kafka’s lover kept another 20
of his notebooks safe until they were seized

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.399
by the Gestapo in 1933.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:05.510
There’s an ongoing volunteer project dedicated
to searching WW2-era documents to try to find

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.230
the notebooks if they still exist.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.160
Which just goes to show one thing: if you
really want your work destroyed, toss it in

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:24.790
the flames yourself.
