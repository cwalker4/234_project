00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.260
The future of humanity
is in the stars.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.580
If we wanted it badly
enough, interstellar travel

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.960
could be achievable
in our lifetime.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.195
So what would it take
to build a starship?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.680
Why don't we see evidence
of galactic empires?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.360
Is our galaxy littered
with the remains

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.250
of single planet civilizations
as Elon Musk has asked?

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.280
Is it really so difficult to
colonize other star systems?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.340
Recently, there's been
some pretty wild talk

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.360
of some crazy ideas for
space travel technologies.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.470
We have the non-momentum
conserving Em-Drive,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.710
the Wormhole from Interstellar,
and the Alcubierre Warp Drive.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.150
That last one is extra cool
and yeah, we'll get to it.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.420
But let me be clear.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.210
Humanity's first
adventure to the stars

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.420
won't and shouldn't wait
for far-off fantastical

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.370
technologies.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.980
Our first starship
would use technologies

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.940
achievable in our lifetimes.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.604
I'm being optimistic
but not unrealistic.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:03.270
Now building a starship
is going to take

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.540
a huge amount of political
cooperation, money,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.244
and single-minded focus.

00:01:07.244 --> 00:01:09.160
Hell, this thing is so
big we're going to have

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.280
to assemble it in space.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.080
So for argument's
sake, let's say

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.240
humanity's future is
at stake, and we just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.230
discovered Earth 2.0 in
the Alpha Centauri system.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.270
It's only 4.4 light
years away, but we

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.260
have to get there before the
Curbles and the impending K1

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.570
asteroid that's on its way.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.220
So we have to focus on one
design, our best chance.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.440
What do we build?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.060
The key is finding
the right balance

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.440
between speed of the starship
and the amount of time

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.120
it would take us to develop
the tech to build it.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.550
No point in launching
a slow ship in 20 years

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.210
if the ship we launch in
50 years overtakes it.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.170
This balance is
factored into something

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.670
we call the Wait Calculation,
and we want to get this right.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.020
First, option one.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.310
Traditional rocket fuel.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.660
This is a non-starter, but
just to give you an idea,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.360
the fastest manned vehicle
ever was the Apollo 10 rocket,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.220
which reached a speed of nearly
25,000 miles per hour, which

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.437
would get you to Alpha Cen
in nearly 120,000 years.

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:07.570
Uh, no.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.600
Propellant is the big limiting
challenge with space travel.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.280
Conservation of momentum sucks.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.020
To learn more, there's some
very serious rocket science

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.410
in this episode about farts.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.910
The rocket equation tells
us that maximum speed

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.280
is based on exhaust velocity,
fuel mass, and spacecraft mass.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.380
If you want to get to Alpha
Cen in a human lifetime,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.960
you need to get to 10%
the speed of light.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.160
And to do that with
any liquid rocket fuel,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.370
you'd need a fuel tank larger
than the observable universe.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.370
Not too efficient.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.850
But there are two ways to
achieve high velocities,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.780
propel a lot of mass
backwards or propel less

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.970
mass at much higher speeds.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.800
So, yeah.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.230
Let's do the second one.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.660
We just want the fuel with
maximum energy density.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.190
So direct conversion of
rest mass into energy

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.510
seems like the way to go.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.890
Remember E equals MC squared.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.410
The sun does this pretty
well, so let's build an engine

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.140
that works like a mini star.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.940
I'm talking option two, fusion.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.200
In fact why not choose
the most middle option

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.840
and just explode nukes
behind our starship and surf

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.930
the blasts.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.120
This was a real option
considered for the Orion

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.250
project by Freeman
Dyson and others

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.740
in the late '50s and '60s.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.560
We're going to assume
modern thermonuclear devices

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.510
and launch with roughly 3/4 of
our starship's mass being taken

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.070
up by 300,000 1 megaton hydrogen
bombs, blast them behind us

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.830
one by one over about a
month, and we accelerate at 1G

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.320
to around 10% of
the speed of light.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.210
Nice.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.860
We get to Alpha Cen
in 44 years, assuming

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.230
we don't need to slow
down at the other end.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.240
Actually, slowing
down is a huge issue.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.420
We need to use half of
our fuel to slow down

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.250
at the other end,
which unfortunately

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.080
means we half our speed.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.740
So let's make that 90
years for a one-way trip.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.800
This means we'd need three
generations of humans on board

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.210
that ship and pray that
space babies turn out OK.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.750
Still, this tech is
perhaps the most achievable

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.010
in the shortest time.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.200
We already know
how to build bombs.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.850
Yay, cold war!

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.210
Although the 1963 test ban
treaty says no space nukes,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.830
maybe we can make an exception
for the future of humanity.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.760
There are also some
pretty awesome options

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.149
to running contained
thermonuclear reactions

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.510
on board.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.120
Fusion rockets,
either pulse blasts

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.140
like the Daedalus project
or ongoing fusion.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.180
You could push to a bit higher
than .1C this way but probably

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.830
not a lot higher.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.280
It's an awesome option
and may actually happen,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.470
but the tech for contained
fusion is only now emerging,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.630
and there are many
difficult challenges.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.940
It's rocket science and nuclear
physics, so you know, hard.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.280
But fusion turns less than
1% of rest mass into energy.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.730
What if we could
get close to 100%?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.700
Well, that's the idea behind
option three, antimatter

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700
drives.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.000
When matter meets it's
antimatter counterpart,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.470
both particles are
annihilated, liberating most

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.510
of the rest mass as energy.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.910
This is an extremely
efficient fuel.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.930
For example, it would only take
around 10 grams of antimatter

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.740
to fly us to Mars in a month.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.920
The big obstacle here is
that harvesting and storing

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.240
antimatter is
incredibly difficult.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.540
We can make in
particle accelerators

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.827
but it's slow and
hellishly expensive.

00:05:13.827 --> 00:05:15.910
We've only been able to
do this with small numbers

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.670
of antiprotons at a
time, not the kilograms

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.340
we'd need to get to the stars.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.570
Assuming we can scale up
production of antiprotons

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.770
by a factor of say 100
trillion, trillion,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.320
then pion rockets
may be a possibility.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.740
Annihilate a proton
and an antiproton,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.100
and you get charged pions
moving at near light speed.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.730
Channeled with magnetic fields,
these pions provide our thrust.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.580
That's something like
50 times more energy

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.830
per kilogram of fuel than
the best fusion options.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.640
Low fuel weight
means our max speed

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.900
is limited only by how much
antimatter we can make.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.480
0.5C is plausible, meaning a
trip to Alpha Cen would take

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.490
nine years.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.200
It may even be possible to
push 0.8C, which would be nice,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.980
because then time dilation
really kicks in, bringing

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.370
travel time down
to 3.3 years from

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.860
the astronaut's perspective.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.510
OK, rockets a cool and all.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.860
But what if we didn't have to
carry any propellant at all?

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.970
What if we could
sail to the stars

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.120
on a wind made of
light, the light sail?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.060
I'm talking about a kilometer
wide sapphire coated sail,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.660
riding the beam of a gigantic
space laser blasting the power

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.330
equivalent of 100
nuclear plants.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.170
What the hell, let's do that.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.350
OK, most of the interstellar
thinking for light sails

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.560
has been about unmanned probes.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.790
10% light speed is
pretty reasonable

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.040
with modern materials
like a carbon web

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.570
sail driven by a
microwave beam running

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.680
on a single nuclear power plant.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.260
This is an update to Robert
Forward's Star Wisp spacecraft,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.780
but it should be scalable.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.289
If we want to take
actual humans,

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.080
we're going to need to
a bigger boat, which

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.530
means a proper visible light
laser and a larger sail, coated

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.370
with advanced, reflective
and heat resistant materials

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.670
like sapphire.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.640
This laser is going to have
to be ridiculously large,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.840
possibly built on the moon and
powered by massive Helium 3

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.990
reactors or in
orbit around the sun

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.580
powered by vast solar panels.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.170
How fast does this thing go?

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.300
Because we aren't
carrying any fuel,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.245
maximum speed is only limited
by the power and collamation

00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:15.069
of our laser and the
size of our sail.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.860
The longer the effective
range of the beam,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.790
the higher the
speed we can reach.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.360
10% light speed or
higher should be doable.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.260
These tech issues
need to be factored

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.070
into the Wait Calculation.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.980
And besides these, slowing
down at the other end

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.580
is a major problem.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.300
There are possibilities
for breaking

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.630
in the stellar wind of
our destination star,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.200
although that is tricky.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.670
Ultimately, though, the
scalability of the light sail

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.720
means that speeds even
greater than .1C are possible.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.050
OK most awesome option for last,
the Blackhole Drive, in fact,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.240
a Schwarzschild Kugelblitz.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.910
This is an engine powered
by an artificial black hole

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.940
and is one of the fastest
options for subluminal travel.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.150
This is a black hole made
not from mass but from light.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.550
A sufficient energy
density of laser light

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.510
focused in a small
enough region would

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.480
bend the fabric of
space time enough

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.510
to produce a singularity,
the Kugelblitz,

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.390
German for ball lightning.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.300
A black hole of the
right size radiates

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.420
Hawking radiation like crazy.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.455
The smaller the black
hole, the more radiation,

00:08:13.455 --> 00:08:16.020
and this radiation could
drive our starship.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.980
The sweet spot is a black hole
of around 600 billion kilograms

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.130
or two Empire State
buildings, which

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.790
would be roughly the
size of a single proton.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.030
Such a black hole would
radiate nearly 160 petawatts,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.260
which is roughly the
equivalent of 10,000 times

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.900
the world power consumption.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.990
And it would evaporate in
around 3 and 1/2 years.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.470
Any smaller and it
evaporates too quickly.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.650
Larger and it
radiates too weakly

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.320
and becomes too massive
to feasibly accelerate

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.230
the ship and the black hole.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.510
Assuming we can catch
most of the radiation,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.010
this amount of power
accelerates us to .1C in 20 days

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.020
and presumably to a significant
fraction of the speed of light

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.507
in the lifespan
of the black hole.

00:08:55.507 --> 00:08:57.590
There's no question that
it ultimately goes faster

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.710
than the other options.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.030
It's also clearly the coolest
of all the subluminal engines.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.210
I mean, even the
Romulans use it.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.990
The only drawback is that the
lasers creating the black hole

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.210
would need to be vastly
more powerful than even

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.020
the black hole they created.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.080
This is a possible yet
very distant technology.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.450
OK, so lots of ways
to get to the stars.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.780
What's the fastest?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.580
Honestly, if we had to colonize
in the absolute shortest

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.900
possible time, then it's
nukes, like the Orion project.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.704
We have the tech.

00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:27.870
We just have to increase
the world's nuclear arsenal

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.550
by a factor of 200, which
we shouldn't do unless it's

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.270
a question of extinction.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.680
Still, in a super
optimistic estimate,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.450
we could have boots on
the ground in 2120 or so.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.800
Now fusion engines
are more sustainable,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.810
even if the tech is a
minimum of 50 years away.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.600
They land us on Alpha Cen in
the latter half of the 2100s,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.930
assuming we start now.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.630
Pure antimatter
and the Kugelblitz

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.640
drives, they're the
starships of the far future.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.745
Assuming warp drives
don't pan out,

00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:59.620
these are what we'll
want to actually explore

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.570
the galaxy with near light
speeds dilating apparent travel

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.450
time down to human scales.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.546
Let's talk near-term reality.

00:10:07.546 --> 00:10:08.920
I'm going to come
out and say it.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.060
Light sails.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.850
We'll put our first unmanned
probes in the Alpha-Cen system.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.930
It'll take around 45 years
from launch, not slowing down

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.834
at the other end.

00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:20.000
And another four and a half
years to get the message

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.430
that we succeeded.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.810
Maybe we could launch a Star
Wisp in less than 30 years.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.570
And some kids
watching this video

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.710
might see this to fruition.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.310
Manned light jammers are way
off but totally plausible.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.020
Humanity's first attempts
to land on other worlds

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.660
might well have us
sailing to the stars.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.470
It's likely between this
and post fusion drives.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.720
Either way, pretty epic.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.910
Which option are you
most excited about?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.370
Let us know in the comments.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.270
We hit warp seven next
time on Space Time.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.420
Last week we talked about
why the speed of light

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.910
is really the
speed of causality.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.330
You guys had lots of
amazing questions.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.840
Andrea Prapone and others asked,
why does the speed of light

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.990
have to be that specific number,
300,000 kilometers per second?

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.990
And what would happen to the
universe if it were different?

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.430
Well, that actual number,
300,000 kilometers per second,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.540
just comes from a pretty
arbitrary definition

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.520
of the length of
kilometers and seconds.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.130
Now physicists often choose to
define the speed of light as C

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.996
equals 1, which we
call natural units.

00:11:24.996 --> 00:11:26.370
At that point, it
perhaps becomes

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.670
more interesting to ask why
other fundamental constants

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.160
of nature have the
values that they do

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.760
compared to the speed of light.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.590
Now that said,
the relative units

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.040
of the fundamental constants,
the speed of light,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.060
the strength of the
fundamental forces,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.900
et cetera, are important for
the properties of this universe.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.210
And you change them too
much and the universe as we

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.190
know it doesn't exist.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.830
We'll talk about that and
more in another episode.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.510
Jai Kolra and others ask, what
about quantum entanglement?

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.080
Shouldn't we be able to transmit
messages instantly this way?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.630
Right.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.680
Spooky action at a distance,
as Einstein called it,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.364
on the surface does
seem to mess with us.

00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:05.780
When you collapse
the way function

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.280
of one entangled particle,
your choice of measurement

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.610
affects the state of
its entangled partner

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.900
instantaneously, potentially
over large distances.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.650
However, it turns out
that this can't ever

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.680
be used to transmit
new information faster

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.740
than the speed of light,
so causality is preserved.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.990
We may do an episode on
this, but in the meantime,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.020
Veritasium has as an excellent
one, linked in the description.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.970
Ed Stephan asks why
we're even talking

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.614
about gravitational waves when
none have ever been observed.

00:12:30.614 --> 00:12:32.280
Why don't we get back
to this next week.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.180
But in the meantime, in pointing
out the indirect detection

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.500
of gravitational
waves, Garreth Dean

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.126
delivers the amazing quote,
"So we haven't seen a duck,

00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:43.500
but something's been quacking
and eating all of our bread

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.170
sticks."

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.890
TheColonel asks,
"Does this now mean

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.860
I can refer to the speed of
light as total monkey speed?"

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.870
The answer is yes.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.700
And to Tyler Hamilton, all
I have to say is, Yahhhhhh!
