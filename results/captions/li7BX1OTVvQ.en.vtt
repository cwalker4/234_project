00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.152
Thrawn was a male Chiss born on the planet
Csilla a few decades before the start of the

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:10.152
Clone Wars.

00:00:10.152 --> 00:00:14.599
He grew up within the Chiss Ascendancy, a
territory within the Unknown Regions controlled

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:15.780
by the Chiss.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.640
When he was old enough, he joined the Chiss
Expansionary Defense Force, the military branch

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.220
of the Chiss Ascendancy.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.429
He soon reached the rank of Commander, becoming
the youngest Chiss to obtain such rank.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.060
As a commander, Thrawn had many achievements
to his name.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.620
He was the first Chiss to make contact with
Humans, with one of them being Corellian smuggler

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.030
Jorj Car'das.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.910
Through this contact, Thrawn learned Galactic
Basic, the standard language of the Star Wars

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.910
Universe.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:53.739
He also was told about the Jedi and droids,
two things that were unheard of to the Chiss.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.330
About 5 years before the clone wars, Thrawn
would make contact with a small fleet of trade

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.040
federation ships commanded by Kinman Doriana,
a trusted aid of Palpatine who was sent on

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.570
a secret mission by the secret sith lord to
destroy Outbound Flight and its escort.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.170
The Outbound flight was on a mission to explore
the unknown regions and to reach the edges

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.100
of the galaxy and make contact with possible
alien species outside the galaxy.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.990
Palpatine’s motivation for destroying the
outbound flight was to prevent them from discovering

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.530
the Yuuzhan Vong, also known as the far outlanders,
as had they done so, the galaxy would have

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.290
gone into sheer chaos at the threat of a massive
intergalactic invasion force preparing to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.470
attack the entire republic, and such chaos
would have hurt Palpatine’s plans for securing

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.530
the galaxy for himself.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.369
Also there were 20 Jedi onboard Outbound flight,
so Palpatine also wanted to take them out

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.830
as well.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.420
After destroying most of the trade federation
fleet, Thrawn boarded the enemy flagship and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.890
confronted Kinman.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.090
During their meeting, Kinman explained his
mission to destroy Outbound flight and told

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.240
him how the Jedi on it posed a threat to Thrawn
and his people.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.899
Thrawn listened, but was unimpressed, and
before he could continue his interrogation,

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.590
he was summoned to a meeting with another
Chiss admiral who had just won a costly battle

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.910
against an unknown alien force on the edge
of the galaxy, which unknown to the chiss

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.750
at the time, was the Yuuzhan Vong.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.360
Worried about this unknown dangerous force
and also not wanting to start a conflict in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.820
which the Chiss would have to fight multiple
wars, Thrawn made a deal with Kinman that

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.580
he would help him, but only if he told him
the full story of his mission.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.820
Reluctantly agreeing, Kinman explained how
he was an advisor to Palpatine, who was the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.519
Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.269
He went on to tell him that Palpatine had
information on a group only known by them

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.239
as the “far outlanders”, who were massing
an invasion force at the edge of the galaxy,

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.430
and that Palpatine was preparing the republic
to be able to repel such invasion.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.570
Kinman explained how if the Outbound flight
reached its destination, it would lead the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.230
far outlanders, the Yuuzhan Vong, back the
the Republic, and that’s why it needed to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.840
be destroyed.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.850
After explaining his mission, Kinman contacted
Palpatine by hologram to confirm his story.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.210
Palpatine was impressed with how easily Thrawn
was able to defeat Kinman’s fleet.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.500
Palpatine then ordered Kinman to provide all
the known reports and information on the far

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.340
outlanders to Thrawn.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.049
After reviewing said data, Thrawn concluded
that these so called far outlanders were the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.290
same forces that his fellow Chiss admiral
had fought against earlier.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.919
Realizing the threat they posed to his people,
Thrawn accepted the mission to destroy Outbound

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.919
flight.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.060
Satisfied with his decision, Palpatine gave
crucial information on the Outbound flight

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.859
and warned Thrawn of the Jedi on board, informing
him of how they were capable of using the

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.540
force in combat.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.510
When Thrawn confronted Outbound flight and
its escort, he initially wanted a peaceful

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.400
resolution to the conflict and started a negotiation
with the Jedi on board to have them return

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.479
back to the Republic unharmed.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.449
But the stubborn leader of the expedition,
Jedi Master Jorus C’baoth, refused to retreat

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.950
and instigated a battle between the two fleets,
with at one point C’baoth almost killing

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.260
Thrawn by force choking him from his own ship.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.450
However, Thrawn was able to win the battle
swiftly and was successful in ending Outbound

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.690
flight's expedition.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:23.050
Afterwords, Thrawn’s career in the Chiss
Expansionary Defense Forces didn’t last

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.780
long, as he was soon exiled by the Chiss government
over his overly aggressive tactics and pre-emptive

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.010
strikes on unknown forces that he believed
were a threat to his people.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.690
They sent him alone onto an uncolonized world
for him to live out the rest of his life.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.710
However, Thrawn didn’t stay there long,
as about a week after the formation of the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.970
Galactic Empire, a group of Imperials would
be dispatched to Thrawn’s planet in search

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.400
of a smuggler.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.810
Instead they would make contact with Thrawn,
who initially tried to steal an Imperial shuttle

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
to use to get back home, but he failed and
was instead captured.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.340
Under Imperial custody, Thrawn was taken by
captain Voss Parck to Coruscant to be personally

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.370
presented to Emperor Palpatine.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.970
Pleased to have the genius behind the destruction
of Outbound flight from years earlier before

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.750
him, Palpatine was able to convince Thrawn
to use his superb tactical abilities for the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.750
Empire.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.880
He did so by telling Thrawn that the Empire
was the best chance the galaxy had in defeating

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.930
the imminent invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.280
After accepting to join the empire, Thrawn
was privately trained by Parck and soon quickly

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.980
rose through the ranks, becoming one of the
very few non-human officers in the Imperial

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.980
Navy.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.590
Thrawn achieved many victories and accomplishments
in his early career in the Imperial Navy,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.720
including conquering numerous worlds for the
Emperor as well as initiating cooperation

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.540
between the Galactic Empire and the Chiss
Ascendancy to produce Chiss designed Imperial

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.550
Nssis-class Clawcrafts.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:56.170
As a result, Thrawn became one of the most
valuable commanders in the Imperial Military.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.220
About a year and a half after the destruction
of the first Death Star, Thrawn was promoted

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.450
to grand admiral by Emperor Palpatine.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.630
But due to Thrawn being non-human, this promotion
was kept out of the public and was known only

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.630
by a few.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.380
Along with the promotion and ceremonial title
of Warlord of the Empire, Thrawn also gained

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.980
deep trust and respect from Palpatine.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.380
Despite being praised by the Emperor himself,
most of the other high ranking Imperials looked

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.490
down upon Thrawn solely due to fact that he
wasn’t Human.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.460
Eventually Palpatine gave Thrawn permission
to go beyond the Empire’s borders in the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.920
Unknown regions and to start building up defenses
for potential outside threats to the Empire.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.550
In less than a year Thrawn conjured much of
the Unknown Regions and was able to establish

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.590
multiple defensive bases.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.470
For his successes, he was summoned back to
Coruscant and was invited by Palpatine to

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.470
join the Order of the Canted Circle, one the
highest and most exclusive social orders on

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.470
Coruscant.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.220
Such an invitation shocked the public, as
prior only Humans were invited to join under

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.850
the Imperial reign.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.070
Before his return to the Unknown Regions,
Thrawn assisted Darth Vader in his campaign

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.760
against Prince Xizor and his criminal organization
the Black Sun.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.970
Doing so, Thrawn went undercover disguised
as mandalorian bounty hunter Jodo Kast.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.680
As a reward for his help, Thrawn was given
full control over the Noghri, a species who

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.950
were excellent as assassins and bodyguards.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.950
After the battle of Hoth, Thrawn began to
engage the scattered rebels and was later

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.790
assigned missions to hunt down Imperial admirals
who had either defected to the rebellion or

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.880
sought to take the Imperial throne from Palpatine.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.680
By the time of the battle of Endor, Thrawn
was back continuing his work in the Outer

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680
rim.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.051
After both Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader
were killed, the empire went into chaos, with

00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:44.660
numerous high ranking Imperials all trying
to take control of the remaining empire.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.480
This disarray let the New Republic have the
advantage in the continued war, which followed

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.750
in the New Republic eventually capturing Coruscant,
the capital of the Empire.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:04.389
4 years later, Thrawn would return back to
the remaining Galactic Empire, a crumbling

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:07.699
regime that only had a quarter of its former
territory left.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.150
As the last Grand Admiral that was still alive
and loyal to the Empire, Thrawn was easily

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.950
able to recruit remaining loyal Imperials
to his service, including Captain Gilad Pellaeon,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.990
a survivor of the Battle of Endor.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.460
Gilad Pellaeon soon became Thrawn’s second
in command.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.020
Before he engaged with the New Republic, Thrawn
needed to require resources, including obtaining

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.829
the ysalamiri, a species that were capable
of repealing the force, and recruiting the

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:39.190
dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth, who was a clone
of Jedi Master Joruus C’baoth many decades

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.190
prior.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.370
He also went on to create some clones to fill
his depleted ranks and he recruited a Noghri

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.360
named Rukh to serve as his personal bodyguard.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.070
When he started to attack the New Republic,
Thrawn implemented the stateless strategy,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.400
in which he would quickly strike the New Republic
then retreat, forcing the New Republic forces

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.550
to overstretch and thin out their defenses
trying to defend everything.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.089
An ironic strategy, as the Rebel Alliance
employed similar attack patterns against the

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:12.180
Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil
War.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.029
With each battle, Thrawn got closer and closer
to completely destroying the New Republic.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:21.140
However, his campaign came to a halt at the
Battle of Bilbringi, when amidst the conflict,

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.130
Thrawn was killed by his bodyguard, Rukh,
who after learned that the empire was secretly

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.080
poisoning his people, decided to assassinate
Thrawn.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.330
It is said that had Thrawn not been assassinated
by Rukh, that he would have steamrolled the

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.990
remaining New Republic forces and would have
taken control of all the lost Imperial territory.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.190
Thrawn did have a clone of himself stored
in his secret complex, but it was indirectly

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:52.930
destroyed by Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade
after they discovered it.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:57.620
Grand Admiral Thrawn was noted for his exceptional
leadership and naval commanding abilities.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.020
As a leader, rather than punishing those that
failed him, like many of his Imperial colleagues

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.960
did, he instead had his men learn from their
mistakes and awarded them when they improved

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.190
or showed creativity in their success.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.730
He also rarely ever killed those under his
leadership, only doing so if they showed obvious

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.170
disloyalty or complete disregard of their
actions.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.460
He also listened to what both his advisors
and men had to say and took their opinions

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.510
into consideration before making his next
move.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.180
His men did not fear him, but respected him
and were proud to serve him.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.700
Thrawn also wasn’t overconfident or arrogant
with his attacks, and would retreat and admit

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.320
defeat when necessary rather than not and
lose men to as a result just to sustain his

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320
ego.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.870
When it came to tactics, Thrawn was an absolute
genius, being able to outmaneuver and defeat

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.000
literally anyone in a fair even battle.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.320
He did this by not only studying his enemy's
battle tactics, but also studying their culture,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.400
their arts.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.070
Learning who they are as a people, and learning
not only how they act, but how they would

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.430
react to certain situations, giving him the
ability to predict his opponent's’ moves

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:06.030
with ease.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.930
Thrawn had a very analytical mind, resulting
in him basing his decisions on logic rather

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.930
than emotion.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.740
Thrawn’s greatest, probably only motivation
for serving the Empire, was that he believed

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.899
it was the best bet the galaxy had against
the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:25.430
He believed that a unified galaxy under a
strong leader, a leader that was willing to

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:30.490
do anything to achieve victory, would be unstoppable
and could protect his people from outside

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.600
threats.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.980
Although he respected and was loyal to Emperor
Palpatine, he did share many disagreements

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.980
with him, including the Emperor’s decision
of building massive and expansive superweapons

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.520
rather than investing in the Imperial Navy
to include thousands of more star destroyers

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.710
and super star destroyers.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.590
Although Thrawn didn’t show much emotion,
he did have great concern for his men and

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.690
their well being.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.779
Despite this, Thrawn was not above doing evil
acts, such as when he orchestrated a genocide

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:01.920
on a planet that wouldn’t obey his rule
in the Unknown regions or when he accepted

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.120
to kidnap Leia’s children in exchange for
the dark Jedi Joruus C’baoth’s service.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.430
But he did these things because he felt they
were necessary for the greater good of the

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:24.130
galaxy, and he didn’t gain any personal
pleasure when carrying them out.
