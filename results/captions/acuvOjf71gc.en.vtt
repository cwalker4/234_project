00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.810
IT'S HIS NEWSPAPER.

00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.279
IN AN AGE OF CONCERN ABOUT

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.514
CLIMATE CHANGE SOME PEOPLE

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:08.648
HAVE BECOME OPPOSED TO THE

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.049
VERY IDEA OF HAVING

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.817
CHILDREN.

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:11.451
CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:12.052
OCASIO-CORTEZ IS WARNING

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.119
THAT IT COULD BE IMMORAL TO

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.854
HAVE KIDS.

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:18.625
&gt;&gt; OUR PLANET IS GOING TO

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:19.959
DISASTER IF WE DON'T TURN

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.594
THIS SHIP AROUND AND SO IT'S

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:23.163
BASICALLY LIKE THERE IS

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:23.997
SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS THAT

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:25.098
THE LIVES OF CHILDREN ARE

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.334
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:29.202
AND IT DOES LEAD, I THINK

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:32.439
YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE A

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.407
LEGITIMATE QUESTION, YOU

00:00:34.408 --> 00:00:35.675
KNOW, SHOULD -- IS IT OKAY

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:38.078
TO STILL HAVE CHILDREN?

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.845
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SOME PEOPLE

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:40.013
DECIDED THAT, NO, IT IS NOT

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:42.148
OKAY TO HAVE CHILDREN.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.651
A CO-FOUNDER OF BIRTH STRIKE

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:46.253
A GROUP OF PEOPLE REFUSING

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.687
TO HAVE CHILDREN IN ORDER TO

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:48.422
RESIST CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:49.990
SHE JOINS US TONIGHT.

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:50.924
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:51.191
ON.

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:52.626
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:53.293
&gt;&gt; Tucker: THIS STORY MAKES

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:53.760
ME SAD.

00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.262
I'M NOT HERE TO ATTACK YOU I

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:56.963
WANT TO TAKE WHAT YOU ARE

00:00:56.964 --> 00:00:57.731
SAYING SERIOUSLY.

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:58.965
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND

00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.933
WHY YOU ARE CHOOSING NOT TO

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:00.767
HAVE CHILDREN.

00:01:00.768 --> 00:01:02.169
I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.370
WOULD TELL US.

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:04.104
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:04.404
YEAH.

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:05.372
THANK YOU FOR ASKING BECAUSE

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:07.040
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.442
A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ABOUT

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.745
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:12.045
HERE.

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:13.447
BIRTH STRIKE ISN'T DID

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.648
TRYING TO STOP OTHER PEOPLE

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.150
FROM HAVING CHILDREN.

00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:20.287
WE FEEL TOO AFRAID TO HAVE

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.622
KIDS BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT WE

00:01:22.623 --> 00:01:23.290
ARE HEADING TOWARDS

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.358
CIVILIZATION BREAKDOWN AS A

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.226
RESULT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:28.529
CRISIS AND THIS SORT OF

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.664
MISMANAGEMENT OR POLITICAL

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:31.632
INERTIA OVER DEALING WITH IT

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.034
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:35.536
&gt;&gt; Tucker: IT DOES MAKE

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:35.836
SENSE.

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:36.804
IT'S A SADDER ANSWER EVEN

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:37.638
THAT I IMAGINED.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.739
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.240
PEOPLE WHO ARGUE NOBODY

00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:41.075
SHOULD HAVE KIDS.

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.876
THAT'S ONE ARGUMENT.

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:44.211
YOU ARE BASICALLY SAYING THE

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:46.613
PIECE SAYS

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:46.680
SPECE SAYS

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:46.747
SPECIESAYS

00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:47.514
SPECIES IS OVER.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.383
WE SHOULD A GROUP END IT

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:49.850
COMMIT SUICIDE.

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:51.118
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK WHERE WE

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.454
ARE NOW IS INCREDIBLY

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:54.555
FRIGHTENING AND WHAT I

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:56.256
DISCOVERED WHEN I MADE THE

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:57.191
DECISION AND STARTED TALKING

00:01:57.192 --> 00:01:58.959
ABOUT IT TO OTHER YOUNG

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.062
WOMEN AROUND ME, WAS THAT WE

00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:03.731
FELT LIKE WE HAD LOST FAITH

00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:06.167
IN THE SYSTEM AND THE

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:07.234
AUTHORITIES BECAUSE THEY

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:08.102
WEREN'T REALLY DEALING WITH

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:09.570
THE SITUATION.

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.305
THEY WEREN'T MANAGING THE

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:12.373
THREATS PROPERLY THAT WE

00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:15.543
HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT.

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:17.144
SO, YES, IT IS QUITE SAD,

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:19.747
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, BIRTH

00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:21.315
STRIKE ITSELF IS A HOPEFUL

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:21.882
ACT.

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:23.117
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO SAY

00:02:23.118 --> 00:02:25.352
COME ON, WE HAVE GOT TWO

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:25.820
OPTIONS.

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.724
WE EITHER UNITE COLLECTIVELY

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.960
BEHIND ACTION ON THIS

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:34.896
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE ARE

00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:37.098
ALREADY HEADING TOWARDS THE

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.499
COLLAPSE, OR WE CONFINE

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.401
OURSELVES TO, I MEAN IT

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:46.174
SOUNDS CRAZY BUT IT'S TRUE,

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:46.641
EXTINCTION.

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.042
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WHAT MAKES ME SO

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.211
SAD IT'S THIS IS A MET FOR

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:51.746
OF THE WILL TO LIVE SO

00:02:51.747 --> 00:02:53.181
OBVIOUS EVERYWHERE YOU TURN.

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:54.482
I BONNDER DID IT OCCUR TO

00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:55.550
YOU AND I'M NOT DISAGREEING

00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.384
WITH YOUR FORECAST THAT

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.619
THERE ARE BUMPY TIMES AHEAD

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.454
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:01.189
WOULDN'T IT BE A MARK OF

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.790
DEFIANCE MAYBE PART OF THE

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:05.193
SOLUTION TO HAVE A BUNCH OF

00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:06.094
SMART, DECENT CHILDREN WHO

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.396
MIGHT SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS?

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.231
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I TOTALLY

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.632
UNDERSTAND THAT POINT OF

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:11.933
VIEW.

00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:13.401
AND THERE HAS BEEN PEOPLE IN

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:16.270
MY LIFE WHO ARE VERY AWARE

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.705
OF THE SEVERITY OF WHAT WE

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:18.740
ARE HEADING TO.

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:21.342
WHO HAVE MADE THAT DECISION

00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:22.310
AND THEY HAVE SAID, YOU

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:23.911
KNOW, IT'S THE KIND OF MOST

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.515
HOPEFUL ACT THAT YOU COULD

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:29.918
TAKE IS TO HAVE A CHILD IN

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:30.385
THESE TIMES.

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:31.819
AND I DO RESPECT THAT.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.923
I DO RESPECT THAT.

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:35.824
&gt;&gt; Tucker: IF YOU WERE TO

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:38.059
FLY TO AFRICA TONIGHT, JUST

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.297
DO A TOUR, A LOT OF TOURS IN

00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:42.630
AFRICA.

00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:44.199
PICK JUST FIVE AND MEET 10

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.033
PEOPLE ON THE STREET AND

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:46.468
EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING,

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:47.068
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.036
REACTION WOULD BE?

00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:52.007
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:52.607
&gt;&gt; Tucker: DO YOU THINK

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:53.909
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE WEST CAN

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.676
UNDERSTAND THIS?

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:56.011
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY

00:03:56.012 --> 00:03:57.412
OTHER CIVILIZATION THAT HAS

00:03:57.413 --> 00:03:58.513
DECIDED THINGS ARE SO

00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:01.316
HOPELESS WE MUST ALL DIE?

00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:03.251
&gt;&gt; I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:10.058
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAY.

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:11.693
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I MEAN, IS THIS

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:12.361
SOMETHING HAVE YOU THOUGHT

00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:13.695
FOR A LONG TIME OR TELL US

00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:14.630
HOW YOU WERE CONVINCED THAT

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.231
THINGS WERE SO BAD THAT YOU

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:17.099
SHOULDN'T REPRODUCE?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.302
&gt;&gt; WELL, YEAH, I THINK

00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:21.637
THAT -- I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:24.373
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:04:24.374 --> 00:04:26.508
ENVIRONMENT FOR A LONG TIME

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.310
BUT YOU KNOW, I GOT

00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.145
DISTRACTED BY MY CAREER AND

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:32.814
JUST BEING A YOUNG PERSON

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:34.449
AND LIVING THE LIFE THAT I

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.318
SAW OTHER PEOPLE ON

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:36.952
TELEVISION LIVING THAT

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:38.720
SEEMED TO BE THE RIGHT THING

00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:41.490
TO DO, AND THEN THE LAST FEW

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.392
YEARS I JUST KEPT READING

00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:45.227
MORE AND MORE THINGS AND

00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:47.830
LAST YEAR THE IPPC REPORT

00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.231
CAME OUT AND MEN THE MET

00:04:49.232 --> 00:04:52.301
REPORT AND THINGS HAVE BEEN

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:53.469
CORROBORATED BY PRETTY MUCH

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.670
99% OF THE SCIENTIFIC

00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.441
COMMUNITY IF NOT ALL SANE

00:04:58.442 --> 00:05:00.176
SCIENTISTS.

00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:02.578
IT'S PRETTY INCONTROVERT

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:05.381
TILLABLE NOW, I WOULD SAY.

00:05:05.382 --> 00:05:06.082
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I DON'T MEAN THIS

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:07.516
AS CRITICISM I MEAN IT

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:07.883
SINCERELY.

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:09.351
WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.220
SOUNDS LIKE A RELIGIOUS

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:12.655
CONVERSION AND LIFE YOU ARE

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:17.226
LIVING SEEMS LIKE MANASTIC.

00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:21.230
&gt;&gt; A MANASTIC LIFE?

00:05:21.231 --> 00:05:22.398
YOU SHOULD COME AND HANG

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.665
OUT.

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.033
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE GIVING UP FAMILY

00:05:24.034 --> 00:05:24.934
FOR THE CAUSE.

00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:26.636
&gt;&gt; LAY THE CHILDREN AROUND

00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:28.371
ME AND I'M FIGHTING FOR

00:05:28.372 --> 00:05:28.838
THEM, REALLY.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.540
THIS IS MY WAY OF SAYING

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:31.674
COME ON HUMANITY, WE HAVE

00:05:31.675 --> 00:05:33.209
GOT TWO OPTIONS.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.210
WE ARE EITHER GOING TO

00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:36.412
COMMIT SOME KIND OF SPECIES

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:39.082
SUICIDE BY IGNORING THE

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.150
ISSUE BECAUSE WE'RE TOO

00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:41.985
AFRAID OF THE CHANGE OF

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:43.586
SOMETHING OR WE ARE GOING TO

00:05:43.587 --> 00:05:45.555
UNITE TOGETHER AND AT LEAST

00:05:45.556 --> 00:05:47.090
TRY AND MANAGE SOME OF THE

00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:49.826
COLLAPSE THAT'S PREDICTED IN

00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:54.797
A SENSIBLE AND RATIONABLE

00:05:54.798 --> 00:05:55.131
WAY.

00:05:55.132 --> 00:05:59.669
I'M NOT LIVING A MANASTIC

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.036
LIFE.

00:06:00.037 --> 00:06:01.037
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I THINK YOU

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:02.138
SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN THEY
