00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.290
- I still don't think
you're high right now,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.793
but something tells me you do smoke weed.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.130
Nevermind, he's high.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.264
Take it all back, this man is high.

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:13.620
(playful music)

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.620
My name is Bo Donaldson,
and I am a teacher.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.193
I'm an underpaid counselor.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.865
- Yes, absolutely.

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:25.563
Like, all types of kids know about weed.

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:29.168
- (chuckles) Every day, I work with kids.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:32.180
(group laughs)

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.882
- 1,000%, and I know
this for a kind of fact,

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:38.230
because kids are assholes.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.440
You gotta train 'em to not be dicks.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.233
That's what my job is.

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:45.706
- Alright.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.170
- No, get ready.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.700
Is this your first time doing this?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.533
- Yeah.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.814
- Yeah, no, yeah I see,
I can kinda tell you're.

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:55.852
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:00:55.852 --> 00:01:00.852
- Yeah, no, I mean, you're
totally, yeah, 100%.

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:04.710
- Immediately, this man is high. (laughs)

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.560
I honestly think you're kinda high.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.853
Is that okay?

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:12.250
- I mean, that's okay that you think that.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.083
- Okay, cool.

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:13.960
- Hey.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960
- Hey, how ya doin'?

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.120
I think he might be intoxicated.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.190
- Yeah, what do you look
for in your students

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.070
to find out they're high?

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.502
- Mostly, in their eyes and their dialect.

00:01:28.502 --> 00:01:30.850
Your eyes are actually quite white,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.400
so I don't believe you're high.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.233
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:34.140
- Bo!

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.973
I'm James.

00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:36.120
- Nice to meet you, James.
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.520
- What's your favorite song?

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.023
He's not high.

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:42.450
(laughs) He's not high.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.994
What's your favorite cartoon?

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:46.047
- I like some Zap Comix
stuff from the 60's.

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:47.100
- Oh, okay.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.824
I still don't think you're high right now,

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.803
but somethin' tells me you do smoke weed.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.853
Nevermind, he's high.

00:01:56.853 --> 00:01:59.264
Take it all back, this man is high.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:00.780
(laughing)

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.163
Yep, and that confirmed it, so, thank you!

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.300
Good to know, and he just
left, and nobody said anything.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.743
So, this is great.

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:13.380
I'm winning, kind of.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.213
I think you're high.

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:15.510
- Why so?
- A little bit.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.560
This comes from my father,
it's called the nigga glare.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.093
(laughs)

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:23.170
And the fact that he's
laughing right now means

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.270
that he's probably
understanding what I'm saying.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.103
- I feel that.

00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:29.120
(laughing)

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.013
- Yeah, I think you might be
high, is that okay to say?

00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:32.310
Is that cool?
- I mean,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.020
I feel like you're profiling me.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.103
(laughs)

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.730
- He's high as hell!

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:44.043
(laughter)

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:46.292
He is high. (laughs)

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:47.995
- Why do you think I'm high?

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.410
- Mostly 'cause I can
tell around your eyes,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.003
like, into your lids are kinda red.

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:54.801
(chuckles)

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:55.980
That diva turn!

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.813
Hello!

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:57.646
- Hello.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:59.612
What's your favorite
crunchy food of snack?

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.250
- Chips.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.072
- Have you ever had, like, a
cucumber on top of a Dorito?

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:07.793
- Probably. (laughs)

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.030
- I don't think you're high,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.080
but you seem really fun to smoke with.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.913
- That is true.

00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:15.746
- Yeah.

00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:17.210
So, have you ever busted anybody

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.710
in your class for being high, and, like,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.200
what do you do if you have?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.790
- Most of the time it's
just calling the parents

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.717
and being like, "Uh, you're
the one that dropped them off,

00:03:24.717 --> 00:03:26.950
"so what the hell's goin' on?"

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.020
- That is fucking bleak, man.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.440
- It's very bleak.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.760
- Alright, well, thanks.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.710
- No problem.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.543
- Not high.

00:03:33.543 --> 00:03:37.437
- Not, prob-, not high, I'm gonna say.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.490
Hello, high! (laughs)

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.370
I'm so sorry.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.380
- Is that a racial thing?

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.927
- No, it's not a racial thing.

00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:45.907
(laughs) What?

00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:47.807
(laughing)

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:51.180
When I'm high in front of other people,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.460
I try to be as sober as possible.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.780
You seem like you're trying to be as sober

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.282
in front of me and the,
with the smiling included,

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.000
in front of me and the camera,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.440
and so I can kinda tell you might be high.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.240
When you do get high,
if you ever smoked weed,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.398
what would be your chip of choice?

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.518
- I like Cheeto Puffs.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.810
Do you like Cheeto Puffs?

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.100
- Yes, you're high. (laughs)

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.933
Have you ever had ham

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:17.317
wrapped around a Cheeto?
- No, I don't like ham.

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:19.690
I don't like meat.
- You're missing out.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.550
Well, what about, like, bologna?

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.740
You don't eat meat.
- No.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.761
- You just said that 30
seconds ago, I'm so sorry.

00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:26.250
- Yeah, I think you're high, are you high?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.083
- I wish.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:27.916
- I don't believe you.

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:29.440
- No, that's cool, and that's very.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.530
- Is that cool with you?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.973
- Yeah, that's very okay.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.370
I feel like this is a trick.

00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:42.460
- Oh, fuck off.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.081
What are your favorite snacks, actually?

00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.690
- I like cookies, Sun Chips.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.300
Honestly, the cucumber and
Dorito, that sounds so fire.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.133
- Oh, it's great.

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:51.966
- Yeah.

00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:53.143
- When did you start drinking?

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:54.710
- I would say, like 14.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.870
- Are you still drinking today?

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.500
- I don't really drink like I used to

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.350
or drink like a lot of people I know.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.453
I like to party once in
a while, but when I do,

00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:02.470
I go in, yeah.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.945
- That's dope, are you high right now?

00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:06.540
(laughs)

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.550
I almost got him!

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.880
I'm gonna say you're not high,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.383
but you really wanna get fuckin' high.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.850
- Damn it!

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.180
Oh wait, I got some of you guys right.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.309
You were high, I knew it.

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.432
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. (laughs)

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:25.432
- That's just your life?

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:27.812
(laughs)

00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:31.006
- It must be hard getting
jobs, I'm so sorry.

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:33.640
(laughing)

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.320
- This experience is quite amazing.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.300
This just goes to show,
you can't just judge people

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.410
by how they look.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.820
- Because school fuckin' sucks!

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.483
High school is in the
worst part of your life.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.010
- Don't fuckin' punish them at all.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.140
Well, I think the stigma
behind weed is ridiculous.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.540
It can help so many people,
but at the same time,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.543
be regulated.

00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:06.793
(applause)

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.910
- Oh sweet, my bad.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.410
- [Producer] No, you're good.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.040
- [Bo] Hello, everybody!

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.163
Sorry, this is weird.
