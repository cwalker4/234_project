00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.980
So let's talk about
this new-- you do--

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.340
it turns out you had a number
for her referral for fitness,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.470
and now you're working
together on this new--

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.335
this gym-- what is
this-- first of all,

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.210
I saw pictures of the
two of you working out,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.920
which looked really intense.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.590
And explain what's
happening here, because it's

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.870
like really super hot, right?

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.500
It is hot.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.940
Like how hot?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.330
It kind of gets up
to as hot as 110.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.850
From 80 degrees to 110.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.050
And I call it kind of a hybrid
between Barry's Boot Camp

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.299
and hot yoga.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.840
Yeah, it looks like
yoga right there.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.390
And you can burn
up to 800 calories.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.490
And I just love it.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.760
It's fun, it's great music,
has a great boot camp feel.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.810
You can burn up to 800 calories?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.430
Yeah.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.650
Maybe you can.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.180
Depending on how hard you push.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.680
Yeah.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
But, I mean, the minute you
get in there, you are drenched.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.485
And you have that
dance, there's--

00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:56.940
You have that.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.470
There's my man, Lane.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.690
So you're all doing the same
class, and you are sweating,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.492
and so anyone can do it, it's
not like an advanced thing?

00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:07.200
Nope, not at all.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.730
I mean, you have 65
different classes per day.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.650
We started in Vegas
with three units,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.800
and now we have
over 160 commitments

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.760
all over the US and China.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.940
And this is the future.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.630
I mean, I don't like
one trick ponies,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.640
I get bored with the
same workout every day.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.780
So the fact that I can go in and
do yoga one day, Pilates, spin,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.507
boot camp, I love it.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:30.090
Yeah, me, too.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.830
Plus your body gets
used to something

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.770
and it stops working
after it kind of like,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.310
oh, I see what
you're doing today.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.900
And you-- if you do the
same thing every single day,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.608
it stops working.

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:39.930
Also, the heat is so addicting.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.130
It makes you sweat.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.264
I'm not a sweater, so the
minute I get in there,

00:01:43.264 --> 00:01:45.930
first five minutes, I'm drenched
and I just-- at least mentally,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.670
I feel like I am
getting some work done.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.170
Yeah.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.392
Well, it also releases all
the toxins that's inside.

00:01:50.392 --> 00:01:51.100
That's fantastic.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.095
And it's called TruFusion?

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:52.761
TruFusion, yeah.

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:54.640
And it's gyms all
over the place.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.100
All over the US and now
China and London's next.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.600
Wow.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.960
Yeah.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.235
Congratulations,
that's fantastic.

00:01:59.235 --> 00:01:59.520
Thank you.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.050
We're having fun.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.430
That's great.

[AUDIENCE CLAPS]

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:03.274
All right.

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:06.500
So one last thing before you go.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.550
So I went to go see
Jennifer's show in Las Vegas,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.680
and I was hanging out with
her in the dressing room

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.370
and talking.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.840
And I wanted to FaceTime
you, and I made her call you.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.530
Did you ignore me on purpose?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.060
Oh, no, I didn't realize that.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.560
Yeah.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.950
That was us trying to call
you and you wouldn't pick up.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.380
I must have been with
the girls or at the gym.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.880
Really?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.690
Yeah.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.890
That's the only reason?

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.910
Yeah.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.620
Because you would
have picked up for me?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.860
Oh, yeah.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.401
Like if she calls
me and I don't pick

00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:36.641
up, oh, forget it, forget it.

00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:37.390
You're in trouble?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.139
I've been in like board
meetings and she--

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.210
time out, board.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.919
Yeah.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.460
Oh, yeah, you got
to answer her call.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.960
All right.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.340
So if we FaceTime her
right now, because I think

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.470
you should FaceTime her and see.

tomorrow in Vegas.

Hey, you know, he just told
a totally different story.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.690
He said that you went up
to him, and not the way

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.670
you told it when you were here.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.460
You said he came up to you,
but he said you went up to him.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.780
No, he-- I went up to him,
tapped him on the shoulder.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.578
Oh, is that what you said?

changing your story.

You'll see I said
I went up to him

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.790
and tapped him on the shoulder.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.330
He turned around and
he didn't recognize me.

We'll look at the
tape, but I don't know.

just told the audience

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.040
if they haven't seen
you, your show is-- well,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.630

your show in Vegas.
