00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.109
From trenches located at crushing depths to
rock formations that emerge like daggers from

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:25.400
the ground, here are 11 places on Earth no
human has ever set foot on:

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.700
Number 11 Mariana Trench, Pacific
The ocean is the least explored place on Earth,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.489
so it's no wonder that vast portions have
remained untouched by humans. One of those

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.989
areas is Mariana Trench – a narrow fissure
in the sea floor, located in the western part

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.559
of the Pacific. The trench is the deepest
known region on the planet and was formed

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.620
millions of years ago. The Challenger Deep,
located in the southern end of the Mariana

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.230
Trench, is said to be the deepest spot in
the ocean. It contains more than 20 underwater

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.949
volcanoes, vents bubbling up liquid sulfur
and marine life adapted to pressures up to

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.090
10,000 times stronger than at sea level. Movie
director, explorer and ocean enthusiast James

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.060
Cameron descended to 35,756 feet during his
2010 expedition – and he could have gone

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.080
a little deeper. A high-resolution map published
in 2014 said that it bottoms out at 36,037

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.259
feet. This means that the deepest point still
hasn’t been seen. The US has jurisdiction

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.939
over the Mariana Trench and a protected marine
reserve was created in 2009 by G. W. Bush.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.049
Number 10 Northern Patagonia, Chile
Hosting Chile's wildest landscapes, the area

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.869
hides untouched rainforests, peaks, rivers,
and lakes. The field of northern Patagonia

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.450
is also home to one of the largest masses
of ice found outside of the polar region.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.060
The high elevation preserves the remaining
Ice Field that once covered all of the Argentinian

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.599
and Chilean Patagonia in the Andes. A team
of scientists used polar-ice monitoring satellites

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.250
to determine that some of the glaciers in
Patagonia are melting faster than anywhere

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.220
else in the world, receding at a rate of 21
billion tons per year. Even though it is now

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.150
retreating, the frozen area is still over
1,600 square miles. Several researchers and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.030
explorers have crossed the ice field over
time, but much of its glaciers still remain

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.569
unexplored.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.230
Number 9 Machapuchare Mountain
Machapuchare is a sacred peak for the Hindu

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.680
religion. It’s said that Lord Shiva, an
important Hindu deity, lives here. The ‘Fish

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.440
Tail Mountain’ gets its name from the shape
of the peak as seen from a certain angle.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.700
As one of the last unexplored places on Earth,
it represented a target for the western mountaineers

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.280
that tried to conquer it. In 1957, Wilfrid
Noyce came the closest anybody ever has to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.800
the summit, but the king of Nepal asked him
to respect the religious customs and not set

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.250
foot on it. He and his companion turned back
150 feet short of the peak, producing the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.950
only climbing record of the mountain. The
impact of alpine climbing is much more understood

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.110
today, with sites like Everest being completely
overtaken by climbers. The religious status

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.620
of the mountain may have had an environmental
benefit too, leaving the Machapuchare as the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.709
only pristine mountain peak in the Himalayas.
Number 8 Sarlacc Pit, Canada

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.250
A giant gaping cave was found in Canada in
2018 and it was named Sarlacc Pit, after the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.250
pit-dwelling beast in Star Wars. The discovery
of the cave, concealed in the ground of the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.099
British Columbia's Provincial Park, was a
remarkable achievement for the explorers.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.520
The cave was first accidentally spotted in
April during a helicopter caribou counting

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.239
flight. What’s more remarkable is that the
320 feet long and almost 200 feet wide ground

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.690
hole managed to escape detection before. According
to the man whose company funded the initial

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.640
survey expedition, it’s because the site
has been covered in snow year-round up until

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.790
20 to 50 years ago. Caver Lee Hollis made
the first and only known descent into the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.700
cave up to now, reaching 260 feet down, as
the deluge of the cave's waterfall prevented

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.580
further exploration. Researchers estimate
that the surge of the glacier melt that courses

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.610
down one side of the cave's mouth, nearly
4,000 gallons of abrasive water per second,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.190
helped the structure's formation.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.880
Number 7 New Hebrides Trench
Although we’ve reached to the sky in exploration,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.260
very few attempted to go in the other direction.
We may know more today about stars and galaxies

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.610
than we know about Earth’s oceans. There
are more than 30 deep-sea trenches around

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.430
the world and most can be found in the Pacific
Ocean. In 2013 an expedition to the unexplored

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.200
New Hebrides trench in the Pacific has revealed,
with the help of high-tech cameras, the abundance

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:22.200
of crustaceans and cusk eels that live more
than 23,000 feet deep. Scientists said that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.000
eels have appeared in other deep-sea trenches
around the world but in extremely low numbers.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.130
The ecology of the Hebrides differs from other
regions of the ocean that have been studied.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.740
The difference in the ecosystem is believed
to be caused by the unproductive water above

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.880
the trench, where many fish species are unable
to survive.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.630
Number 6 Star Mountains, Papua New Guinea
The Star Mountains is a massive mountain range

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.680
extending from the Indonesian border to the
Hinderberg wall. It’s a network of huge

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.910
limestone plateaus, up to 6,000 feet tall
and 30 miles long, that protect the area.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.900
The Bluffs stretch for over 30 miles, creating
a diverse and undisturbed wildlife habitat.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.350
A survey of the region found more than 1,100
plant and animal species, 100 of which were

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.100
new to scientists. The area of the Star Mountains
is believed to be one of the wettest on the

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.240
planet, with rainfall being at over 10,000
mm per year.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.830
Number 5 Gamburtsev Mountains, Antarctica
Mountains the size of the Alps have been found

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.140
in Antarctica, entombed in ice – suggesting
that the ice sheet formed more rapidly than

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.030
scientists initially thought. Using gravity
and radar sensors, maps were created showing

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.690
details of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains.
Expecting to find flat plateaus eroded over

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.060
time, they were amazed to discover an area
with peaks and valleys, looking similar to

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.560
the European Alps. The presence of the ridged
peaks suggests the ice formed quickly, burying

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.790
the landscape under up to 2.5 miles of ice.
Hidden beneath Angus dome, one of the coldest

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.470
places on Earth, no one has ever even seen
the Gamburtsev Mountains. However, if all

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.800
the ice in Antarctica melted, their ridges
and peaks would become one of the continent’s

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.610
highest mountain ranges. The mountaintops
now measure almost 9,000 feet above sea level

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.050
and would bounce back to more than 10,800
feet without the ice sheet.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.970
Number 4 Yucatan Cenotes, Mexico
There are thousands of cenotes all across

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.790
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, places that once
were revered by the Mayans as sacred wells,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.100
and still an attraction for people worldwide.
The Yucatan is characterized mainly by its

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.170
limestone bedrock, a soluble type of rock
that can dissolve after being exposed to water

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:49.280
for millennia. The collapse of limestones
sometimes reveals the cave underneath, thus

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.200
marking the birth of a cenote. The caves fill
over time with water filtered directly by

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.890
the earth, creating lakes and stunning views.
Since there aren’t many rivers in the Yucatan,

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.530
they were once the primary source of water
for the Mayans. They were also considered

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:10.440
gateways to the afterlife – now making a
magical place for swimming and snorkeling.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.540
Located in remote mountain areas, most of
the cenotes are difficult to access and sometimes

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.890
undisturbed even by wildlife. Estimates suggest
that there are more than 6,000 such places

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.110
and less than half of them have been studied
or even registered.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:31.770
Number 3 Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan
Gangkhar Puensum, in translation ‘White

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.610
Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers’, is
the highest mountain in Bhutan, with its peak

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.820
reaching almost 25,000 feet. Most of the sources
say that it’s located at the border with

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.560
China. However, for many years, different
maps would show it as various heights and

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.110
even place it in completely different locations.
It’s said to be the highest mountain in

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.880
the world that has still not been fully summited
by man. There have been four expeditions,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.400
none of them successful due to impassable
terrain and sudden weather changes. The villagers

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.630
say it was the spirits of the mountain that
prevented the climbers from summiting it.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:14.640
The peak has been unreachable to climbers
since 1994 when all mountaineering above 20,000

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.891
feet was prohibited in the country due to
spiritual beliefs. In 2003, mountaineering

00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:24.800
was completely forbidden. Gangkhar Puensum
still remains a mystery to man, with ghostly

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.540
apparitions and strange disappearances reported
there.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.950
Number 2 Sahka Federal Republic, Russia
One-fifth of Russia is covered by the Siberian

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:41.260
Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia. The
major part is located above the Arctic Circle.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.360
The hard soil which is covered by permafrost,
make Yakutia a deadly place to live. In July,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.400
some parts of Yakutia can reach up to 100
degrees Fahrenheit, whilst the average recorded

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:57.980
temperature is as low as -50 degrees. Sahka
is one of the few places on Earth where the

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:03.710
mountains, rivers, and lakes are still untouched
by civilization. The largest river system

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:09.490
can be found there, preserving more than 10%
of the world's wildlife. It’s also the least

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:16.160
populated area of its size and the entire
population can fit into one district of Tokyo.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.820
Fauna and flora that exist dating back to
the ice age were preserved here. With 1,850

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.420
species of higher plants, over a hundred are
considered medicinal and used in traditional

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:34.670
medicine. Also unique are the horses of Yakutia,
which can easily withstand -50 degrees and

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:40.690
find food under the snow.
Number 1 Tsingy de Bemahara National Park,

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.570
Madagascar
Tsingy de Bemahara, translating as ‘Where

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.740
one cannot walk barefoot’, is a national
park located in Madagascar covered in huge

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.240
rock formations shaped like needles, protruding
from the ground. Formed millions of years

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.700
ago by groundwater erosion into deep caverns,
the combination of rounded surfaces and jagged

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.280
spires certainly look like a daunting climb.
This has provided the local wildlife with

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:12.590
protection against human intrusion. The national
park has a length of 930 square miles and

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:18.800
is today one of the Unesco World Heritage
sites. Escalating the Tsingy seems far easier

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.240
for the Sifaka lemur, a primate that evolved
there and can easily jump between the spires.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.060
In the 1990s, a French speleologist founded
an organization to help preserve and explore

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:36.710
the area. With the help of the locals, a set
of suspended bridges and steel cables was

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.510
built, allowing the landscape to be seen from
the air. However, getting to the park is still

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:47.540
no easy feat. Located on the remote west coast
of Madagascar, Tsingy de Bemahara is only

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.650
accessible by a dirt road, which becomes unnavigable
for six months a year during the rainy season.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.181
One can also opt for one of the two river
routes but it’s worth knowing that they’re

00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:03.779
both infested with crocodiles.
Thanks for watching! Do you know other places

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.990
on Earth that are untouched by humans? Tell
us about them in the comment section below!
