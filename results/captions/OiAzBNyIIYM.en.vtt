00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.940
-Even as the shutdown drags on,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.050
we have not seen Mitch McConnell
really play a leading role

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.160
in the negotiations to try
to resolve this thing

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280
and, really, this is a very
unfamiliar spot for McConnell.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.530
Here is a guy who has a history
of trying to make deals.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.020
-Political stunts are not
gonna get us anywhere.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.440
-Here's somebody who is a sort
of savvy political strategist.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.810
-In previous
government shutdowns,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.920
the Senate's done business.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.400
-And, yet, by choice,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.030
he has removed himself
from these negotiations.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.540
And we can see a couple
of reasons

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.960
for why he has done that.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.610
If you go back to December,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.190
he thought that he had a deal
to defer a government shutdown.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.650
He moved forward with a vote

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.880
that would fund
the government temporarily

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.650
and he got
the unanimous support.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.430
-Let's pass it.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.260
Let's finish our work
for this year.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.300
Let's secure our country.
-But then what happened?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.940
The president himself said,
"Oh, you know what?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.230
I'm not going to sign this".

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.840
And so, looking at that,
McConnell observed

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.420
the situation and said,
"Look, this now has to be a deal

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.950
between Nancy Pelosi,
the House speaker;

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.440
Chuck Schumer,
the Democratic Senate leader;

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.870
and the president and,
until they can come to a deal,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.370
I'm not gonna play
a role in this.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.830
No further votes will occur

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.660
until the president
and Senate Democrats

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.380
have reached an agreement
to resolve this.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.440
-He's somebody who never says
anything by accident.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.730
Everything he says and does
is usually pretty calculated

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.370
and, right now,
his position is pretty firm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.190
and it's been the same
for the past few weeks.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.120
But Democrats say,
"Look, you need to use

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.510
your clout, use your power.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.610
You're the majority leader.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700
If you were to just hold a vote
on these bills,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.410
maybe that would pressure
the president to do something".

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.030
But, right now, I think what
he's trying to do is show

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.620
that he is
on the side of President Trump.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.020
Every time Nancy Pelosi
does something or says

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.600
something
that's antagonistic to Trump,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.390
whether it's about the State
of the Union or something else,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.230
he wants to show that
he's aligned with Trump.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.360
-These days, it seems
like Democrats

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.000
are happy to take their cues

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.070
from the gentlelady from San
Francisco and her extreme,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.590
fringe position that walls
have now become amoral?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350
Really?
-But, when you look forward,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.120
there's a reason why McConnell
needs to work with Trump

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.160
and why he needs a lot
of his fellow

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.730
Republican senators
to work with Trump.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.880
McConnell's up for reelection
in 2020.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.100
He's up in a state
that's very conservative,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.510
a state that supported

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.770
Trump very,
very strongly in 2016

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.560
and is expected to do
so in 2020.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.410
And so, if you're McConnell
and you stray too far from

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.290
Trump, you could draw
a primary challenger.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.720
You could draw somebody who,
you know, runs against you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.970
and says you're not
a strong enough

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.180
supporter for the president.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.800
That can be very dangerous.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.810
And, when McConnell looks at his
Republican colleagues,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.020
you know, a number of them
are up for reelection in 2020

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.980
and he knows the same thing
could happen to them.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.320
For McConnell, you know,
it's clear

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010
that he politically
can't really afford

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.030
to distance himself
too much from Trump

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.030
because that can get
really dangerous for him

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.510
as he tries to win
another term in the Senate.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.210
And, you know, when you talk to
a lot of Republicans,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.490
they look at the situation
and they say,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.740
"Well, he doesn't really have
a choice, at this point.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.950
It's a tough situation for him
to be in".

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.550
Essentially, what McConnell
has done

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.910
is he's put his own future

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.890
and the future
of the other 52 Republicans

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.180
in the hands of Donald Trump,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.920
who has been
an unpredictable president.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.440
So, it's a little bit of a risk
for McConnell right now,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.010
that he's taking,
as he sort of steps back

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.160
and lets others
take the lead on this.
