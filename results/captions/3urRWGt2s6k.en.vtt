00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.440
- Hi, it's me Tim Dodd,
the Everyday Astronaut.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.220
Blue Origin, perhaps the sleeping giant

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.500
of the aerospace industry

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.924
will be going from a tiny
little suborbital rocket

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:11.970
to one of the biggest rockets ever made.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.680
Now you guys have been
asking and asking me

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.370
to do a video all about Blue Origin

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.800
and their massively
ambitious New Glenn rocket.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.710
But I've withheld, why?

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.480
Well, to date we really didn't
have that much information,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.685
just some pretty animations,

00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:29.080
a few videos of them
firing their BE-4 engine

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.730
and a few basic specs of the vehicle.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.810
Blue Origin has been awfully quiet

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.730
about this monster rocket, until now.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.829
Finally, Blue Origin blessed us

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.260
or really their future customers

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.742
with a Payload User's Guide.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:48.000
Ah, that sounds like the
lamest announcement ever.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.620
But in all reality it's
super, super exciting

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.930
as we finally get those
nitty-gritty details

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.150
that I been waitin' for.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.790
So today we actually get to do

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.420
a quick rundown on Blue Origin.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.600
We're gonna talk about their
upcoming, New Glenn rocket

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.780
and then we're gonna compare it

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.200
to some other heavy-lift launchers

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.540
that it's going to be competing against.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.311
Finally, I've been waiting
a long for this one.

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.550
Let's get started.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.215
- Three, two,

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:12.415
(rocket roaring)

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:14.012
All engines running.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:16.429
Lift off, we have a lift off.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.050
- Okay since I haven't really done

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.550
any videos on Blue Origin yet,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.020
let's do a super quick
rundown on who they are.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.290
Blue Origin was founded in the year 2000

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.810
by the richest human alive,
Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.643
That's right.

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:35.420
They were actually founded
two years before SpaceX.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.551
So wait, they've been around
for almost two decades

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.440
and have no shortage of money.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.860
What the heck have they been up to?

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.440
That's actually a fair question.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.450
Blue Origin is extremely tight-lipped

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.280
and we often don't hear
about what they're working on

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.087
until one day they're like, "Oh, hey!

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:51.380
"We did this."

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.780
and with their company motto
being gradatim ferociter,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.760
Latin for step by step ferociously,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.480
they're conservative on their time lines,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.012
slow to show off their details

00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:02.460
but just as ambitious as the rest of them.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.600
So with that in mind,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910
Blue Origin started chasing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.030
the suborbital tourism game first.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.060
And they still are to this day.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.270
In 2005 Jeff Bezos discussed plans

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.590
for a vertical takeoff and landing

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.240
suborbital spaceship called New Shepard.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.740
Their first tests begin
all the way back in 2006

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.110
with the launch of their
subscale demonstrator

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.240
called Goddard, named after the pioneer

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.860
of the liquid-fueled rocket
engine, Robert Goddard.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.480
This little guy was the company's test bed

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.630
to learn how to propulsively land,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.200
a key technology they'd be utilizing

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.290
in their upcoming New Shepard program.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.340
Think of this like SpaceX's
Grasshopper program

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.840
which served a similar purpose for SpaceX.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.810
The only publicly released
flight reached 86 meters

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.225
and lasted 25 seconds.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.120
The vehicle flew at least
three times in total

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.250
with the last known flight in 2007.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.010
In 2011 Blue Origin
began testing a version

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.680
of their booster for the New Shepard,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.210
climbing to over 13 kilometers in altitude

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.988
and reaching Mach 1.2 in the process.

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.109
In 2012 the company did a pad abort test

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.650
of their crew capsule.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.470
By 2015 they began testing their

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.230
first full New Shepard system

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.900
which is an 18 meter
tall booster and capsule

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.620
designed to kiss the edge of space

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.580
with up to six passengers on board

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.410
for a 20 minute flight.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.540
It's a single stage liquid-fueled booster

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.151
powered by their BE-3 engine

00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:17.740
running on liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.329
Their plan was to separate the booster

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.930
and the passenger capsule
after main engine cutoff

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.310
and have the capsule
safely land via parachutes,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.533
nice, simple and proven,

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.260
while the booster was going
to attempt a rocketry first,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.290
land propulsively after
touching the edge of space.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.182
Their first flight on April
29th, 2015 was a partial success

00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:38.730
with the capsule and booster

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.920
just about kissing the Karman line

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.170
or the boundary of space,
before returning to earth.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.940
Now the important thing is the capsule

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.040
was safely recovered via parachutes

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.664
however, their first
attempt at landing a booster

00:03:48.664 --> 00:03:52.600
was not successful, citing a
failure of hydraulic pressure

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.770
in the control system,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.870
leading to a complete loss to the vehicle.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.370
It only took seven months
for Blue Origin to return

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.800
to their Texas launch site
with a new New Shepard rocket,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.801
ready to continue testing
their new suborbital workhorse.

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:08.801
Their launch on November 23rd,
2015 was picture perfect.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.335
After successfully reaching
100.5 kilometers in altitude,

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.210
the booster and capsule came
rushing back down to earth.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.654
The capsule popped it's parachutes

00:04:16.654 --> 00:04:19.010
and was recovered exactly as planned,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.310
however, the booster continued
falling back to earth,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.121
just falling and falling and falling,

00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:26.594
gaining velocity with each passing moment,

00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:30.020
the ground coming closer
and closer and closer,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.763
'til suddenly, it's engine
ignited exactly as planned

00:04:32.763 --> 00:04:35.327
and it performed the world's
first propulsive landing

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:37.710
after reaching the edge of space.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.720
Sorry for the drama,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.900
I just wanted to spice it up a little bit.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.480
So, yeah, they absolutely
nailed their second flight.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.290
And not only that, they actually reused

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.140
that exact same booster again,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.304
taking it up to space
and landing it precisely.

00:04:51.304 --> 00:04:54.330
And then they did that same thing again

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.520
three more times for a total of five times

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.670
with the last flight

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.820
even doing something even more impressive.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.290
It performed an inflight launch abort,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.450
which is where they literally
lit a solid rocket booster

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.032
on top of the main booster

00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:09.940
and it still survived.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.739
Now, that is absolutely mind blowing.

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:14.960
They've since retired that second booster

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.833
which is now sitting at their factory

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:19.240
and they're now on to
their third New Shepard.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.050
It's flown three times to date

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.210
with the last one also being an abort test

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.580
but at apogee.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.990
This validated their abort system

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.140
throughout every portion of flight,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.430
providing extras confidence

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.790
that their passengers are safe

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.250
no matter the circumstances.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.459
So the New Shepard is
crazy, crazy impressive,

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.640
setting many space flight firsts

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.050
and getting really close
to finally launching people

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.859
and I know it's just a suborbital rocket

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:46.920
and although the total energy
and velocities involved

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.130
in these little hops is nothing
compared to orbital flight,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.650
it's still an absolutely
incredible rocket.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.030
Okay, so now I hear ya.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.120
You're sitting there going,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.030
wait, I thought the video title was,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.550
Will Blue Origin Be the
King of Heavy-lift Rockets?

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.550
How is this anywhere
comparable to Falcon Heavy?

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.370
Well, seeing as New Shepard
isn't even that much taller

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.890
than one of Falcon Heavy's landing legs,

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.220
yeah, you're right.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.183
But now, let's check out
Blue Origin's next rocket.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.850
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, they're
going from this to this?

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.250
From a Cessna to a 747?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.000
From a canoe to a cruise ship?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.940
From an ant to an elephant?

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.012
This can't be right, can it?

00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:32.150
Well it is and it's called New Glenn.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.820
Are you seeing a pattern yet?

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.800
From Goddard, a guy who tested rockets

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.230
to New Shepard, as in Alan Shepard,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.300
the first American to fly in
space on a suborbital flight,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.400
and now, New Glenn, as in John Glenn,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.550
the first American to orbit the earth.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.710
But come on, anyone can draw
pictures of a giant rocket

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.770
and say it's going to be super, super big

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.320
and have really powerful lasers and stuff.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.537
So, how seriously can
we actually take this?

00:06:58.537 --> 00:07:01.309
Ahh, does this answer your question?

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:04.142
(roaring engines)

00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:07.900
Whoa, design work began in 2012

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.510
to develop a partially
reusable heavy-lift rocket

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.890
and in 2015 Blue Origin
made their plans public.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.418
But they dropped another fun hint

00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:18.110
claiming this rocket
would be their smallest

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.500
of their orbital rockets.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.900
Not only that, it's maiden
voyage is scheduled for 2021

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.000
and Blue Origin is
historically fairly accurate

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.110
with their dates so this
might actually hold.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.241
New Glenn will initially launch from LC-36

00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.080
at Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station in Florida.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.373
This pad has hosted over 140 launches,

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.560
formerly launching the
Atlas II and Atlas III.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.750
Their factory at Kennedy Space
Center's Exploration Park

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.350
is located in very
close to their launchpad

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.240
only about 15 kilometers away.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.960
Blue Origin is also working
on securing a launchpad

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.930
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.520
I'll be curious if they'll
have to build another factory.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.620
Kinda doubt it.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.430
Or if they're going to ship
it through the Panama Canal

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.770
like many other rockets.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.330
New Glenn is gonna be powered by seven

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.480
of the companies BE-4 engines.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.020
The BE-4 is racing to become

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.860
the first operational
orbital class rocket engine

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.310
to run on methane.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.042
The other is SpaceX's Raptor engine.

00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:11.790
They're both crazy impressive engines,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.220
but they take on the task
in pretty different ways.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.370
The Raptor engine is a full-flow
closed cycle methane engine

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.190
that's approximately the same size

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.800
as SpaceX's Merlin engines.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.510
While the BE-4 is a closed cycle engine

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.540
that's closer in size

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.490
to the RS-25 Space Shuttle main engine,

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.080
which means it's very, very big.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.626
The BE-4 is very far
along in it's development.

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:36.240
They've successfully
hot-fired full-scale versions

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.320
of the engine many, many times,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.703
including some tests
lasting over 200 seconds.

00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:43.088
The performance of the engine
has been so attractive,

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:45.425
it was chosen by ULA to
be the engine they'll use

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.430
on their upcoming Vulcan rocket.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.170
The upper stage of the
New Glenn will feature

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.862
two vacuum optimized versions
of their BE-3 engine,

00:08:51.862 --> 00:08:55.050
that same engine that powers
their New Shepard launcher

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.245
only these will be called the BE-3Us.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:00.674
Combined they produce just
over a meganewton of thrust.

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.320
We can kinda speculate similar efficiency

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.160
to the RL10 vacuum engine.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.031
Perhaps the United States' most
prolific upper stage engine.

00:09:08.031 --> 00:09:12.250
Like the RL10 the BE-3U will
be an expander-cycle engine

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.781
but interestingly it will be
an open expander bleed cycle

00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:18.270
and not a closed cycle expander.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.980
The only other currently operating

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.610
open bleed expander cycle,
at least that I know of,

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.830
is being used by Japan on
the LE-5 series engine.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.510
Blue Origin is also planning on using

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.580
autogenous pressurization on both stages.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.100
This means they won't use an inert gas

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.400
like helium or nitrogen

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.810
to maintain pressure in the
fuel and oxidizer tanks,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.600
which can be cool because
it can decrease complexity.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.483
SpaceX is also planning
on using the same system

00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:45.410
on their upcoming
Starship and Super Heavy,

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.820
previously known as BFR.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.840
The rocket's fuselage
is made out of aluminum,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.000
like most other rockets.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.790
There were rumors of Blue Origin making

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.720
a carbon composite upper stage.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.700
But, at least for the initial version,

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.860
it's going to be aluminum.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.380
There will be a common
bulkhead on the upper stage,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.490
a technique first seen on the Saturn V.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.640
Okay, all this is pretty impressive

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.630
but we haven't got to the
coolest part of New Glenn.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.560
Blue Origin will be recovering
and reusing the first stage.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.440
Blue Origin is actually
quoting up to 25 reuses

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.200
out of these massive boosters

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.347
and seeing how well they've
done with New Shepard,

00:10:18.347 --> 00:10:21.199
I really hope that's
a metric they can hit.

00:10:21.199 --> 00:10:22.940
That's super impressive

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.830
and will certainly help
bring the cost down.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.240
They'll be doing a similar technique

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.720
to what SpaceX's Falcon 9

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.110
and Falcon Heavys do most of the time

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.837
by propulsively landing downrange

00:10:31.837 --> 00:10:33.719
on a large ship in the ocean.

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:36.930
Now before you accuse them
of ripping off SpaceX,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.770
two notes, first off, if
they did, would it matter?

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.050
Why wouldn't you replicate
an awesome system

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.510
that works so well?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.600
But, second off, just to throw
a little salt at some haters,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.690
Blue Origin actually filed a patent

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.490
for reusable rocket booster landing

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.313
on a seagoing platform in 2010.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.153
Crazy.

00:10:58.153 --> 00:11:01.030
After a bit of a dispute
between SpaceX and Blue Origin

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.970
the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.470
canceled Blue Origin's patent claim,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.110
meaning the case was lost

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.810
and SpaceX was given the go-ahead

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.020
to continue pursuing landing on a ship.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.440
But like I said, I don't
really care who did it first

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.480
or whose idea it was first,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.340
it's clearly a great idea

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.490
and it's what helps allow
a significant payload

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.900
to be lofted into orbit

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.770
while having enough propellant
margin to propulsively land.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.799
Unlike SpaceX's Autonomous
Spaceport Drone Ship,

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:29.530
Blue Origin's ship is
actually a full-blown

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.430
Stena Freighter container ship

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.740
called the LPV or
landing platform vehicle.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.450
Another notable difference is the LPV

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.079
will actually be moving
while the rocket lands on it.

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:41.500
This helps keep the
landing platform stable,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.480
allowing recovery during rough seas.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.100
And I know, you're probably
sittin' there going,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.530
that sounds impossible,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.160
how could they land on a moving ship,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.889
isn't that super, super hard?

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:52.870
Well, I actually don't think it's gonna be

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:53.750
that much different.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.050
The rocket can kind of know the trajectory

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.680
and I'm assuming they've
figured this all out

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.562
and they know how to work it
out so I think they'll be fine

00:12:02.562 --> 00:12:04.320
but I'm excited to see them do it.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.970
The actual physical landing area

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.580
is almost the same size as SpaceX's,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.123
at around 4500 square meters,

00:12:10.123 --> 00:12:12.740
although theirs is a
little skinnier and longer

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.080
and SpaceX's is closer to a square.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.315
And although the propulsive landing

00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:18.700
might actually look
similar to the Falcon 9,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.970
the hardware Blue Origin uses before that

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.270
couldn't be more different.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.580
Instead of grid fins at
the top end of the booster,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.670
the New Glenn will use some small fins

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.370
similar to the New Shepard.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.590
And although I don't think these fins

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.390
are going to retract into the booster,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.930
they are used for the same purpose

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.730
which is to steer through the atmosphere.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.060
The New Glenn also has
what could be described as

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.500
some small wings or strakes

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.260
on the lower portion of the booster.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.880
These increase the surface area,

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.740
helping allow the fuselage
to generate more lift

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.690
which can give the booster

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.240
a little more cross-range capability

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.390
and also gives the atmosphere more time

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.960
to bleed off more energy.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.590
Just like if you were sky-diving,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.690
your terminal velocity
would be a lot slower

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.177
if you were belly first
compared to feet first.

00:12:59.177 --> 00:13:02.270
We can also see SpaceX
perform a little bit of this

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.740
with their Falcon 9s,

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.790
but with some additional surface area,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.080
New Glenn might almost be able to fly

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.230
and slow down a substantial amount.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.320
Another fun thing to note is

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.610
how far downrange these
boosters will likely land.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.930
One of the fun little details

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.010
to come of this New Glenn
PayLoad User's Guide

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.850
is how long the first stage
will actually burn for.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.600
The first stage will burn
a whopping 199 seconds

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.020
or three minutes and 19 seconds.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.710
Compare that to SpaceX,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.240
whose longest burn times are often

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.980
not much over two minutes and 40 seconds.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.980
An additional 30 seconds or
more of vehicle traveling

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.980
at well over 2000 meters per second,

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.020
yeah, that's gonna put the recoveries

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.580
pretty far downrange.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.480
Now again, we don't know
the exact flight profile

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.200
or MECO velocity, but judging by the fact

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.930
that SpaceX's furthest
drone ship landing is

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.690
around 680 kilometers downrange,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.770
New Glenn will probably
land significantly further.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.123
Blue Origin's website does state

00:13:59.123 --> 00:14:00.340
that New Glenn will land

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.705
nearly a thousand kilometers downrange

00:14:02.705 --> 00:14:06.920
but I might venture to guess
it'll go beyond that even.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.900
What do you think?

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.073
Place your bets now by voting here!

00:14:10.073 --> 00:14:11.980
(lively contest music)

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.750
Okay, so now that we're finally
done giving you a rundown

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.798
and we're getting pretty heavily
into the comparison mode,

00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:19.960
it's time we actually stack up

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.280
how the New Glenn will perform

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.310
against the other launchers in this class

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.110
that are going to be flying
around the same time.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.830
Some notes here before we get started.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.730
If we include all the heavy-lift launchers

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.840
from around the world,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.530
our chart and our screen is
gonna get pretty cluttery.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.720
So we're just gonna compare

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.160
the five United States
heavy-lift launchers

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.275
that will hopefully be near operating

00:14:38.275 --> 00:14:40.070
when New Glenn goes online.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.070
All five of these rockets

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.970
either are already flying
payloads for the U.S. Air Force

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.020
or they've won contracts by the Air Force.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.740
That's another reason
why I put these together.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.760
We're also gonna be leaving out any

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.150
super heavy-lift launchers
like the Starship/Super-Heavy,

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.010
previously know as BFR and the SLS,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.580
since those rockets are in a

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.670
completely different class on their own.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.770
Ooh, I love doing these.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.020
And this one is very interesting.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.560
So first up is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.230
the only other reusable
launcher in this class.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.800
Now, next up is another
three core heavy-lifter,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.820
ULA's mighty Delta IV Heavy.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.090
Then we have ULA's other
launcher the Vulcan.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.010
Now do note, this is not the Vulcan Heavy

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.932
which won't be online for awhile longer,

00:15:20.932 --> 00:15:24.640
but even with just the standard
Vulcan with six solids,

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.120
it's right within the same specs
as all these other rockets.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.550
Then we have Northrup
Grumman Innovation Systems

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.070
upcoming Omega rocket, but a quick note,

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.672
they too will probably be making

00:15:33.672 --> 00:15:35.910
a heavy version of the Omega.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.890
But, who knows when that will come out

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.410
and there's really not
that much information out

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.230
about this rocket so I had to
fudge a few of these numbers

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.090
but I think they're pretty close

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.850
but take them all with
a little grain of salt.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.810
And of course we have
Blue Origin's New Glenn,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.399
which if you need a recap on this rocket,

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:55.632
just rewind five minutes.

00:15:55.632 --> 00:15:58.728
So let's start with the most
obvious thing, their heights.

00:15:58.728 --> 00:16:02.970
That New Glenn is massive,
standing at 95 meters tall,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.970
it's much taller than Falcon
Heavy at 70, Delta IV Heavy 71,

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:13.130
Vulcan at 66 and the
Omega at 60 meters tall.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.900
New Glenn is also the widest

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.543
by quite a large amount too,

00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:21.200
Now compare that to 3.6 meters, well,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.020
times three in the Falcon Heavy,

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.380
five meters, again times
three of the Delta IV Heavy,

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.730
5.4 meters of the Vulcan
and five meters of Omega.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.963
Next we need to check
out their fairing sizes.

00:16:32.963 --> 00:16:36.010
Now here's where New Glenn
is in a class of it's own.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.176
It's internal volume is massive,

00:16:38.176 --> 00:16:41.970
a whopping 458 cubic meters

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.007
compared to the Falcon Heavy

00:16:43.007 --> 00:16:45.680
which shares the same
relatively small fairing

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.930
as the Falcon 9 at 145 cubic meters.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.130
Then there's the Delta IV

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.480
which can have up to 233 cubic meters.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.700
Now I can't find the exact
numbers on Vulcan or Omega

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.370
but I believe they're
probably going to be around

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.780
that same 230 cubic meter-ish region.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.720
This massive fairing allows the New Glenn

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.990
to do dual payloads

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.940
with up to 10,000 kilograms

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.010
in either the upper or
lower payload births.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.970
This is something that ECA's Ariane 5

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.860
has done very well with

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.980
and now it looks like
New Glenn's taking a note

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.813
from it's playbook.

00:17:15.813 --> 00:17:17.300
Now let's talk engines.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.180
There couldn't be a wider variety

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.840
of engines on these rockets.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.730
The New Glenn, of course,

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.390
has those seven BE-4
engines running metholox

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.510
on the first stage

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.110
and two BE-3Us on the upper
stage running hydrolox.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.730
The Falcon Heavy has 27 Merlin 1Ds

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.630
running keralox on the first stage

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.900
and a single vacuum optimized Merlin 1D

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.950
on the upper stage running keralox also.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.860
The Delta IV Heavy has three RS-68As

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.450
running hydrolox in an upper stage

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.515
with an RL-10B also running hydrolox.

00:17:44.515 --> 00:17:46.400
Then we have the Vulcan

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.660
which actually has the same
main engines as the New Glenn,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.294
the BE-4, but again it only has two.

00:17:52.294 --> 00:17:54.600
However, you can have up to six

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.940
powerful strap-on solid rocket boosters.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.308
It's upper stage has two
RL-10Cs running hydrolox.

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:01.810
Then there's the Omega rocket

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.470
which is just solids on solids

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.710
and a dash of hydrolox on top.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.378
It's a three-stage rocket
with a Castor 600 main booster

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:10.340
which is similar to the Space Shuttle's

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.020
solid rocket boosters
but only has two segments

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.280
instead of four.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.660
Then it has a Castor 300 solid stage

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.530
and then it's upper stage
is similar to the Vulcan

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.900
as it too is RL-10C powered

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.630
but down to just one,
which also runs hydrolox.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.350
And it can have up to six

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.410
GEM 63XL strap-on solid
rocket boosters as well.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.560
Okay, now let's get on to the fun stuff.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.790
Thrust.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.090
The New Glenn delivers a
more middle-of-the-road

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.674
16,800 kilonewtons of thrust,

00:18:38.674 --> 00:18:40.750
much, much less than the Falcon Heavy

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.467
which has 22,815 kilonewtons

00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:46.280
but that's much more
than the Delta IV Heavy

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.600
at 9,420 kilonewtons.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.052
The Vulcan almost ironically comes in

00:18:50.052 --> 00:18:54.190
at virtually the exact same
amount of thrust as New Glenn

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.630
despite having literally
the exact same engines,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.200
well but, two instead of seven.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.870
But what it lacks in BE-4s
it makes up for in SRBs,

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.710
winding up with almost the exact same

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.150
total thrust at 16,812.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.500
The Omega rocket has a combined

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.180
21,798 kilonewtons of thrust
with seven SRB's firing.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.770
That sounds crazy.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.940
I can't wait to hear one of those fly.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.780
Okay, so thrust is great and all,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.400
but what can these things
actually deliver to orbit.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.690
Now before we get too far into this,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.720
I do want to point out,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.670
I'm going to be quoting
the three booster recovery

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.330
for Falcon Heavy, one at sea, two at land,

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.010
as I think that's how
we're gonna see it fly

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.340
most of the time.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.650
And we're also going to be
quoting the first stage recovery

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.150
of New Glenn, as I don't
think they ever intend

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.110
to expend one.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.710
So keep that in mind when
we're looking at those numbers.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.228
So first, how much can these
rockets get to low earth orbit?

00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:47.830
New Glenn can launch a
massive 45 tonnes to LEO,

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.274
Falcon Heavy 30, the Delta
IV Heavy can take 28 tonnes,

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:55.070
the Vulcan 27.5 tonnes, and the Omega,

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.910
I can't find an exact number on

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.190
but it's probably around 30 tonnes.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.700
And lastly, let's compare
how much they can shoot off

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.310
to a geostationary transfer orbit.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.110
New Glenn can loft 13.6 tonnes,
Falcon Heavy eight tonnes,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.760
Delta IV Heavy 14
tonnes, Vulcan 13 tonnes,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.090
and Omega 10.1 tonnes.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.120
A few reasons we see
such massive differences

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.850
in capabilities between these vehicles

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.805
again is due to their recoverability,

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:21.880
the efficiency of their engines

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.250
and in some cases their physical size.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.000
And of course, the other
big factor here is price.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.630
And at this point we just don't
have good enough information

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.910
on all these launchers

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.470
or at least not accurate enough

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.530
to wisely factor them in here.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.210
So that being said,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.650
I do think Falcon Heavy
will be the one to beat,

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.960
at least as far as price goes.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.930
I'll be very curious if New Glenn

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.700
or any of the others
will be able to beat it.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.700
So, all in all, New Glenn is shaping up

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.270
to be a super impressive rocket.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.190
By the numbers, it will be the largest

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.080
and most capable rocket
flying when it goes online.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.013
Well that is of course
unless SLS makes it online,

00:20:57.013 --> 00:21:00.330
which I highly doubt it will do by 2021

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.646
or if SpaceX's Super Heavy
starts flying by then,

00:21:03.646 --> 00:21:06.821
which we'll see, but the race is on.

00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:09.050
I have a feeling the
New Glenn is going to be

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.480
impressively cost competitive as well,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.243
seeing how they're planning
to reuse the booster 25 times,

00:21:14.243 --> 00:21:16.970
how they can do massive dual payloads

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.680
and with streamlined operations,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.256
like having their factory
right next to their launchpad,

00:21:21.256 --> 00:21:23.890
this might shake up the industry.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.120
I for one am extremely
excited to see this thing fly.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.862
And as you may or may not know by now,

00:21:29.862 --> 00:21:31.810
I'm not really a big fan of tribalism

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.602
or just picking a favorite
rocket or a favorite company,

00:21:34.602 --> 00:21:37.690
so of course, I'm going to
be cheering on Blue Origin

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.320
and their New Glenn rocket
all the way to orbit.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.300
2021 can't come soon enough.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.980
So I'm sure the comment
section is full of Jeff who,

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.774
and other whatevers about
Blue Origin and New Glenn.

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.830
I don't really care what you guys think.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.760
I'm super, super excited for this

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.390
and I'm just a big fan of being positive

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.700
and cheering on everyone
in the aerospace industry.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.860
So I encourage our community
here to do the same thing.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.670
So while you're down there
in the comments section,

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.990
let me know if you have
any other questions

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.330
about Blue Origin, about
rockets, spaceflight,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.510
or even just give me feedback

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.866
on if you think these videos
are improving in quality

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:11.740
or what things you think I'm
missing or could improve on.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.270
As always, I owe a super huge thank you

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.600
to my Patreon supporters

00:22:16.465 --> 00:22:18.030
for helping me do all of this stuff.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.750
There's a lot of work
that goes into scripting

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.596
and research, shooting and editing

00:22:21.596 --> 00:22:23.580
and I couldn't do it without you guys.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.620
There's even Patreons that are

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.550
sitting in my exclusive Discord Channel

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.370
or sitting in our exclusive Subreddit

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.290
that help me script and research.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.730
If you want to help contribute

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.710
or even get access to
exclusive livestreams,

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.300
please visit
patreon.com/everydayastronaut.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.133
Thank you.

00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:39.966
And while you're online, be sure

00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:41.510
and check out my brand new web store

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.150
for things like these.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.793
Grid Fin Not-A-Coasters.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.140
Now notice these are not coasters

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.300
because they have holes in 'em

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.360
and that means the liquid can
drip through to your surface.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.500
But I do promise they're
gonna keep your drink elevated

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.790
exactly this high off of
whatever surface they're on,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.030
making them Grid Fin
Not-A-Coaster drink elevators.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.300
And there's also lots of
other fun stuff like shirts,

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.540
hats, mugs, prints of rocket launches

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.013
and other original photographs,

00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:10.303
as well as stickers and patches.

00:23:10.303 --> 00:23:13.000
There's tons of new stuff
on my brand new web store.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.490
You need to check it out.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.190
Everydayastronaut.com/shop.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.710
And finally I did it.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.822
I got my music on line for you guys.

00:23:18.822 --> 00:23:20.260
You've been asking forever

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.430
to get it up on iTunes and
Spotify and yada, yada, yada.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.260
I finally have Maximum
Aerodynamic Pressure,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.030
my first seven song EP,

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.689
available, hopefully
everywhere you listen to music.

00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:32.990
So search for it, listen to it

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.240
while you're doing some science,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.570
maybe you're studying,

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.840
maybe you're building a rocket,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.000
maybe you're floating in space,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.440
maybe you're on a road trip,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.140
whatever it might be, check it out.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.400
Let me know what you think

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.210
and thank you so much for listening.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.280
That's everydayastronaut.com/music

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.740
or wherever you listen to music
hopefully you can find it.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.573
Thanks everybody.

00:23:50.573 --> 00:23:51.406
That does it for me.

00:23:51.406 --> 00:23:52.806
I'm Tim Dodd, the Everyday Astronaut,

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:55.720
bringing space down to
earth for everyday people.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.303
