00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.609
- Okay, give me a good spin.

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:03.696
(laughter)
(applause)

00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:06.117
Help, my house is on fire!

00:00:06.117 --> 00:00:08.291
Yeah, Brittany's a firefighter, for sure.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.939
("In the Hall of the Mountain
King" by Edvard Grieg)

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.197
- Hi, I'm Timmy Rogar, I'm a
drag queen and a bartender.

00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:18.089
- My name is Alex Alexander.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.259
- I'm Ilah Dizon.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.926
- I am Crystal Reed,
and I work here at Cut.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.920
- I fucking love what I do.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.702
Totally, I can't imagine a
dumber way to make money.

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:34.535
- I'm doing some sort of guessing?

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:40.784
- Okay, am I gonna have
like, a list to choose from?

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:45.251
- Oh, really?

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.758
Wow, porn producer?

00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:53.000
- Bounty hunter?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.245
Horse listener?

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:55.279
- Is this real?

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:59.258
Some of these jobs I
didn't know were real jobs.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:01.721
- Alright, do you wanna come up first?

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:02.554
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:03.421
- Great meeting you.

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.050
- That's a good handshake.
- Thank you.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.931
- Do you shake a lot of hands at work?

00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.203
- I do.

00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:11.531
- Give me one more good one, okay.

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:12.403
- Can I touch you?

00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:13.569
- Yeah, you sure can.

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.043
- Okay, do you feel okay?

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:17.011
- I'm okay with it.
- Okay.

00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:18.603
- Wait, let me see your fingers.

00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:20.371
No you can't be the firefighter.

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.571
- I really just want to
get rid of tarot reader.

00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:24.684
I don't know what that is.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.020
- You know like the psychics.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.251
- How do you feel about God?

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:29.701
- Uh, he's a cool guy.

00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:32.131
- Can you sing like a gospel thing?

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.436
I'll give you a beat, go ahead.

00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:39.763
- (clapping) I'm sorry I can't sing.

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:40.718
I don't...
- Okay.

00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:42.901
- I'm going with pastor,
I feel good about pastor.

00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.048
- Because you failed all the tests,

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:46.619
I think you're,
(laughter)

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.971
I think you're a software engineer.

00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:50.384
- Oh man, so this is literally just what

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:51.952
you're labeled as forever now.

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:52.785
- I know, man.

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:54.443
- Okay, next.

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:57.516
Oh, you're definitely a horse listener,

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.741
because you look like you're from nature.

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:00.934
- Aww.

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:05.126
- Maybe she might be the
porn producer (laughs).

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.549
- No it's not, it's just like,

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.331
it's versus what I would have thought,

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:11.261
y'know like a heavier set
guy who breathes heavy like,

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.830
(breathes heavily)
(laughter)

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.189
- Do you like what you do?

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.120
- I love what I do.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.909
- I want you to do a little
motion of like brushing a horse.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.021
(laughter)
- Okay, okay, not very good.

00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:25.375
- Have you ever ridden a horse before?

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.274
- I have.

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:27.675
- You're a horse listener, for sure.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:28.866
- We'll go with ER nurse.

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:32.234
- She's probably the
firefighter isn't she, probably.

00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:33.830
- Do you work with a lot of people?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.663
- Yes.

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:36.244
- Do you like people?

00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:37.077
- Some.

00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:38.071
- Do you know CPR?

00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:39.613
- I am certified in CPR.

00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:41.583
- What's your favorite porn genre?

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:42.416
- Anime.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.617
- Right on.

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:47.735
- I feel like maybe
you're a porn producer,

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.741
this is the trick.
(laughter)

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:52.402
This is the trick.

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:53.463
- What's your favorite book?

00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:56.951
- I like to read reference,
so like studying new topics.

00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:59.597
- You're hard, I think you
- That's what she said.

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:01.324
(laughter)

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:04.364
- That's a good one, okay she's
definitely a porn producer.

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:05.834
- Can I go with software engineer?

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:07.135
- I'm gonna go tarot reader.

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:09.284
I still barely know what it is.

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:11.284
I'm gonna go tarot reader, for sure.

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:14.061
- Okay, ooh, (hisses)

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:17.112
- Wait, before, you have to judge.

00:03:17.112 --> 00:03:19.004
- Okay.
(laughter)

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:22.352
Teach me your ways with makeup, oh my god.

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:24.602
(sniffing)

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:27.394
- You smell neutral, I smell nothing.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:28.695
- Because you have good style,

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.781
I would say you're a bartender.

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.871
- I think I want to go with ER nurse.

00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:34.704
- How come?

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:37.170
- 'Cause everything else is
like, it would kinda make sense,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.164
I think that's like the most
thing that I wouldn't expect.

00:03:39.164 --> 00:03:40.757
- You're wearing lots of crystals.

00:03:40.757 --> 00:03:43.031
I'm gonna go with tarot reader.

00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:43.983
- Deal.

00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:46.594
- Hello, fellow Asian.

00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:48.263
(laughter)

00:03:48.263 --> 00:03:50.143
- What's your favorite porn genre?

00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:52.863
- I don't watch porn,
- Oh wait yeah.

00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:55.574
- But I have seen two girls
and one cup, and that was...

00:03:55.574 --> 00:03:57.215
(laughter)
(clapping)

00:03:57.215 --> 00:03:59.152
- Oh my god, I don't know, I was,

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:00.648
I'm starting to question whether or not

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:03.316
you're the pastor and now I'm like, no!

00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:05.914
- Do you have long hours?
- Yes.

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:06.775
- Are you tired?

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:08.494
- Yes, stressed.
- Constantly?

00:04:08.494 --> 00:04:09.674
Definitely ER nurse.

00:04:09.674 --> 00:04:12.623
- You've got riding boots, gorgeous ombre.

00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:15.023
Wendy the horse whisperer, listener.

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:16.854
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:18.183
- You seem very friendly.

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.223
- I'm friendly.

00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:21.943
- And you got like that
badass, like Denzel's like

00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:23.982
brother kind of thing going on.

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:25.262
(laughter)

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:27.474
- Can you drop and give me five?

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.497
Okay, can I sit on you?
- Let's go.

00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:31.263
(laughter)

00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:34.036
- Ready?
- I'm ready (screams)

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.185
Okay, okay, okay.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:36.868
- Pretend like you're
trying to bounty hunt me,

00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:38.327
and like I'm trying to run away.

00:04:38.327 --> 00:04:39.494
Try to get me.

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:41.716
(laughter)

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.148
- No, I'm still going with bounty hunter,

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:45.188
you got that calm, cold, collected.

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:46.021
- I'll take it.

00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:47.195
- Imma go firefighter.

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:48.646
- So doing pushups with somebody on

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:50.086
my back makes me a firefighter?

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.286
- Look, it's not a perfect science, look.

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:53.908
(laughter)

00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:54.826
- Congrats,
- Yeah.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:56.178
- I hope you like your job.

00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:58.196
- Oh, you look intimidating.

00:04:58.196 --> 00:04:59.725
- Thank you.
(laughter)

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:00.988
- I forgot what that's called.

00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:02.180
- It's a bolo.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.588
- [Interviewer] Does that mean anything?

00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:05.559
- Yes, bounty hunter.

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.086
(laughter)

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:10.526
- (hissing)
(humming)

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:12.596
I wish I wouldn't have gave away pastor.

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:14.156
- I went to a Christian college.

00:05:14.156 --> 00:05:15.316
- What did you study?

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:16.149
- Psychology.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.858
- What's the longest
shift you've ever worked?

00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:19.428
- 36 hours.
- Yeah.

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:20.695
Brittany's a firefighter.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.228
Do you want to twirl me?

00:05:22.228 --> 00:05:24.043
(laughter)
(applause)

00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:26.210
Help, my house is on fire!

00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:29.908
- I'm gonna go bartender now.

00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:30.980
- Hello, I'm Sir Mark.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.308
- Hi, Sir Mark?
- Uh huh.

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:36.628
I have titles of knighthood
in eight countries.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:37.660
- So like they did the...

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.337
- Yeah.
- Huh.

00:05:39.337 --> 00:05:42.788
- Tell me about your sign and
how you feel about the moon.

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:44.570
(laughter)

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.798
- Well, I'm another air sign, Aquarian.

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:47.631
- Okay.

00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:49.707
- And uh, I love the moon.

00:05:49.707 --> 00:05:51.505
- There's only two things left.

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:53.980
Bounty hunter and porn producer.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.988
You could be both of those,
man, you really could.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.039
(laughter)

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.868
- Sir Mark's a total bartender name,

00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.077
I could see you at like a
cute little hole in the wall,

00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:03.879
talking to people about their problems.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.247
- What does a bounty hunter do?

00:06:05.247 --> 00:06:09.622
- They get hired out to chase
people who have warrants.

00:06:09.622 --> 00:06:11.202
- Yep, you're a bounty hunter.

00:06:11.202 --> 00:06:12.922
- You're like really gorgeous.

00:06:12.922 --> 00:06:16.071
- That highlight is magical.
- Thanks.

00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:17.202
- Although, like your hair,

00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:19.432
I feel like is too long
to be a bounty hunter.

00:06:19.432 --> 00:06:20.659
- I could put it up in a bun.

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:21.933
- There's only one thing on the list left,

00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:24.173
so I'm not sure, it's porn producer.

00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:27.292
And, you know what, I
think you could do that.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:30.781
- Do porn producers star in porn too?

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:32.512
- How do you feel about vaginas?

00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:34.722
- Um, I mean, I like mine.

00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:37.792
- You're stern, you look
like you get shit done.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:39.389
I'm gonna say you're the porn producer.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.222
- Okay.

00:06:40.222 --> 00:06:42.555
- Aunjoli the porn producer.

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:47.585
Would you book me?
(laughs)

00:06:49.047 --> 00:06:51.163
- I don't feel good.

00:06:51.163 --> 00:06:54.568
- I think I got all of them wrong.

00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:55.720
- Yes.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.936
- I can?

00:06:56.936 --> 00:07:01.400
- You're the bounty hunter,
and you're the pastor.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.317
- Tarot reader, uh huh.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.812
- I'm gonna trade you two.

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:07.570
- You know what, I want you two to switch.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.130
- You're the pastor 'cause you had that

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.750
whole knight situation happening.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.971
- Because no one suspects the hot lady

00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.800
to be in like software engineer,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.859
'cause I don't know, men apparently are

00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:19.581
the only ones in that industry.

00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:23.081
- I'm just gonna stop messing with it now.

00:07:24.535 --> 00:07:25.452
- Like two.

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.872
- How many hands went up?

00:07:34.498 --> 00:07:36.637
(screams and laughs)

00:07:36.637 --> 00:07:38.058
- What?!
(laughter)

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:39.370
Get out!

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.490
- Okay, it's like half.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.407
- (sighs) Alright.

00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:49.861
- This is like, an M. Night
Shyamalan movie right now.

00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:52.579
(laughter)

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:54.249
- Okay, 'cause I got a lot of questions.

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:55.550
(laughter)

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.061
- Alright, mister pastor.

00:07:57.061 --> 00:07:58.440
- What kind of congregation do you...

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.160
- Uh, it's a Christian congregation.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.339
- Yeah, awesome.

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:02.381
- Will you sing now?

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:07.381
I know this song is like
(singing a tune and clapping)

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.272
- [Both] ♪ Of my heart. ♪

00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:13.872
♪ I want to see you ♪

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:15.469
(clapping)

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:18.072
♪ I want to see you. ♪

00:08:18.072 --> 00:08:19.552
- What made you want to be a pastor?

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:21.000
- I was in high school
and I was just kinda

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.381
going through like a depression,

00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:25.150
and the church kinda
helped me through that.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.422
- Yeah.
- And so, I figured,

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.659
I want to help kids who are
going through the same stuff,

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:30.600
so, yeah.
- Totally.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.539
Well, that's awesome, good for you.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.941
(clapping)

00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:35.821
- When did you decide to be a firefighter?

00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:37.669
- I've been a firefighter
for about three years, so...

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.502
- Okay.

00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:40.528
- What's like the gender
balance where you work?

00:08:40.528 --> 00:08:42.730
- Uh, 4% of us are women nationwide.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.432
- That's it? Wow.
- Yeah, so seven

00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:47.832
at my department, seven
women, and then about 130 men.

00:08:47.832 --> 00:08:49.357
- (sighs) Sounds like a dream come true.

00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:51.232
- Can you do the firefighter carry?

00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:52.873
- Maybe, I don't know, I'm wearing heels.

00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:55.590
(screaming)

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.730
- Probably just like that.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.010
(laughter)

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.832
(applause)

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.507
- So you're a horse listener,
do you own your own horses

00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:05.240
or do you help people, or both?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.729
- Both!
- That makes sense.

00:09:06.729 --> 00:09:08.431
- But you listen to the horses?

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:09.264
- Right.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:10.872
It's less talking to the horse,

00:09:10.872 --> 00:09:13.770
and more listening to the
horse to have them tell me

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.581
why they don't fit into
the domestic world.

00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:18.032
- Did you have to get a degree for that?

00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:19.730
- I did an eight year internship with

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.560
a world-renowned horse whisperer.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.540
- Horses are amazing.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.168
- They're unicorns, you can only see

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:26.381
their horns if you're also magical.

00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:27.368
- I wanna hug you.

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:29.903
(laughter)

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.430
So, the crystal didn't mean anything?

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.263
- It didn't.

00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:35.421
- How old are you?

00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:36.998
- 23.

00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:39.120
- How are you already an ER nurse?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.912
- Well I got a really incredible

00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:42.300
scholarship to go to school,
- That's so cool.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.716
- And otherwise I would
never have been able to.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.397
- When you go to work, do you wear this?

00:09:46.397 --> 00:09:49.168
- I don't do full glam,
but I'm always on a lip.

00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:51.061
- Do you deal with any like issues

00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:52.950
with your queer identity at work?

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.403
- Um, yeah I work in a
conservative healthcare system,

00:09:55.403 --> 00:09:58.616
and it's really hard because
patients can be rude.

00:09:58.616 --> 00:10:01.282
- Even though you're trying
to help them? They're trash,

00:10:01.282 --> 00:10:02.115
not really.
- Even though I paid money

00:10:02.115 --> 00:10:03.619
to go to school.
- Like everybody else.

00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:05.460
- I just want to help them.
(laughter)

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.112
- To be fighting that fight in places

00:10:07.112 --> 00:10:10.136
where it's not easy is so brave.

00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:11.490
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.450
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.206
So you're a software engineer?
- Mmhm.

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:17.010
- Do you do like, game development or?

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.440
- So we develop intermapping software,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.352
so it's like Google Maps but indoors.

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:25.443
- Can you find people with that?

00:10:25.443 --> 00:10:26.276
- No.
- Do you work for the

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:27.384
government?
- No.

00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:28.692
(laughter)
- Just kidding.

00:10:28.692 --> 00:10:30.920
- Are there any like roadblocks
because of your gender?

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.181
- Yeah, a little bit, but
you just have to speak up.

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:35.541
- Mmhm.
- Yeah.

00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:36.912
- Bartender?!
- Yeah.

00:10:36.912 --> 00:10:38.152
- That totally makes sense.

00:10:38.152 --> 00:10:39.512
- You were like pretty cool,

00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:41.290
so maybe I should've guessed that.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.350
- You ever witness bad Tinder dates?

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.751
- Every day at work.
(laughter)

00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:47.810
Every single day.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.621
- Do you enjoy it? Do you...
- I love it.

00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:51.067
- I love it too.
- It's the best,

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.032
it's like a chef but with bottles,

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:54.792
and you get to talk shit at the same time.

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:56.167
- Yeah, exactly.

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:57.902
- Bounty hunter!
- Yeah.

00:10:57.902 --> 00:11:00.021
- I got you right, you're
the only one I got right.

00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:01.690
- Have you ever shot anybody?
- No.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.523
- Do you get to handcuff

00:11:02.523 --> 00:11:03.748
people on a regular basis?
- Yes.

00:11:03.748 --> 00:11:05.250
- Have you ever been in
a high speed car chase?

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.083
- Yes.

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:07.585
- Oh my gosh, do you wear disguises?

00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:08.418
- All the time.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.592
- Dude, that's so scary

00:11:09.592 --> 00:11:11.541
because I would never see you coming.

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:13.999
- Do people cry a lot
when you drag them away?

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:15.740
- I've never had anybody not cry.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.149
- Really?
- Yes. Everybody always cries.

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:20.090
- Do you know any other
female bounty hunters?

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.908
- I do, I know a lot of
really good ones, yeah.

00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:24.330
- Well, thank you for your service.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.496
- Oh, appreciate it.

00:11:25.496 --> 00:11:27.194
- This is like a job fair.

00:11:27.194 --> 00:11:29.200
- Tarot reader, Sir Mark.
- Yeah.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.099
- I shoulda known with the name.

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:33.408
- Wait, you told me
earlier that you are like

00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:35.010
a person of God,
- I am.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.680
- and in the Bible it says
you're not allowed to like

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.712
worship anything other than God.

00:11:39.712 --> 00:11:43.449
- There's no worshipping of the
tarot or anything like that,

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:46.050
it's just a simple
scientific procedure which,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.820
each of the 78 cards reverberates
with a certain energy.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.552
If I have the clients choose the card,

00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:53.760
and it's just like a
magnet, do-do-do-do-do.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.879
- Interesting.
- And it just,

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:56.652
tells exactly what's going on.

00:11:56.652 --> 00:11:59.370
- I really want a tarot
reading, like I really do.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.529
- Come on down to the shop.

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:02.466
- I know right, I need to.

00:12:02.466 --> 00:12:03.299
- Oh!

00:12:04.687 --> 00:12:07.269
Yeah, you were like way
too hot to be like any...

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:08.712
- But I'm not a porn star so...

00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:09.945
- Yeah, but you're,

00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:11.243
you run the show.
- Right.

00:12:11.243 --> 00:12:12.810
- What do you do as a producer?

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.689
- Basically, I make sure that
the people that are applying

00:12:16.689 --> 00:12:18.461
aren't like underage,
- Yeah.

00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:21.131
- Have any like fraud stuff going on.

00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:22.430
- Do you work with PornHub?

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.030
- I do, I do.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.288
- Number one channel.
- I uh,

00:12:25.288 --> 00:12:28.701
like monitor about 5,000
different live cam sites so,

00:12:28.701 --> 00:12:31.168
- Wow.
- that is our like main...

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.156
- Do you make good money off of it?

00:12:33.156 --> 00:12:36.061
- Not as much as the performers, but yeah.

00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:37.570
- So yeah, is that like...

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.040
- Pay-per-minute.
- Pay-per-minute?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.029
- So, anywhere from $1.99 a
minute to like $14.99 a minute.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:47.194
- Oh, you could, you can, they, yes.

00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:48.619
You should do it.

00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:50.781
Let's talk after.
- I just got a new computer.

00:12:50.781 --> 00:12:52.694
- Oh (laughs)
- So...

00:12:52.694 --> 00:12:54.690
- What is the kinkiest
shit you've produced?

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.261
- I've seen prolapsed assholes,

00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:58.929
so I've seen like
- Prolapsed? (vomiting)

00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:01.800
Oh my god, I say cover your ears pastor!

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.050
(laughter)

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:08.301
(applause)

00:13:08.301 --> 00:13:10.884
- Thanks for sharing, you guys.

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:17.947
- Thank you guys, sorry that took so long.

00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:21.540
How did I not guess anyone
except for one person?
