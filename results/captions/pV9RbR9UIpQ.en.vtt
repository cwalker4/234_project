00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.480
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.420
I very much appreciate it.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.740
I’ll be heading to Alabama
on Friday.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.430
So I think some of you
will be joining me,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.800
but we’ll be going down Friday.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.250
And we’ll let you know times
and when we’re leaving,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.490
and how long we’ll be there.
It’s been a tragic situation,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.070
but a lot of good work
is being done.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.930
And we’ve been in constant
touch with the Governor,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.250
and also the Governor
of Georgia.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.930
And so we’ll be
going to the area.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.200
We’ll be — Alabama
and the general area.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.590
We’ll see Governor Ivey.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.060
So that’ll be on Friday.
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.670
And we’re here today
to confront a solemn crisis

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.570
that requires urgent
national action.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.470
In a few moments, I will sign
an executive order addressing

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.510
one of our nation’s
most heartbreaking

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.680
tragedies:
veteran suicide.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.810
Our mission is to mobilize
every level of American society

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.850
to save the lives
of our great veterans

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.240
and support our heroes in need.
We’ve worked very hard on Choice

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.030
for the veterans
and so many other programs,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.610
and done a really great job
in so many ways.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.770
Veteran suicide is something
that’s been an incredible thing

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.310
to watch —
hard to believe. It’s tragic.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.490
Today we can help end
this crisis.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740
I would like to thank
Secretary Wilkie

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.200
for being here today with us.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.340
He has done a fantastic job
as Secretary.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.320
He is making tremendous
progress at the VA.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.580
We are also profoundly grateful
to be joined

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.200
by many of our nation’s leading
veteran service organizations —

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.340
the best — and all of the state
and local veteran leaders.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.480
And I want to thank everybody
very much for being here.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.850
Thank you very much.
Thank you all very much.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120
I know how hard
you’ve been working on this.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.400
Veteran suicide is a tragedy
of staggering proportions.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.600
Hard to believe an average
of 20 veterans

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.000
and service members take
their lives every single day.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.700
Who would believe
that’s possible?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.440
There are more than 6,000
veteran suicides per year.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.640
The suicide rate among veterans
is 1.5 times greater

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.390
than that
for non-veteran adults,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.820
and the suicide rate
for post-9/11 soldiers

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.460
has increased significantly over
the last ten-year period.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.370
To every veteran: I want you
to know

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.480
that you have an entire nation

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.720
of more than 300 million
people behind you.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.710
You will never,
ever be forgotten.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.950
We are with you all the way.
I think you know that.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.570
Supporting veterans is a very,
very important thing to me.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.530
And it’s been very important —
from my campaign, from day one,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.910
and from before my campaign —
but from day one.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.940
Supporting veterans in distress

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.780
is a critical priority
for our entire administration —

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.400
everybody in the administration.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.670
Last year, I signed into law
the largest funding bill

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.640
for the VA in its history,
which included $8.6 billion

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.130
for veterans
in mental health services.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.660
I also signed
an executive order

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.110
directing the Department
of Defense,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.090
Veteran Affairs,
and Homeland Security

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.730
to ensure our veterans
have seamless access

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.870
to mental health care and
suicide prevention resources.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.820
These efforts focus
on veterans the first year

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.240
after they separate
from military service

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.260
when they are
at the heightened-risk area.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.710
The White House VA hotline has
fielded more than 200,000 calls

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.960
and successfully resolved
93 percent

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.120
of the concerns
our veterans brought to them.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.679
And they work very hard.
It’s been very, very effective.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.350
We secured $206 million for VA
suicide prevention programming.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.770
Every VA medical center now

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.340
offers same-day
emergency mental health care.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.660
These are crucial steps,
but unfortunately most veterans

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.990
who die by suicide have not been
in the care of the VA.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.540
Many of them don’t know
about the programs that we have

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.900
or the programs
that we’ve instituted.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.390
In fact, nearly 70 percent
of those lost to suicide

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.390
have not received care
from the VA

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.390
in the previous two years.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.720
They’re just not aware
of those great strides.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.680
They’re just not aware.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.930
It’s just not something
that’s on their mind.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.590
This grave problem can only be
solved

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.690
if our entire country works

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.980
together to build communities
that truly serve, support,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.410
and protect our veterans
from the first moment

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.810
they return to civilian life.
It’s so different.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.030
They leave a military life
and they go to civilian life,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.730
and it’s just much different.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.900
We must keep our promises
to those who keep us free.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.770
Through today’s action,
I am launching the PREVENTS

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.280
Initiative — “The President’s
Roadmap to Empower Veterans

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.730
and End the National Tragedy
of Suicide”.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.020
This order creates a new
Cabinet-level task force

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.770
co-chaired by Secretary Wilkie.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.220
The task force will create
a comprehensive,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.040
national public health roadmap

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.250
that brings together
federal and local government,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.770
along with private
sector partners,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.770
to improve the quality of life
for our veterans

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.380
and turn the tide
on this terrible crisis.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.020
We’re being helped greatly
by our strong economy.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.720
Our economy is very,
very powerful

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.220
and makes it a lot easier
for people to get jobs,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.280
including veterans.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.930
And a lot of companies
are actually giving priority,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.430
at our request,
to veterans

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.830
and they’re very happy
with the results.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.510
The task force will be charged

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.720
with developing
a national research strategy

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.340
so that we can more effectively
identify, intervene,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.400
and help veterans
during a time of need.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.020
By investing in research
and scientific advances,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.700
we can better understand the
trauma our brave soldiers face

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.970
and how to restore their faith
and their health.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.660
Under this order,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.530
my administration
will also work with Congress

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.900
to pass legislation providing
resources and assistance

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.850
in the form of grants
to communities

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.410
so that they can
empower veterans

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.870
with critical information,
services,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.330
and networks
of total, total support.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.500
We’re going to take care
of our veterans.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.610
We’re working so hard on this.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.310
We’re making so much progress

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.270
and we’re going to take care
of them like never before.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.920
Veterans are America’s
greatest national treasure

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.800
and a lot of people
understand that;

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.320
some people don’t.
I will tell you,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.490
our single-greatest
national treasure.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.089
They kept us safe and we’re
going to keep them safe.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.160
They courageously fulfill
their duties to our nation.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.010
Now we must fulfill
our duties to them.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.520
Here with us today
is Frank Larkin.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.120
His son, Ryan,
followed in his footsteps

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.370
to become a Navy SEAL.
Terrific, terrific young man.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.600
Tragically,
Ryan is no longer with us.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.380
Frank, we’d love
to have you come up

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.530
and just say a few words
about your great son, please.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.230
Frank.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.360
Mr. Larkin:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.110
And thank you to our warriors
and veterans present today;

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.560
along with the veterans
service organizations —

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.010
our partners who
are working hard every day

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.460
to make a difference for
our veterans who are in need;

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.090
to the other government
leaders here today;

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.890
and to the survivors of suicide
who live every day with the pain

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.590
from the loss
of their loved one.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.350
Ryan was a decorated
high-performing Navy SEAL

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.050
who suddenly went
over the edge.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.350
In the two years
that we tried to rescue him,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.600
he was prescribed
over 40 different drugs.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.000
His treatment
was all psychiatric-

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.850
and behavioral-health focused.
All along, Ryan kept saying

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.980
that something was wrong
with his head,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.650
but nobody was listening.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.850
Months before he took his life,

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.920
he expressed a wish to donate
his body for TBI research.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.920
Ryan was concerned
about his teammates

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.200
and the similar struggles

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.840
that they were experiencing
following both training

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.700
for combat
and combat operations overseas.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.820
Many are burdened
with invisible wounds

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.920
as a consequence
of going into harm’s way

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.700
into the service
of this nation.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.900
After Ryan’s death,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.680
we learned that he suffered
from an undiagnosed,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.730
severe level
of microscopic brain injury

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.570
uniquely related
to military blast exposure

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.210
from firing our weapons systems,
rockets, mortars,

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.590
using explosive
breaching charges,

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.570
and being exposed to improvised
explosive devices — IEDs.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.060
We are currently challenged
by the fact

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.930
that this newly discovered
pattern of brain injury

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.680
cannot be seen
in a living person —

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.390
not unlike the contact
sport players

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.390
who are trying to understand
the effects of microscopic CTE,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.330
which also cannot be seen
in a living player.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.930
This executive order is defining
a national strategy

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.430
that needs to resemble
a Manhattan-like Project.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.880
We need the science
to illuminate our path forward.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.210
I am convinced
that we can solve this.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.420
It is not because we lack

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.620
the intellectual capability
or capacity;

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.100
in many cases,
it’s because of culture.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.520
We need all
the relevant players

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.390
to step onto the same field
of play at the same time,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.930
completely focused
on solving this problem.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.520
We need collaboration,
integration of data,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.150
and unity of effort across DOD,
the VA,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.900
HHS, DHS, academia,
and the private sector.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.880
We need a holistic approach with
a heightened sense of urgency

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.580
to push
the scientific research.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.730
As we develop knowledge —
as we experienced

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.380
with the Manhattan
Project and space exploration —

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.960
we will inform on other
disease processes

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.460
and therapies that will go well
beyond the veteran community

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.480
and vice versa.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.120
I receive calls almost weekly
from special operators,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.030
past and present,
seeking help.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.500
They want to know
what is happening to them.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.599
They are experiencing
unexplained changes.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.050
They want to know
if the pain will get better,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.070
if the demons will go away,

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.820
if they will return to being
the person they once were.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.340
I have to commend my own
SEAL community

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.790
and the Special
Operations Command

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.010
for embracing this challenge.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.680
They realized that things
did not go well

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.729
in Ryan’s case —
that he got left behind.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.890
They are working hard now
to get it right,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.570
collecting exposure data,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.860
promoting a brain donation
program to advance the research,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.580
increasing baseline
health surveillance,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.290
and changing tactics
to reduce exposures,

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.060
especially in the combat
training environment.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.990
We also need to appropriately
recognize invisible wounds

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.930
suffered on the battlefield.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.250
The monetary cost of a
Purple Heart award is low —

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.120
a few dollars
for the medal itself.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.810
But the emotional impact is very
high to those suffering daily

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.510
with these obscure injuries

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.040
to be recognized
for their sacrifice.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.350
Mr. President,
following this event

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.290
I’m going over to Arlington
National Cemetery to tell Ryan

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.089
that he’s still making
a difference,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.320
that he’s still
helping his boys.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.150
We can’t leave any more of our
valiant men and women behind.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.170
To our warriors, our veterans,
and their families:

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.230
Please do not lose hope.
We will find a better way.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.420
Remember, we made a promise

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.650
to take care of those
who served us.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.050
Failure is not an option.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.730
Mr. President, I thank you
for the platform.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.510
The President:  Very nice.
Thank you.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.370
(Applause.)

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.740
Thank you.
Thank you, Frank, very much.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.320
Also here today with us

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.530
is Thomas Winkel,
a Marine Corps veteran.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.510
He is the Director
of the Arizona Coalition

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.540
for Military Families

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.610
and the creator of a nationally
recognized community

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.790
collaboration model called
“Be Connected.”

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.740
And, Thomas, if I might,
could you please come up

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.560
and say a few words?
Thomas.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.410
Mr. Winkel:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.010
I greatly appreciate
being able to be here

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.850
and speak with you all today.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.360
To Frank, I really
appreciate your words.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.100
I’m sorry about your son.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.150
He is in our hearts and you are
in our hearts, your family.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.640
And Semper Fi, brother.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.640
Mr. Larkin:  Thank you.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.560
Mr. Winkel:  Folks, the PREVENTS

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.550
Initiative it exactly
what this country needs.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.630
It is exactly
what the thousands —

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.270
the tens of thousands
of individuals

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.080
across the country
have been hoping for.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.280
For the past 10 years,
I’ve been working with states —

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.280
every single state —
across the country.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.210
Local teams, state teams,
federal teams.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.830
And when you boil
everything down —

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.090
all their concerns,
all their hopes,

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.280
all their dreams,
all their frustrations —

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.810
what it really comes down to
is that there needs to be

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.130
a sense of coordination
and collaboration

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.100
unlike what we have today

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.800
and unlike what
we’ve seen before.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.520
We’re not talking about
just regular old coordination

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.770
and collaboration,

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.340
or a partnership that is
“partnership” in name only.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.440
But we need partnership that
is true, that is consistent,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.390
that allows the organization
to meet both its own metrics

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.860
and its altruistic metrics.
It’s incredibly important.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.560
And it’s incredibly valuable.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.630
We have examples of this
true partnership

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.200
— little ones,
all across the country.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.760
One from Arizona
happens to be in 2010.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.090
The Arizona National Guard

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.030
had its highest rate
of suicide ever.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.730
Very, very difficult situation.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.420
Partners got together
under the leadership

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.600
of a collective
impact initiative.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.310
And we all had
the same goal in mind:

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.159
How do we reduce this number
or get rid of it completely?

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.020
Over the course of 36 months,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.930
we dropped the rate
from the highest ever to zero.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.250
It can be done.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.120
We have the ability
to prevent suicide,

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:46.260
to make lives more empowered,
to make lives have more meaning,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.210
and to be able
to drive folks forward

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.190
to feel the success that happens
when they get a great job,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.580
or they get a great spouse,
or they have kids.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.940
Look, the reality is,
is that we’ve all known someone

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.270
who has died by suicide.
It is hard. It is painful.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.190
And we have the ability
to stop it.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.130
What our belief is, and the way
that we were able to do this

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.150
is that we worked with
a “No Wrong Door”

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.300
and “No Wrong Person” approach.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.480
A “No Wrong Door,
No Wrong Person” approach.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.300
That means very single
organization was engaged.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.510
Every single organization
was involved

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.600
that had a stake
in service members,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.940
veterans,
and their families,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.839
and their survival
and their thriving.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.400
So we have mechanics,
and lawyers, and doctors,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.030
and teachers,
and first responders.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.430
And we have hotel clerks —

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.250
one of my favorite stories
is a hotel clerk that noticed

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.690
that a person that was checking
in happened to be a veteran —

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.390
that they were struggling
in a variety of different ways.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.020
But the hotel clerk
didn’t know what to do.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.640
He called
what we have in Arizona,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.330
called the “Be Connected” line,
and talked with them.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:01.860
They coached him
through how do you

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.700
just connect
with the individual.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.310
So the clerk goes up
to his room, knocks on the door,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.620
and says, “Hello, sir.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.860
I just wanted
to check in with you.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.290
You seem like you might be
a little distressed

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.130
and I wanted to see if there was
anything I could do for you.”

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.420
The individual said,
“I’m so glad that you came up.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.440
I’m so glad
that you talked with me

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.210
because I was sitting here
contemplating

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.530
how I was going to die.
Not ‘whether.’ Not ‘if.’

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.149
So you may have
just saved my life.”

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.380
We hear these stories
consistently,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.920
and it takes
the entire community

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.210
to be able to do this —

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.290
everybody working off
the same page.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.920
Our belief is, is that
if everyone knows what to do

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.450
when an individual
is in trouble, they will act.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.580
And we’ve seen it time
and time again.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.360
So, Mr. President,
we greatly support this act —

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.350
or this initiative.
It is an incredible thing.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.800
We deeply appreciate everything
that you have put into this.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.670
It is going to make
a huge difference.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.390
And I can speak
on behalf of Arizona

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.700
and the other states that I have
spoken with that we stand ready.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:10.620
Thank you.
(Applause.)

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.930
The President:  So, Thomas,

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.010
I heard one thing
beyond all else

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.590
when you just spoke
so beautifully,

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:21.070
and that was “from
the highest rate ever to zero.”

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.250
That was a very big statement.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.270
So we’re going to have to
find out what you are doing.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.780
Somebody’s got to get
together with you.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.060
That’s an incredible job.
I’ve heard about it, too.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.330
“Highest rate ever to zero.”

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.570
Mr. Winkel:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.790
The President:  That’s
what it’s about.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.120
That’s what we’re up here for.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.110
There has to be something
that we can do.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.000
Mr. Winkel:  There is.
The President:  Twenty a day?

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.440
It’s hard to believe.
So thank you very much.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.310
Come here.
Again, thank you very much.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.570
I’d like to ask a man who’s
really done an incredible job,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.890
before I sign —
Secretary Wilkie —

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.750
to step up
and just say a few words.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.330
I’m so happy that
he’s our Secretary.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.420
If you look over
the last fairly long time

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.870
now that he has been Secretary,
we’ve had so many good stories

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.480
about what’s happening,
generally, at the VA.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.450
We’re extremely of proud
of Choice.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.410
It’s been many,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.220
many decades that
they have been trying to get

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.110
Choice, where a veteran
can go out

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.210
and see a doctor
if the lines are long.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.310
They don’t have to wait
four days, nine days —

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.700
I always say three weeks,
five weeks, ten weeks.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.720
Never get to see a doctor.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.420
People go on line
and they’re not feeling well,

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.210
and they end up being terminal
by the time

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.820
they get to see a doctor.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.260
And, by the way,
we have great doctors.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.080
I have to say, I’ve heard —
one thing I hear:

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.370
We have great doctors in the VA.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.380
A lot of people say
getting there is tough

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.700
but, when you see them,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.600
they’re as good
as anybody in the world.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.740
We have great doctors.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.750
But a man who has really

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.340
put it all together
is Secretary Wilkie.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.980
So, Secretary,
please say a few words. Please.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.290
Secretary Wilkie:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.810
I’ve said this to you before,
separate and apart

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.640
from the honor of serving
in your administration,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.270
but I am what passes
for an amateur historian.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.070
And there has never been
a campaign or an administration

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.200
where the candidate
and the President

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.670
put veterans at the centerpiece
of his campaign

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.820
and his administration
until you did that.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.950
And as I speak for all of us
who have worn the uniform,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.490
in whatever capacity
we have served,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.880
we can’t thank you enough
for that, sir.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.100
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.390
Thank you, sir.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.570
Secretary Wilkie:  So,
last week,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.500
three Department
of Veterans Affairs

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.560
heroes put their lives
on the line

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.430
to keep a fellow veteran
from taking his own life.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.490
Dr. Bruce Goldfeder,
Dr. Evelyn Alba,

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.980
and hospital technician
Navarone Johnson

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.220
in the West Palm Beach
VA Medical Center

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.000
risked their lives
to save the life of a veteran.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.630
Two of our VA heroes
were wounded — one severely.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.790
But that veteran lived.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.910
Since 2017, VA employees —
doctors, nurses,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.180
technicians,
policemen —

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.580
have saved 243 veterans
just like the one

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.249
that our heroes
saved in Palm Beach.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.980
But since 2017,
19 veterans have not been saved.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.350
That is what today’s
ceremony is about.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.850
It is about pulling together

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.850
the resources
of the federal government,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.150
our states and localities,
our charities,

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.980
our non-governmental
organizations,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.570
and coming together
with a roadmap

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:56.140
and the resources to make sure
that we no longer have those 19.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.820
I have said many times
that the mission

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.520
of the Department
of Veterans Affairs

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.030
is to remind our fellow citizens
why they sleep soundly at night.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.780
They sleep soundly at night
because of the sacrifices

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.950
of a select number
of their fellow Americans

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.080
who have taken the affirmative
step to serve in uniform.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.310
Those — as the President said,

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.740
those 20 who every day
take their own lives —

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.780
14 of them outside
of our VA system,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.640
most of them
from my father’s generation.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.220
His comrades
from Southeast Asia.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.020
We deserve, for them, the last
full measure of our devotion.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.050
And this begins
the closing of that circle.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.060
And, Mr. President, I thank you
and your team

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.679
for everything they have done
on behalf of America’s warriors.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.880
Thank you, sir.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:04.330
The President:  Good job.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.810
Thank you very much.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:19.350
(Applause.)

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.430
This is very important to me
and to everybody here.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.340
Thank you very much.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.680
Where’s Frank?
Here you go, Frank.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.950
Mr. Larkin:  My son’s bracelet.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.660
It’s a symbol
of all the veterans

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.990
who have taken their lives.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.889
We’ve got to keep our eye
on the ball.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:53.680
The President:  Thank you,
Frank.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.360
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.320
The Press:  Sir, your response
to the Democrats

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.070
who are calling
for a criminal investigation

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.070
into Jared Kushner’s
security clearance?

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.220
The President:  The witch
hunt continues.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.700
The fact is that, I guess,
we got 81 letters.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.700
There was no collusion.
It was a hoax.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.730
There was no anything.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.900
And they want to do that instead
of getting legislation passed.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.640
Eighty-one people
or organizations got letters.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.270
It’s a disgrace.
It’s a disgrace to our country.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.600
I’m not surprised
that it’s happening.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.730
Basically,
they’ve started the campaign.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.110
So the campaign begins.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.690
But the campaign is actually —
their campaign has been going on

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.820
for the last two
and a half years.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.360
So it’s a shame.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.290
And the people understand it.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.660
When they look at it,
they just say,

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.600
“Presidential harassment.”
But that’s okay.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.700
No administration
has accomplished — probably,

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.010
you could say this
with absolute surety —

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:57.540
in the first two years anywhere
near what we have accomplished.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.430
Whether it’s the tax cuts;
whether it’s regulation cuts;

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.230
whether it’s the Veterans
Administration —

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.850
what we’ve done with
the Veterans Administration

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.570
with Choice and so
many other things

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.270
that nobody thought
would be possible to get passed;

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.580
no administration has done
in its first two years

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.840
what the Trump
administration has done.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.500
So what the Democrats want to
do — they cannot stand the loss.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.510
They could not
stand losing in 2016.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.190
I see it all the time.
I see people getting on —

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.530
I saw a certain person
get up yesterday.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.730
The anger.
The anger.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.810
And they just haven’t
gotten used to the fact

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.750
that we won a lot of states
that haven’t been won

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.450
by Republicans
in a long time.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.290
But essentially what they’re
saying is the campaign begins.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.270
And instead of
doing infrastructure,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.900
instead of doing healthcare,
instead of doing so many things

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.900
that they should be doing,
they want to play games.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.470
President Obama,
from what they tell me,

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.450
was under a similar
kind of a thing —

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.300
didn’t give one letter.
They didn’t do anything.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.920
They didn’t give one letter
of the request.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.469
Many requests were made;
they didn’t give a letter.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.900
It’s too bad because I’d rather
see them do legislation.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.820
We negotiate out legislation.
We have so many things —

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.570
actually things that we agreed
on, like infrastructure.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.380
But they want to focus
on nonsense.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.730
So I just want to end
by thanking all of the people

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.280
that are in this room today.
Very special people.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.820
The job you’ve done
for the VA is incredible.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.920
And just keep up the good work.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.890
And, Secretary,
you’ve been fantastic.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.590
Thank you very much.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.000
Thank you all.
