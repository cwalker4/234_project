The President:
Thank you all.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:06.840
It's a great honor, and
thank our Vice President

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.208
for being here.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.242
Thank you.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.045
Ivanka Trump, thank you
for being here,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.881
and we have a great group behind
us, incredible people.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.685
Some of you are very good
friends for a long time.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.686
Good afternoon.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.955
It's an honor to be with
you; the men and women

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:26.793
of law enforcement, as well
as two fantastic state

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:31.064
attorneys general who are
always proud to stand by

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.933
the side of law
enforcement officers.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.803
That's Pam Bondi and
Leslie Rutledge.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:37.904
Thank you very much.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.672
Thank you.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:42.542
I want to thank also Chuck
Canterbury, president

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:47.046
of the Fraternal Order of
Police and Sheriff

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.215
Greg Champagne, president of
the National Sheriffs

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.216
Association.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.519
Where are you folks?

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.454
(inaudible) How are you?

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.922
Male Speaker: Sir, great.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.657
The President: I
appreciate your being here.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:01.428
Really two great champions
of law enforcement.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.063
We are here today to
reaffirm our unbreakable

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.567
support for the American
heroes who keep

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.537
our streets, our homes, and
our citizens safe,

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.105
and they've been doing an
amazing job under

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.574
very adverse conditions.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.644
We will always support the
incredible men and women

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.912
of law enforcement.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:23.450
I can speak very strongly
for myself and for Mike Pence,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.418
our Vice President.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:29.889
We are behind
you 100 percent.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.258
Every single day America's
law enforcement officers,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.994
firefighters, first
responders, and their

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:38.131
families make tremendous
sacrifices for their

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.734
communities and
for their nation.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.437
When a home is threatened,
when danger visits our

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.875
doorstep, when innocent
lives are on the line,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.945
Americans turn to their
courageous officers of law

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.081
enforcement because we
know they are here

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.718
to serve and to
protect us all.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:02.589
They sacrifice every
day to keep us safe.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.624
Many have paid the
ultimate price,

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:09.362
laying down their lives to save
others; incredible people.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.932
They're true heroes,
and we will always

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.802
be grateful, so I want
to thank you folks.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.038
That is so true.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:21.941
Our duty as Americans is
to honor their service

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:27.213
and sacrifice and to protect
those who protect us.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:31.417
Today I am proud to sign
two laws to help fulfill

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.488
that very, very
sacred commitment.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.558
First, the Public Safety 
Officers Benefits

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.895
Improvement Act will help
disabled officers

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.999
and firefighters and families
of those who fall

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.269
in the line of duty quickly
receive all of the benefits

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.071
they so justly deserve.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.508
People have wanted this
for a long time,

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.944
and I'm not just talking the
people behind me.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.813
I'm talking about many
people that represent

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.516
the people behind me: family
members and friends,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.485
and people that just
appreciate the work they

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.854
do, which is incredible.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.723
For too long injured
officers have suffered

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.927
and the children of fallen
officers have put their dreams

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.729
of college on hold,
while bureaucracy

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.732
delayed crucial benefits, made
it impossible

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.334
for their families.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.869
No longer.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.939
It's unacceptable, and
it's going to end today.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.976
In fact, it's going to
end in about one minute.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.445
This bill speeds approval
times by giving state

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.514
and local enforcement
a greater role in

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:38.217
determining eligibility
and lets applicants track

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:41.754
the progress of
their claims online.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:46.225
So a much, much
faster situation.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.261
You're all
happy with that?

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.029
You know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.397
Audience: Yes, sir.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.533
The President: You've
been waiting for this for years.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:56.035
Second, the American Law
Enforcement Heroes Act

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:59.038
allows the use of federal
grants to help

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.308
our military veterans
transition to new careers

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.711
in law enforcement.

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.647
America is proud of our
veterans, and I think

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:10.717
I can say a double proud
or a triple proud.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:15.088
We love our veterans, and
they're serving overseas,

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:19.459
they're in harm's way, and
they are doing things

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.061
that very few people would have
the courage to do, and we will

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.365
be and always will be
incredibly proud to have

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:29.636
them with us, and they've
been with us like nobody,

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:33.172
and we are going to
be protecting them.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.874
They've been
protecting us.

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.910
We're going to be
helping them right now.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.982
They've really been with
us, in terms of freedom,

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.984
in terms of our rights,
and we're right now,

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.719
in terms of their rights.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.554
As president, keeping
Americans safe

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:52.125
is my highest duty, and
supporting law enforcement

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.793
is my unwavering
commitment.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:59.198
I am very proud to sign
these two great bills today.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.567
I want to thank everybody
for being here,

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.003
and if you have the bills,
we'll sign them.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:07.640
This has been years in the
making, and I will tell you

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.445
that this is something
that I'm very happy to be doing.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.213
So, congratulations, everybody.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.682
Congratulations.

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.950
Audience: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.325
President Trump: This act 
may be cited

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:30.496
as the Public Safety Officers 
Benefits Improvement Act

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:33.633
of 2017.

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:54.721
Please spread it around.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:04.397
(applause)

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.565
Congratulations.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.333
That's a big one, right?

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:13.506
And this is, as you know,
let it be an act

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.374
of the United States House.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:18.678
This act reviews the
American Law Enforcement

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:21.481
Heroes Act, and
that's what it is.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.817
You're heroes, and so I
want to just congratulate you.

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:28.855
This one also has been a
long time in the making.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.723
You're all heroes,
aren't you, I think?

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.091
Audience: They sure
are (inaudible)

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.794
The President: Yes?

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.505
That is fantastic.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.640
Who gets this pen, Mike?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.109
Vice President Pence:
Who gets this pen?

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:54.914
The President:
(laughs) Okay.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:07:05.224
(applause)

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:06.559
Thank you very
much everybody.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.594
This is slightly less
controversial

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.695
then yesterday --

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:10.797
(laughter)

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.532
-- but yesterday was a big
service to this country,

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:13.699
I will tell you.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.301
Thank you very
much everybody.
