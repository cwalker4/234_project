00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.270
Our world is chock full of amazing places.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.370
Seriously, go out your front door, start walking
in any random direction, and chances are that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.870
you’ll probably hit something interesting
within a few hours.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.900
It could be a meadow, a groovy street you’ve
never visited before, a windswept stretch

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.340
of coastline, or even just an all you can
eat noodle bar offering free drinks to every

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.340
unshaven customer.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340
Hey, amazing is a relative concept.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.080
The trouble is, most of us don’t do our
own exploring.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.340
We comb guidebooks or the internet for places
that crop up in top 10 must-see lists, and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.320
then we go exactly where everybody else does.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.230
And while some of these places genuinely are
amazing (take a bow, Taj Mahal, Machu Picchu,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.820
and the Grand Canyon), some actually suck
far more than you’d reasonably expect them

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.820
to.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.420
In the mood for a flagrantly biased, wildly
unscientific look at the world’s most overrated

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.420
beauty spots?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.460
You’ve come to the right place…

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.910
10.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.229
Dresden, Germany, is Soullessly Ugly

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.479
Dresden’s nickname is “Florence on the
Elbe.”

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.900
That’s a mighty claim to fame, and it’s
absolutely not overstated… provided you’ve

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.450
just discovered this article in a crashed
time machine and are reading it prior to February

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.069
13, 1945.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:23.649
That was the night Allied aircraft firebombed
the ancient city, turning this architectural

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.899
treasure into the urban equivalent of the
charred lumps you get at the bottom of a firepit.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.579
So why, pray, do people still think of Dresden
as beautiful?

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.829
That’s probably because they’ve seen pictures
of it after its partial reconstruction was

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.599
finished, in 2005.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.020
The key word there is “partial.”

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.999
Aside from a tiny fraction rebuilt in the
center, most of Dresden today is soulless

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.560
concrete housing blocks.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.380
The guys in charge of reconstructing postwar
Dresden weren’t West Germans keen to rebuild

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.909
their shattered country.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.489
They were East German Communists, keen to
show off the endless possibilities of Soviet

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.639
concrete.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.189
When Kurt Vonnegut – who survived the firebombing
of Dresden as a prisoner of war – visited

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.819
the city after reconstruction, he claimed
it “looked a lot like Dayton, Ohio.”

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.930
No offense to residents of Dayton, but literally
nobody in the history of the world has looked

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.060
at Ohio’s sixth-largest city and said “this
reminds me of Florence.”

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.060
9.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.670
Dublin, Ireland, is like Getting Mugged by
the Monopoly Man

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.580
The capital of Ireland, Dublin is stop number
one for millions of Americans proudly tracing

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.680
their family’s history and/or looking to
get falling-down drunk on Guinness.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.599
It’s a city that’s beautiful, historic,
literary, and small enough to get a handle

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.010
on, unlike it’s British behemoth of a cousin
London.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.870
Sounds great, until you happen to inquire
about the prices.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.500
At that point, you’ll find yourself weeping
over your empty wallet as all your hard-earned

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.470
cash evaporates in a haze of whiskey fumes.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.800
Dublin is an expensive city.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.050
Yep, even if you’re used to NYC or London.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.360
Even if you’re used to Singapore.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.739
Dublin is the second most expensive city for
expats in the entire Eurozone, beaten out

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.940
only by Paris.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.680
But Paris at least doesn’t pretend to be
anything but classy and haughtily unaffordable.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.590
Dublin advertises itself as your friend, as
the jovial Irish guy you wanna share a drink

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.590
with.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.469
It’s only afterwards that you realize he’s
snatched your wallet mid-swig, and probably

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.549
made off with your pants, too.

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.650
Even tourism experts have called the city
a “rip off.”

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.650
8.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.999
Iceland is Drowning Under Tourists

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:36.040
The entire population of Iceland is a mere
334,252, about the size of Santa Ana, California.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.680
The number of annual tourists to Iceland is
over 2 million, or about the same as the population

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680
of Houston.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.730
Imagine the entire citizenry of Houston upping
sticks and deciding to spend three months

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.219
in the summer swarming through the streets
of Santa Ana, taking selfies, clogging up

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.499
traffic lanes, and generally acting like Americans
on vacation (i.e. like jerkwads).

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.819
Everything would vanish under a sea of ten
gallon hats and Texan attitudes to gun safety.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.659
Well, that’s basically the permanent condition
that Iceland lives in.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.609
There’s no doubt that Iceland is a beautiful
country, with rugged, awe-inspiring vistas,

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.010
and stretches of remote road that can feel
like driving on another planet.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.959
The only trouble is, those remote roads and
rugged vistas are now jam packed full of Americans,

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.810
Brits, Canadians and Germans clutching selfie
sticks and talking about how there are way

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.320
too many tourists in Iceland these days.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.690
Oh, and they’re also probably drunk, and
acting in a way that’s guaranteed to annoy

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.690
the locals.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.220
Thanks to drunk tourists, Iceland now has
a major problem with people pooping in public

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.220
areas.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.030
Do you really wanna add to these gross statistics?

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.030
7.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.590
Varanasi, India, is Where the Ganges Becomes
Toxic Sludge

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.520
Varanasi is the spiritual home of Hinduism,
a place where enlightenment fuses with mind-blowing

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.620
architecture to create something completely
unique.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.300
The centerpiece of this is the mighty Ganges,
which flows through the city, washing away

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.550
sin with its powerful waters.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.300
At least, that used to be the case.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.449
Today, the Ganges is less a river than it
is a rolling wave of sludge so toxic it’ll

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.020
either give you superpowers or just outright
kill you.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.889
Factories, sewage pipes, private bathrooms,
and tanneries upstream all dump their waste

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.770
into the Ganges as it makes its way across
India.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.490
Elsewhere, the water is hived off for industrial
uses, meaning what is left is unable to keep

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.090
up a healthy flow.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.770
The result is a river of sludge that gets
sludgier and sludgier as it snakes its way

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.210
towards Varanasi.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.009
By the time it reaches the city, it can’t
even really be called a river anymore.

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.169
It’s more of a chemical swap that’s decided
to go walkabouts.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.990
This is a doubly major issue, as one of the
main reasons to visit Varanasi is to bathe

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.720
in the river (seriously, don’t actually
do this).There are clean up operations underway,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.259
but they’re behind schedule, over-budget
and, frankly, not very effective.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.259
6.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.560
Stonehenge, UK, is Right by a Busy Road

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.849
Imagine being at Stonehenge during the solstice.

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.180
The eerie silence just before the sun rises
between the perfectly aligned rocks would

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180
be magical.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.970
Or at least it would be, if that eerie silence
wasn’t being broken by the sound of car

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.880
horns, roaring engines, and gridlocked drivers
yelling at one another.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.710
Yep, despite being an ancient wonder supposedly
in the middle of nowhere, Stonehenge is actually

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.120
close to a road.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.349
And what a road.

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.860
Known as the A303, it is the key link between
London and the counties of Devon and Cornwall.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.210
That’s the same Devon and Cornwall that
Londoners drive to en masse every single weekend

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.820
and public holiday.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.000
Believe it or not, this is an improvement.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.729
Prior to 2013, an equally busy road went within
yards of Stonehenge itself, meaning you could

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.450
contemplate the mysteries of the universe
while spoiled kids yelled out back windows

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.840
and threw things at you.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.720
Still, even the newly diverted road leaves
the monument smothered with an unceasing din

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720
of traffic.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.310
The good news is the British government has
plans to build a tunnel.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.730
The bad news is archeologists say it will
undermine Stonehenge’s foundations.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.730
5.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.340
Dracula’s castle, Romania, is Surrounded
by a Forest of Tacky Stalls

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.889
Maybe we’re asking a bit much to expect
somewhere known as Dracula’s Castle to be

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.229
free of tacky roadside stalls.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.419
But there’s ordinary roadside tat, and then
there’s the sweeping miles of stuff that

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:19.030
plagues Bran Castle in Romania, the source
of Bram Stoker’s inspiration for his novel.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.630
You’ve probably seen pictures of the castle,
looking suitably European and forbidding,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.460
surrounded by a sea of forest.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.610
What those pictures don’t show is the far-bigger
forest of tackiness that surrounds the real

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.610
one.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.090
Approaching Bran Castle is like approaching
Disneyland… if Disneyland were run on a

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.870
budget of six dollars and staffed entirely
by people who’d ditched their Goofy costumes

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.360
for vampire trinkets.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.439
There are stalls selling vampire teeth.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.930
Stores selling vampire masks.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.409
Stores selling stuff you couldn’t possibly
need in a billion years, but still has vampires

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:46.409
on it.

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:50.910
There is even a theme park replica of the
castle, within spitting distance of the actual

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:51.910
castle.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:52.919
The worst part?

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:57.379
Romania is full of beautiful castles no-one
has ever heard of, all of which you can explore

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:00.879
without some dude hassling you to buy fake
rubber bats.

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.879
4.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:04.659
The Maldives is like Putting Yourself in a
Beautiful Prison

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:09.169
Those screensavers of pristine white beaches
lapped by crystal clear waters you’re always

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:10.319
seeing on your mom’s old laptop?

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:15.210
There’s a good chance they’re pictures
of the Maldives, a tiny collection of islands

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.719
in the Indian Ocean that banded together to
form one – very spread out – state.

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:23.919
To be sure, the islands are as beautiful as
those pictures suggest.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:28.469
But entering an island paradise isn’t quite
as simple as hopping the first flight to its

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:29.780
capital, Male.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.670
Unless you’re very wealthy, or have done
your research, your vacation in the Maldives

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.660
could wind up being very expensive or very
claustrophobic.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.090
There are over 1,200 islands in the Maldives.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.760
The largest, Gan, is a mere 2.26 square kilometers.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.360
That means every resort is its own private
island, and getting between them ain’t cheap.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.870
Unless you’re cool being trapped around
the same people day in, day out, with nothing

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.980
but the resort to see, you’ll have to shell
out around $800 for a 15 minute seaplane flight

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.060
to another island.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.350
That’s just one way.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.130
It’ll cost the same to get back, and “getting
back” could well mean to an island resort

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.240
that has nothing for you to do but drink.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.450
Great for unadventurous drunks.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.610
Hell for literally anybody else.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.610
3.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.330
Bagan, Myanmar, is Plagued by Ham-fisted Temple
Restorations

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.090
A collection of thousands of ancient temples
spread out across an endless, rolling plain,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.540
Bagan in Myanmar looks like the sort of place
you would be willing to kill to visit.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.040
For sure, it’s one of the most Instagrammable
spots in Asia.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.130
But those awesome photos taken from afar and
showing the distant temples wreathed with

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.020
mist miss out on one very important piece
of context.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.690
Historically, plenty of those same temples
weren’t exactly cared for.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.080
They look like they do today not because that’s
how they’re meant to look, but because the

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.510
previous military government hamfistedly put
them back together again without having a

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.290
clue what they were doing.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.500
Bagan’s restoration work is bad.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.530
Not just “not great”, but actively bad.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.080
The temples were put back together using cruddy,
low-grade cement, and with regular bricks

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.840
instead of faithful materials.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.890
While this isn’t always clear to the untrained
eye, you can sometimes stumble across evidence

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.450
of this shoddy workmanship as you walk around.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.460
The end result is a kind of Disney-fied version
of Burmese history that’s about as authentic

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.030
as the It’s a Small World ride.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.440
There’s a reason UNESCO listed Pyu in Myanmar
but refused to touch Bagan with a bargepole.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440
2.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.670
Germany’s Romantic Road was Invented by
Travel Agents

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.530
The Romantic Road.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:33.160
Even the name is evocative, conjuring images
of stately medieval towns, ancient castles,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.290
and more beautiful nature than you can shake
a stick at.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.850
Running through Germany from the town of Wurzburg
to Fussen in the Alps, the road sounds like

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.590
the very definition of old fashioned European
romanticism.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.650
There’s just one problem with that.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.650
It ain’t old.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.890
It’s not even something the Victorians came
up with.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.470
It was invented by travel agents in the 1950s,
and you better believe it’s as jam-packed

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.570
with tourists as that implies.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.770
West Germany in the 1950s was just emerging
from the shadow of WWII, and needed all the

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.690
money and non-Nazi publicity it could get.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.750
So a bunch of travel agents designed a theme
route that would show off their country at

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.710
its best, and slapped an evocative name on
it.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.570
While a lot of the stops on the route are
indeed nice to look at, some are seriously

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.570
overrated.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.310
Wurzburg, for example, is like someone took
the best bits of Prague and made them smaller

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.450
but still kept the same number of tourists.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.640
Rothenburg Od Der Tauber is like someone tried
to see how many tour groups they could cram

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.520
into one space before everyone started killing
one another in a Mad Max-style orgy of violence.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.250
Our advice?

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.220
Leave the beaten track and try Nuremberg instead.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.220
1.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.340
Disney World Florida is as Magical as Cholera

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.460
As a kid, you probably dreamed of going there.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.240
Disney World in Orlando, Florida, is the biggest
of the Disney amusement parks by far, and

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.050
the one which advertises itself most aggressively.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.680
All of which simply proves the old adage that
bigger is not necessarily better.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.110
Disney World has the worst rides, the emptiest
swathes, and the least charm of all the parks

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.280
in the Disney franchise.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.700
This might not be such a pain on its own,
but it’s also the most expensive.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.680
In a strange inversion of the logic that more
money=better quality, Disney World charges

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.940
more for an experience that’s significantly
less enjoyable than that in its California,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.020
Paris, Shanghai or Tokyo sister parks.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.250
One major issue is that it’s just so spread
out, getting from one place to another becomes

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.980
a dispiriting experience.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.150
There’s also the issue of how worthwhile
each place is or isn’t.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.070
While the Anaheim, California park doesn’t
waste a square meter of space, the Florida

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.570
version puts aside a huge area for the Epcot
Center.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.140
No-one in their right mind wants to voluntarily
visit the Epcot Center.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:59.990
But, hey, if you’re in the area anyway,
you might as well head down the road and check

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.670
out the superior Universal Studios.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.440
You’re welcome.
