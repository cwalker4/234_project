00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.850
[Rhonda]: Hello everyone, I'm very excited
to be sitting here with Dr. Peter Attia who

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.979
has a medical degree from Stanford University.

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:16.820
And he has done a residency in surgery, I
believe, and also some research in surgical

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.080
oncology with Dr. Steven Rosenberg, I believe.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
Very interesting background, broad interests.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.910
I know of him from being on Tim Ferriss' podcast,
where he talked a lot about some of his self-experimentation

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.590
using a variety of different dietary techniques.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.040
But I'm really excited to talk with Peter
today because we have a lot of overlap in

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.760
our interest in longevity, particularly the
role of diet, nutrition, and other lifestyle

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.070
factors like sleep, exercise, stress in longevity.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.660
So thanks for being here, Peter.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.660
[Peter]: Sure.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.830
[Rhonda]: So maybe we could start a little
bit with what are you eating, then, to try

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.090
to delay the aging process like what is...so
diet obviously plays a very important role

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.229
in aging and I'm trying to figure out exactly
the best diet to eat and talk a little bit

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.710
about what I think, but I'd love to get some
of your thoughts.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.909
[Peter]: So I mean think the short answer
is we don't know definitively, and I don't

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.210
think we're going to know definitively if
you define "definitively" as a randomized

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.710
clinical trial of longevity in humans.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.009
We have to posit that we're never going to
figure that out.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.829
So instead we have to rely on proxies.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.479
So we look at proxies in animals where you
can do virtually anything you want in a totally

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.630
controlled setting but then you run the risk
of two things.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.460
One, are you identifying diets that are clinically
and biologically meaningful to your host?

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.759
For example, if you put a humanized diet into
a mouse what you learn may or may not extrapolate

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.869
to the human.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.609
And then secondly, you're really hindered
by the idea that you're studying that animal

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.639
in an artificial environment and when you
reduce the risk of a subset of death, a subset

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:11.200
of causes of death which is effectively metabolic
disease, you're often unable to measure what

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.940
in my opinion is an underappreciated risk
that comes on, which is, sort of, the more

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.470
sudden and traumatic causes of death that
we take for granted, especially in the case

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.790
of caloric restriction.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.450
So that's the problem with animals.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.260
Then what we do in humans is we kind of rely
on our best proxy biomarkers that we think

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.200
reflect the systems that drive aging and we
can measure those things over time and sort

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.080
of estimate what we think is the effective
this dietary change or that dietary change

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.110
or this lifestyle change or that drug change
on those things.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.440
And so I basically try to focus my efforts
on, sort of, converging those two worlds but

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.560
acknowledging that we're never going to know
the answer for certain and we're going to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.300
have to use our best judgment around those
things and hope that in time certain other

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.070
things do become available.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.020
For example, it would be really great if there
is a way in the blood to measure the activity

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.020
of mTOR.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.460
We don't have that.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.350
It would also be great if we could measure
other growth pathways like the RAS pathway

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.060
without having to rely on tissue biopsies
and things like that.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.030
[Rhonda]: So just for people that don't know
what mTOR is, can you explain why that's really

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.030
important?

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.030
[Peter]: Yes.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.820
So there are probably, depending on who you
talk with, I would say there are two or three

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.120
major growth pathways in the body that are,
kind of, responsible for growth both in the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.130
positive sense and in the pathologic sense.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.040
The two that I focus on the most are the IGF
pathway and the mTOR pathway.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.170
Now, mTOR stands for mammalian target of rapamycin.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.130
I think for the sake of time I will not tell
my favorite story, which is a story that is

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.690
both the discovery of rapamycin and perhaps
more interestingly the elucidation of how

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.690
it worked.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.391
But suffice it to say the compound rapamycin
was identified first long before a really

00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:21.859
amazing guy named David Sabatini as a PhD
student at Hopkins in 1993, 1994 as a side

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.539
project in a lab made the discovery that this
thing, rapamycin, was actually working by

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:34.210
inhibiting a protein complex of which TOR,
target of rapamycin, as it became named was

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.580
the central piece.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.449
We now know today that it can form onto two
complexes.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:46.569
One is called mTOR complex 1 or mTORC1 and
the other is mTOR complex 2, mTORC2, and we

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.639
also know that it exists in different tissues
and it has different activities in different

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.639
tissues.

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.979
Like most things in the body, too much or
too little is a bad thing.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.009
So if you have no mTORC1, for example, in
your muscles, you'd wither away and that would

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.280
be a debilitating condition.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.900
In fact, for people with muscular dystrophy
one of the things you want to do is figure

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.970
out how to alter that pathway.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.021
But similarly, we know that overactivity is
predisposing us to aging and, of course, certain

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:13.539
diseases of aging like cancer.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.449
[Rhonda]: So for people that...you know when
Peter mentioned that if you don't have any

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.639
mTORC1 activity you might cause muscle wasting,
well, that's because mTOR does a very important

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.250
role in protein synthesis.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.349
And what's very interesting is that both the
two pathways that you mentioned in being evolved

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:37.080
in aging, mTOR and IGF-1, IGF-1 actually increases
mTOR activity so you know they're in this...

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080
These aren't independent pathways, yeah.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080
[Rhonda]: Right.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.860
And what's also very interesting is that they're
both regulated by amino acid intake, right?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.380
[Peter]: Yes.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.629
[Rhonda]: So IGF-1 is also a growth factor
that you do need as well.

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.539
So it's one of those things where you don't
have any IGF-1, well you're going to be in

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.539
trouble.

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.440
I mean, there's a lot of positive things about
IGF-1, muscle growth, muscle repair, neuronal

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.479
growth.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.620
But too much IGF-1 also can allow damaged
cells to continue growing.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.501
But are you familiar with, like, any of the
dietary nutritional research on IGF-1 and

00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.889
mTOR and specifically with amino acids and
how...

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:21.889
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.039
I mean that's, sort of, my biggest obsession,
I think, is probably around those topics.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.249
So it's complicated.

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.159
I think we have probably a better understanding
of mTOR.

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.159
I mean I think it's very clear that mTOR is
amino acid driven.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.389
In fact, what's today?

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.389
Friday?

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.539
Last Thursday, eight days ago, David Sabatini
and his group at MIT published a paper in

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:49.320
"Science" that identified the amino acid sensor
for mTORC1.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.710
Now, it's always been suspected what it was,
which was leucine was the highest affinity,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.009
but in fact he's now crystallized that structure.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:02.059
So if you even think about it through the
lens of, like, "Why do bodybuilders or people

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:07.110
who love lifting weights, want to take Branched-Chain
Amino Acids while they're exercising?"

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.809
The reason is largely through this empirical
observation that it enhances muscles growth

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.809
and/or prevents muscle degradation during
exercise.

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:19.659
What I think is really interesting is that
we now know exactly what's going on.

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:23.949
So the Branched-Chain Amino Acids, there are
three, leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:29.009
It turns out that isoleucine and valine are
virtually irrelevant.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.400
It's pretty much all leucine.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.669
And what's really clever just from an evolutionary
perspective is that mTORC in muscle has a

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:44.830
much higher affinity for leucine than mTORC1
in fat or in hepatocytes.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.949
Now, that's a good thing because you'd like
to believe that in times of nutrient deprivation

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.850
even a trace sign of leucine should preferentially
provide the muscle with its growth signal

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.099
before providing the adipocyte or hepatocyte.

00:07:57.099 --> 00:08:03.060
So from a nutrient-sensing pathway, what you
could infer from that is too little leucine,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.430
probably a bad thing, too much leucine, probably
a bad thing.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.999
Now, what too much and too little are I think
remains to be seen.

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:15.389
The other thing to keep in mind is...you know,
because one of the questions a friend of mine

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:24.089
asked me recently, actually a mutual friend,
Tim Ferris, is "Can we take too much leucine

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:25.099
during a workout?"

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:31.259
And again, I don't think we know the answer
but extrapolating from the animal data I think

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.089
5 grams of leucine during a workout, probably
not harmful.

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:38.300
And it also doesn't stick around very long
because when we take amino acids in a workout,

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.370
if you, sort of, sip them throughout the workout
you're taking a free amino acid, so it's got

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.009
a relatively short stay in the body.

00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:50.970
In fact, one of the pharmacointerests on this
front, which is to treat diseases of muscular

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:57.209
wasting, is to actually come up with molecules
that are not necessarily more potent agonists

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:00.320
of the leucine receptor but would stick around
a lot longer.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.000
Because that's actually the problem with the
nutrition side, is we can't keep leucine around

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.589
long enough to stimulate muscle growth.

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:07.589
Okay.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.699
So that's the easy story.

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:12.200
Now the hard one, IGF.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.290
Okay.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:19.720
So two schools of thought on this, I am in
one camp but I will acknowledge the other

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720
camp.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.680
One camp says IGF-1 is driven exclusively
by amino acids.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.839
The other camp says, no, it's actually driven
by amino acids and carbohydrates.

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:34.980
And carbohydrates indirectly via insulin.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.980
So...

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.190
[Rhonda]: Why are those mutually exclusive?

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.190
I mean...

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.290
[Peter]: The way I define it when I'm...there
are certain people who I will not name that

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:48.480
are prominent in the field who will argue
that the carbohydrates play no role, it's

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480
virtually all protein.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.920
[Rhonda]: But there is a role that they do
play that's been shown, depending on...

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.360
[Peter]: I believe it has been shown but,
I mean, there are wonderfully erudite people

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.690
in this field who believe it is entirely an
amino acid issue.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:07.160
And it is true, methionine has probably been
shown to be the most active amino acid in

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.199
driving IGF pathway.

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:15.899
However, as it sounds like you agree, it's
pretty clear that as insulin levels go down

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:24.329
IGFBP-3 goes up...sorry, as IGF binding protein
3 goes up...maybe it's worth me taking a moment

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:25.329
why that matters.

00:10:25.329 --> 00:10:26.329
[Rhonda]: Yeah, probably explain that.

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:28.920
[Peter]: So most of these things, as maybe
the listeners know when you have hormones

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.300
floating around the body, whether it'd be
testosterone, whether it'd be cortisol, whether

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:39.380
it be thyroxine, these things, because they're
typically hydrophobic, they can't just travel

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.440
through the bloodstream freely.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.770
They have to be bound and carried just as
cholesterol does.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.610
And so it's these binding proteins that we
often don't think about that play an important

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.920
role in determining how much active or bioavailable
hormone is free.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.259
So in the case of IGF-1 it gets trafficked
by this IGF binding protein, and most of these

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:00.340
binding proteins actually bear an unbelievable
relationship to insulin.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.389
So sex hormone-binding globulin goes up when
insulin goes down.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:09.769
It's very interesting, there's always this
complaint that free testosterone levels will

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:13.949
drop, all things equal, in someone who restricts
carbohydrates.

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:18.829
And I remember through hearing that empirically
and not really thinking much about it until

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:22.230
I started to, one, observe it and, two, understand
why.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.430
And it's quite obvious because again, all
things equal, when insulin goes down, which

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.970
is usually what happens when you restrict
carbohydrates, sex hormone-binding globulin

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.120
goes up.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.529
That means if you have no change in testosterone
level or even estradiol level, free testosterone

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.800
will go down.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:45.240
Less testosterone is around to be unbound
to the sex hormone-binding globulin.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.889
So it's for that reason that I think that
insulin and carbohydrate do play an important

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:50.970
role in the IGF pathway.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.870
And I also think empirically, not that I like
to refer to ecology or epidemiology, but when

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:07.860
you look at ecology and epidemiology of cancer,
to my knowledge the content of highly refined

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:15.779
carbohydrate and sugar is more predictive
of cancer in a society than the variety in

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:16.779
protein content.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:21.000
In other words, there are cultures that have
consumed larger and lesser amounts of protein

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.430
that have been without mass amounts of cancer,
but the same cannot be said with large amounts

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.459
of these things.

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:31.120
Now by these things, I mean sugars and high-glycemic-index
carbohydrates.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.829
The problem with that is, of course, you can't
infer cause from that, but the negative to

00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:39.850
me is suggestive that at the very least, carbohydrate
content matters when it comes to IGF-1 signaling.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.270
[Rhonda]: Absolutely, and the way I like to
think about it actually when you're discussing

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:53.050
these two things is IGF-1 is not a cancer
initiator, like, it's not going to cause the

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:58.410
initial damage that can make a normal cell
aberrant, a normal cell that acquires whatever

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.580
problems it acquired to make it turn into
a cell that's not cancer.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.250
What IGF-1 is really good at doing is taking
that cell that's already acquired the damage.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.250
[Peter]: It's an amplifier, yeah.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.250
[Rhonda]: Right.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.250
And saying, "Here, keep growing.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.250
Like, no, don't die.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.709
I know there's signals in your body that are
trying to kill you, but don't die."

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:20.720
You know, whereas the refined carbohydrates,
the way I always think about is that leads

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.519
to a variety, a plethora of physiological
processes in your body, inflammatory processes

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:33.050
a lot of different pathways that are causing
damage, that are initiating the type of damage.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.940
So it's like, well, if you have someone that's
eating a terrible diet, they're eating refined

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.870
carbohydrates, they're they're releasing endotoxin
in their gut, they've got this some constant

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:46.250
inflammatory process going on, they're releasing
hypochlorite damage they were damaging mitochondria,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.500
damaging DNA, blah, blah, blah.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.680
Well, and then so they've acquired all these
damaged cells and then they're eating a bunch

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.760
of protein and activating the IGF-1 pathway,
it's like dynamite.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.209
It's like, here's the damage cell and here's
the signals to, like, keep living and keep

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.209
growing.

00:14:04.209 --> 00:14:05.209
So I kind of...

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:06.209
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:11.569
I mean, so you obviously alluded to this and
I think many patients when I talk to them

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:14.930
are sort of surprised to learn that every
one of us has cancer.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.850
I mean, at this moment I have millions of
cancer cells in my body, as do you.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.029
The good thing is virtually all of the time
the problem gets eradicated, right?

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:28.850
So either we talk about the apoptotic pathways
that you describe, but even when those pathways

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.540
fail our immune system is remarkable.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:38.180
I did my post-doc in immunotherapy so I spent
about two and a half years working with T

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:44.130
cells specifically regulatory T cells in looking
at this problem, and we just take for granted

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.779
how good the humoral...the cellular immune
system is, rather.

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:52.740
So for those, again, maybe not familiar with
the immunology you have your B cell system

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.759
and your T cell system.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:57.490
These T cells, which are the ones that fight
viruses, are unbelievable.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.459
When you think about how many antibiotics
we have in our arsenal to fight bacterial

00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:02.720
infections, it's remarkable.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.470
Think about how many antiviral drugs we have
relative to antibiotics.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.899
We have very few and we certainly don't have
them for the most common viruses we acquire.

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:14.990
And yet, virtually all of us recover in the
end unharmed from the typical viral infection

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.510
we get two to three times a year.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.830
That's a testament how amazing our immune
system is.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.610
And when you unleash it against cancer, it's
effective 99.9% of the time.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.390
So, yeah, the name of the game is avoid the
amplifiers.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:32.040
Now, the other reason why I think this is
an important concept that goes beyond cancer

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:39.930
but now gets to the broader aspect of aging
is, when you look at the people who live the

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:45.430
longest, when you look at these people who
live to 100 and beyond, for the most part

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.629
they die of the exact same diseases as the
rest of us schleps.

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:50.910
They just get them later.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:56.779
That's really important because I think it
offers an insight into longevity that is often

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:58.009
overlooked.

00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:04.829
So if the people who lived to 100, 105 were
all dying in car accidents and plane crashes,

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:07.660
you might make the argument that there's two
classes of citizens, right?

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.410
There's the people who get chronic disease
and then there's people who will never ever,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.129
ever get it and eventually they just die of
something else.

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:17.189
Because remember, the fourth leading cause
of death or the fifth leading cause of death

00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:21.060
starts to become accidental stuff, once you
get outside of the chronic stuff, but that's

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.520
not the case.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.410
The point is we're all, sort of, preprogrammed
to go through this process, but if you want

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:31.279
to live longer the name of the game is delaying
the onset of the big three, the big three

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:39.040
being the diseases that will kill 75% of us,
so cerebrovascular and cardiovascular, cancer,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.579
and neurodegenerative.

00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:46.810
And so that brings us back to why we've got
to have IGF and mTOR in check, because we've

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.259
got to prevent them from being able to, sort
of, amplify that.

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:50.259
[Rhonda]: Right.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.259
And...

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:54.459
[Peter]: I still haven't answered your question
which is, "How do you do this with diet?"

00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:55.459
But...

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:56.519
[Rhonda]: Well...

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:00.550
[Peter]: So I will explain conceptually how
you do it.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:06.039
How you do it at the individual level is empirical
and I think prescriptive, meaning you have

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:09.579
to be able to try something, iterate on it,
and make a measurement.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.860
But here's the conceptual way to do it.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:18.740
The conceptual way to do it, at least the
way I do it, is you consume more or less the

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.319
least amount of protein you can consume to
maintain and grow muscle mass.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.549
But you don't need any more than that.

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:28.169
So it depends on the individual, it depends
on the timing of that protein ingestion, the

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:32.730
quality of that protein and the type of metabolic
and conditioning stimulus you put into it,

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.860
but there's an amount.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.920
But for most of us I think we're probably
over consuming protein relative to that actual

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.120
need, so we raise protein level until we hit
that amount.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.049
Carbohydrate, we do the opposite.

00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:50.510
Carbohydrate, we are basically lowering it
until we reach the highest point...or pardon

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:58.309
me, the lowest point that we can tolerate
where we can maintain, and again, this is

00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:02.060
quick and dirty but it's the lowest possible
fasting insulin.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:09.480
And in my mind I typically like to see that
at below 3 or 4 as IU of insulin.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.360
And you want to limit, sort of, post-meal
glycemia.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.260
And I actually use a standardized test which
is an OGTT which has its limits because it's

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.240
liquid, you're drinking liquid glucose.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:28.040
I like to limit that postprandial hyperinsulinemia
to a number and I use a checkpoint of 30 that

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.340
I want to be able to see within one hour of
a 75-gram glucose challenge if you can keep

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.340
insulin below 30.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.020
So in my mind, because I can't do what's called
an AUC, an area under the curve.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.560
So the really rigorous way to do this would
be I'd put a catheter in your arm and I would

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.890
sample your blood every 30 or 60 minutes over
the course of a day while you ate.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.370
And I'd integrate that function and there
would be an area under the curve of insulin,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.140
and that's actually the number I care about.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.580
But since I can't do that outside of a research
setting, I rely on these other proxies.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.279
So the bottom line is your carbohydrate content
is highly variable by the individual, by their

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:07.590
insulin sensitivity, by their muscle mass
and their capacity to dispose of glucose and

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.710
a host of other factors.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.220
But the bottom line is you don't want to consume
any more carbohydrate than you can without

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.789
blowing through those parameters, and you
don't want to consume any more protein than

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:19.020
you need to to preserve that.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.380
And then basically, fat becomes the fill.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.750
And so the point here is that that becomes
a highly different diet for different people.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:32.400
For some people that's 40% carbohydrate and
20% protein, and the remainder of fat.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.080
For others that's 20% carbohydrate and 15%
protein and the remainder of fat.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.770
[Rhonda]: So your approach seems to really
look at insulin response.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:50.429
It's looking at obviously the IGF-1, mTOR,
dietary nutritional factors that are influencing

00:19:50.429 --> 00:19:53.600
those pathways and then, of course, the rest
being fat.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:03.320
For me, I like to think about food as what
you're putting in your body not only to activate

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.179
these pathways or try to keep the pathways
from being too active.

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:12.170
But also, I like to think about it at the
level of the gut because the gut, one, regulates

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.730
the immune system, big time.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.470
I mean that's you've got more immune cells
in your gut than you do in any other organ

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:24.320
of your body and your gut bacteria, the interaction
between your gut bacteria and your gut are

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.040
also, you know regulating the types of immune
cells that you're making, regulatory T cells

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.620
being put in that.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.090
And also because it's the major source of
inflammation, and inflammation,even very recently

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.340
has been identified to be a driver of the
aging process.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:45.940
So eating things that are good for your gut
like fiber and avoiding things that are going

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.559
to cause a lot of gut damage.

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:50.830
So I think about those things as well.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.679
And then micronutrients which is also a very
important.

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:57.100
Micronutrients are cofactors for a variety
of enzymes and proteins in the body.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.980
It makes sure they're functioning proteins
that are involved in these processes we're

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.799
talking about, keeping cancer cells in check.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:08.960
You know, like p53 zinc-dependent proteins,
magnesium which is important for repairing

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.309
damage, things like that.

00:21:10.309 --> 00:21:14.929
Are those things that you consider at all
when you're thinking about the influence of

00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:16.779
diet on the aging process?

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:20.320
[Peter]: I don't think about it as much as
a lot of people do.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.290
And I would hate to use the term I'm a gut
skeptic because I think that conjures up a

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:31.770
whole bunch of negative images but...so I'm
going to be a late adopter on this one, all

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.770
right?

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:37.400
So there are a whole bunch of facts that everybody
can rattle off about the gut.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.520
A lot of them by the way are kind of BS.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.500
So the cells in the gut outnumber the cells
in our body 10 to 1, that actually turns out

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.500
to be false.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.980
[Rhonda]: So you mean bacterial cells?

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.440
[Peter]: Yeah, sorry, the bacterial cells
within our gut.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.049
So putting all that stuff aside, there are
a whole bunch of really interesting facts.

00:21:55.049 --> 00:22:00.480
But it reminds me of what a good friend of
mine once told me when I was trying to rationalize

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.710
something I needed to do or thought I needed
to do to him.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.670
He said, "Why are you doing this?"

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.480
And I said, "Blah, blah, blah."

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.110
And he said, "That's a fact, but is it a reason?"

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.710
And so that's kind of how I feel a little
bit about the gut.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.270
Like, there's a whole bunch of really interesting
stuff but I don't know that it actually matters

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.270
that much, right?

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.750
I'll give you a really idiotic example.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.120
The number of ants on this earth outnumber
us 10 to 1.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.809
I'm making that up.

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:29.290
Ergo, we should be doing more to protect the
ants by avoiding climate change.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.710
[Rhonda]: Yeah, but that's irrelevant.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.450
[Peter]: And I'm saying, "No, that might be
true.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:39.539
There might be more ants than us, but we're
the species of interest."

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:43.070
So that's my first, sort of, kind of, lack
of interest.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.000
The second is I don't really know what to
do with it, right?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.159
So I've been through it all, I've gone through
all the sequencing, I've done it with patients,

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:54.990
and I have found that it's like there's a
very crude set of tools that I can use in

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.560
really obvious cases.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.770
So, all right, a patient that came to me two
years ago who had a history of sinusitis,

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:03.770
horrible history of sinusitis.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:10.679
So she probably had to do an Augmentin course
six times a year because of recurrent sinusitis.

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:14.700
She had three surgical procedures, just couldn't
get better.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.730
So I started working with her.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.289
It became pretty clear to me that there was
something in her diet that was creating an

00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:24.330
inflammatory environment that wasn't a structural
problem.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.890
So we made a lot of dietary changes, things
got better, but in parallel to that I sort

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:35.740
of suspected that 10 years of 6 cycles of
Augmentin probably altered her gut.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.380
And so, yeah, she's an example of someone
where I would do a sequence and can be like,

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.580
"Lo and behold, you're all yeast."

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.580
Right?

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.140
Not surprisingly, and disproportionate bacterial
overgrowth.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.429
Okay, so she's an example of someone in whom
the signal was so big that I felt like there

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:54.960
was an intervention I could make which was
both fixing her diet but also utilizing agents

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.080
that could alter that.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.250
But for the most part, I don't have a clue
what to do.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:03.370
And all the people I see who claimed to know
what they do, like, they can't convince me

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.700
that they're knowing what they're doing.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.070
Now, that doesn't mean that you can't...I
mean I'm talking outside of a couple of really

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.070
amazing examples.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.000
So we're familiar with how C. diff colitis
works and the reversal of C. diff with stool

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
transplants.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.620
So those are remarkable examples, but some
of the other stuff I'm still not clear of.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.720
So I guess what I'm saying is I'm happy to
be convinced but I'm not convinced yet that

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.390
this is a reason and not just a fact.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:36.090
[Rhonda]: So I think that focusing on the
gut microbiome and the number of bacterial

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:41.679
cells that supposedly outnumber our human
cells and all that, I don't think that's the

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:43.770
important point.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.440
You know, so I've become very interested in
the gut mostly because of a colleague of mine,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.800
Mark Shigenaga, who has been working doing
gut research at Children's Hospital in Oakland,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.840
and is brilliant.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.210
He's been showing me data and I've just been
convinced more and more that gut health, making

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:10.820
sure that you're keeping the mucin which you're
gut goblet cells are producing that disgustingly

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:16.029
slimy mucus-like material that's keeping and
separating the immune cells in your gut from

00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:17.670
all the microorganism in your gut.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:22.980
And that's very important because when that
starts to break down, the immune cells recognize

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.983
bacteria and they start [crosstalk]...

00:25:23.983 --> 00:25:26.950
[Peter]: Is there...and I'm not asking this
rhetorically, I just don't know.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.649
Is there an effective way to diagnose that
in patients?

00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:35.350
[Rhonda]: So the problem is that endotoxin
released into the blood system would be the

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.450
way to measure it and to diagnose...

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.990
[Peter]: I see, so you could measure it through
the lack of barrier basically.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:45.519
[Rhonda]: You can measure the endotoxin levels
in someone's blood which is a marker, a proxy,

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:46.519
if that helps.

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:47.519
[Peter]: Yeah, like the throughput, yeah.

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:51.610
[Rhonda]: But the problem is that there's
also a lot of false positives.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:57.630
So that's the only concern until that test,
the diagnostic test can be defined...

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.760
[Peter]: Because it seems to be a stool test
would be a more effective way to measure that.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.760
[Rhonda]: Mucin?

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760
[Peter]: Mucin.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.000
[Rhonda]: Yeah, there might be.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.600
There might be a way to do that, to measure
it in a stool.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.880
That would be an interesting thing to explore
because the...so what I'm getting at here

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:25.270
is I'm a scientist, obviously, you're a scientist
and like to understand the mechanism and see

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.720
solid data before you think something is true.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:35.850
And I've become more convinced that the endotoxin
released from the gut which is a constant...I

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.769
mean, really the major source of inflammation
in the body is coming from the...

00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:42.710
[Peter]: And to be clear Rhonda, I'm not disputing
that.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:47.861
So to be clear, I bought that thesis actually
when I was a surgical resident because we

00:26:47.861 --> 00:26:49.440
would see endotoxemia, right?

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.980
A surgical procedure gone bad endotoxemia,
ICU, death.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.350
I know what that looks like in its most extreme
state.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.750
What I think I'm more of a skeptic of, and
again, a skeptic waiting to be convinced,

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:06.830
is that I can make that diagnosis in a non-catastrophic
case which is basically the chronic case and

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:15.799
make an intervention either through some alteration
in the microbiome itself or meaning directly

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:20.560
or indirectly through diet or other variables.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:27.000
And I think that it would be very interesting,
sort of, path to go down but, again, there's

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.841
so many things I don't know at the moment,
I'm just trying to focus on the ones that

00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:31.841
I do know.

00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:32.880
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.340
There is some interesting work coming out
of, like, Justin and Erica Sonnenburg Lab

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.340
over at Stanford.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.429
I recently had a discussion with them on looking
at the role of fiber and certain types of

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:51.580
fiber in fueling different species of bacteria
in the gut and how those are generating short-chain

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:57.029
fatty acids and other signaling molecules
which are regulating hematopoiesis, they're

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:59.740
regulating the number of Tregs that we're
making.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:05.380
So it is very interesting that feeding our
gut certain types of fiber which are present

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:13.250
in vegetables and a variety of fruits even,
do have a positive effect on the immune system

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.700
via the signaling molecules that are being
made in the gut.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.769
So that's very interesting, and it is one
thing that I consider when I'm thinking about

00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:24.809
the effects of diet on longevity.

00:28:24.809 --> 00:28:29.690
You know, I've focused on insulin for a long
time.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.530
I've been very interested in insulin.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:37.380
When I was doing research at the Salk Institute
in La Jolla, before I went to graduate school,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.269
I was working on aging and specifically doing
different genetic manipulations in C. elegans

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:46.280
to look at the effects on aging.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.649
So insulin signaling was like obvious.

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:53.190
Decrease insulin signaling you're gonna increase
this worm's lifespan by, like, up to a 100%,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.830
which was, like, very profound.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:59.950
So I've been very focused on insulin for a
long time...reducing the insulin signaling

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.409
pathway, reducing the insulin response all
that.

00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:11.370
However, I think that as I continue to look
in humans we're very complex organisms and

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.769
there's lots of interactions between the things
going on, between different things that are

00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:21.030
happening in our diet, in our lifestyle that
are affecting the way we age.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.610
And one of those I do think is gut health.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:28.840
I, sort of, began to become interested in
what sort of diet is good for my gut and what

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.590
is not good for my gut.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:37.220
And I think we were talking a little bit about
this before we start filming this, and that

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.850
is one thing I'm also very interested in these,
the effects of fat on the gut.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:47.080
Because fat can be very hard on the gut but
I think that also depends on a variety of

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:54.450
factors, if you're eating it with protein
if you already have an unhealthy gut, if you're

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.570
not exercising or you are exercising, things
like that.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:01.980
Also, genetic factors play a very important
role certain polymorphisms in...

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.750
[Peter]: Don't ask me about ApoE.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.130
[Rhonda]: PPAR gamma?

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.130
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.559
[Rhonda]: Influence saturated fat versus polyunsaturated.

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:10.559
Yeah, ApoE.

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:15.269
I've actually got one ApoE4 allele, so I'm
very interested in ApoE and I'm actually writing

00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:20.210
a paper on ApoE4 and its role in Alzheimer's
right now.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.110
[Peter]: Well, I'll tell you my take on
that, which I'm sure you've seen the literature

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.110
on it.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.410
But I actually think it's the phenotype that
matters more than the genotype.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:32.250
So in other words, I think it's the amount
of ApoE that's expressed that matters, not

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.520
the ApoE, not the genotype.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.480
In other words, just as we measure ApoB as
a surrogate for LDL particle number and VLDL

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.929
and remnant VLDL particle, we can measure
ApoE now.

00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:49.220
There's no clinically used or CLIA-approved
assay for that yet, but there are labs that

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.330
are doing it for experimental purposes.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:56.760
And there's a paper that I saw maybe six months,
nine months ago that actually showed that

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:03.410
if you take the ApoE 3/4s and 4/4s...so I'm
sure better than I do, a 3/4 genotype just

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:08.289
on a hazard ratio is about a 2x increase over
the 3/3 in terms of Alzheimer's disease.

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:13.000
A 4/4 of course, is anywhere from 10x to 20x
depending on the series.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.149
Okay, so if you're out there and you've got
an ApoE 3/4, or especially if you've got a

00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:18.700
4/4, you're worried, right?

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.920
And I'm worried for my patients who are 4/4s.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.120
I have four patients who are 4/4s.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:29.289
But when I saw this paper what it showed was
actually...and just so the listener would

00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:37.899
know, the majority of people with Alzheimer's
are not 3/4 or 4/4, they're still 3/3.

00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:41.490
The difference is this...because remember,
the 3/3 is the majority of the population.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.169
I mean the 3/4 is actually pretty big, it's
about 20%.

00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:48.639
But the 3/3 is the largest one, so having
a 3/3 doesn't protect you from Alzheimer's

00:31:48.639 --> 00:31:52.160
and having a 3/4 doesn't guarantee you're
going to get it.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.820
And, by the way even a 4/4 doesn't guarantee
you're going to get it.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.380
So the key is there's something else that's
more predictive, and I think it's the phenotype.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:07.559
So when they measured the serum level of ApoE
it turned out to be more predictive of Alzheimer's

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:09.690
disease than the genotype.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:15.029
So my hope is that we can get a clinically
approved assay in a relatively short period

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:18.259
of time that will allow us to actually do
that, especially for the patients who are

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:21.159
3/4 and 4/4, which says, "Are you able to
reduce your risk?"

00:32:21.159 --> 00:32:25.419
So let's say I could measure you today and
your ApoE level was here.

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:27.390
And then we could say, "Well, look, there's
some intervention.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.960
We believe that reducing or increasing insulin
sensitivity of your brain, you know reducing

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.340
the probability that pyruvate dehydrogenase
is going to cause an energy shortage in your

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:42.409
neuron is going to improve your odds for delaying
or eliminating AD from the list."

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:46.520
And then we could measure your ApoE at a point
in time and it were lower, that would give

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.149
me some confidence that we're moving in the
right direction because...

00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:50.409
[Rhonda]: Lower?

00:32:50.409 --> 00:32:52.649
So you're saying that the higher the...

00:32:52.649 --> 00:32:56.230
[Peter]: The higher the expression, the higher
the risk.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.230
That's what this...

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.230
[Rhonda]: Higher expression in the plasma.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:59.230
[Peter]: In the plasma, the higher the risk.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.230
[Rhonda]: Okay, So a couple of things, one
is...

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.440
[Peter]: I'd be happy to show you the paper
because that's...

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.779
[Rhonda]: Yeah, that's interesting because
from my understanding, you make ApoE in the

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:06.799
liver and you make it in the astrocytes.

00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:11.440
But one of the important things is that it
plays an important role in bringing cholesterol...

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.440
[Peter]: Cholesterol.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.440
Yep, yep.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.269
[Rhonda]: ...from the astrocytes to the neurons,
but also in repairing damage that's done.

00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:22.961
So, you need to have neurite outgrowth to
repair any sort of damage that's done, damage

00:33:22.961 --> 00:33:28.240
with normal brain aging or traumatic brain
injury, which is like damage in real-time.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.721
I was under the impression that there's less...so
there's less ApoE expression in ApoE4 and

00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:40.539
so there ends up being a problem because the
LDL receptor is very important for bringing

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:43.670
the cholesterol to the neurons, to getting
it there and so...

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.570
But the plasma, I don't know.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:46.570
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.769
And the other thing is I think the...and by
the way, I could be wrong.

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:51.700
It's been nine months since I read this paper,
so I could have it backwards.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.830
But I think the more important thing is, I
think there's two separate things going on,

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.830
right?

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:02.620
So the ApoE4 gene also plays a role in...because
my real interest clinically is, of course,

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.700
lipidology, that's my clinical obsession.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:12.710
And that's the place where I think we're becoming
pretty clear now that the ApoE 4/4 or the

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.760
3/4 is not a death sentence in cardiac disease,
especially the 4/4.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.159
The 4/4 was really viewed as, "Boy, you're
guaranteed to have an MI before 60."

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:26.310
And I think the evidence today suggests that
once you normalize and correct for LDL particle

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.129
number or ApoB, it stops mattering.

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:30.129
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:31.240
Those are definitely probably more important.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:43.010
And so loosely speaking, this is an oversimplification,
if you're a 3/4 or 4/4, in theory you should

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.849
have a harder time clearing LDL particles
from circulation.

00:34:47.849 --> 00:34:51.440
But I think that that's not entirely the issue
that you're alluding to, right?

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.200
I think there's two issues you're talking
about.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.770
One is the clearance issue and then one is
the cholesterol transport, the central part.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:58.770
[Rhonda]: Yes.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:04.710
I mean, and there's also the different issues
in the brain versus the liver.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.720
So, I mean, we're talking about, like, the
astrocytes are almost like little livers in

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.740
a way but not really.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.400
You know, I think looking at the effects on
the brain and then looking at the effects

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.829
on recycling LDL and all the other things
going on in the periphery are different.

00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:28.390
But by the way, I did just want to mention
that between 65% and 80% of all cases of Alzheimer's

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.060
disease at least, you know...

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.060
[Peter]: At least 4?

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.750
[Rhonda]: At least one has a 4.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.700
Between 65% and 80% of all the Alzheimer's
cases, so...

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.510
[Peter]: So the majority are 3/4s then?

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.240
[Rhonda]: The majority even have at least
one allele.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240
Yeah.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240
3/4s.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.240
But again, that's...

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.240
[Rhonda]: Having just one allele.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.000
[Peter]: ...based on the hazard ratio, we
know that that's just a numbers game because

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.970
20% to 25% of the population is 3/4.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.940
[Rhonda]: Right, exactly.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.340
But the point is is that there's something...

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.960
[Peter]: But the 3/3 doesn't protect you from
AD.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.960
[Rhonda]: No, it doesn't.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.490
[Peter]: So someone walking around with a
3/3 you shouldn't assume that, "Well I'm never

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.490
going to get AD."

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.990
[Rhonda]: No, it does not protect you, but
there is definitely something...

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.119
[Peter]: Does the 2/2 protect you?

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.920
[Rhonda]: The 2 does actually protect.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920
Yes.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.920
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.720
I'm sure that some paper has the histogram
of 2/2, 2/3...

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.900
[Rhonda]: It's protective.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.810
Yeah, it is.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:16.810
And so it's very...

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.760
[Peter]: Because in cardiac disease it does,
and in cardiac disease the 2/4 is about the

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.040
same as the 3/3.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040
The 2 and the 4 cancel.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040
[Rhonda]: Wait, say that again?

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040
So the 2/4s is...?

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.430
[Peter]: The 2/4 is about the same as the
3/3.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.430
[Rhonda]: Oh, good.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.089
[Peter]: And again, just in hazard ratio.

00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:33.869
[Rhonda]: I found that my mom was 2/4 and
it was for the cardiac problem that I was

00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:34.869
kind of worried.

00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:36.190
Anyways, okay, that's very interesting.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.810
So we're totally going off on this ApoE tangent
but it's something that...

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.119
[Peter]: No one is even watching at this point,
it doesn't matter.

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:43.750
[Rhonda]: ...I'm very interested in.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:50.990
But there's a huge, huge component for lifestyle
in risk for Alzheimer's disease, particularly

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:56.230
with having an ApoE4 allele, and that's where
I've become obsessed.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:01.230
You know, I've been looking at mechanism but
also looking at the epi studies.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.880
Looking at epidemiology, you see certain lifestyle
factors for example, drinking.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:10.760
If you're drinking in your ApoE4 because you're
inducing damage that you can't repair as well,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760
you're going to fare worse.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.160
You know, so anything that's going to damage
your body worse, anything that's going to

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:21.109
create inflammation...refined carbohydrate,
eating a bunch of refined carbohydrates, a

00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:23.960
bunch of sodas with added sugars.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.840
Like, all this stuff that's terrible for you,
that's not whole food, that's not something

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.200
that's nutritious, that's going to cause inflammation.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.710
Inflammatory molecules get across the blood-brain
barrier.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.740
You know, so blah, blah, blah, and all this
damage can continue to occur.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:46.250
So obviously, diet, lifestyle play a very
important role in your Alzheimer's risk.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:53.560
And I think that understanding the biology
of what ApoE4 is doing because now there's

00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:00.890
research, a lot of it coming out of UCSF Gladstone
Institute showing that in addition to a loss

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:05.850
of function with the ApoE4 allele, there's
also a dominant negative effect.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:11.870
So apparently, the ApoE4, there's this 2-amino-acid
substitution and structurally, if you look

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:15.940
at the structure of the protein, it starts
to get cleaved.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:23.190
And so it itself starts to accumulate these,
like, aggregates that then you get more activated

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:28.190
microglia and it keeps, like, spiraling out
this whole inflammatory process in the brain.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:33.260
So there's also this dominant negative effect
that's going on that's interesting.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.440
And you want to understand that as well.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.089
But, yes, Alzheimer's disease is one of the
neurodegenerative diseases that are up in

00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:43.230
the top four or five, like you mentioned,
cause...

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.450
[Peter]: Well, it's the top.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.720
It's the only neurodegenerative disease that's
on the top 10 list of death.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.970
[Rhonda]: Top 10, yeah.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.520
So cardiovascular disease...

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.319
[Peter]: So cardiovascular is far and away
number one.

00:38:52.319 --> 00:39:00.050
It's not even...I mean, cancer in an aggregate
is number two, but as an oncologist I, sort

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:06.060
of, take an issue with that because cancer's
a completely heterogeneic form of diseases.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:11.730
So to put this in perspective, right...so
breast cancer, who's not afraid of breast

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.160
cancer if you're a woman?

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.080
Breast cancer accounts for 3% of deaths in
women.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.890
I was shocked to learn that, very low.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.560
I would have thought much, much higher.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.920
Now, cancer in women, all cancers, 20%, 21%.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.609
Cardiac disease, 22% 23%.

00:39:29.609 --> 00:39:33.760
So if you're woman, if you ask any woman in
the street, "Are you more afraid of heart

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.829
disease or breast cancer?"

00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:38.290
I think most women would understandably say
breast cancer.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:44.140
And yet, it's dwarfed by cardiac disease by
a factor of seven and a half to one.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.430
[Rhonda]: And we definitely know that diet
and lifestyle play a major role in your risk

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.990
for cardiovascular disease.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.990
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.240
I mean, I think there's no place where that's
more obvious than actually in Alzheimer's

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.830
disease for other reasons, which is...

00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.830
[Rhonda]: Really?

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:00.830
Alzheimer's?

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:01.830
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.830
I think so.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.830
[Rhonda]: More than cardiovascular?

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:04.900
[Peter]: Well, I mean I say that just based
on what I called the existence principle,

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.900
right?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.400
So cardiac disease, I mean I think that's
entirely true.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.720
I think cardiac disease is inevitable.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.880
Right?

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:20.309
And, while we've had a deterioration in our
lifestyle over the past 40 years, a pretty

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:26.690
precipitated and accelerated, sort of, move
in the wrong direction on that, it's been

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:31.200
largely offset by pretty amazing medical advances.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:38.020
So the three things that have, I think, allowed
cardiac disease to remain...in fact, it's

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.020
actually come down.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.520
If you look at the death rate from cardiac
disease, it's come down.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.710
So it's still the number one killer but it's
actually on a downward slope, I mean it's

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.369
sort of plateauing.

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:51.420
But when you look at what, sort of, the three
biggest drivers are of cardiac disease, the

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.550
first one is not disputed.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.900
It's smoking.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:00.030
So the data are really clear that if you could
only make one behavioral change to reduce

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.310
your risk of heart disease, it's don't smoke.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:08.800
The next two are actually, because they are
so cross-correlated you can't actually distinguish

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:15.310
which one is more important, are hypertension
and elevated ApoB or LDL particle number.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:21.030
And, again, ApoB is the single best biomarker
or LDL-P to distinguish your risk of cardiac

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:22.030
disease.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:27.160
It trumps LDL cholesterol, it trumps non-HDL
cholesterol, it trumps triglycerides, HDL

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.160
cholesterol.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.390
Those things don't hold a candle to LDL particle
number ApoB.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:33.020
Well, think about it.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.730
Think about the advances we've made in the
last 40 years on all of those, right?

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:40.599
So smoking has gone from 45% of the population
to 18% of the population.

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:41.640
So we reduced smoking.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.640
[Rhonda]: In the U.S.?

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.640
[Peter]: In the U.S. that's right.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.170
Obviously, we haven't done the same in the
developing world.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:52.340
Think of the litany of drugs we have for controlling
hypertension and think about the litany of

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.690
drugs we have to bring down ApoB.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:42:01.230
So despite enormous improvements in the three
big picture drivers, it's still the number

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.960
one killer.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.200
So it's got to be lifestyle-driven but we're
blunting the effect of that.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.510
Whereas in Alzheimer's disease, we don't really
have any pharmacotherapy plays.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.569
Like, we're still arguing about what the environmental
trigger is.

00:42:15.569 --> 00:42:19.460
Is it all diet-driven, is it sleep-driven,
is it stress-driven, what's the combination

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460
of factors?

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.460
Is it is a virus?

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.460
Is it prions?

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.089
I mean I've heard every argument under the
sun, right?

00:42:25.089 --> 00:42:27.150
But here's what we do know.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:32.510
We know that in the last 50 years, the prevalence
of Alzheimer's disease has gone up about 2.5%...per

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:36.030
year, by the way.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.190
I'm sorry.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.940
That's per year.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:44.000
Whereas we know that our longevity has increased
at about 0.6% per year over that same period

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
of time.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.400
Now, over a 50-year period, a 2% spread per
year of prevalence.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.170
Actually, I think that might be incidence,
now when I think about it.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.980
I think it's incidence.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:03.930
And longevity suggests that Alzheimer's disease
isn't just the natural response of getting

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.000
old.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.280
There's something driving it.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:10.910
And even if you accept that part of that increase
in incidence is a greater appreciation for

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:15.520
the diagnosis, it's hard to argue that makes
up the full 2% spread.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.950
And to me, that's the most convincing case
for why there is something in our environment

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.900
that's triggering Alzheimer's disease and
it is not just the natural consequence of

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.900
aging.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.380
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.220
So what are your thoughts as to what are triggering
Alzheimer's disease in terms of our environment?

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.220
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.490
I mean, I think it's probably a combination
of things.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.191
But the most compelling evidence to me and,
again, this is probably, because I'm just

00:43:39.191 --> 00:43:48.640
a simpleton and I like to start with Occam's
razor, is it's very hard to dispute the high

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.339
association between Alzheimer's disease and
Type 2 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia.

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:58.180
And so I'm in the camp of which some neurobiologists
are, but not all.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.300
This is still far from being settled.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.059
I sort of view Alzheimer's disease as brain
diabetes, and I think if the ApoE genotype

00:44:06.059 --> 00:44:08.460
as basically just a susceptibility.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:13.340
So I think anybody can get Alzheimer's disease
with any genotype if there's enough insulin

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:18.410
resistance, if there's basically enough difficulty
in getting glucose through pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.580
and into the Krebs cycle.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.310
So I think it's a neuronal energy problem
more...and I think all of the other things

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.440
we see are results of that.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.900
But in terms of what the driver is, I think
it's a neuronal energy problem.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:41.390
And I think all of the tau plaque, the neuronal,
the synapse stuff, I think those are byproducts.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:45.160
And I think in animal models there's some
very convincing data that you can...you know,

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.510
I mean you've seen the stuff I'm sure more
than I have, right?

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.760
Simultaneous injection of glucose and insulin
can transiently overcome deficit, administration

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:58.330
of exogenous BHB can overcome the deficit
by bypassing and going straight through alpha-hydroxybutyrate

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.700
into the Krebs cycle.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.770
So where you can reverse the signs and symptoms.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:07.980
Now, I'm not particularly in this space though
I find it really interesting.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.099
There's a guy by the name of, Richard Isaacson.

00:45:12.099 --> 00:45:13.680
Do you know Richard?

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:21.770
He's a neurologist at Cornell and he has a
practice that focuses on early cognitive decline

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:28.849
that utilizes very-low-glycemic-index diets
coupled with MCT and stuff.

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:33.400
So it's basically like inducing ketosis without
a full-on ketogenic diet, which obviously

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.780
for many people is challenging.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.420
And he's seen very promising results.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.190
I think he's running a couple of clinical
trials as well.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:44.500
And there's a whole sort of...I don't know
what the word to describe it is.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:49.280
But there's a whole network of people out
there with all of their interesting data that

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.849
are, because we don't have controls, we just
don't know if this is, like, a performance

00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:55.559
bias we're seeing or if there's a true impact.

00:45:55.559 --> 00:46:00.380
But anyway that's sort of my hypothesis, which
is I don't actually know what's causing Alzheimer's

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.359
disease, I don't know how to treat it, I don't
know if it's treatable once it's in a late

00:46:04.359 --> 00:46:11.470
enough stage, but I firmly believe that if
you can be as insulin-sensitive as possible,

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:14.060
for you as an individual you reduce your risk.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.190
Now, that doesn't mean that the risk ever
goes to zero for any of us, regardless of

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:24.710
ApoE genotype, but I know that if I have to
choose between being very-insulin-sensitive

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.430
and not-so-insulin-sensitive I'm going to
be better off in this camp.

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:29.839
And I think that's frankly true for every
disease state.

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:31.480
There are other things.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.630
There's subtle things going on, of course.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.819
IGF, of course, just to bring it back to where
we were.

00:46:37.819 --> 00:46:44.060
IGF is really interesting because centrally
and peripherally you may actually want them

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.910
to be in opposite directions.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:52.950
You probably know this, but Amgen had a drug
that was an IGF-receptor antibody.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:58.910
It went into clinical trials, phase two trials
in pancreatic cancer, advanced pancreatic

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.210
cancer, and it failed.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:07.450
Now it failed despite reducing IGF levels
at the receptor by 50%.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:13.170
You could argue that that failure implies
that reducing IGF is irrelevant, reducing

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:18.650
IGF is irrelevant once the tumor burden is
established, reducing IGF to only 55% is irrelevant.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:20.690
You could argue 100 different things.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:24.369
What's most interesting is that antibody does
not cross the blood-brain barrier.

00:47:24.369 --> 00:47:30.211
And so today, there is ongoing research, it's
all in animals at this point in time, that's

00:47:30.211 --> 00:47:36.650
looking at giving a diet that actually increases
IGF but giving it in the presence of this

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.290
IGF-receptor antibody.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:45.170
The point being is can we raise IGF levels
totally, primarily centrally, and then block

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.049
the receptor peripherally.

00:47:47.049 --> 00:47:53.440
So we ward off cancer and diabetes but we
ward off dementia.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.839
And actually, there's even evidence, though
I think this evidence isn't as strong, that

00:47:57.839 --> 00:48:01.210
elevated levels of central IGF also are protective
against diabetes.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.210
[Rhonda]: Really?

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:03.210
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:07.300
But, again, the problem is these are animal
data so you got to, sort of, take everything

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.549
with, like, a lot of speculation.

00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:10.549
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:14.640
So to just, kind of, bring it briefly back
to the type, when you're talking about diabetes

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:25.329
in the brain being Alzheimer's, what's really
interesting to me is the fact that neurons

00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:29.350
are actually mostly using lactate from astrocytes.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:30.350
Astrocytes are glycolytic.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:36.359
The astrocytes are these brain cells in your
brain which are using glucose mostly, or using

00:48:36.359 --> 00:48:38.760
glucose to generate lactate.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.450
Lactate then gets shuttled into neurons, and
the reason why neurons like that is because

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:49.780
it's thermodynamically favorable, much like
beta-hydroxybutyrate which you mentioned,

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.170
BHB, because it can shunt right into the TCA
cycle in the mitochondria...

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.540
[Peter]: But wait, how does the brain outcompete
the liver for lactate?

00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.819
So, like, if I made you go out there and do
a bunch of burpies, right?

00:49:00.819 --> 00:49:06.700
So the...I'm blanking on the name of the transporter.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.700
[Rhonda]: MCT.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.260
[Peter]: MCT1 or MCT2?

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.309
Which one is the transporter out of the muscle?

00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:12.740
[Rhonda]: I don't know which one.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.770
[Peter]: Okay, but the majority lactate is
going to be generated in the muscle.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:19.790
So then MCT is going to transport that out.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.510
And remember, it's going to go through the
portal system...it actually it doesn't go

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:28.380
to the portal, it passes through the cava,
but it's still passing through the liver.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:33.990
How does the brain managed to get any without
the liver taking it all into the Cori cycle,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.910
which seems to me the preferential place to
undergo gluconeogenesis.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:38.910
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:42.390
So what's weird is that...I don't know the
answer to your question.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:46.750
I know that many tissues...and this has been
shown through the work of George Brooks at

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:52.430
UC Berkeley who actually pioneered the lactate
shuttle hypothesis and the theory.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:57.720
But it's been shown that it gets taken up
by the liver, it gets taken up by the muscle,

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.510
it gets taken up by the brain.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:05.730
In fact, exercise itself has been shown to
preferentially cause the brain to the take

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.730
up more...

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:13.460
[Peter]: Can we measure...I don't know if
you read this literature but there was a lot

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:21.270
of really interesting work back in the '60s
done at Harvard with real fasting experiments.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:22.859
I mean 40-day fasts.

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:28.210
So you'd have inpatient subjects given nothing
but water and minerals for 40 days.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:32.780
And it was done to basically demonstrate what
the steady-state fasting levels of glucose,

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.960
insulin, BHB, and acetoacetate would be.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.579
And it's actually quite interesting, right?

00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:38.440
So you take a normal person.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:47.349
We'd take you and let's say your insulin level
is 10, your glucose level is 95, your BHB

00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:51.840
level is unmeasurable because you're on a
normal diet, and your acetoacetate level is

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.799
unmeasurable, and then we just fast you.

00:50:53.799 --> 00:51:04.790
And it turns out that within about seven days,
you'll be at a ketone level of 5 to 7 millimolar,

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:10.970
glucose will be down to 3 to 4 millimolar,
which is, call it 60 to 70 milligrams per

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:11.970
deciliter.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:17.849
And you will stay at those levels in...you
know, at the end of the 40 days, they're still

00:51:17.849 --> 00:51:18.849
in those levels.

00:51:18.849 --> 00:51:20.230
[Rhonda]: So they stay the same.

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:23.270
[Peter]: So glucose remember really goes away.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:28.470
What's changing is the consumption by the
neuron which goes from, at the initial state,

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.089
being about a 100% glucose...of course, I
don't think they were measuring lactate then

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.089
so we don't actually...

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:34.950
[Rhonda]: Were they looking at neuron or just
brain?

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:36.540
Was it astrocytes or neuron...

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.480
[Peter]: They were probably just looking at
brain.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.480
Yeah.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:47.520
But it would fall to maybe 40% or 50%, the
rest of it being made up by the combination

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.310
of the ketones.

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.390
And it's interesting that they never went
to zero, right?

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:58.250
So even to your last day of life, if you're
being starved to death, you still have glucose

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.250
in your blood.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:06.420
And so it's kind of interesting that, like...what
percentage of overall brain metabolism do

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.420
you think is driven by lactate?

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:13.440
It must be very, very small and reserved for
a very, very specific subset of neurons or

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.480
astrocytes or...

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:18.201
[Rhonda]: Well, the astrocytes are using the
glucose and they're generating lactate.

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:19.201
So the lactate doesn't have to get in.

00:52:19.201 --> 00:52:21.480
[Peter]: So we're not even seeing that, so
that might be the issue.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.900
So that's probably why the liver doesn't matter
because it's...

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.130
[Rhonda]: Yeah, during exercise, I mean.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.660
But it has been shown that lactate will cross
over the blood-brain barrier during exercise

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.660
as well.

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.660
But that is why it doesn't have...

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.950
[Peter]: But the dominant source is...

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.121
[Rhonda]: The astrocytes, yeah.

00:52:34.121 --> 00:52:36.059
The astrocytes are making it in the brain.

00:52:36.059 --> 00:52:37.160
And what's fascinating is...

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.410
[Peter]: So astrocytes don't have mitochondria?

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:39.410
[Rhonda]: They do.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.569
[Peter]: So why do they make all the lactate?

00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:45.569
[Rhonda]: I think they make the lactate because
that's how the neurons are getting their energy.

00:52:45.569 --> 00:52:46.960
I think that's just the way it works out.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.180
[Peter]: So it's sort of a Warburg effect.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.710
The Warburg effect, of course, to me is interesting
because I don't buy the argument that the

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:59.030
Warburg is due to defective mitochondria.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.309
[Rhonda]: It's not.

00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:01.799
Warburg showed that...I mean he...

00:53:01.799 --> 00:53:06.109
[Peter]: No, there are still a lot of people
who think that it's that cancer affects of

00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:07.410
mitochondria, and that's why the Warburg.

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:11.160
But I think it's just that the cancer cell's
smart enough and it's optimizing for cellular

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.680
building blocks, and it sounds like the astrocyte
is doing the same thing.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.320
[Rhonda]: Okay.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.400
We have to talk about this.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400
[Peter]: For different reason, but...

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400
[Rhonda]: Yeah, it's really interesting.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400
Okay.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.030
So we're totally just hopping around all these
interesting topics.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:29.760
But, okay, to finish on the lactate thing,
fascinating work, traumatic brain injury also

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.640
brain aging in real-time, people with TBI
are much more likely to get Alzheimer's especially

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640
if they have ApoE4.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:38.619
You know, up to 10 times, 20 times, depending
on how many alleles they have, but...

00:53:38.619 --> 00:53:44.089
[Peter]: I used to do work with some professionals
athletes and for guys in the NFL.

00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:50.930
If I saw that they were ApoE 3/4...and again
this is completely bogus but it's the best

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:55.609
I think you can do, I would advise somebody
who's an ApoE 3/4 entering the NFL that your

00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:58.460
number of concussions should be fewer than
what is recommended.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.460
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:05.180
I would actually go as to saying if you're
ApoE with 3/4 that head trauma in general

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.940
is putting you at high risk for...

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.490
[Peter]: No, I completely agree but, of course,
when you've got a guy who's about to make

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:16.319
$20 million to play football and he's willing
to, like, play until he gets six concussions,

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.160
maybe you make it three.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.850
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:23.010
So back to the lactate thing, very interesting.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.390
Yeah, so read up on this, you know.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:31.540
George Brooks, a friend of mine, he's working
now with some other physicians at UCLA looking

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:36.220
at the effects of actually exogenous lactate
on helping treat TBI.

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.220
Because TBI...

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.900
[Peter]: Why not just exogenous BHB?

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.690
[Rhonda]: Or, yeah, or that, exactly.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:43.520
[Peter]: I mean have you see what Dom D'Agostino
has done?

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:49.760
[Rhonda]: I think I've read one of his studies
on cancer.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.760
I think it was cancer.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.760
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.760
You should see Dom's work in TBI.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.760
[Rhonda]: So this...oh, in TBI?

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760
That's how he got started.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760
[Rhonda]: That they're the same?

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.760
[Peter]: He's a neurobiologist.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.760
[Rhonda]: Oh, okay.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.390
[Peter]: The only reason he's in cancer now
is because...he started out working a neurobiology...

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.390
[Rhonda]: Interesting.

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:04.390
[Peter]: ...and using TBI models.

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:05.390
[Rhonda]: I didn't know that.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.869
Yeah, but it's the same thing, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate,
it doesn't matter.

00:55:07.869 --> 00:55:09.240
They're going through the MCT...

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.070
[Peter]: Yeah, they're completely overcoming
head trauma.

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:13.109
[Rhonda]: Yeah, they're both doing similar
things.

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:17.150
They're both thermodynamically favorable,
they allow glucose sparing, they allow glucose

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:23.270
to then be used to make glutathione, which
is important in the brain when you have damage.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:28.720
But what's interesting is that TBI also disrupts
astrocytes' ability to make lactate.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.060
And what I'm wondering when you were talking
about...

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.200
[Peter]: But those two might just synergize.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.200
[Rhonda]: They might.

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:37.440
[Peter]: Because I also think the trauma causes
an oxidative stress, so I think what's happening

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.880
is pyruvate dehydrogenase is getting interrupted
and all of a sudden you're having a transient

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:48.000
but violent interruption of energy to the
brain.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.030
And this is obviously of high interest to
the military because of blast injuries, and

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:56.710
Dom would know this, so it's absolutely worth
talking about this with him.

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:58.039
I'm sure the DoD is all over this.

00:55:58.039 --> 00:56:02.310
I hope the DoD is all over this because the
interesting question is, do you have to have

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:08.670
the BHB or the lactate in your system at the
time of injury to prevent it, or can administration

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.609
be done immediately following the trauma?

00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:11.680
[Rhonda]: Or is there a kinetics?

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.030
Is there a certain time?

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:19.910
I think because of the fact that it allows
glucose sparing which if you have a trauma

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:30.400
is...and this has been shown on animal models
for TBI, but this was done by putting glutathione

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.329
transcranially which obviously is not going
to happen.

00:56:33.329 --> 00:56:39.809
But anyways, they could prevent, like, over
50% of the damage because they were able to

00:56:39.809 --> 00:56:45.550
sequester the reactive oxygen species that
start to cause all the damage in the inflammatory

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:47.960
pathways that start to get out of control.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:54.160
So I think that if you allow that glucose
to be used for the pentose phosphate pathway

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.390
within a certain time frame...I don't know
what that time frame is.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:59.780
It was something within a couple of hours.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:05.440
Then, independent of allowing you neurons
to get this easier source of energy...if the

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:11.309
neurons are using glucose because they need
energy but the glucose can't be used to repair

00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:15.829
that damage to the pentose phosphate pathway,
I think that's one component of it in terms

00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:21.250
of the temporal effects, like how soon after
the damage.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.450
But anyways, your Warburg thing.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:29.430
I have to just quickly tell you, I spent six
years doing cancer metabolism at St. Jude

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:31.080
Children's Research Hospital.

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.670
And I wanted nothing more than to believe
that mitochondria were dysfunctional and not...

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:36.670
[Peter]: Defective, yeah.

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:39.960
[Rhonda]: Yeah, because that would have made
my whole thesis, like, so much easier and

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.640
I wouldn't have taken six years.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640
But I couldn't find that.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:50.299
I couldn't find that the cancer was causing
the mitochondria to be so dysfunctional that

00:57:50.299 --> 00:57:51.520
that's why they were glycolytic.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.520
[Peter]: Yeah.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:57.681
There's an amazing paper that Matthew Vander
Heiden wrote in 2009 in "Science" with Lou

00:57:57.681 --> 00:58:01.750
Cantley and Craig Thompson.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.770
Really, that's when I, sort of, shifted my
point of view on that.

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:05.770
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:11.329
Well, you mentioned that cancer cells are
using it for...I agree with you, with the

00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:15.280
fact at you know cancer cells, the reason
why they're glycolytic I think also is because

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.619
it's quicker and they don't really give a
shit, like...

00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:24.280
[Peter]: Well, they're optimizing for the
building blocks to make more cellular machinery.

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.829
They're basically saying, "I'm willing to
do an inefficient process of getting ATP in

00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:31.200
exchange for something else."

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.200
[Rhonda]: Yes.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.010
But here's my other insight onto this, my
other, sort of, theory...

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:37.580
[Peter]: By the way I'm interested in how
to exploit that.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.049
In other words, you don't have to know why
that's happening to figure out how to exploit

00:58:41.049 --> 00:58:42.049
that.

00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:43.049
That's what I'm interested in.

00:58:43.049 --> 00:58:44.049
[Rhonda]: Right.

00:58:44.049 --> 00:58:47.569
Well, here's what I think, another reason
why they've figured out not to use their mitochondria.

00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:53.609
I think the reason they've figured that out,
and this is why I also think why things like

00:58:53.609 --> 00:58:58.799
anything that will activate pyruvate dehydrogenase
or anything like beta-hydroxybutyrate, anything

00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:02.680
that's going to force the mitochondria to
work, right?

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.940
So like whatever it is because the mitochondria
are for the most part, not as active in the

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.940
cancer cell.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.891
I think that anything that's going to force
them to work...the reason why cancer cells

00:59:12.891 --> 00:59:17.730
don't want them to work is because cancer
cells are primed to die.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:23.430
So this is the whole basis, most of the basis,
behind how chemotherapeutic drugs work.

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:27.760
Cancer cells are primed to die in the sense
that our body has increased the amount of

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:32.400
all these pro-death signals, pro-apoptotic
proteins to say, "Die, die, die."

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.780
Cancer cells have increased all of the anti-apoptotic
proteins and signals and say, "No, I'm not

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:38.780
going to die yet."

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.780
So there are, like, balances here.

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.460
You know, they're primed to die, they're ready
to die.

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:44.549
All they need is a little push to the pro-death
side, right?

00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:50.890
So if they have a chemo, that's another activating
more pro-death, it's enough to push the balance

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:52.300
into pro-death, right?

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:57.870
Well, the mitochondria when they're active,
when you're highly metabolic using your mitochondria,

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.040
you're generating reactive oxygen species.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.040
[Peter]: Reactive oxygen species.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040
Yeah.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040
[Rhonda]: Which are a pro-death signal.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.280
And I think that is one of the main reasons
why giving DCA, activating the pyruvate dehydrogenase

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.900
complex, can kill cancer cells.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:16.950
I think that's why ketogenic diets, which
are basically forcing the cell to use oxidized

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:22.690
fats which require a mitochondria, I think
that's also why they're very effective at...

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:26.309
[Peter]: And so that's interesting, so you
would think, then, that all things equal,

01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:31.049
a ketogenic diet would produce favorable cancer
outcomes versus exogenous ketones?

01:00:31.049 --> 01:00:35.520
In other words, you could produce the same
hormonal milieu with both, but in one of them

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.750
you don't have to undergo the machinery.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.090
[Rhonda]: So, maybe.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:42.210
Maybe.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.522
And the reason I say this is...

01:00:43.522 --> 01:00:44.950
[Peter]: And I find that interesting, I don't
know the answer.

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:45.950
[Rhonda]: Yes.

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:50.680
The reason I say that is because cancer cells
also want lipids.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.230
They like to build more cells and you need
lipids to build...

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.230
[Peter]: Yeah, so that might offset it.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:57.099
[Rhonda]: So I'm worried about that component
of it.

01:00:57.099 --> 01:01:00.960
However, if you think about normal cells aren't
primed to die.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.971
So anything that's activating your mitochondria
in normal cells isn't going to kill them,

01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:11.020
and I think that's why it's a much better
cancer therapeutic strategy than chemo because

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.260
chemotherapeutic drugs also kill normal cells,
proliferating cells.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:19.589
You've got, your hair, your skin, whatever
is proliferating fast like a cancer cell.

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:27.180
So I actually think that it's possible that
whether that's fat oxidation through more

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.930
of a ketogenic diet, I think it's something
that needs to be tested more.

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:36.089
Like I said I do have concerns just because
you are giving a cancer cell building blocks

01:01:36.089 --> 01:01:39.920
for more cells, which of course is always
a concern.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.789
But I think that anything that is going to
force the mitochondria to become active and

01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:53.400
generate that signaling reactive oxygen species
signaling to death to kill it, is good.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:59.260
It's also why taking supplemental dietary
antioxidants when you have cancer is very

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.520
dangerous because you're blunting that whole
signaling pathway, right?

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.089
You're basically blunting all the reactive
oxygen species that are usually signaling

01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:11.089
for your cells that are primed to die, for
the cancer cells to die, and you're sequestering

01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:12.089
it.

01:02:12.089 --> 01:02:16.190
So it's like and that's been shown.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.410
But it's something that's interesting to think
about.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:26.790
And I don't know, it's a possibility, it hasn't
been proven, but I think that it's certainly

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.960
an interesting hypothesis that should be looked
at.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.170
And for all those people out there that are
researching cancer and mitochondria, maybe

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.170
they will.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.750
[Peter]: We'll be looking at it.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:37.790
[Rhonda]: Great.

01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:42.170
All right, so I think we've talked about a
lot of interesting things.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:47.670
And is there anything else you want to discuss
or talk about?

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:54.570
[Peter]: I mean, I think we could talk about
ISIS, but I feel like it takes us a little

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.570
bit off course, so probably not.

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:56.070
[Rhonda]: Yeah, probably, probably.
