All right, I want to read an
email I got from a viewer named

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Tracy Brandon.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.910
"Hi Ellen, my name is Tracy.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.542
I'm a single mother to a
beautiful boy named Miles.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.500
Miles and I watch your
show together every day,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.420
and it never fails
to make us laugh.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.280
So I'm writing to say thank you.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.860
You have no idea the impact
you've made on my life.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.200
My coworkers called me
Smiles because no matter what

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.610
I'm going through, I
always make sure to smile.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.520
And watching you is
what keeps me smiling

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520
through the tough times.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.729
So keep doing you,
Ellen, because you really

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:29.770
do change people's lives.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.600

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.060
So Tracy, right now, is
backstage in a dressing room

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.430

We're going to use
our Cisco technology.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.960
And Tracy thinks
that she's being

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.452
interviewed for EllenTube.

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:42.660
She's one of my biggest fans.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180
Let's just-- Jeannie,
obviously, is in on this.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.080
Jeannie, if you can hear me,
blink five times really fast.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.800
Blink five times really,
really, really, fast.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.770
All right.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.100
And then put one-- left
hand way in the air.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.460
Put left hand way in the air.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.620
Like, way high.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.340
Yeah.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.940
Great.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.010
Great.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.940
Wave it around.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.550
Wave the hand around like that.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.050
Right.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.190
And blink really fast.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.749
Just keep blinking
really, really fast.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:09.290
That's great.

Hi, Ellen!

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.780
What's going on, Tracy?

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.752
I'm doing great.

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:35.955
You know, just chilling.

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:36.455
Good.

Good.

You're sitting
there with Jeannie?

Yeah.

Yeah.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.550
Yeah.

She's-- Jeannie, she doesn't
seem to be that surprised.

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:47.810
Tracy, you're not that
surprised, are you?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.100
No.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.255
No, I'm not that surprised.

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:50.296
Why aren't you surprised?

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:51.680
But I'm glad to
meet you, though.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.070
Yeah.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.320
You're not supposed to be
surprised, because we're not

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.200
surprising you.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.870
Because you're an
actress that we hired.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.920
We're surprising Jeannie.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.003
Jeannie, come on out here.

00:02:04.473 --> 00:02:05.471

Oh, my gosh.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.976
When I was telling you
to blink, and then I

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.600
started telling you
to raise your hand,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.516
that you just did it--

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:34.820
Well, I do whatever you say.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.610
You're my boss.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.430
Move your hair.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.540
Here, move it.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.120
And I thought,
oh, you know, this

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.890
is this normal thing that
you tell people what to do.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.390
Right.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.764
So I was like,
oh, this is funny.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:45.520
Yeah.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.220
And then when she wasn't
getting scared I was like--

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.000
or when she wasn't
surprised, I was like--

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.420
I know.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.919
It's Ellen.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.561
Like, no one has ever
done this before!

00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:52.060
I know.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.946
What do I do?

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:55.351
I saw you just, like, keep
pointing, like, it's Ellen.

Yeah, no.

She's an actress.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.520
We hired her.

I know you're in shock.

gone through together--

How are you?

So you've entered every

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.100
won one contest.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.711
No, I haven't.

To tell you you still
have not won anything.

OK.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.170
I don't know why we wouldn't
bring Jeannie to see a show

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.880

a bathroom or something.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.980
So long ago.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.270
So, thank you.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.770
Thank you.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.940
I'm grateful for you,
because I feel the same way.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.160
I have the greatest
group of people

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.450
working with me every
single day, except for Andy.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.950
And I--

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.520
But I walk in, and when
you're not at that desk,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.620
I know you're someplace
on assignment doing

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.910
something wonderful for us.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.042
And so you're a huge
part of this show.

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:28.000
Huge part of this show.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.210
Thank you.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.610
So we wanted to make it official
that you're always going

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.170
to be a big part of this show.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.090
So you have your own
seat in the audience.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.590
Oh my god.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.852
You have-- the Jeannie seat!

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:42.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.154
Thank you so much.

00:07:43.154 --> 00:07:44.118
You're welcome.

00:07:44.118 --> 00:07:45.570
We'll be back.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.610
So we sent you
out on assignment,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.110
and you did Ford's "Life's
First Evers," right?

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.610
Yes.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.610
And what is your favorite
part about doing that?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.130
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.296
Well, you want to know what?

00:07:54.296 --> 00:07:55.980
I always say my
favorite thing to get

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.680
to do is to get to be a
little part of what you do

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.740
every day, which is, you find
these amazing, incredible

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.960
people that have the
most amazing stories

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.210
and getting to share
it with everyone.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.820
And just, it touches me.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.540
And the stories that we found
for this were just so awesome,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.790
and the people are so awesome.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.550
And it was one of the
greatest experiences.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.240
It really was.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.620
It's fun to do that
for people, isn't it?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.110
It's so fun.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.920
You feel so blessed and
so lucky when you do.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.420
Right.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.760
Well, let me tell you something.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.750
OK.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.710
Our friends at Ford were so
happy with your "Life's First

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.310
Ever" series, they want you
to have your very own first

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.480
ever Ford EcoSport.

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.486
No!

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:37.972
No way!

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:40.462
Oh my gosh!

00:08:40.462 --> 00:08:42.454
Oh my gosh!

00:08:42.454 --> 00:08:43.948
Are you kidding me?

00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:50.422
Oh my gosh!

00:08:50.422 --> 00:08:52.414
Holy smokes!

00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:55.402
I've never gotten
to do this part.

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.142
I've never gotten
to do this part.

00:08:57.142 --> 00:08:57.892
This is your part.

00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:59.386
Oh my gosh!

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:00.970
Holy smokes!

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.310
I know.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.390
I know.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.180
There you go.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.464
Oh my gosh!

00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:06.750
This was so fun.
