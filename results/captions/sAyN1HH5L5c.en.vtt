Next on this edition of It's Supernatural!
[music]

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.220
Centuries have come and gone offering wisdom
and understanding throughout the ages.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.200
Today there should be nothing beyond one's
power to discover.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.160
And yet the strange, unusual and mysterious
world of the supernatural defies understanding.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.440
Stay tuned for a unique and powerful investigation
into a curious undiscovered universe only

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.340
on It's Supernatural!

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.520
[music]

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.820
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative reporter.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:55.240
It's going to be hard for you to believe,
but on December 11, 1981, a woman was praying

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.340
and she felt an impression to go to a K-Mart
Department Store.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.360
And she drove to the store, got out of her
car and, Margy Palm, what happened?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.140
Margy: Well I was walking to my car and when
I got to the car I felt something in my back

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.320
and I thought, what is that?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.120
And I turned around and there was this man
standing there.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.189
He was shaking and crying, and he was dressed
in black.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.909
He had a gun about that big, not a small hand
gun, a big 38-caliber revolver, and he had

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.170
it stuck in me.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.399
And when I turned around he stuck it right
here.

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:48.439
And he said, "I am the man who killed the
girl last night at," he was at a bar in San

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.200
Antonio, Texas, where I lived.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.549
And he said, "And I have cut a man's heart
out in prison and if you don't do exactly

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.539
what I tell you to do I'm going to kill you."

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.829
And I knew he was serious.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.329
I had never seen anybody remotely like this
man except on TV.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.810
And so, and the other thing was I hadn't read
the paper, so I didn't know that this man

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.810
had done this.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.300
But it was headlines of our papers, newspapers,
and friends of mine told me there were helicopters

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.760
circling San Antonio looking for this man.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
Sid: So I mean, what he said was bad enough.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Margy: Yeah.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.440
Sid: But had you known that this was the man
that murdered and raped 30 women?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440
Margy: Yeah.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.440
Sid: And the thing that's kind of amazing
is there was a certain profile he was looking for.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.300
He was looking for a woman, because these are the women that he had murdered and raped previously,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.520
that looked exactly like Margy.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.000
But she didn't know any of this.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.100
So the gun is in your ribs.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.320
What's the first thing you thought?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.160
Margy: Well the first thing I thought was
I'm going to die today.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.630
That was the first thought that came into
my mind.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.450
And I could feel this terror trying to come
on me.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.590
I could feel my body starting to shake.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.731
And then out of my mouth, it was very interesting,
out of my mouth came the words, "Do you know

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.530
Jesus Christ?"

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.040
Sid: You're saying with a gun in your ribs,
"Do you know Jesus Christ?"

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640
What did he say?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.980
Margy: He said, "No, I don't want to know
Jesus Christ, lady."

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.790
He said, "Get in the car and sit on your hands
until I decide what we're going to do."

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.350
So I got in the car.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.040
I sat in the passenger side of the car.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.430
And he told me, sit on my hands, which I did,
and he stuck his gun right here in my ribs,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.620
and he told me, "If you try to escape I will
shoot this gun and kill you."

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.820
So and I knew he was serious.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.840
I had never seen anybody like this man.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.430
So anyway, I started to pray, and I was like
this in my car, and I was praying, and all

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:00.660
of a sudden I saw a, like a picture inside
of myself, and I also saw scriptures from

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.910
the Bible, like there they were in front of
me.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.140
And one of the scriptures said, "I have given
you authority over serpents and scorpions,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.880
and over all of the power of the enemy, nothing
shall by any means can hurt you."

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.000
Sid: Did this help you?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.750
Margy: Yes, it helped me.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.030
I mean, I had been a believer in Jesus for
many years.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.300
And of course, you know, this man is telling
me he's going to kill me, and I'm seeing what

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.770
God, I felt that this was what God was telling
me, was the scripture.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:41.099
And then I saw the scripture that said, "These
signs shall follow them that believe.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.500
They shall cast out demons."

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.259
So then I saw a picture of myself take my
hand from under myself and put them on his

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:58.990
head, and command these demonic spirits to
come out of him, which might sound very strange.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.080
Sid: Margy, this whole deal is unreal to me.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.120
It's unreal.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.500
So you're getting all these messages from
God.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.719
Margy: Getting all these messages from God.

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.389
Sid: But in the meantime, there's a real life
man.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.389
Margy: Right.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.949
Sid: That's a maniac with a gun right next
to you in control.

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:12.949
Margy: Right.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.009
But you know, the Bible says you're not wrestling
with flesh and blood.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.090
In other words, you're not wrestling with
a human being.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.840
You are wrestling with principalities, powers
and rulers of darkness of this world.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.080
It says you're wrestling with a demonic spirit
many times.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.340
And I mean, I knew this man was filled with
that.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:39.900
He was so filled with hatred and fear, and
he was just, you could see it all over him.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.000
Sid: Did you pray for him?

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.010
Margy: So and I believe the Bible.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.360
Sid: But did you pray for him?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360
Margy: I did.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.289
That was the next thing I did and that, this
probably was the hardest thing, one of the

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:55.439
hardest things I did all day because, you
know, the Bible says to have faith, and faith

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.420
is believing what God says and then doing
it.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.159
So I had to believe so much what I was
seeing that I did it.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.469
And I thought to myself, if this is not God,
I'm dead.

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:07.469
Sid: For sure.

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.520
Margy: If I'm just making this up.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.140
So I took my, I said, I didn't look at him,
I said, "I'm going to pray for you."

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.350
And he said, "Lady, you're not going to pray
for me."

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.169
And I said, "Yes I am."

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.389
I took my hands out from under myself, I put
them on his head and said, "In the name of

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.729
Jesus, I use the authority of the name of
Jesus and I command every demonic spirit to

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:34.289
come out of you, out of this man I command
it to leave my car, I command the spirit of

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.689
death to leave my car and I'm telling you,
today, that this man will be serving Jesus

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.710
before today is over."

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.430
And I mean, I was screaming this in the car.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.289
Sid: What was he doing?

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.180
Margy: Well I think I, I think he was just
frozen.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.590
He probably never had anything like that happen,
obviously.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.389
Sid: I'm sure the other 30 women didn't do
that.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.939
Margy: I sat back down and I sat, put my hands
back under myself, and I kind of went like this.

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:07.919
And the next thing he said, "Oh my gosh, I'm
in a car with a religious freak."

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.639
Sid: He really was.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.719
Margy: And he said, "Are you conning me?"

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.381
And I said, "I've never even heard anybody
say that to me."

00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:21.110
And I said, "No, this is real.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.180
I'm really like this."

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.330
And that morning, I put my Bible in my car
and this book of scriptures that I had been

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.330
compiling.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.979
And so I said, "Look, do you think that's
normal for a girl to carry a bible and a book

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.740
of scripture, and evangelistic tapes I had
in my car."

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.819
And I said, "Do you think that's normal?"

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.660
And he said, "No, I don't think it's normal."

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.979
And I said, "This is real."

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.189
I mean, I said, "You, God put you," all of
a sudden I was realizing that God had put

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:47.690
him in my car.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:54.419
And the other thing I was realizing was that
the fear and terror that was in the car had

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.060
left.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:01.140
After I prayed all of a sudden this peace
came in the car. And uh...

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.650
Sid: Listen, you think you have problems,
how would you like to have been in that car

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.919
that Margy was in?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.500
I know you'll be back.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.800
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:20.980
[music]

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.760
Hello YouTube mishpochah!

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.180

This is Sid Roth.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.560
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative
reporter and we have a word in Hebrew.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.740
It's called "chutzpah." It means nerve.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.620
And Margy Palm had nerve.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:05.880
She was in a car with a psychopathic rapist-murderer,
had just murdered 30 women that looked exactly

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.900
like her, one just a few hours earlier.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.340
And she puts her hands on him and prays that
he be set free.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.960
He calls her a religious fanatic and he drives
her to a secluded spot.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.120
And what happened next, Margy?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.080
Margy: Well the next thing that happened was
he said to me, "I don't know why, but I don't

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.770
feel like raping you.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:34.010
I feel more love coming out you than anybody
I've ever known in my life.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.320
I don't know why.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.740
I don't understand.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.860
Are you an angel?

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.060
Who are you?

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.740
And I don't understand why you're not afraid
of me."

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.580
And I said, "Well you know, Jesus is not going
to appear to you unless it's a phenomena that

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.300
he appears through his people.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:55.900
And you are being confronted with Jesus Christ
today with his love because all he was telling me."

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.240
He said, "I have so much hatred in me if
there is a God and there is no way you can

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.620
get it out of me."

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.740
And I was saying, I would say, "Well there's
no, the only reason I'm in this car is because

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.380
God put me in the car with you."

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.440
And so when I wasn't afraid of him he started
thinking I was an angel.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.840
But that was, the reason I didn't have fear
is because God's power was in the car.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.390
I mean, you know, He said, there's a scripture
that says, "There's no fear in love.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.380
Perfect love casts out fear."

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.920
And he was feeling that.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.060
Sid: Now what did you feel towards him?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.880
Margy: That was the other amazing thing, was,
you know, at first, I felt that fear.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.660
But after I prayed that prayer this peace
came into my car and I felt this overwhelming

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:48.750
compassion toward him that I don't know that
I've ever felt that much compassion for anybody

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.900
that hates me and is trying to kill me.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:59.840
But I felt this overwhelming love and mercy
and compassion for him, and I kept hearing

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.440
God seemed to be telling me over and over,
"My mercy endures forever".

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.920
And I felt, I kept thinking to myself, this
is God's love.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.780
This is how God loves people.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.390
Sid: And a man that's separated from God as
this man could feel that love was able to

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.390
penetrate it.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.620
Margy: Yeah, it was penetrating him because
even, after a while, I mean, you know, he'd

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.820
be saying horrible words, cussing up a
storm, really.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.980
But every time he'd say a cuss word, he'd
say, "I'm so sorry, lady, I'm saying that.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.060
I am so sorry.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.270
I know that's offending you."

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:40.440
He was starting to become convicted every
time he'd say a word, a word that might be

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.600
offensive to me, which was very interesting.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.300
Then we started talking and, you know, he
said, "I'm never going back to prison again."

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.880
And I said, "Well you're in a prison.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.440
Right now you're in a prison of hate."

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.750
And I said, "There are people that go into
prisons and help prisoners, evangelists."

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.180
And he said, "Well like name one."

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.710
So I named an evangelist, Kenneth Copeland,
who I named.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.670
And he said, "Well where does this man live?"

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.300
And I said, "Well he lives in Fort Worth."

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.990
And he said, "Well I want to go up and see him."

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.360
And I said, "Well I don't know this man personally."

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.820
So he said, "But I want us to go up there."

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.950
So that's exactly what happened.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.850
We ended up, and he wanted to go up through
Austin.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:34.140
And when he said that to me, I saw a picture,
and I'm sure it was from God, because I saw

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.850
a road blockade all around Austin.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:44.810
And then I saw a picture of Kerrville, Texas,
and I felt that God was telling me to tell

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.730
him we're supposed to go to Kerrville.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.630
And I saw him getting on a bus, and I said,
"You need to get, you're supposed to get on

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.630
a bus."

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:58.640
And I told him all this stuff, which all sounds
very bizarre and crazy, except this is all

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.120
written in the newspaper in San Antonio.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.050
I mean, it's not, you know, it sounds like
I made it up.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.870
Sid: So basically you had a vision.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.170
Margy: I had a vision.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.950
Sid: Showing you there was this road block.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.170
He must have thought you were nuts, but how
did he think that you were telling the truth?

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:19.280
Margy: Well after I told him this, he said,
"I want you to go into that convenience store

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.880
there and get me a paper, cigarettes and beer."

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.260
Sid: He was really trusting you at this point
because you have gone out the back door.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.260
Margy: Yeah, I could have.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.880
Sid: Or told the man, I've got a psychopath
with a gun on me.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:37.680
Margy: Yeah, I really could have, but I really
believed that God had put me there.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.100
I really, I felt this peace in me.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.420
I felt that God had really put me in the situation.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.640
So I bought the beer, I bought the cigarettes,
I bought the paper.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.540
And I looked down on the paper, and I noticed
he was the headline of the paper.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.120
And it was amazing to me when I looked at
it I still didn't have fear when I looked at it.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:05.320
When I took it back to the car and he started
reading the paper, and he said, "How did,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.450
have you read this paper before?"

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.450
And I said, no.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.880
And he said, he read me the first paragraph,
and in the first paragraph it talked about

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.660
a road blockade around Austin.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.692
Sid: Exactly what you had seen in the vision.

00:14:15.692 --> 00:14:17.350
So he knew you were hearing from God.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.350
Margy: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.420
I said, "That's God."

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.699
Sid: So did he not–
Margy: Yeah.

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:24.080
He said, "Now where are we supposed to go?"

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.850
Sid: He's now asking you and you're the one
he's going to murder and rape.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.850
Margy: He's asking me.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.930
Sid: Let me tell you something.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:42.040
If God could love this man, comprehend
how much God could love you.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.280
God has so much love that you never even experienced
that you're about to experience.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.820
We'll be back right after this word.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:15:02.580
[music]

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.520
Sid: I want to go to the control room and find

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.620
out who will be on next week.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.080
Janie, who's up?

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.160
Janie: You'll be interviewing a woman by the
name of Rose Price and she experienced the

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.060
horrors of the Holocaust.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:21.700
Nearly 100 of her relatives died in the Holocaust
and Rose herself was experimented on and tortured,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:28.100
and she had so much hate that she ended up
moving to America, and I mean, she didn't

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.640
die in the Holocaust, which was a miracle.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.760
But she still had hate, hatred towards the
German people.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.560
And when she moved to America she got married,
had children.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.700
And when her daughter was a teenager, she
said, "Mommy, I believe in Jesus."

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.660
And Rose felt betrayed because she thought
it was in Jesus' name that her whole family

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.840
was killed.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.840
And so Rose wanted to just prove to her family
that this Jesus is not the Messiah.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.440
And so she just ended up searching the scriptures,
and she ended up finding out that Jesus really

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:05.060
was the Messiah, and he gave her supernatural
forgiveness for the German people.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.340
Sid: I can't wait for that. Thank you, Janie.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.920
Now Margy, here you are in the car with this
psychopath who's murdered 30 women that looked

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.430
just you, murdered and raped.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:20.810
And all of a sudden he's taking direction
from you because God supernaturally– He realized

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.040
it's God speaking through you.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.700
And he even had the trust to let you call
your husband?

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.440
Margy: Yeah.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.500
He told me to call my husband.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.940
So I called home and all of a sudden–
Sid: Why did he tell you to call your husband?

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.050
Margy: Well you know, he said, all day he
kept saying, "I don't know if I'm going to

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.720
be able to let you go or not."

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.140
And you know, he just changed his mind.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.430
He said, "Call your husband."

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:51.860
So I called my husband and when my husband
answered the phone, all of a sudden, the calm

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.230
that I had all day went out the window.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.530
I started shaking.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.530
Sid: I'm sure.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.460
Margy: When I heard his voice I started thinking,
am I going to see my family again and things

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.500
like that.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.880
And anyway, when I got off the phone, Stephen
was standing there with the gun on me, and

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.509
he said, "You're really upset."

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:15.080
And I put my hands on him and I said, "In
Jesus' name, I take authority in Jesus' name

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.380
over the spirit of fear and command it to
leave me."

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.949
And it left immediately, and that peace came
back on me.

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:25.010
And I said–
Sid: Why didn't you tell your husband what

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.010
was going on?

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.189
He wouldn't have known.

00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:28.519
Margy: Because Stephen was standing right
there.

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:29.519
Sid: Oh I see.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:32.029
Margy: Yeah, he was standing right there with
a gun on me when I was on the phone.

00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:33.029
Sid: Okay.

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:34.029
Margy: So I couldn't tell him.

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:37.100
And he knew something was wrong, and he kept
saying, what's the matter.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.950
I said, "I'll be home later.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:39.950
I'm out shopping."

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.970
It was Christmas time.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.740
So you know, he just let it go at that.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.909
And so after I got off the phone I was shaken
up.

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:51.490
But God's peace came back on me right after
I prayed.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:57.070
And we got back in the car and started going
up to Kerrville where I had seen God showed

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.330
us to go.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:04.740
And so on the over out there, Stephen started
telling me that he had this son.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.150
And he said, "I haven't told you this, but
I have a son."

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.240
And I said, "Well I want to ask you a question.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.950
If this son had committed the same crimes
that you've committed, I don't know what they

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:20.570
are, if he had done exactly what you did and
had done, would you be willing to die for

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:27.520
him and let's just say there is hell, would
you be willing to go hell and pay for all

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.870
of these crimes, that God would say, you do
this, you're going to pay for every crime

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.070
that your son has committed.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.740
Would you be willing to die and go to hell
for him?

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:43.340
And I want to know if you could still love
your son if he had done those kind of crimes?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.020
Would you forgive him?"

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.680
Sid: That's a very penetrating question.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.809
Margy: So it was.

00:18:47.809 --> 00:18:49.899
He said, "Well that's a hard question, lady."

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:51.470
And I said, "You need to answer it.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.500
I want you to answer me."

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.601
And he said, "Well you know what–"
Sid: You're saying to a man, a psychopath

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:58.500
with a gun that you need to answer it.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.040
Lady, you got chutzpah.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.620
Margy: So he said, "You know what, I would
die for my son.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.159
I would die for him and I would forgive him."

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.880
And I said, "Well you know, that's exactly
what Jesus Christ did for you."

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:25.379
And he just looked at me and he said, "You've
been preaching to me all day and I finally

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.860
understand what you're trying to say."

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.480
And then we just kind of drove on in silence
for a while, and all of a sudden he pulled

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.880
my car over to the side of the road, and he
was looking all around my car.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.340
He looked in back of him and all over the
place, and I didn't know what he was doing.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.429
Sid: What was he looking for?

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:50.269
Margy: Well he stopped my car on the side
of the road after looking all over the place,

00:19:50.269 --> 00:19:56.039
and then his hands went up in the air like
this, and he said, "Jesus, I'm sorry for everything

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.039
I've ever done.

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.039
Please forgive me.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.300
I want to go to Heaven."

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.720
And I just sat there staring at him because
I had not said to do that.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.600
But what had happened was, he told me later,
he said, "Remember when I was looking around

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.120
the car?"

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.840
And I said, yes.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:17.620
He said, "I heard an audible voice," and he
said, "it came from up here and it said to

00:20:17.629 --> 00:20:22.299
me, "This is the last time I'm going to call
you, Stephen.'"

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:28.030
So he said, "When I heard that voice," now
I didn't hear it, but he heard it.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.789
And he said, "It was very loud."

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:32.279
He said, "I knew it was Jesus."

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:37.760
And he said, "I knew all day everything that
had gone on," you know, he said, "I could

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:45.139
just see the peace that you had and everything,
I realized that this was not a joke.

00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:50.389
Everything you said was true and there really
was a Jesus, there is a Jesus and this was

00:20:50.389 --> 00:20:52.580
not something you made up."

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.509
He said, "I had thought it was just, you know,
you had this strong faith, but I knew it was

00:20:57.509 --> 00:20:58.540
something real."

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.740
Sid: So look, he's one of the ten most wanted
men in America.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.840
There's helicopters going all over.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.420
Everyone is looking for him.

00:21:06.429 --> 00:21:09.129
They're furious to find him.

00:21:09.129 --> 00:21:11.800
What did he do next now that he believes in
Jesus?

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.110
Margy: Well I mean, at that point in the car,
you know, when he put his hands up after hearing

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.070
this voice, he started crying.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.269
And he said, "It's gone.

00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:23.269
It's gone."

00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:24.289
And I said, "What's gone?"

00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:29.570
And he said, "Lady, something just came in
me and all the hatred is gone out of me."

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:35.399
He said, "I've been hating and hating, and
I hated myself, and hated everybody else,

00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:37.450
and I feel like I've been cleaned.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.651
I'm clean now."

00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:43.149
And I said, "Well you have, what the Bible
says, you have been born again."

00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:45.840
He said, "What in the world is that?"

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.059
And I said, "When you got born the first time
you have an earthly mother and father, and

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:54.029
you have their blood in you.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:55.610
You are their seed.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:22:01.919
Well when you ask Jesus to come into your
life he puts his seed into you, which is eternal

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:07.460
life, and he becomes, God becomes your father
and Jesus' blood comes into you.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:13.140
You have supernatural DNA and he washes your
sins away supernaturally."

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.840
I said, "It's supernatural."

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.040
And he said, "I don't deserve this."

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.960
He said, "I don't deserve it, but I feel like
I'm clean, lady."

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.070
And he was overwhelmed with this feeling.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.889
And so then we drove on up to Kerrville.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:33.691
And when we got there, I went into the bus
station, and I said, "Is there a bus going

00:22:33.691 --> 00:22:35.320
to Austin any time soon?"

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.100
And he said, "In 30 minutes there's a bus
going."

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:44.300
So he, Stephen and I sat there waiting for
this bus, and when I went back to the car,

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.700
he said, "Don't tell me, there's a bus going
to Fort Worth."

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.280
And I said, "Yeah, the next bus coming in
is going to Fort Worth."

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.200
So they eventually caught him and he was executed.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.640
But there is a big prison ministry now as
a result of his life.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.060
Sid: What did he say to the police officer
that arrested him?

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:10.640
Margy: Well he said, "If I had seen you earlier
this morning there would have been a shoot-out

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.240
and I would have killed myself, but I met
this lady today and she changed my life, and

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.700
I'll never be the same again."

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.540
Sid: Looking back in retrospect, how could
you have done that, Margy?

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:22.549
Margy: I couldn't have done it.

00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:23.789
Sid: How could you have gone through this?

00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:25.780
Margy: I couldn't have done it without Jesus.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.780
It wouldn't be possible.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.780
Sid: I mean, you're just a mom.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.040
Margy: I know, I am.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.360
Well I mean, I couldn't do it without Jesus.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.480
But that morning I said, I will never forget
this, that morning I said, "God, I'll do anything

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.180
you want me to do for you."

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:45.239
Don't ever say that if you don't mean it because
God had literally used me.

00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:46.239
Sid: Had you not done that?

00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:47.549
Margy: Had I not done that I'd be dead.

00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:48.200
Sid: You'd be dead.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.740
Margy: I'd be dead.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.240
Sid: Did you hear that?

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:56.919
Remember the voice that this man heard, "This
is your last chance."

00:23:56.919 --> 00:24:02.669
I believe that some of you that are watching
me right now, God has been calling you for

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:10.180
a long time and this is your last, last chance.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.000
Pray this prayer with me and mean it to the
best of your ability.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.460
I don't care what you have done, God loves
you.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.560
His love is pouring right through this television
set right now.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.960
There is something happening to you and that's
God's spirit.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:33.360
Repeat this prayer: Dear God, out loud, Dear
God, I'm a sinner.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.860
Against you and you alone have I sinned.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:49.160
I believe that Jesus died for my sins and
because of his blood I am clean.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:56.520
And now that I am clean, I make Jesus my
Messiah and Lord.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.820
Lord Jesus, come inside of me, take over my
life.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:08.210
I need to know my Father God.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.619
I need to know the goodness of God.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:20.260
My earthly father made mistakes, but O God,
your love is being poured into me right now.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.360
Fill me.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:28.900
Say this out loud, fill me in Jesus' name
with your Holy Spirit.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.680
You see, because of Jesus, you've been made
whole.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.580
God says, "I remember your sins no more."

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.520
Fill them right now, O God.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:47.040
Let them experience the love of the Father,
the love, the clean, undefiled love of the

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.400
Father.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:56.360
Let them experience your peace and let nothing
separate them from your love.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.180
Let nothing ever separate them again.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:08.820
I urge you to get a Bible, start reading it
and start telling God how much you love him

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.940
because you are special.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.660
God really, really loves you.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.260
He really does.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.380
He sent me here to tell you.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.040
That's why I'm here.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.260
He loves you.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.620
He loves you. He does.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:32.720
