00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.780
Working long hours is a way of life in Japan.
So much so, that some occasionally die from it.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.000
Karoshi is a term that
means death by overwork.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.080
So why are people working so hard?
And can it be fixed?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.180
Japan has some of the longest
working hours in the world.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.760
Nearly a quarter of Japanese
companies have their employees

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.680
work more than 80 hours
of overtime per month.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.980
Those extra hours are often unpaid.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.080
Today, Japan’s corporate culture is
driven by the so-called salaryman.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.980
The salaryman is defined by
his loyalty to his company

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.060
and expected to spend his entire
career working for the same firm.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.260
Not only does he work long hours in
the office, but it’s also assumed

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.980
he’ll participate in after-work activities
too, like drinking with colleagues.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.020
And they’re not taking enough time off.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.540
In 2017, one survey found that despite
being entitled to 20 days off per year,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.940
Japanese workers left 10 of those days unused -
topping every other country in the survey.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.560
You don’t have to be in the confines of corporate
walls to feel the impact of its work culture.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.480
It’s 3am Thursday morning right now
in Tokyo, I'm in the area of Ginza.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.140
Every few minutes I see a man
wearing a suit, holding a briefcase.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.520
The nation’s work ethic dates back to what’s
referred to as Japan’s economic miracle,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.320
which was its dramatic economic
growth beginning in the 1950s,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.640
which propelled it to become the
world’s second-largest economy.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.260
Inside Japan’s corporations, the
culture emphasizes the success of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.480
a company as a whole to be more
important than any single individual,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.400
which might explain why one study found that
63% of Japanese felt guilty for taking paid leave.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.600
But perhaps more concerning is this:

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.860
Long work hours don’t necessarily
mean high productivity.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.160
In fact, Japan has the lowest productivity
amongst the G7 nations.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.780
Earlier I mentioned the term karoshi -
it means death by overwork.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.760
It’s legally recognized by the
government and usually is marked

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.060
by a heart attack, stroke or
suicide due to stress.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.640
There’s hundreds of cases of karoshi reported
annually, although some argue these cases

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.340
are underreported and that the real number
could exceed that by up to 10 times.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.840
An employee of the advertising firm
Dentsu jumped to her death in 2015.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.420
The cause was said to have been
depression caused by overwork.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.060
The case generated widespread attention and
renewed calls to change the long working hours

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.400
and illegal unpaid overtime
highly common in Japan.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.020
The firm was fined for violating labor standards
because she was reportedly forced

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.160
to work more than 100 hours
of overtime per month.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.500
The company’s CEO even
resigned over the controversy.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.720
After the death, Dentsu made
some changes within the company.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.660
One of them?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.760
The lights in the office now turn off at 10pm every
night in an effort to force employees to leave.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.760
Both the government and companies are now actively
trying to reduce the number of working hours here.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.540
And there are some
early signs of hope.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.700
Japan’s government has considered several
initiatives to curb the number of hours spent

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.480
at the office, including making it mandatory
to take at least five vacation days a year

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.140
and requiring a “rest” period between
the end of one day and the start of another.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.420
In 2016, a new holiday “Mountain Day” was started, bringing Japan’s number of annual public holidays to 16.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.240
And in 2017, the government launched
an initiative called Premium Fridays,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.040
in which it encouraged companies to
allow their employees to leave at 3pm

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.180
on the last Friday of the month, promoting
consumer spending and less time in the office.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.000
But one study found that less than 4% of employees in
Japan actually left early on the first Premium Friday.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.980
Which is why despite these initiatives,
a cultural challenge still looms.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.600
Since Japan’s culture emphasizes
the group over the individual, well,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.900
no one wants to be the
first one to leave the office.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.420
And there’s another reason that there’s
pressure on people to work hard.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.100
Japan’s economy is in danger.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.100
And in order to maintain its massive size,
Japan needs to put in the hours.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.100
Japan lost its spot as the world’s
second-largest economy to China in 2011,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.710
a title that it had previously
held for 42 years.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.860
Japan is dealing with
a labor crisis.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.980
Its population is aging fast and its birth rate is in
decline. That means its total population is going down.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.820
And in the next 50 years, it’s projected
to shrink by nearly a third.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.400
The population is expected to go from 127
million in 2015, to just 88 million by 2065.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.000
There’s two likely ways the nation can compensate
for the labor shortage - immigrants or robots.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.380
Japan has always been less 
inclined to accept immigrants.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.640
In fact, its percentage of foreign workers is tiny
compared to other nations of large economies.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.960
So without more immigrants, it’s
looking to robotics to fill in the gap.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.780
Its robotics industry has spanned
from hospitality to manufacturing,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.920
and now even reaching farms
by creating robots that milk cows.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.140
But whether technology
could open the door for

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.660
a better work-life balance for Japan’s
workforce still remains to be seen.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.340
