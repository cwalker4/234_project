00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.010
Hey, I'm Colin from
Blackjack Apprenticeship,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.180
and in this video I'm going
to teach you everything

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.810
you need to know about how
to play the game of blackjack

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.165
as well as how it can be beat.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:12.500
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.420
Hey, I'm Colin and I'm here
with my good friend David

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.220
a.k.a. Loudon Ofton.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.980
We're gonna teach you how to
play the game of blackjack.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.230
We have been professional
blackjack players

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.680
for roughly 15 years.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.133
We have played individually,

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.930
we've played as part of teams

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.330
responsible for beating
casinos for roughly $4 million,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.770
and we now teach others
how to beat blackjack

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.140
through Blackjack Apprenticeship.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.730
In this video, we're gonna
show you how to play blackjack

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.410
and eventually how it can be beat.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.470
Before we can talk about how
to play the game of blackjack,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.490
we first need to talk about what the goal,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.030
or the objective, of the game is,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.760
which is to, in its simplest
form, beat the dealer.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.480
Unlike poker, where you're
playing against other players,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
in blackjack it's all about
your game against the dealer.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.690
How do you beat the dealer?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.600
Basically by getting closer
to 21 than the dealer

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
without going over 21.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.330
That's why they call the game 21.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.360
How do you lose?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.920
There's a couple ways you can lose.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.410
If the dealer gets closer to
21 than you, then you lose.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.380
Or if you go over 21, you lose right away.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.150
What we have right here is a
fourth of one deck of cards.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.521
This is two through ace, and in blackjack,

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:25.521
the two through 10 are simply
gonna be their point value,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.900
so a two is gonna be worth two points,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.030
and a 10 is gonna be worth 10 points.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.160
And then a Jack, Queen and King

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.930
are also going to be worth 10 points.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.689
So 10, Jack, Queen, and
King are all 10 value cards

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.670
and then an ace is unique in
that it can be a one or an 11,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.070
whichever is going to be
the best for the hand.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.740
Ace and a two is gonna be a three or a 13,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.500
whichever is better for the hand.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.530
Let's talk about how the game is dealt.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.880
Both the player and the
dealer get two cards,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.470
but the dealer only shows one card

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560
while the other card is kept face down.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.630
At this point, the
player always goes first,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.010
and they have an option to
take more cards, or to stay.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.830
They actually have a few other decisions

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.040
we'll get to in a minute,
but they always go first

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.330
and decide if they want
more cards or to stay,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.560
with the goal of getting closer to 21

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.150
than the dealer without going over.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.360
The player has an 18 is going to stay,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.955
and the dealer has a 16,

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:28.350
and since he has to hit until he has a 17,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.540
he has no choice but to hit.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.730
Now he has a 17 and even though the dealer

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.410
has a worse hand than the player,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.360
the dealer has to stay at 17,
so the player is going to win.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.340
After the round is played,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.310
there are three outcomes for payouts.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.010
If the player wins,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.110
they get paid an equal
amount to what they just bet.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.970
If they lose, they lose their entire bet.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.803
If they push,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.295
which is to get the same
point value as the dealer,

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:57.070
then they don't win or lose,
and the next round begins.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.360
But wait, there's another
way that you can win

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.070
at blackjack automatically,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.010
and that's if you're dealt a blackjack,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.150
or what we call a natural,
so it looks like this.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.880
If you're dealt an ace and a 10 value card

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.660
as your first two cards,
we call that a blackjack.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.830
As long as a dealer doesn't
also have a blackjack,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.280
you win automatically.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.910
If you're dealt a blackjack
it gets paid right away,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.673
and like it says on this felt,
blackjacks pay three to two.

00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:25.790
David is betting 400 here,
it's going to get paid 600,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.590
which is three to two or 150 percent.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.080
Beware, because there's some
greedy casinos out there

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.520
that have started to offer
an inferior form of blackjack

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.480
where it doesn't pay three
to two, it pays six to five,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420
or even paying even money,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.390
which would be paying like a normal hand,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.000
and you don't want to
play those games ever.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.830
Because a big part of you not
having a large disadvantage

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.660
from the casino or if you learn to become

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.900
a card counter like us, and
you want to beat the game,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.020
you're gonna need a three
to two blackjack game

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.850
to even have a chance to beat them.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.923
Let's deal some example rounds
and show you how this works.

00:04:03.647 --> 00:04:07.160
(cards swishing)

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.270
In this example, the first
player is gonna stay.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.340
So is the second player,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.600
and then the third player is going to hit.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.740
Now they would stay.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.150
In this situation, the dealer has an 18,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.580
the first player has a
17, so he's gonna lose.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.440
The second player has a 19
which beats the dealer's 18,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.850
so he's going to win.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.731
The third player has an 18,

00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:29.620
which is the same as the dealer's hand,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.820
so that would be a push,
they don't win or lose.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.020
In the second example,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.230
here this first player
has a 12 against a seven.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.050
If they were to hit, they have 22.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.460
They went over 21, he's
gonna lose right away

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.050
regardless of what the
dealer ends up getting.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.500
He loses.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.400
The 19, he's gonna stay.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.293
The dealer has a 13, so
the dealer has to hit.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.010
The dealer also went over 21.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.620
This 19 is gonna win, but
again, this is really important,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.990
because the player always
plays first, they lose,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.020
if both the player and the
dealer bust, the player loses.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.100
That's a big part of how the casino

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.550
gets the advantage at blackjack.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.430
Third example, the player is
dealt, boom, the blackjack,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.890
and with the blackjack,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.960
as long as the dealer
doesn't have a blackjack,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.850
the player wins right away.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.920
Not only do they win right way,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.500
but they get paid just like this says,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.510
blackjacks pay three to two,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.010
the player is going to get
paid three chips to his two,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.965
or 150%, and that doesn't
matter if you're betting

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:36.600
five dollars or $5000, you
get paid 150% of your bet

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.050
when you get a blackjack.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.150
That's really important
because that's part of how

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.340
the player can try to regain the advantage

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.360
against the casino.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.940
The player needs that
extra 50% on blackjacks

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.520
to even have a fighting
chance against the casino.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.460
Let's talk about playing decisions.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.680
There are four main playing decisions

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.470
that you as a player can
make at the blackjack table.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.370
There's hitting, standing,
splitting, and doubling down.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.320
We're gonna break down
each one of those for you.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.570
But just so you know
there's actually a chart,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.460
and we'll put a link to it
in the description below,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.910
that will tell you the
proper playing decision

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.220
for every hand of blackjack.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.444
It's called basic strategy

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.950
and it was created by mathematicians,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.050
and it is the best way to play

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.900
every possible hand in the game.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.340
David, how long would you say it takes

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.800
to memorize basic strategy?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.470
- A couple of hours a
day for a couple weeks.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.303
- Yeah.

00:06:25.303 --> 00:06:26.136
Couple hours a day for a couple of weeks

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.260
to know how to play perfect blackjack.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.300
That's not going to give you
the advantage over the casino,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.040
you need card counting for that, but,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.441
with proper basic strategy,

00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.240
you're playing every hand properly,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.900
and it's going to cut the casino's edge

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.810
to a very small margin,
roughly half of 1%.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.620
First let's talk about hitting.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.070
Why would a player hit?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.230
- [David] To get a better hand.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.620
- Yeah, yeah, to take another card.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.050
So let's show you what that looks like.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.660
In this situation we have
an eight against a seven,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.341
so the player's gonna wanna hit.

00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:56.690
You're going to do that
by tapping or scraping

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.839
or some form of tapping the table,

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.010
and then the dealer will
give you another card.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.340
Then your next option would be standing,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.710
and that's if you don't want another card.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.680
Now you have an 18 against
the dealer's seven,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.650
you're gonna want to stand,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.070
so you're gonna just wave that hand off,

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.640
then your hand is over.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.120
Our next playing decision
would be to stand,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.580
when would you stand?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.430
- When you have a good hand
or you don't want to bust.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.040
- The third option would be doubling down,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.470
and that's only available
on your first two cards

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.310
or sometimes after you split your hand.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.530
We'll show you that in a minute.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.750
When you double down,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.370
you're going to place an equal
bet to your original bet.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.010
You can bet up to your
original bet, a little pro-tip,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.340
you would never double down

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.712
for anything less than the full amount

00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:39.170
and you would always double down

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.880
when basic strategy says to double down.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.610
Let me show you what that looks like.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.670
With doubling down,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.610
each of these hands are
actually technically

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.010
a hand you should double down,
so this first one's a nine.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.500
what you're gonna do is
put an equal bet next to it

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.240
and place one finger out.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.430
The dealer's gonna give
you one card sideways,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.860
to signify that you can't hit
that hand, that hand is over.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.559
Here's an 11, an 11 is
always going to double down

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:04.453
against a six.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.260
Then again on this last hand,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.980
it's a soft 18 so this is an eight or 18

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.793
and the correct decision
would be to double down.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.430
At that point all three
of these hands are done

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.370
and you have to just hope
that the dealer's gonna bust.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.203
Boom!

00:08:20.203 --> 00:08:25.130
Then you get paid out on all those bets.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.930
Another thing to be aware of,

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.900
as far as proper basic
strategy at blackjack,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.300
doubling down situations
are all situations

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.920
where you have an advantageous hand.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.289
While you might feel scared
to put another bet out there

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.440
to match your original bet,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.970
it is the proper way to play it,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.240
and if you don't double down
when you're supposed to,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.190
you're really just costing
yourself money over the long run.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.520
Splitting as an option
when you have two cards

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.860
that are of equal value to each other.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.410
If you have a pair of
twos or a pair of sevens

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.480
or even a pair of tens,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.760
you have the option to split those cards.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.247
Here we have a pair of
eights and to split those

00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:04.289
you're gonna put a second equal bet out

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:07.553
and split your fingers
like saying two hands.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.410
Then you're gonna get dealt.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.950
Here you have another eight,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.160
so you can actually split that again.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.160
So you're gonna do the exact same thing.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.793
Then you're gonna get dealt
into three separate hands.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.120
Here you're gonna stand on each of these.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.730
Then over here we have a pair of aces,

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.780
which is always going to split.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.430
Again, you put two fingers
out to say two hands.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.370
With a pair of aces, you only
get dealt one card to those.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.690
The dealer's gonna put them sideways

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.110
to signify that you can't
hit, and those hands are over.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.560
The dealer's gonna play out their hand.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.380
Again, if you want to know how
to play proper basic strategy

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.120
there's a link below in the
description so you can learn

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.430
the proper way to play
every hand of blackjack.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.110
- Which doesn't guarantee
you're gonna win,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.800
it just gives you the best chance.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.320
- There's one other option for the player

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.700
when the dealer has an ace up,
and that's to buy insurance.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.730
How that works is that if
you want to insure your hand

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.610
against the dealer's blackjack,
they're gonna let you,

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.400
they're gonna do this and say insurance,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.760
and let you buy insurance.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.040
To do that, you would put half of your bet

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.090
into the insurance line right here.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.813
At that point if the dealer
does have a blackjack,

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.100
you would lose your hand
because you have a 14

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.140
and they have a blackjack
but then insurance

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.830
is going to pay two to one
so that would mean basically

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.272
you're gonna break even.

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:38.220
If you're just following basic strategy,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.930
you should never buy insurance,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.500
but that's how that
playing decision works.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.370
Unless you're a card counter
don't ever buy insurance.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.210
David, do you agree?

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.580
- Well, basic strategy
says, it's not a smart play.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.020
- When you're at the casino

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.850
there's gonna be other players or dealers

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.150
that are gonna say oh,
will you shouldn't insure

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.550
if you have a good hand,
or don't insure a bad hand,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.810
that's all just casino mumbo-jumbo.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.943
It's not based on math or logic.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.375
Unless you're learning how to
count cards like David and I,

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.190
just don't ever buy insurance.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.980
There's one other playing decision

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.340
that we didn't talk about yet,
which is called surrendering.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.110
It's only offered at maybe 10% of casinos,

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.130
but if the casino does offer it,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.329
it actually is valuable
to the player if you know

00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:24.640
how to play it properly.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.880
If you're at a casino
that offers surrender,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.320
if it's a hand that you want to surrender,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.160
what you're gonna do is slide
your finger across the table,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.920
make a line, and you'll
probably wanna say, surrender,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.610
just so the casino knows

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.950
that that's clearly what you want to do,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.160
and how it works is, you
forfeit your hand right away

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.220
and only lose half your bet.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.620
You would lose five of the
10 dollars right there,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.563
before the hand is ever played out.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.713
The hand is over.

00:11:49.713 --> 00:11:52.390
Mathematically if it's
a hand where the casino

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.380
has a better than 50% advantage over you,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.290
you would just surrender half your bet

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.550
and move on to the next round.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.310
At this point you might be
thinking, this sounds great,

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.560
all I have to do is follow basic strategy

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.450
and beat the dealer.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.180
Is it that simple David?

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.320
- You do have to use
your brain a little bit.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.510
- What if I just am a
lucky blackjack player.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.524
- That's great

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:17.230
but that's not going to
guarantee profits over time.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.063
- That's right.

00:12:18.063 --> 00:12:21.180
Casinos are no dummies,
they've designed the game

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.340
in a way where they have the
advantage over the player.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.840
There are really two reasons for that.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.500
The first reason is that very few players

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.450
actually follow basic strategy.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.360
How often do you find a
perfect basic strategy player

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.940
at the blackjack tables?

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.540
- Less than 5% of the time.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.373
- Yeah.

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:38.206
It's really rare.

00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:41.690
Even though basic strategy
won't give you a winning game,

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.290
it cuts the casino's advantage
to about half a percent.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.650
Whereas the average gambler
at a blackjack table

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.240
is probably playing with
about a 2% disadvantage

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.970
which is really about the
same or not much better

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.280
than the slot machines.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.830
You want to just play slot machines?

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.663
- [David] No.

00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:59.260
- The second reason why people
don't have the advantage

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.140
is because how the game is designed.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.290
I showed you before,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.980
if both the player and the
dealer bust, who loses?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.460
- If the player busts before
the dealer, the player loses.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.293
- That's right.

00:13:09.293 --> 00:13:12.270
Since a player always goes
first, even if they both bust,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.257
the player loses.

00:13:14.257 --> 00:13:17.060
Even though blackjacks help the player,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.760
double downs help the player,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.560
those aren't enough to gain
the advantage over the casino.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.718
You need something more,
which is card counting.

00:13:24.718 --> 00:13:26.310
In the short run,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.530
anyone can get lucky on
a given day or night.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.170
But over time the odds
are going to work out

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.140
and even if you're playing
perfect basic strategy,

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.720
the casino's gonna end up with your money

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.890
over the long haul.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.660
You can gain the advantage
but it takes more.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.500
What's the first step

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.220
to getting the advantage over the casino?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.800
- Basic strategy, getting that perfect.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.530
- Perfect basic strategy
and the second step is?

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.460
- Counting cards.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.293
- That's right.

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:51.126
That's illegal, right?

00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:53.230
- No, it's using your brain.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.410
- [Colin] I thought using your
brain was illegal in casinos.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.920
- No, it's legal to use your brain,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.840
the casinos have invited
you to play a game,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.850
use your brain, beat it.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.180
- This is what David and
I have done for 15 years.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.670
We have played as
professional card counters.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.190
We between the two of us
have won over $1.5 million.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.770
We've been a part of teams.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.430
One of the more notorious ones
was called the church team.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.260
Which beat casinos for
$3.2 million legally

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.310
through card counting.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.370
What card counting does
is tells you how to bet

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.350
and when to change your playing decisions

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.050
in a way that gives you
the advantage over casinos.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.220
I'm going to be honest with you though,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.480
casinos don't like people
that can beat them,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.710
so they have a right to refuse
service to whoever they want.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.590
If you want to learn how to beat casinos,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.110
that's what we're all about.
