00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.235
Ms. Sanders:  Good afternoon.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.206
The first state visit
for the Trump administration

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.741
was a tremendous success,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.576
and the First Lady,
in particular,

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:10.944
deserves a lot of the credit.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.413
Her attention to every detail
and full engagement

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.181
in the planning
helped highlight

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.083
and showcase
the special relationship

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.985
between the United
States and France,

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.754
our oldest ally.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.288
President Trump
and President Macron

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:25.558
also had a number of important
conversations on critical issues

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.995
facing each nation
at home and abroad.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.264
As the President said yesterday,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.433
the future between
the United States and France

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.435
has never looked brighter.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.605
Tomorrow, the administration
will be participating

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.173
in the 25th anniversary

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.375
of Take Our Daughters
and Sons to Work Day.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.345
The President looks forward to
welcoming many of your children

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.714
and the children of those who
work here at the White House.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.786
As a reminder, this Saturday
is National Prescription

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.154
Take Back Day.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.223
Across the country, many
businesses, medical offices,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.925
state, local,
and tribal governments,

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.694
and first responders
will host drop-off events

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.865
where Americans can safely
dispose of unused medication.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:13.206
Disposing of unused pills
can prevent the misuse

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.341
of commonly prescribed opioids.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.911
During the last National
Take Back Day in October,

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.313
Americans disposed
of a record-breaking

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.149
900,000 pounds
of prescription pills.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.351
The Trump administration
encourages

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.686
everyone to take part.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.355
We can all be part
of the solution.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.658
For more details on that,
I encourage you to visit

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:36.496
TakeBackDay.dea.gov to find
your local collection site

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.531
and learn more about
how to safely dispose

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.200
of prescription medication.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.402
And with that,
I'll take your questions.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.670
John.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.538
The Press: I asked the President
yesterday about the allegations

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.975
that Dr. Ronny Jackson
is facing.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.278
There are more allegations
that have been leveled at him

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.180
in the last 24 hours,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.416
one of which might involve
a HIPAA violation,

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.985
or an alleged HIPAA violation.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.922
Do you have anything more on
the allegations against Jackson?

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.291
Is the White House
saying anything about it?

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.660
Ms. Sanders: Yeah,
Dr. Jackson's record

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.330
as a White House physician
has been impeccable.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.865
In fact, because Dr. Jackson

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.434
has worked within arm's
reach of three Presidents,

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:17.337
he has received more
vetting than most nominees.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.206
Given his unique position
of trust and responsibility,

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.675
Dr. Jackson's background
and character

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:26.045
were evaluated during three
different administrations.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.414
Dr. Jackson has had
at least four independent

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.084
background investigations
conducted during his time

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.821
at the White House, including
an FBI investigation conducted

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.891
as part of the standard
nomination vetting process.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.826
During each of
those investigations,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.663
Dr. Jackson received unanimous
praise from dozens of witnesses,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.966
and the investigations
revealed no areas of concern.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.637
Dr. Jackson has received glowing
evaluations from his superiors,

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.306
including several
from President Obama,

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.742
which said -- such as,
Dr. Jackson should

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.844
 continue to promote
ahead of his peers 

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.613
and  already at a level of
performance and responsibility

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.081
that exceeds his current rank. 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.317
The Press: But what about
some of these allegations

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.852
about overprescribing?

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.087
The other one that I just
mentioned a moment ago.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.324
Ms. Sanders:  I think that makes
it pretty clear, in terms of --

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.993
a very thorough investigation

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.162
and vetting process
has taken place.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.263
None of those things
had come up.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.232
We're continuing to look
at anything beyond that.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.233
Darlene.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.568
The Press: Despite what you
just said there,

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.603
is the White House
doing any sort of additional

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.438
looking into Dr.
Jackson's background

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.273
in light of all
of the allegations?

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.075
Ms. Sanders: There's been,
again, a pretty thorough

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.045
vetting process done by the FBI,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:37.116
as well as three other
independent investigations.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:40.086
But that's part of what
the nomination process

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.354
of Congress should do

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.056
and what it's supposed
to look like,

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.991
and why they should move
forward with a hearing.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.659
The Press: And since you are --
since the White House

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.628
and the President
are standing behind him,

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.597
will he ask the Senate
Veterans Committee

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.398
to reschedule his
confirmation hearing?

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.635
Ms. Sanders: We're continuing
to work with members

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.703
on the Hill.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.837
Major.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.138
The Press: Sarah, I've got one
on this and a couple

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.006
on foreign policy.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.174
Ms. Sanders: A couple?

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.475
The Press: So, is it the
position of the administration

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.877
that the people who have raised
these allegations are lying?

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.714
Ms. Sanders: That's not what
I said. I said we've done --

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.250
multiple background checks
have taken place,

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.386
and we're continuing
to look at the situation.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.754
The Press: Do you not
find them credible,

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.689
in other words,
these allegations?

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.792
Ms. Sanders: Again, these are
new, I can only speak to --

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:20.893
The Press: And do you think
there's anything that suggests

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.228
political motivation
behind them?

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.464
Ms. Sanders:  I can only speak
to some of the personal accounts

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.165
that those of us have,

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.667
as well as the records

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.670
that we have that
are substantiated through

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.038
a very detailed

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:35.174
and thorough background
investigation process.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.042
The Press: So, on North Korea.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.210
During the State
of the Union address,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.312
the President described
the North Korean regime

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:43.750
as one that shamefully tried
an American, Otto Warmbier;

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.319
sent him back
to the country nearly dead;

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.787
starves its own people;

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.923
and is a dictatorship worse
than almost any other.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.125
That's what he said
in the State of Union.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:56.562
How could that also be true
if Kim Jong-un

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.131
is  honorable  and  open ?

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:02.235
How do you reconcile those two
assessments of the leader

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.603
and the regime
in North Korea?

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.406
Ms. Sanders:  The President is
referencing the conversations

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.476
that we've had ongoing
over the last month

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:14.280
or so in regards
to the meeting to take place

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.315
and their willingness
to denuclearize

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.584
on the Peninsula,
and that's --

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.653
The Press: So, he's changed
his appraisal of Kim Jong-un?

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.789
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly
not that,

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.192
but he wants to have
the ability to sit down

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.593
and have these conversations.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.263
And in that process,
they have been open

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.098
with their willingness
to denuclearize,

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.533
and that's certainly
been the focus

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:36.669
and what we have been pushing
for and expect to happen.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.104
The Press: He thinks
the regime has changed?

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.539
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry?

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.907
The Press: He thinks
the regime has changed?

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.642
Ms. Sanders: We think that
the maximum pressure campaign

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:43.810
is working.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.812
But again, we're not going
to let up on that campaign

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:49.182
until we see some of the words

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.384
that they've made go
into concrete action.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.885
But they're moving
in the right direction.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:54.721
John.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.723
The Press: Thanks a lot, Sarah,
I wanted to get your reaction

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.324
to the ruling that came down

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.259
from a federal district
court judge here

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.662
in Washington
concerning DACA.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.866
He said that the President's
decision to end DACA

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.568
was arbitrary and capricious.

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.536
So, what's your reaction
to this ruling?

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:14.040
The third federal judge to rule
against the President on DACA.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:17.443
Ms. Sanders:  The DACA program
violates federal law.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.612
President Obama
went around Congress

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.548
and created the illegal
DACA program.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.850
We believe the judge's ruling

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.251
is extraordinarily broad

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.586
and wrong on the law.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.387
What's worse is that
it creates an incentive

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.957
for more illegal immigrant
youth to come here

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:33.760
and causes them to expect
similar judicial policies

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.027
be applied to them.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:37.597
This ruling is good news
for smuggling organizations

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.965
and criminal networks,

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.867
and horrible news
for our national security.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.702
It's time for Congress
to do what the President

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.170
has called on them to do

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.706
and offer to be part of
and actually fix this problem.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:50.143
The Press: Is it still the main
argument by the administration

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.312
that the reason
why it was necessary

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.348
to cut off the DACA program

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.850
was because of
the threat of lawsuits

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.752
by Republican attorneys general?

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:04.590
Ms. Sanders:  That was certainly
a big part of us

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.493
knowing that this is
an illegal program

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:10.630
and something that
Congress has the ability

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.331
to actually create laws.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.400
And they're the ones that have
to be part of this process

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.668
and fix this problem.

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:16.836
Steve.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.572
The Press: Yes, Sarah, I'd like
to ask you about the drop

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:22.008
in the ranking
for the United States

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.710
in the World Press
Freedom Index.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.146
The United States
now down to 45.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.483
And according to Reporters
Without Borders,

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:34.554
much of the blame for that
goes to the President

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.455
for his attacks on the media.

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.124
What's the reaction
of the White House?

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:41.027
And does it accept that
the President's comments

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:44.664
has denigrated our freedom of
the press in the United States?

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.567
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly,
would not --

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:48.968
would reject the idea

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.637
that the President
or this administration

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.073
has halted freedom of the press.

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:57.343
I think we're one of the most
accessible administrations

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.145
that we've seen in decades.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:02.348
I think by mere presence
of standing up here

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.884
and taking your questions,
un-vetted,

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.753
is a pretty good example
of freedom of the press,

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.323
and I think it's ridiculous
to suggest otherwise.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.457
John.

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.292
The Press: Thank you, Sarah,
two questions.

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:17.196
One on President Macron's visit
and the other on foreign policy.

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.833
Yesterday, there was
some scuttlebutt late

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.501
in the afternoon

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:27.406
that no Democrats were invited
to the dinner last night.

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.176
And then later,
a check of the list showed

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.945
that there were at least
four Democrats invited.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.847
However, the accurate report

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:38.985
was there were no congressional
Democrats invited.

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:43.189
Now, going back to state dinners
to when President Roosevelt

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.626
hosted the King and Queen
of England in 1939,

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:49.095
and invited potential opponents,

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.365
there have always been
congressional Democrats

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.699
at state dinners.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.334
Why the exception last night?

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.069
Ms. Sanders: Again, as you said,

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:00.306
there were Democrats
present at the dinner,

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:05.544
and the focus of this dinner was
to keep it intimate and small,

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:06.846
and that's exactly what we did.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:10.683
There was a wide range of
individuals that participated,

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.518
and we think it was
a great success

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:16.789
and very proud of not just
the dinner but the entire visit,

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.557
and certainly the relationship

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.793
that we have with
our great ally in France.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.130
The Press: But no
congressional Democrats.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.300
Was there any discussion of that
in preparing the list?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.068
Ms. Sanders:  Look, we talk with
congressional Democrats

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.202
all the time.

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:31.270
We don't have to have
dinner with them

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.605
to have conversations with them.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:36.409
We'll continue to talk with them
about policy-related issues.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.344
And again, I think that the fact

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.779
that there were
a number of Democrats

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:42.648
that were present
kind of negates the fact
243
00:09:42,648
that it wasn't
a bipartisan dinner.
 --&gt; 00:09:45,217
Charlie.

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.218
The Press: My other question --

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:47.453
Ms. Sanders:  Oh, sorry --
your second question.

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.522
The Press: -- was about
the proclamation the President

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.857
signed regarding
Armenia and Turkey.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:56.729
He used the word,
 Meds Yeghern, 

00:09:56.729 --> 00:10:01.167
which is Armenian for
"catastrophe" or "atrocity,"

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:05.204
but he never used the word
 genocide  in this resolution.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:09.608
Does the President believe
in Armenian genocide?

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:12.144
Ms. Sanders: I haven't had
a detailed conversation with him

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.179
about that,

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.648
but I understand that
the resolution the President

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:19.485
signed was consistent with
past administrations as well.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.419
Charlie.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.855
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.
Rap superstar Kanye West

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.291
has been in the news lately
for supporting the President

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.693
and expressing his admiration
for the President.

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.628
Ms. Sanders:  Covering
all range of topics today.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.230
(Laughter.)

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.965
The Press: I'm curious whether
the President has reached out

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.000
to Kanye West

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.968
and whether he'd be willing
to meet with him

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.303
at the White House.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.038
Ms. Sanders: I don't know
of any conversation

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:42.742
that they've had over
the last week or so.

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:45.678
I'll keep you posted
if that changes at any time.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.579
Matthew.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.080
The Press: Two weeks ago?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.282
Ms. Sanders:  Sorry, I know
they met during the transition.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.550
That's the only meeting
I'm aware

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.319
of that's taken place
for a conversation.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:57.023
Before everybody has
a meltdown and thinks

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.958
that we had a meeting last week.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.995
The Press: In today's Supreme
Court arguments about the travel

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:06.065
ban there was much discussion
of the President's proposal

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.434
during the campaign
that all Muslims

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:10.436
be barred from entering the U.S.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.806
And it was noted during those
arguments that the President

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.775
has never actually
disavowed that proposal.

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.744
And it was also noted that
he had not made those comments

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.346
since being sworn
in as President.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.416
So, I wanted to ask,
does the White House disavow

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.818
that campaign proposal,

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.386
or does it stand by it?

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:29.121
Ms. Sanders: The
administration's top priority

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.391
is to ensure the safety and
security of the American people.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.793
For that reason,

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.461
the administration
has put in place enhanced

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.197
global security measures
to improve screening

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.465
and vetting capabilities

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.567
and share information.
It's working.

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.369
There's been
significant improvements

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.304
in identity management
and information

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.972
sharing with
foreign governments.

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:48.941
Because of this,
our international partners

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:51.444
have raised their own
baseline requirements.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.080
Without the ability to impose
entry restrictions,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.915
the United States may be forced

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:58.384
to unsuspectingly
allow dangerous criminals

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.286
or terrorists into the country.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.821
Additionally, without
the restrictions,

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.355
foreign governments
have little incentive

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:05.424
to improve their
information-sharing

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:07.426
and identity-management
practices.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:11.397
The focus of this travel ban
has been on safety and security,

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:14.533
is limited to a small
number of countries,

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.837
and a lot of
Muslim-majority countries

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.839
have the same abilities

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.740
to travel to and
from the United States

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.809
as they did in previous
administrations.

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:27.213
I think that alone, in action,
answers your question clearly.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:28.948
Jim.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:31.350
The Press: I just wanted to
follow up on Dr. Ronny Jackson.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.953
Yesterday, the President
suggested that Dr. Jackson

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:35.221
does not have the experience

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:37.556
to run the Department
of Veterans Affairs.

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:40.192
Is that a fair assessment,
that he lacks that experience?

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:42.027
Ms. Sanders: That's not what
the President said.

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:44.663
I think you're taking some
of his words out of context.

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.565
And based on your tweet today --

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:47.766
The Press: He said experience
is an issue.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:48.868
Ms. Sanders: -- I know
you don't appreciate

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.402
when people take your
words out of context.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.338
So, I'd appreciate if you not
do that to the President.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.540
If he didn't think
he had the experience,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.474
he wouldn't have nominated.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.042
He said that that had been
one of the questions

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:59.345
that people had posed about him.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.513
Obviously,
the President thought --

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.081
The Press: So, he thinks Dr.
Jackson has all the experience

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.582
necessary to run the department?

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:06.318
Ms. Sanders:  Look, I think
he has an incredibly strong --

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.386
The Press: It's a yes
or no question.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.855
Ms. Sanders: -- background.
He's a highly qualified,

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:11.524
highly skilled individual.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:14.226
And if he didn't think he was
capable of doing the job,

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:17.363
he wouldn't have announced his
nomination in the first place.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.898
The Press: Let me just
follow up, if I can.

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:21.634
Just since you brought up
being taken out of context,

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.769
if seems to be
a press-related question.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:26.205
Are you trying to say
that this administration

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:28.207
is a champion of a free press?

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.842
That seems --

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:32.745
Ms. Sanders:  I certainly think
that, as I stated a moment ago,

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.980
we support a free press

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.749
but we also support
a fair press.

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:40.319
And I think that those things
should go hand in hand,

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.988
and there's a certain
responsibility by the press

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.758
to report accurate information.
I think a number of people --

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:46.659
The Press: Isn't there
a certain responsibility

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.826
on the part of the President --

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:49.495
Ms. Sanders:  I think a number
of people in this room

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.729
do that every single day.

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.631
They do their very best
to provide fair

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:53.999
and accurate information.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.935
I certainly support that,
and that's one of the reasons

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.803
I'm standing here
taking your questions --

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.205
The Press: We appreciate that.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.073
Ms. Sanders:  -- and a lot
of times taking your questions

00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:04.009
in a tone that's completely
unnecessary, unneeded,

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.512
and, frankly, doesn't help
further the conversation

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.680
or help the American people

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.049
get any more information
in a better way,

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:11.584
which is your job and my job.

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:12.585
And that's what
I'm trying to do.

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:13.752
The Press: I fully appreciate
that. But, Sarah --

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:14.954
Ms. Sanders: I'm going
to move on. David, go ahead.

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.622
The Press: But the President's
tone towards the press --

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:18.290
Ms. Sanders: Jim,
I'm finished here.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.825
The Press: The President's tone
towards the press is obviously

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:20.926
not helpful at times --

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.094
Ms. Sanders: Thank you, Jim.

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:23.729
The Press: -- and I think
that that's plain to see.

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:24.897
Ms. Sanders:  David.

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:26.432
The Press: A Navy inspector
general had problems

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.733
with the way Jackson
ran his medical office,

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.301
which only has 50 people in it.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:31.036
What makes him qualified
to run a big department

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.871
that has 350,000 people?

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:35.708
Ms. Sanders:  Look, I saw
a number of members

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:40.779
of both the House and Senate
do interviews today,

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.815
just earlier this morning,
in which they said,

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:44.617
look, we've tried this
a number of other ways

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.453
with people who have run
massive organizations,

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:48.854
and it hasn't worked
out very well.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.123
This is a different approach,

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:53.158
but it certainly doesn't mean
it's a wrong approach

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.893
or that he's not qualified.

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:57.863
This is somebody who's been
on the battlefields,

00:14:57.863 --> 00:15:01.033
made decisions at
a very high-stress level,

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.835
and saved a number
of individuals'

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.471
lives in some of the most
trying circumstances.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:08.674
Somebody that understands the
relationship between veterans,

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.642
and the needs and the care

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:11.377
that they have
as a veteran himself --

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.245
or as a service member himself,

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.080
and somebody who has
a relationship

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.482
and a deep-rooted care

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:19.151
and concern for those
individuals that may be far

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:22.221
and above what we've seen
from previous administrators

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.922
that have overseen that agency.

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:25.524
He's a highly
qualified individual,

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:27.192
and we're going to
continue looking at this

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.394
and continue
moving forward.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.763
Julie.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.464
The Press: Are you telling us
that the White House

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:34.099
was not aware of
any of the allegations

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.669
before the President
decided to name Dr. Jackson?

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:38.037
Just, first of all, to clarify.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.638
Ms. Sanders: I'm telling you
that none of those things

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:43.175
have come up in the four
separate background

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:45.110
investigations
that have taken place.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.613
There's been no area of concern

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.649
that was raised
for Dr. Jackson specifically.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.284
The Press: Can you describe
to us, then,

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.153
what the vetting process
was at the White House

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:55.454
before he was named,

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.156
given that, as David
just mentioned,

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:58.490
there is an inspector
general report

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.526
and there have been
allegations in the past

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:01.527
that are now coming to light,

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:03.962
but they existed before
the President chose him?

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:06.532
Ms. Sanders:  Again, Dr. Jackson
has undergone

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:10.336
four separate background checks.

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.471
One that was
conducted by the FBI,

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.240
and all those revealed
nothing and came back

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.811
with a clean recommendation.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.379
The Press: So, the only vetting
that was done of him

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.613
as a nominee was to look

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:23.882
at his past background checks,
is what you're telling us?

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.117
Ms. Sanders: No -- I mean,
there's a number of things.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:27.052
But you also have to remember
this is somebody

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.588
that spends more time
with the President

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:30.956
than just about anyone.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.426
These investigations
are very thorough

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:37.996
and certainly something that
was taken into consideration.

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:38.964
Blake.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.099
The Press: Sarah, thank you.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.266
Let me ask you
a couple questions

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.434
about the Tim Cook meeting

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:44.236
that is either wrapped
or going on right now.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:45.437
Do you, by chance,
have a readout

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.973
of what exactly took place?
Did the President promise to --

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.575
Ms. Sanders:  The meeting
was still ongoing

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.809
when the briefing started.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:54.380
I know that the primary focus
and purpose of the meeting

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.914
is to discuss trade.

00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:58.250
It's something that's been
on the President's schedule

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.385
for the last couple of weeks.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:01.286
If we have any additional
information, we'll let you know.

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.155
The Press: Let me ask you.
In the last month now,

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.457
the President has met
with Bill Gates,

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:08.160
who is the second-wealthiest
individual in the world.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.361
Now he's meeting with Tim Cook,

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:13.665
who runs the largest company
in the United States.

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:16.769
Does the President have
any intentions, at any point,

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:19.304
to meet with the wealthiest
individual in the world,

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.539
Jeff Bezos?

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:24.176
And if so, under what
conditions would that be?

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.245
Ms. Sanders: I'm not aware
of that being on the schedule.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:29.715
I certainly haven't seen it
on any of the look-aheads.

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.651
I think the President
would be open to it,

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:35.120
but I'm not aware of anything
being locked in at this point.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.355
Ashley.

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:39.124
The Press: Sarah, Scott Pruitt
lived for below-market rent

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.426
in a Capitol Hill row house

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.694
owned by an energy
industry lobbyist.

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.998
He reportedly directed staff
to give raises to top aides,

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.833
and then obfuscated about it.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:51.370
He spent over $150,000
of taxpayer dollars

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.439
on first-class travel.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.073
And he reportedly
once even tried

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:57.910
to get his security detail
to use their sirens,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.913
so he could get to
a reservation at Le Diplomate,

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.816
among other alleged
ethical lapses.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.984
I know you've said yesterday
you were looking at reports

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.586
about him,
but can you sort of explain

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.488
why he still has a job

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:10.789
in the President's Cabinet,

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:15.194
and also how his behavior
is in keeping with the values

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:16.495
of draining the swamp?

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.198
Ms. Sanders: Again,
we're evaluating these concerns,

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.300
and we expect
the EPA Administrator

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.201
to answer for them,

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.635
and we'll keep you posted.

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:24.770
Ayesha.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.338
The Press: Thanks.
Just to follow up on that --

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:29.575
when you say you expect
Administrator Pruitt

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:32.344
to answer for these accusations,

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.246
where do you expect
that to happen?

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:36.615
Like, are you looking
for this in hearings?

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.650
Is the White House
asking questions?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.285
Ms. Sanders: We're having
ongoing conversations.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:44.389
The Press: And also, just to
follow up on Jackson.

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:48.927
When you say that he's been
through four background checks,

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.997
can you say -- but these
allegations have now come up,

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:53.665
and some of them
are very serious --

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:56.335
is the White House going to
look into the allegations

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.003
that have been made against him

00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:00.072
about drinking on the job
and (inaudible)?

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.340
Ms. Sanders: Certainly,
something that we

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.841
would look at, absolutely.

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.543
I'll take one last question.

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.711
Francesca.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:07.779
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.
I wanted to clarify, too,

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.548
about these four
background checks.

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.483
Were any of these
background checks

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.352
since President Trump
took office

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:17.523
or since he was named
as the nominee for VA Secretary?

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:18.757
And has the White House

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:21.493
ever been informed
of allegations

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.829
like these -- like excessively
drinking on the job

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:27.232
or passing out medication
like candy, as it were --

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:30.702
since he was the physician
for President Trump?

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:32.671
Ms. Sanders: I'm not aware
of any of those allegations

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.807
being made until
the nomination was made.

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:38.377
The Press: And to follow up
on what I was asking

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.145
about the background check.

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.814
When was his most recent
background check?

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.750
Ms. Sanders: I'd have to look
at the specific date,

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.119
but my understanding
is that a new one took place

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.154
at the time of
the new administration.

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.689
Thanks, so much, guys,
see you tomorrow.
