00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.423
My name is Kyle,
I'm the red paperclip guy.

00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:15.473
But before I get started on that story,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.804
I want to draw attention
to this slide behind me.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.715
On the beginning
of every TED video out there,

00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:24.532
the whatever it's called,
the screenshot that precedes the video,

00:00:24.537 --> 00:00:26.505
[where] everyone's standing like this ...

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:28.098
all of them.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.815
So, demand more from TED,
post comments online poking fun at this,

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.245
we need better screenshots
for these videos.

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:38.265
We can make a better world of TED
with better screenshots.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.699
Onto the paperclip though.

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:43.120
This is this kind of crazy idea
I had when I was -

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:45.904
Y'know, about 10 years ago,
I was looking down at my desk,

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.821
and I saw a red paperclip sitting there.

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:51.309
And I said, "Y'know what, I remember
this game called 'Bigger and Better'

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:54.575
where you start with something small,
trade it for something bigger,

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:55.765
and then you repeat.

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.536
I wonder what would happen if I took
this red paperclip and tried to trade it?"

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.069
I posted a picture of that red paperclip
on a website called "craigslist."

00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:05.602
Two girls named Ronnie and Karina
responded and said,

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:06.800
"Hey, that's pretty cool!

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.762
We'd like to trade with you.
We got a pen shaped like a fish."

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.180
(Laughter)

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:13.186
I was really excited, this was a cool pen.

00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:15.428
This was bigger and better
than a red paperclip.

00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:17.246
"How far can I go with this idea?

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:20.106
Anybody want a pen shaped like a fish?"

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.615
"Absolutely, my name is Annie,

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:23.973
and I've got a doorknob
with a crazy face on it."

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:24.984
(Laughter)

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:27.957
Two trades in, I've already
gone way up from a paperclip,

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:29.140
and I was thinking,

00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:30.480
"How far can I go with this?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.147
Maybe I can keep going until one day
I owned a house or something from this."

00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:35.814
Shawn says, "Come down to my place,

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:37.431
I'll cook your burgers,

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.008
and I'll trade you my camping stove
for that doorknob,

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.749
because I need it to fix the knob
on my stovetop espresso maker.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.029
(Laughter)

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.800
We're moving liabilities into assets;
we're creating value.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.108
We're improving each other's lives,
albeit on a small scale.

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:57.148
But the Sergeant, David J,
of the US Marine Corps, he said,

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:59.870
"I've been looking for
that exact model of camping stove.

00:01:59.878 --> 00:02:03.149
I've got extra generators,
would you like an electric generator?"

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.819
To me this was a dream come true:
an electric generator.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.901
Finally, my teenage dreams of being able
to create power were realizing.

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:11.267
(Laughter)

00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:15.350
Unfortunately, most people on the internet
didn't suffer from a blackout,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.451
they didn't need power.

00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:19.225
So, my trading in
for bigger and better things

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:20.464
that I thought had value

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:21.778
turned into a liability.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.273
It took me several weeks
to be able to trade this.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.806
But I actually found another person
just recently out of his teenage years

00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:30.151
who did want to create power
with this generator.

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:32.497
His name was Martin,
and he was in New York City.

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.671
He says, "Look, I've got
an empty beer keg,

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:37.346
I'll trade you an IOU
to fill the keg with beer

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.314
and a neon with "Budweiser" sign.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:40.867
What do you say?"

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:41.911
So I met up with him.

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:45.196
We made the trade, and here's us
showing all parts of the trade work.

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:50.106
(Laughter)

00:02:56.051 --> 00:03:01.608
I rebranded the mishmash
of IOU beer keg and neon "Budweiser" sign,

00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:03.669
and called it an instant party.

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:05.553
Does anybody out there want to party?

00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:06.843
"My name is Michel Brett,

00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:10.079
I'm a famous radio and TV personality
in the province of Quebec,

00:03:10.084 --> 00:03:11.862
and I want to make a trade with you."

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:14.102
"Absolutely Michel,
what do you have to trade?"

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:15.870
"I'll trade you my worst snowmobile."

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.014
I was intrigued just by the idea
of somebody's worst snowmobile.

00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:21.892
It implied that he not only
had more than one snowmobile,

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:24.393
but he was kind of cheeky
and willing to prove to me

00:03:24.393 --> 00:03:27.623
that, you know, I've got better ones,
but I'll trade you my worst.

00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:29.422
I was really happy to trade with him.

00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:32.098
He was a great guy,
and it was a pretty nice snowmobile.

00:03:32.102 --> 00:03:34.581
Seeing how it was
the middle of winter in Canada,

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.601
and it was very cold,

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:39.651
and a snowmobile at that time of year
had more value than in the summer,

00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:42.787
a snowmobile magazine
called "SnoRiders West"

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:43.839
called me up and said,

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.634
"Hey, we would like to offer you
two trips for two to the Canadian Rockies

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.182
in exchange for that snowmobile.

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.481
It'll probably give our magazine
some publicity,

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:54.533
and who doesn't want to go
to the Rockies at this time of year?"

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.607
I said, "Yes, alright, what's the catch?"

00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:59.135
They said, "The catch is
you can come to the Rockies;

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:01.895
you can't come to the town of Yahk
in British Columbia."

00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:04.605
I said, "Alright, I got to find
a loophole around this."

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:08.004
So we decided to kind of blackmail
a national news organization.

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:10.956
It's a really long story,
but what ended up happening was

00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:14.268
I got on TV wearing the logo
for the shirt I was wearing.

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:17.272
It was called Cintas, the uniform company.

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:18.942
It was just sort of an inside joke:

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:21.184
my cousin's husband
had given me this shirt ...

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:23.478
an even longer story
to explain the whole thing.

00:04:23.482 --> 00:04:26.293
However, the head honcho of that company

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.893
saw me on TV
with his corporate uniform on,

00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:32.108
and said, "Wait a second,
this is a huge liability to me,

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.548
but it's also an opportunity."

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:34.692
And we met up one night.

00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:37.360
He says, "I'd like to make
you a trade. What d'you say?"

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.502
And I'm like: "I think that's
the perfect way we can work together

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.374
without selling our souls
to the corporate ownership devil."

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:44.919
He said, "Great, let's meet up."

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.083
So we met up.

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:48.839
He offered this van
for the trip for two to the Rockies,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.562
I drove the van to the Rockies;
he flew because the trip included that.

00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:55.572
And I wound up
with this giant, huge machine,

00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:57.329
much bigger than a paperclip,

00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:59.418
arguably better, worst fuel mileage,

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:02.894
but to transport a lot better
things than just that.

00:05:02.898 --> 00:05:05.333
So, I said, "Does anybody
out there want to trade?"

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:08.384
And I realized bigger and better
was just really getting bigger,

00:05:08.384 --> 00:05:11.195
but how could it get better,
what was the opportunity here?

00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.824
And I realized that I've been offered
a recording contract,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.390
a piece of paper, a promise,

00:05:16.396 --> 00:05:18.644
an opportunity to someone
who is good at music.

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:20.795
"Does anybody want
to be a recording artist?"

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:23.655
So I traded the van for the recording
contract with Brandon.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.820
He used it to drive around in his band,

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:29.468
which was currently traveling around
in a 1988 Volkswagen Jetta.

00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:31.570
Moving up to the van
really helped him out.

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:33.021
I took the recording contract.

00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:35.182
"Does anybody want
to be a recording artist?"

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.384
It turns out pretty much
everyone in the world

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:38.630
wants to record music.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.650
(Laughter)

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.824
I was offered my soul from a soul singer,

00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:44.185
a pinkie finger.

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:47.396
Someone actually offered me
their virginity, which is -

00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:49.345
(Laughter)

00:05:49.718 --> 00:05:52.352
I don't know what the legalities, or -

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.850
Needless to say, I said no,

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.272
because Jody said to me,

00:05:57.012 --> 00:05:59.916
"Look, I've got a half a duplex
in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:00.968
Half of it's unrented.

00:06:00.968 --> 00:06:03.528
I'll trade a year free rent
in my duplex for that.

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:04.592
What do you say?"

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:05.644
I said yes.

00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:09.090
I went down there. We made the trade
in front of the white picket fence.

00:06:09.094 --> 00:06:10.113
Very Americana.

00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:11.403
Now I had a year free rent.

00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:13.694
Her next door -
one of her tenants actually -

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.228
Her next-door neighbor, Lesley,
found out about this.

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:17.851
She says, "I want that free rent."

00:06:17.853 --> 00:06:21.166
She offered me up
an afternoon with her boss.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.994
At first I was like this sort of sucks,
like oo-er-hoo ...

00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:25.032
(Laughter)

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.919
because I didn't know who her boss was.

00:06:27.197 --> 00:06:28.963
She stood up - "I'll bring him out."

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:29.966
I'm, "This is weird."

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.523
She brings out her boss's head.

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:33.712
Her boss was Alice Cooper

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:36.661
because she worked
at Alice Cooper's town in Phoenix

00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:39.055
as the manager of the restaurant.

00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:41.381
I was like, "An afternoon
with Alice Cooper,

00:06:41.384 --> 00:06:44.274
that's pretty amazing,
what's it's going to be worth?"

00:06:44.274 --> 00:06:46.144
His tour manager called me up and says,

00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:47.961
"We're on tour in Fargo, North Dakota.

00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:51.435
Come up, experience an afternoon
with Alice Cooper, see what it's like."

00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:54.874
And then after our afternoon
this happened live on stage.

00:06:56.224 --> 00:06:58.754
(Video starts) (Cheering)

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:01.364
(Applause)

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:07.465
(Video ends)

00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:11.055
Alice is a really nice guy -
this picture displays how nice he is.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.295
(Laughter)

00:07:12.535 --> 00:07:14.305
"Look, it's great you're doing this.

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:17.361
You'll find an Italian billionaire
who's a big Alice Cooper fan.

00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.796
He'll probably have several mansions.
He'd easily trade you one of them.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:21.893
Promise me one thing?"

00:07:21.898 --> 00:07:22.940
"What's that?"

00:07:22.946 --> 00:07:25.187
Promise you won't trade
an afternoon with me

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:29.006
for a weekend with the Rolling Stones
or a night with KISS.

00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:30.166
(Laughter)

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.556
I said, "Alright, I'll try."

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.476
The phone rang, and it was Mark.

00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:36.878
Mark says, "I'm an amateur photographer
with a lot of KISS memorabilia.

00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:38.711
Are you be interested in any of that?"

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:41.207
This is hard. I really wanted
to trade with him.

00:07:41.207 --> 00:07:42.311
"What do you have?"

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:44.461
He says, "Well, I've got this,
I've got that,

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:46.866
KISS posters, KISS guitars,
a KISS snow globe."

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:49.468
When he said KISS snow globe,
I immediately said,

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.447
"Yes, and only the snow globe."

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:55.069
So, met up with Mark,
traded the afternoon with Alice Cooper,

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.519
a priceless opportunity
for a KISS snow globe.

00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:02.037
And the whole world
kind of sort of like oo-oo-oo -

00:08:02.037 --> 00:08:05.019
and I was like this is great,
it lights up, changes colors.

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:06.219
(Laughter)

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:09.728
Here's some of the various
online responses from the video.

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:14.338
This is the worst trade
that I've ever heard of, bar none.

00:08:14.338 --> 00:08:17.191
(Laughter)

00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:21.098
This is possibly the dumbest decision
I've ever seen anyone make ... ever.

00:08:21.098 --> 00:08:22.318
(Laughter)

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:24.660
Except for the people on Jerry Springer.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.362
(Applause)

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.429
Other people were much
more eloquent in their delivery.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:34.789
(Laughter)

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.370
And this was the only time
during the entire project

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.395
where I had another trade lined up.

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.755
Every other trade
had come along serendipitously,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.812
and it'd just been this
amazing experience.

00:08:47.812 --> 00:08:51.581
However, two months previous to all this,
this guy had called me up and said,

00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:54.770
"Hey, my name is Corbin Bernsen,
I'm a huge Hollywood actor.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.440
I'm making a movie

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.572
and I'd like to offer a paid, speaking,
credited role in a Hollywood film.

00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:02.607
Are you interested in trading for that?"

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:04.785
I had just done
the recording contract trade,

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:07.323
and was like, "Yes, absolutely,
this sounds perfect."

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:08.331
He hung up the phone,

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:10.572
and I'm, "Corbin Bernsen,
who is this guy?"

00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:13.767
It turns out he is very well known,
he's been in many major movies,

00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:16.122
and he also, according to Wikipedia,

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.403
has the world's largest
snow globe collection,

00:09:18.403 --> 00:09:20.373
over 6,500 snow globes.

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:21.663
(Laughter)

00:09:21.983 --> 00:09:24.263
Since it was Wikipedia I knew it was true,

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:25.373
(Laughter)

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.772
and I just sort of kept it
in the back of my head.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:32.021
When Mark said he had a KISS snow globe,
I was like,"This is perfect."

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:34.370
Called Corbin: "Do you want
the KISS snow globe?"

00:09:34.371 --> 00:09:35.396
"Send a picture."

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:39.253
Sent one. Corbin called back,
"Not only do I want it, I need it."

00:09:39.253 --> 00:09:40.593
(Laughter)

00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:47.705
While these comments
were coming in like dumbasses, etc,

00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:49.460
I had no backup plan,

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.665
and luckily for the project
and for Corbin,

00:09:51.671 --> 00:09:54.103
he didn't get hit by a bus
and he was still alive,

00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:55.493
and we made a trade.

00:09:55.493 --> 00:09:59.153
He showed us into his snow-globe lair
of over 6,000 snow globes,

00:09:59.153 --> 00:10:00.795
which looks kind of like this.

00:10:00.803 --> 00:10:02.070
(Laughter)

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.404
Following this,

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:08.494
the Economic Development Officer
of the town of Kipling, Saskatchewan,

00:10:08.494 --> 00:10:11.175
a fellow named Bert Roth,
called me up and said,

00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:13.722
"We see that you've been
doing this project.

00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:16.240
Our town has a couple
extra houses that we own.

00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:17.711
Would there be a potential

00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:19.865
that maybe we could trade
one of these houses

00:10:19.867 --> 00:10:21.067
for something you have?"

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.787
I say, "I have a role in the movie."

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.225
He's like, "That'd be perfect:

00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:27.038
What we were thinking is having
a huge house warming party,

00:10:27.038 --> 00:10:30.662
a huge celebration, inviting everyone
in the world to come to Kipling.

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:32.614
We could offer an opportunity:

00:10:32.614 --> 00:10:34.047
we'll call it 'Kipling Idol.'

00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:37.476
We'll have live auditions
for the movie role, here, right in town."

00:10:37.476 --> 00:10:41.574
I said, "That's absolutely perfect, Bert.
What you need to do to make this happen?"

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:43.637
He's,"Well, we need
town council approval."

00:10:43.637 --> 00:10:46.175
I say, "Alright, if you can get it,
that'd be great."

00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:47.796
He called me back two weeks later:

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:50.803
"I did it, I got town council approval,
we can make the trade."

00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:52.286
Turns out town council approval

00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:54.776
was getting two people
to put their hand in the air.

00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:57.837
But, full credit to Bert,
he made it happen.

00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:00.757
And we traveled to Kipling,
and there we are.

00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:03.041
That's how you trade
a paperclip for a house.

00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:04.881
And that's the house.

00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:07.734
(Applause)

00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:15.918
The best part about
this whole project is fun,

00:11:15.923 --> 00:11:17.306
making the trades for things.

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:20.886
Easier to tell the story with the objects,
but it was the people behind it.

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:24.842
In Kipling, apparently, Mounties
sign the deeds to traded houses.

00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:26.658
We had a huge house warming party,

00:11:26.658 --> 00:11:30.678
over 3,500 people
came to the town of Kipling,

00:11:30.678 --> 00:11:32.745
a town of under 1,000 people,

00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:34.088
for an entire weekend.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.202
There were live auditions on stage,

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:39.821
500 to 600 people in the crowd
including the volunteer fire department,

00:11:39.821 --> 00:11:41.700
in a capacity 300-person building.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.198
So, yeah, they let it slide,
but it was an amazing experience.

00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:48.609
Corbin Bernsen went out on stage,
the next day in town,

00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:50.929
and said, "Here's the winner
of the movie role.

00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:53.353
Written on his back
was the name Nolan Hubbard.

00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:55.734
Nolan Hubbard had just graduated
from high school,

00:11:55.743 --> 00:11:57.864
was making minimum wage
at The Bottle Depot.

00:11:57.871 --> 00:11:59.910
Two months after this picture was taken,

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.991
he was down in Los Angeles
working on a film with Corbin.

00:12:03.591 --> 00:12:04.940
An amazingly talented person

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.174
who, without this opportunity
to make a film,

00:12:07.174 --> 00:12:08.765
might have not had that chance.

00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:11.290
And it was all about the people saying,

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:14.019
"Yes, let's build something,
let's do something together,

00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:16.099
let's collaborate,
let's see what happens."

00:12:16.107 --> 00:12:18.490
That was what one red paperclip
was all about.

00:12:19.962 --> 00:12:23.781
There, at this house warming party
in Kipling, Saskatchewan,

00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:27.711
Karina had the original red paperclip
around her neck in a picture frame.

00:12:27.944 --> 00:12:29.566
And people were saying to me like,

00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:33.228
"Wow, you traded with a paperclip,
but don't you wish you had it back now?"

00:12:33.282 --> 00:12:34.552
(Laughter)

00:12:36.182 --> 00:12:40.390
That's got to be worth a lot of money.
That's got to be - It's really famous.

00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:44.142
And I said to them that day
what I still say today:

00:12:44.142 --> 00:12:45.667
"It wasn't about the paperclip,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.536
it's not about having it,
or selling it for what it's worth.

00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:50.773
If I hadn't traded away
that red paperclip,

00:12:50.773 --> 00:12:54.603
I'd just be a guy sitting there at a desk
holding a paperclip in his hand,

00:12:54.603 --> 00:12:58.027
wondering what would happen
if I did something with the paperclip."

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.794
So ... if you have a paperclip,
trade it away.

00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:02.364
You might only get a fish pen,

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:06.232
but it might be the single step
that leads to an amazing journey.

00:13:06.232 --> 00:13:08.803
And, for me, that journey
will be off this red circle.

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:10.250
So, I wish you the best.

00:13:10.316 --> 00:13:13.220
(Applause) (Cheering)
