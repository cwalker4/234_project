00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
You have the happiest face I have ever met.

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.090
Say, "Hello, how's your family?"

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.451
“Just great.”

00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.155
[Laughing]

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.704
I'm happy right now talking to you.
[Laughing]

00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:17.942
We did meet once before.

00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:21.157
You might not remember 'cause I'm not really sure whose party it was at.

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:26.966
But we were both invited to meet the princess of Monaco.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.130
Marvin Davis.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.670
Yeah. It was a really, a big party.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.986
Lot of, lot of big names.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:36.445
And I was very thrilled that you insulted me at the very end.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:37.905
&gt;&gt; I did?
&gt;&gt; I don't really remember what you said.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.385
But I remember I was, like, shocked.

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:43.435
I was just leaving for the car and you shouted it out and I thought,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.666
I made it. I'm in Hollywood.

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.106
Rickles insulted me.

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:47.727
You're single?

00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:50.548
I'm single? Are you starting in and insulting me already?

00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:51.659
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; You like to hit to the core?

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.444
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; No, I was gonna ask you about that, too, 'cause you married late, too.

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:56.053
Take a guess.

00:00:56.053 --> 00:00:57.231
How long do you think I'm married?

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.869
Uh, well...

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:59.773
Tonight!

00:00:59.773 --> 00:01:00.708
All right, all right, all right.

00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:01.830
I'm slow, I'm slow.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.689
[Laughing]

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.097
I'm gonna say 50 years, maybe.

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:07.882
&gt;&gt; Fifty-one.
&gt;&gt; Fifty-one.

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:09.039
[Laughing]

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.439
And how did you meet your wife of 51 years?

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.110
That was a mercy case.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.203
[Laughing]

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:19.210
She said, “I can't believe that Johnny knows me so good.”

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.566
“I’m gonna be on TV.”

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:24.156
Go ahead, honey, tell them what you told me how you're fed up with the show.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:25.953
[Laughing]

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.516
When you came out of high school you started to be an actress?

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:29.726
No, more in my 20s.

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:31.024
I stayed in New York for a while.

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.496
I joined a theater company.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:36.521
I did a bunch of plays off-Broadway and eventually on Broadway.

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:37.551
And then I came here.

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:38.840
&gt;&gt; Was your, was your...
&gt;&gt; Got sucked into it.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.436
Was your family for that or...

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:41.702
My mom said no.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.434
My mom was like, "Do something with your mind."

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:48.430
She didn't know that it takes intelligence to, to be in our business.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.634
But actually, my mom was pretty funny.

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:56.370
And I always think that I got some of my, my timing and, and that zest for it from her.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.083
&gt;&gt; Same thing with me with my mom.
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.026
So she was funny and made you laugh and then you in turn...

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.573
No, she never made me laugh.

00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:05.552
Oh, no?
[Laughing]

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:06.579
My goodness.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.683
What, what you throw on a bucket of paint?

00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:10.243
[Laughing]

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:12.095
Why don't you put a number on your back and get in the roller derby?

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.033
[Laughing]

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:13.937
You're a good-looking guy, right?

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.487
You look like Richard Harris, the actor.

00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:16.159
Have you ever been told that?

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.013
No.

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:17.938
Well, you don't then.

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.403
[Laughing]

00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:23.722
Your manager was just telling me one of your first, uh, stops was a nightclub

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:24.786
that now is a shul

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.034
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; in Brooklyn.

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:26.747
[Laughing]

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.622
It's funny the way you know the word shul, the way you say it, you know?

00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:31.193
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Being a Gentile girl it's...

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:35.487
Yeah, well, but I grew up in, in Brooklyn in the, in the heart of Flatbush.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:40.916
There is a sense of where I was from and my particular family that,

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:43.952
like all performers, like, that's what influences us.

00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:48.280
And coming out of that particular neighborhood in Brooklyn,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.403
which was very mixed, a lot of ethnicities, which I think is so wonderful

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:57.570
for an actor to get to see all kinds of cultures and get to know and love all kinds of people.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.245
[Laughing]

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:03.847
My whole life, my friends, has been dedicated to humor about ethnic backgrounds.

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:07.817
And a wonderful man, Jack Benny, said to me once, in the Slate Brothers in California,

00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:09.256
"He's gonna get killed."

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.580
[Laughing]

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.102
I was really good in, at the corner joints.

00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:17.080
Places that weren't exactly top of the mind.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.935
I, we might have that in common.

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:22.664
I, I did play a stripper and I know that you worked in some, in some strip joints.

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:23.774
So I know a joint.

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:26.057
Dean Martin has been a friend of many, many years.

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:27.972
Dean, uh, I say this from my heart, really.

00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:29.547
I've never liked you. Never.

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.825
[Laughing]

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:35.652
Yeah, I'd be so terrified to ever do stand-up.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:38.417
I like, or I don't know what you, you want to call it,

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:42.572
like, I have text and I can make something of it, but, um...

00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:43.754
You didn't go to college.

00:03:44.103 --> 00:03:48.911
I went to college for a year and then I, I got a job on a soap opera, actually.

00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:53.578
So I thought it was gonna be like a short little thing and then they extended my part

00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:55.787
and I wound up not going back.

00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:57.153
You're doing “Spider-Man.”

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.037
&gt;&gt; I am.
&gt;&gt; A lot of physical stuff, right?

00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:01.759
&gt;&gt; I'm the, uh, I'm his adviser.
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.728
Perhaps his guru.

00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:05.021
[Laughing]

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.751
“Rat Race” I did with Debbie Reynolds.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.407
I played a gangster.

00:04:10.407 --> 00:04:11.932
I said, "Why don't you shut up?"

00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:13.943
Bang. I physically slapped her.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.085
But you really, you, you really gave her a knock?

00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:17.851
Oh, yeah.

00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.328
“Oh, yeah.” You say it like there's a statute of limitations on that.

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:23.152
She was on, laying on the floor for the count of nine.

00:04:23.152 --> 00:04:24.287
[Laughing]

00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:27.333
And I did “Innocent Blood” with John Landis.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.733
I did a John Landis picture.

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:29.777
&gt;&gt; Oh, did you?
&gt;&gt; “Oscar.”

00:04:29.777 --> 00:04:30.998
So what do we have in common?

00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:35.133
We have the neighborhood, John Landis, strip clubs.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:37.733
&gt;&gt; And I'm successful and you're struggling.
&gt;&gt; Are we both...

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:38.567
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:39.918
[Laughing]

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:43.449
You gonna eat? Can I have that?

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.697
It's like a cheese steak.

00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:45.744
Before you bite into it...

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:46.632
Yeah.

00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:48.944
&gt;&gt;&gt; I wish you every success...
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:49.706
&gt;&gt; to you and your family.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.942
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; You're a pretty girl.

00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:51.861
Thanks.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.674
Don't marry a cameraman, a director.

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:56.749
They're all trouble.

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:57.533
Oh, my God.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:04:58.624
I gotta get out of this business.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.053
We had an album, "Hello Dummy!,” in our house,

00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:08.234
so it was something that my brother and I listened to a lot.

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:11.968
And then later I met him at Marvin Davis' house.

00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:14.645
He stole the evening.

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:19.991
It was a lot of hotshots and he was so incredibly funny.

00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:25.122
And he personally insulted my boyfriend at the time as we were walking to the car.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.427
He gets to that sensitive spot

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:31.643
where he knows what's going on really deep inside you and then kind of zings it,

00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:35.594
but in the way, like, only your family could do.

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:36.893
But in the right way.

00:05:36.893 --> 00:05:38.026
You know, a loving family.

00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:47.337
What it do?

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:48.501
It's your boy, big Snoop Dogg.

00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:51.426
And I need y'all to go subscribe right now to the AARP Channel.

00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:52.401
You know what I'm talking about?

00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:55.304
So you can see Don Rickles and see his right-hand man,

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:58.435
no, his left-hand man, Snoop Dogg, live and direct.

00:05:58.435 --> 00:05:59.359
Go subscribe right now.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.141
What you waitin' on?

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:01.935
What did he say?

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:04.226
[Laughing]
