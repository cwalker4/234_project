SHOW.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.606
FOLKS, I GREATLY ADMIRE THE WORK

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:10.577
HE HOSTS "THE DAILY SHOW" EVERY
NIGHT ON COMEDY CENTRAL.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.345
PLEASE WELCOME TREVOR NOAH!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:19.252
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:31.297 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.066 size:81% position:41%
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
THANK YOU.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.335 align:start size:88% position:13%
THANK YOU.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.403 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.270 size:75% position:38%
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.241 size:88% position:56%
I JUST WANT TO SAY SINCE THE
LAST TIME I HAD YOU ON HERE,

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:41.975 size:88% position:56%
LAST SEPTEMBER OR SOMETHING.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.243 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.346 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU HAVE WRITTEN
AND RELEASED A BOOK CALLED "BORN

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:46.613 align:start size:88% position:13%
A CRIME."

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:47.814 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; I DID, INDEED.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.483
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I'M
ANGRY THAT YOU HAVE TIME TO DO

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:50.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.919 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
OR THE ENERGY, REALLY.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:58.658
BECAUSE I JUST GO HOME AT NIGHT
AND THEY PUT ME IN AMNIOTIC

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:02.562
FLUID SO I'M READY FOR THE SHOW
THE NEXT NIGHT.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.032
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE AN HOUR SHOW, AND I
HAVE A HALF HOUR SO.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.100
YOU ALSO HAVE A FAMILY.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.801 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'M ALONE.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S TRUE.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.171 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S TRUE.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:11.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
YEAH.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.906 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT YOU TRAVEL ALL OVER THE
WORLD.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.507
YOU'VE GOT TO BE EXHAUSTED ON A
CERTAIN LEVEL.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:18.344
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, I FIND I GET
MY ENERGY FROM DOING THE THINGS

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:18.978 align:start size:88% position:13%
I LOVE.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.914 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING I
LEARNED FROM YOU.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.550 align:start size:88% position:13%
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
SAYING THIS.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.654 align:end position:100%
WHEN CREATING THE SHOW, STEPHEN
COLBERT SAID-- LIKE HE'S NOT

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.657
HERE-- HE SAID, "THE JOY OF THE
SHOW IS NOT OFTENTIMES IN

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.091 align:start size:88% position:13%
PERFORMING IT.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.260
THE JOY IS DERIVED FROM CREATING
IT, AND WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING IS

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.062
A MANIFESTATION OF THAT JOY."

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:40.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU SHOW THE
AUDIENCE WHAT WE ALL TO DO

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.601 align:start size:88% position:13%
TOGETHER.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.904
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DO WHAT YOU LOVE-- AND
I KNOW IT'S HARD IN THIS WORLD--

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.874
IF YOU DO THE THING YOU LOVE YOU
DON'T GET TIRED.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.676 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU GET TIRED BECAUSE OF THE
CHALLENGE.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.378
BUT YOU DON'T GET MENTALLY AND
EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGED.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.746
MAN, THAT WAS A NICE DAY.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.516
IMAGINE DOING SOMETHING YOU LOVE
UNTIL YOU GOT TIRED.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.385
THAT SOUNDED WRONG, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:01:59.719 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER ).

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:00.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT SOUNDED VERY
RIGHT TO ME.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.756
OF COURSE, THERE ARE DAYS LIKE
TODAY, WHEN SHOWS LIKE MINE AND

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.192
SHOWS LIKE YOURS, WE TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE DAY,

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.795
AND TODAY THERE WAS ANOTHER--
THERE WAS ANOTHER HORRIFIC

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:13.766
SHOOTING IN AMERICA, THIS TIME
TARGETING, APPARENTLY, G.O.P.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:14.501 size:88% position:44%
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:18.938
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY
THOUGHTS ON WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.574
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT YOU SAID,
SIMILAR TO WHAT I HAD AS AN

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.910 size:88% position:56%
INITIAL THOUGHT-- ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE WE WATCH THE NEWS SO

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.915
MUCH-- AND THAT WAS IT WAS GREAT
TO SEE PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:33.987
SEEING THIS AND UNITING UNDER
THE BANNER OF "HUMAN" AND

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.821
"AMERICAN" BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.024
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
WE'RE SEEING LESS AND LESS OF IN

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.059
SOCIETY TODAY, IT FEELS LIKE.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.062
IT'S ALMOST SOMETHING-- I WAS
TALKING TO SENATOR AL FRANKEN,

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.965
AND I WAS SAYING TO HIM, LIKE--
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW HE

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:50.537
WAS FRIENDS WITH JEFF SESSIONS
BEFORE THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW,

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:50.803 align:start size:88% position:13%
TESTIMONY.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:54.541 size:88% position:56%
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S LACKING IN AMERICAN

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.343 align:end position:100%
POLITICS IS POLITICIANS SHOWING
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.312
THAT THEY ARE FRIENDS.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.748
IT'S ALMOST BECOME LIKE
WRESTLING, WHERE THE FANS DON'T

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.551
REALIZE THAT THOSE PEOPLE GET
ALONG.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.886
<i>( APPLAUSE )
THOSE PEOPLE FIGHT EVERY SINGLE</i>

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:11.591
DAY, BUT, LIKE PAULRIAN SAID
TODAY, LIKE NANCY PELOSI SAID,

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.861
WE FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL, BUT WE
DON'T FORGET THAT WE ARE PEOPLE.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.864
WE ARE FRIENDS, WE ARE FAMILIES,
WE ARE COLLEAGUES.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.900 align:end position:100%
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY COULD DO A
BETTER JOB OF SAYING THAT TO

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.168
AMERICANS, "HEY, WE FIGHT.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU CAN FIGHT.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.439
BUT DON'T FORGET AT YOUR CORE,
YOU ARE AMERICANS.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.508
DON'T EVER FORGET THAT."

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.811 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, THAT'S

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.513
ABSOLUTELY-- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.648
BUT THAT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT--
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:36.382 align:start size:88% position:13%
UNITED STATES?

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.218
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING
HERE FULL TIME NOW?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.820
&gt;&gt; THIS IS MY SECOND TIME LIVING
HERE.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.625 align:end position:100%
I LEFT JUST TO PRACTICE LEAVING
BEFORE DONALD TRUMP SAID SO.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.993
( LAUGHTER )
SO I LIVED ON THE WEST COAST FOR

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:47.460 align:start size:88% position:13%
TWO YEARS.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.729
AND THEN I LEFT THE UNITED
STATES AND WENT TO WORK IN THE

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.933
WORLD, AND THEN I'VE BEEN LIVING
HERE I GUESS IT'S CLOSE TO THREE

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:54.133 align:start size:88% position:13%
YEARS.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.101 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: FIVE YEARS ALL
TOGETHER.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.202
ARE YOU AN AMERICAN CITIZEN YET?

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:59.239
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NOT ALLOWED TO
BE.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.473
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOT ALLOWED TO BE.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.507 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; NOT YET.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.976 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE WE PLAYING
HARD TO GET.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.244 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; NO IT'S TIME.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.144 align:start size:88% position:13%
I GET IT.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:08.881
WITH AN IMMIGRANT THEY'RE LIKE
WE WANT TO SEE WHERE THIS IS

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.752 align:start size:88% position:13%
GOING AND FIGURE OUT ARE YOU
REALLY INTO US?

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.486 align:start size:88% position:13%
LET'S GO SLOW.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND I GET IT.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.289
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I GUESS THAT'S THE
QUESTION.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.192
ARE YOU REALLY INTO US, TREVOR
NOAH, AFTER THREE YEARS HERE AND

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.527
EVERY NIGHT TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN AMERICA, DO YOU

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.729
STILL FIND US ATTRACTIVE?

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.063
&gt;&gt; I'M HERE AND I'M LOVING IT.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:26.733 align:end position:100%
I'M A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD, AND
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE UNITED

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:26.966 align:start size:88% position:13%
STATES.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.701
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
BE A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:32.472 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE WORLD DOES NOT ISSUE A
PASSPORT.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.006
&gt;&gt; SURPRISINGLY IT DOES.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.474
THERE IS A WORLD PASSPORT.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:37.677
IT DOESN'T GET YOU ANYWHERE, BUT
THERE IS A WORLD PASSPORT.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:43.116 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT GETS YOU TO A
PHISH CONCERT.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:43.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
TIE-DYE.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.619
&gt;&gt; MY DREAM WAS TO LIVE IN THE
U.S. MOSTLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.553 size:78% position:39%
HOME OF STAND-UP.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.722
AND I LIVE THAT DREAM EVERY DAY.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:50.590 size:75% position:38%
AND I'M BLESSED.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.792
WHEN PEOPLE GO WHICH COUNTRY DO
YOU LIVE IN?

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.460
I GO, "I LIVE IN NEW YORK.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.929 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S NOT A COUNTRY, IT'S A
PLACE."

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.565
IF YOU KNOW NEW YORK, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALK ABOUT.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:00.933
IT'S A WORLD UNTO ITSELF.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.137
&gt;&gt; Stephen: EVERY LANGUAGE
SPOKEN HERE, EVERY RELIGION

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:04.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
PRACTICED HERE.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.139 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T TAKE THAT FOR
GRANTED.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.742
I WAIT TO SEE-- LET'S FUT THIS
WAY-- IF AMERICA IS AROUND WHEN

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:12.679
I CAN BECOME A CITIZEN, THEN
MAYBE WE'LL SEE IF I JOIN IN.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.413
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HOPE SO.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.681 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.515 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.750
MAYBE I'LL BE INVITING YOU TO
SOUTH AFRICA.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.584 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU NEVER KNOW.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ANOTHER I'VE BEEN
TO SOUTH AFRICA, NOT TO THE

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.858
CITIES BUT I'VE DONE LIKE, YOU
KNOW, THE UNITED STATES, YOU

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.026
KNOW, WESTERN MAN THING.

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.762
I'VE GONE AND DONE THE SAFARI--
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE SPHAEPS THAT IS

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:31.664 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE CITIES.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:31.998 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER ).

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:36.169 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU OUGHT TO GET
SOME OF THOSE LIONS OUT OF YOUR

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
CITIES, THEN.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:42.308
DOES SOUTH AFRICA HAVE ANYONE OR
HAVE THEY EVER HAD ANYBODY LIKE

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
OUR PRESIDENT?

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
BECAUSE--
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'VE-- WE'VE
NEVER HAD A DONALD TRUMP BEFORE,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.917
SO WE DON'T KNOW ENTIRELY WHAT
TO DO WITH HIM.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.852 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
HE SEEMS TO BREAK A MOLD.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.153
HE BREAKS A LOT OF NORMS FOR US.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.323 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; YES, HE DOES.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.726 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HAS SOUTH AFRICA
HAD ONE JUDGE IT'S TOUGH.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.695 size:88% position:56%
DONALD TRUMP IS SO DIFFERENT
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.698
DEFINITIVELY SAY WE'VE HAD OR
NOT HAD A DONALD TRUMP.

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.801
HE REMINDS ME OF AFRICAN
DICTATORS BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:09.635 align:start size:88% position:13%
CERTAIN --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IN WHAT WAY?

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:13.973
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, I'VE SAID MANY TIMES
LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE LOVES

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:14.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
HIMSELF.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.142
HE BELIEVES THAT ONLY HE CAN FIX
THE PROBLEMS.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.877
HE SPEAKS IN THE THIRD PERSON.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:22.882
HE-- I MEAN, HE'S THE FIRST
AFRICAN DICTATOR TO USE TWITTER,

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.284
WHICH IS THE MILLENNIAL COMING
OUT.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.888 size:88% position:56%
BUT HAVE WE HAD-- LET ME FUT
THIS WAY: I DON'T KNOW FOR

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:29.122 align:start size:88% position:13%
CERTAIN.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.457 align:start size:88% position:13%
I WILL SAY THIS, THIS IS MY
PRESIDENT.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:35.395
MY PRESIDENT IS CURRENTLY
EMBROILED IN A SCANDAL WHERE HIS

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.631
FAMILY HAS BEEN USING THEIR TIES
TO THE PRESIDENCY TO MAKE MONEY.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.034
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT RINGS A
BELL...

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:42.835 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
LET ME SEE WHAT ELSE?

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.638 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT ELSE?

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:48.474
UHM... HE HAD A FEW ISSUES
BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT WITH

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.077 align:start size:88% position:13%
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND-- NO,
OKAY.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.645 align:start size:88% position:13%
LET ME THINK.

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:54.580 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
HE'S FRIENDS WITH VLADIMIR

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
PUTIN.

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.549
THAT'S DIFFERENT-- NO, NO.

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:57.283 align:start size:88% position:13%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.318
YOU TELL ME, STEPHEN.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.053
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'LL TRADE YOU.

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.990 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.390 align:start size:88% position:13%
JUST TO TRY.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.392 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD DO THAT, RIGHT?

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LIKE SWAPPING.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.495 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD DO A PRESIDENT
SWAP.

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:13.166
I WILL SAY THIS-- NOW, IMAGINE
DONALD TRUMP AND IF HE WAS

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.935 align:start size:88% position:13%
BLACK.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:16.102 align:start size:88% position:13%
HMM?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:21.140 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S--
&gt;&gt; HE'S A MAN OF COLOR?

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.010
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO
SAY?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.610 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.645 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY IT.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WASN'T SURE.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.216
YOU CAN SAY IT BEFORE I CAN, MY
FRIEND.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.018
"THE DAILY SHOW" IS DOING
SOMETHING INTERESTING THIS

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:34.420
WEEKEND-- YOU DO SOMETHING
INTERESTING EVERY DAY-- BUT

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.322
YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING
ON THE WEEKEND.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.157
EXPLAIN TO THE GOOD PEOPLE HERE
IN MANHATTAN.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.058 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; HERE'S THE THING.

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:42.395
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO AS "THE DAILY
SHOW" YOU HATE ON DONALD TRUMP,

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:46.299
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE DO,
BUT I DID FEEL THERE WAS

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.001
SOMETHING WE COULD DO FOR THE
PRESIDENT IN AND AROUND HIS

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:49.268 align:start size:88% position:13%
BIRTHDAY.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.937 size:88% position:56%
THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERTED
EFFORT BY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:54.207
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, TO
SILENCE THE PRESIDENT'S SWEETS

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
TWOOETS.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.911
WE KNOW ABOUT THIS, KELLYANNE
COB WAY, THEY GO, OTHER IGNORE

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE TWEETS.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.914
I DON'T THINK THAT'S COOL.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.484 align:start size:88% position:13%
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HIS
PRESIDENTING.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.018
HE'S THE KING OF TWITTER.

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:06.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE ROCKS IT.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:10.056
YOU CAN'T HATE ON DONALD TRUMP
WHEN IT COMES TO TWITTER SO WE

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:13.926
DECIDED TO HAVE A TWITTER
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY THAT HONORS

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.228
DONALD J. TRUMP'S TWEETS.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:17.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
I KNOW, NORMALLY--

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.933
YEAH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:24.170
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY, I KNOW IN
AMERICA, YOU HAVE THE

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.707
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY WHEN THE
PERSON LEAVES OFFICE.

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.876
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:30.443 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OR EVER.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:31.777 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.579 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO APPRECIATE PERSON WHILE
THEY'RE STILL AROUND.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:34.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHERE IS IT?

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.314 size:78% position:39%
HOW CAN I SEE IT?

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:38.317
&gt;&gt; IT'S ACTUALLY A BLOCK AWAY
FROM TRUMP TOWER.

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:42.889 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S GOING TO BE ON 3 WEST
57th STREET.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:48.361

&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE THERE ANY
DISPLAYS?

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.197
&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE EVERYTHING.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.834
THE TWITTER LIBRARY WILL GIVE
YOU CONTEXT, WHAT THE TWEETS ARE

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:55.801 size:78% position:39%
ABOUT, THE STORY.

HE'S AN AMAZING MAN WHEN IT
COMES FOR TWITTER.

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.874
IF HE WAS RUNNING FOR TWITTER
PRESIDENT, I WOULD SAY EVERYONE

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.309
SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM, EVERYONE.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.111
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE THEY ORGANIZED
BY SUBJECT?

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:07.079
ARE THEY ORGANIZED BY HASHTAGS?

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.315
&gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS WE COULD.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:12.451
THE ONLY SUBJECT THAT'S
CONSISTENT IS "SAD."

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.986
THAT'S THE ONLY THING.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:16.155
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE IS THE "SAD
HALL OF FAME."

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.657 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ABOUT IT.

YORK BECAUSE NEW YORK IS THE
HOME OF STAND-UP.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:27.867
YOU STILL DO STAND-UPS ON THE
WEEKEND

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:28.034 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt;.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.069 align:start size:88% position:13%

YOU FLY.

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:36.542
HOW DO YOU FIND THE TIME AND HOW
DO YOU HAVE ANY JOKES LEFT.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:40.880
&gt;&gt; I FIND THE JOKES FROM
STAND-UP AND BRING THEM TO "THE

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.948 align:start size:88% position:13%
DAILY SHOW."

I'VE BEEN TO 45 STATES NOW.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.261
I'VE BEEN TO HUNDREDS OF U.S.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:55.962 align:start size:88% position:13%
CITIES.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:59.732 align:start size:88% position:13%
I SAW MAR-A-LAGO IN PERSON
BECAUSE OF STAND-UP.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:04.303
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE TO PALM
BEACH.

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:07.206
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN, BUT I
WENT TO MAR-A-LAGO.

&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HEARD IT WAS
VERY NICE.

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:11.143
&gt;&gt; I SAID CAN I COME IN.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.947
AND HE WAS VERY SWEET BUT HE
SAID, "IT'S FOR MEMBERS ONLY."

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:21.854
AND I SAID, "I'M THE HOST--" AND
HE SAID, " WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.222
LIKE SECURITY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:25.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
