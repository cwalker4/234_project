00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.010
In A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones,
“Every great lord has [a] maester” , an

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.690
educated man who serves as a healer, tutor
and advisor . The maesters may seem harmless,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.279
but many fans – and some characters in the
series – think they’re up to something.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.279
Something big.

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.650
So let’s have a look.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.630
The maesters are an ancient order based in
the Citadel, in Oldtown , which is kind of

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.150
like a university . As a maester studies,
he forges a chain made of many different metals

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.530
to be worn around his neck , with each link
representing mastery of a different field

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.090
of learning – silver for healing , copper
for history , and so on.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.980
The Citadel is governed by a Conclave of archmaesters
– the highest-ranking maesters – who each

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.800
bear a mask, ring and rod made of the metal
of their field of expertise.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.990
The Conclave also elects a Grand Maester who
advises the King in King’s Landing – for

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.181
the last forty years, this has been Pycelle
. When maesters complete their training, they

00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:01.280
give up their family name , and take vows
of celibacy and service to the realm . They’re

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.490
then assigned to a castle or keep in Westeros
where they serve whoever rules there – healing,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.100
teaching, advising, and also managing the
ravens that carry messages between castles

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.499
. So – what’s so suspicious them?

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.890
The Lady of Barrowton, Barbrey Dustin, deeply
distrusts the maesters, calling them “grey

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.890
rats”.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.009
She points out that the maesters actually
have a lot of power over the lords they supposedly

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.439
serve – she says since maesters often read
and write the letters for their lords, they

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.219
could possibly “twist … the words for
their own ends”.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.950
Maesters are supposed to be politically neutral
, but because they abandon their family names,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.750
you can’t know “who they truly are”,
or “where they come from” – or whose

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.450
interests they might serve . She says “we
… make them privy to all our shames and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.759
secrets, a part of every council.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.460
And before too long, the ruler has become
the ruled”.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.869
Dustin makes some good points here, right?

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.819
Maesters are like the Google or Facebook of
Westeros – they control the flow of information,

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.799
and everyone just trusts or hopes that they’re
not being manipulated.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.680
Maesters write the history books , educate
young lordlings, count the votes at councils

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.360
, and whisper into the ears of the most powerful
people in Westeros.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.170
Could the maesters be manipulating politics
for their purposes?

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.690
Dustin goes on to claim that the maesters
were closely involved in a plot against the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.570
Targaryens before Robert’s Rebellion.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.330
So at the start of the series, before Tommen
and Joffrey, Robert Baratheon is the king

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.330
of Westeros.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.350
He became king about twenty years earlier,
when his Rebellion overthrew the Targaryens,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.620
who had ruled Westeros for the last three
hundred years.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.920
The rebellion began when Eddard Stark’s
sister Lyanna was abducted by – or maybe

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.180
ran away with – Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.310
But Lady Dustin implies that the Starks along
with the Tullys, and maybe the Arryns and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.590
Baratheons had been plotting a rebellion long
before the war began , and that one of the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.660
main people behind this plot was a maester
named Walys, apparently the son of an archmaester

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.800
of the Citadel and a “Hightower girl”
– House Hightower is one of the biggest

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.560
supporters of the maesters . So if what Lady
Dustin is saying is true, the maesters of

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.620
the Citadel may have been partly responsible
for Robert’s Rebellion and the downfall

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.500
of the Targaryens . A lot of this is uncertain,
we don’t really know the details, but it

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.740
sure is intriguing, and we hear a similar
but bigger claim from another character – Marwyn

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.460
the Mage.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.910
Marwyn is an archmaester of the Citadel, but
he’s “not like other maesters” , all

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.580
stuffy and academic.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.570
Marywn reputedly “keep[s] company with whores
and hedge wizards”, in “rat pits and black

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.720
brothels”, and sacrifices to “queer gods”.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.110
He spent years in the distant east, “searching
for lost books”, “studying with warlocks

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.640
and shadowbinders” , and, along the way,
teaching Mirri Maz Duur how to heal . Marwyn’s

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.190
mask is Valyrian steel , meaning he is an
expert on magic.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.100
At the end of Feast, Sam Tarly meets Marwyn,
and Marwyn claims that the maesters are conspiring

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.600
to build a world without “sorcery or prophecy
or glass candles” or dragons.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.210
He implies that the maesters “killed all
the dragons the last time around”, that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.550
they didn’t trust Maester Aemon because
he was a Targaryen , and that the maesters

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.740
are willing to kill to further their goals
. Marwyn then gets on a boat and sails off

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.160
to find Daenerys, leaving Sam, and the reader,
wondering what the hells to make of all that.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.489
So let’s work it out.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.870
Marwyn is implying that the maesters of the
Citadel have been conspiring for many years

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.570
against Targaryens, and dragons, and magic.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.960
Which could make sense.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.390
As the historians of Westeros, the maesters
would be painfully aware of the damage done

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.120
to realm by the Targaryens and their dragons,
through war , and misrule , and madness – not

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.620
to mention that several Grand Maesters were
killed by Targaryen kings . Maybe the maesters

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.560
figured that the best way they could serve
the realm would be to get rid of the Targaryens

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.580
and their destructive dragons.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.130
It’s also no secret that the maesters don’t
trust magic – it’s easy to see why – magic’s

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.000
wild, and dangerous, difficult to control
and to understand , which is a real challenge

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.190
to the maesters’ power as scholars and advisors.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.570
So it probably would make sense for the maesters
to oppose the Targaryens, dragons and magic.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.570
Can we find any evidence that they’ve been
conspiring against those things?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.260
We’ve already talked about Lady Dustin’s
claim that a maester helped cause Robert’s

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.690
Rebellion, which could possibly have been
part of a maester conspiracy against the Targaryens.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.090
We hear another claim from Marwyn – he suggests
that the maesters don’t trust Maester Aemon

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.770
because he’s a Targaryen, and that’s why
Aemon spent his life on the Wall instead of

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.500
becoming an archmaester at the Citadel . However,
when Aemon talks about this stuff, it sounds

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.610
like it was his choice to serve on the Wall
, and the official World of Ice and Fire app

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.830
says Aemon went to the Wall so he couldn’t
be used politically against his brother Egg,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.210
the king . So it doesn’t really sound like
Aemon was exiled from the Citadel for being

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.210
a Targaryen.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.719
Further, we know of at least one Targaryen
who did serve as an archmaester at the Citadel

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.650
, though admittedly that was a long time ago.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.220
So none of this is really evidence of a conspiracy.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.550
Let’s look at another of Marwyn’s claims
– he implies that the maesters “killed

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.370
all the dragons the last time around” . The
“last time around” was about a hundred

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.770
and seventy years ago, at a time during the
Targaryen reign of Westeros, when they had

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.990
twenty-one dragons.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.639
Most of these dragons were killed during the
Dance of the Dragons, a civil war of succession

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.031
that divided the Targaryens and their dragons,
and pitted them against each other . In the

00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:25.430
three years of the war, twelve dragons were
killed in battle , five dragons were killed

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.150
by a rioting mob of common people , two flew
off , and one “vanished” , leaving just

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.840
one young dragon, called Morning, alive and
under Targaryen control . There were also

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.740
some hatchlings after the war, but none survived
long, and apparently Morning died too because

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.090
within about twenty years, the last Targaryen
dragon was dead . There were still some eggs

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.490
left over after that , but none of them ever
hatched – well, not until much later . Anyway

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.310
it’s not clear what Marwyn means when he
claims that the maesters killed the dragons

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.210
– the dragons clearly died in this huge
civil war . Maybe Marwyn means that the maesters

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.030
killed off these last few dragons somehow
– it has been suggested that they might

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.220
have been poisoned, because they were stunted
and small . In fact, the dragons had been

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.630
getting smaller for years – none ever grew
as large as the original three that Aegon

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.979
the Conqueror brought from Valyria . The maesters
say that the reason the dragons don’t grow

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.250
so large is because the Targaryens started
keeping them in an enclosure in King’s Landing

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.860
called the Dragonpit – though Daenerys’
dragons still seem to grow fine when they’re

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.780
kept chained up, so maybe that’s not true.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.910
Either way, it does seem possible that the
maesters might have poisoned the last dragon

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.990
hatchlings, or stunted the dragons’ growth
somehow, but there’s no evidence for any

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.310
of it and besides that’s hardly “kill[ing]
all the dragons”, is it?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.800
What killed the dragons was the war, the Dance
of the Dragons , so maybe what Marwyn means

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.490
is that the maesters caused that war, like
how Lady Dustin claims that the maesters helped

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.620
cause Robert’s Rebellion.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.250
We learn about the origins of the Dance of
the Dragons in the Princess and the Queen

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.690
and Rogue Prince novellas, as well as The
World of Ice and Fire, and in these texts,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.800
it… doesn’t look like the maesters were
involved in the start of the war.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.830
In fact, both Grand Maester Orwyle and Grand
Maester Runciter try to prevent the war from

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.669
starting , and Maester Norren helps a dragon
and its rider flee the war . If you want to

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:19.510
get a bit paranoid you could point out that,
in-universe, these texts are written by maesters

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.590
, who may have covered up their own involvement
in the war.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.889
It’s possible, maybe, but we are told that
a septon and a court jester also contributed

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.680
to these accounts , making a maester cover-up
seem less likely.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.630
So, there’s no clear evidence that the maesters
were involved in causing the war, but we do

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.539
know that the Hightowers were.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.910
Queen Alicent Hightower, who had married King
Viserys Targaryen, wanted her son Aegon to

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:51.080
inherit the throne, even though the king himself
wanted Rhaenyra, his daughter by his first

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.520
wife, to inherit the throne.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.640
That’s basically the conflict that led to
the Dance – and the deaths – of the Dragons

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.850
– and it was, in large part, caused by House
Hightower, the same house that that Lady Dustin

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.720
says was connected to the maester who helped
cause Robert’s Rebellion, and the same house

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.279
that’s known to closely support the maesters
. It doesn’t seem likely that the Hightowers

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:13.910
were conspiring with the maesters against
the Targaryens, because the Hightowers have

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.320
actually been very loyal to the Targaryens
, but it might be that the maesters manipulated

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.010
the Hightowers into starting the Dance of
the Dragons in the same way that the maesters

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.529
apparently manipulated the Starks to rebel
against the Targaryens.

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:30.680
So – we still have no hard evidence, but
it does seem very possible that the maesters

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.800
were behind both the Dance of the Dragons
and Robert’s Rebellion – the wars that

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.279
killed the dragons and overthrew the Targaryens.

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:42.610
Let’s look at the other part of Marwyn’s
claim – he says the maesters are building

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:48.630
a world without “sorcery or prophecy or
glass candles” – a world without magic.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.710
This is an interesting thing because, apparently,
at least until recently, magic has been in

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.260
decline in Westeros.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.221
Daenerys says that “Magic had died in the
west when the Doom fell on Valyria” . The

00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:04.620
Doom of Valyria was centuries ago, and happened
very far away, so the maesters probably weren’t

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.740
involved – though the Faceless Men might
have been . The point is that now it seems

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.170
that the maesters believe that magic’s no
longer a thing.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.880
Maester Luwin says that “magic does not
work” . “Perhaps magic was once a mighty

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.279
force in the world, but no longer” . This
view seems to be shared by most other maesters

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:24.300
. At the Citadel, part of a maester’s training
involves spending a night in a darkened room

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.550
with a candle made of obsidian, or dragonglass.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.450
Lighting a glass candle apparently requires
magic, and the whole point of this procedure

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.170
is to show maesters that magic doesn’t work
. So what’s the sense in the maesters having

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.380
a conspiracy against magic, if the maesters
believe there is no magic any more?

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.120
Maybe the maesters have realised the same
thing that Quaithe and Marwyn have realised

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.760
– that “glass candles are burning” – magic
is returning.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.010
New dragons have been born, the Others have
returned, Melisandre’s magic grows stronger

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.240
and resurrections are happening left, right
and centre . Leo Tyrell says “Old powers

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
waken.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240
Shadows stir.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.970
An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon
us, an age for gods and heroes”.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.060
That does not sound like something the maesters
would want to happen, so maybe they are trying

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.060
to stop it.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.290
It’s not clear how they would do that, though.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:18.010
It’s not like they’re covering up the
existence of magic – they openly discuss

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.440
it in their books , and they have an official
position on their Conclave for an archmaester

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.480
who’s an expert on magic.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.399
So while it makes sense that the maesters
might oppose magic, it’s not clear how they

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:31.580
do would it.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:37.410
So a big maester conspiracy against Targaryens
and dragons and magic is looking possible,

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.120
but we still have zero solid evidence that
one exists.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.490
Let’s try to find some by having a look
at some individual maesters – Pycelle and

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.490
Cressen.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.720
Pycelle is the Grand Maester – he directly
advises the king of Westeros, so he’s one

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.740
of, if not the, most powerful maesters.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.709
If there is a maester conspiracy, Pycelle
would surely be a part of it.

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:02.620
And Pycelle has done a lot to undermine the
Targaryens.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.000
In Book 1, when the small council discusses
what to do about Daenerys, Pycelle advocates

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.029
assassinating her – though, most of the
rest of the council does too, so that might

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:12.029
not mean much.

00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:16.910
But there’s a bigger thing – during Robert's
Rebellion, Pycelle convinced the Mad King

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:21.460
to open his gates to Tywin Lannister's army
– which led to the Sack of King's Landing

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.110
, the death of King Aerys, and the end of
the line of Targaryen kings.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.540
Maybe Pycelle did these things as part of
the maesters' conspiracy against the Targaryens.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.730
But, a couple of times, Pycelle gets really
sharply interrogated – by Tyrion, then by

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.680
Cersei – and in these scenes, Pycelle totally
breaks down, he’s weeping and whimpering

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.000
on the floor, and he reveals his true motivation
– which turns out to be not a conspiracy

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.339
against Targaryens, but a massive man-crush
on Tywin Lannister.

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:55.110
Pycelle says he’s Tywin’s man , that he
hoped Tywin would become king , that “All

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.790
[he] did, [he] did for House Lannister”
. In The World of Ice and Fire, Pycelle says

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.610
“The gods made and shaped [Tywin] to rule”
, he goes on about “the man beneath the

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:11.150
armor” . It was loyalty to Lannister, not
a conspiracy against Targaryen, that led Pycelle

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.830
to bring about the Mad King’s downfall.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:18.630
Of course, you could claim that this seemingly
doddery old man is actually a master of deception

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.220
and is hiding his true involvement in a conspiracy
– we couldn’t rule him out unless we could

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:30.209
really see what he was thinking – fortunately,
we get to do exactly that in the case of Cressen.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:34.380
Maester Cressen serves Stannis Baratheon at
Dragonstone.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.800
And in the Prologue of Clash, Cressen tries
to kill the “red witch” Melisandre – which

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.330
looks exactly like the sort of thing that
someone would do if they were part of a conspiracy

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.149
against magic.

00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:47.899
The chapter is written from Cressen’s point
of view – so we get to see all the maester’s

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.880
thoughts that lead to his decision.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.420
And opposition to magic and superstition is
part of Cressen motivation – a sort of ideological

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.790
battle goes on between Melisandre’s magic,
and Cressen’s denial of it . But that’s

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.830
not the main issue here – Cressen’s does
have his doubts about magic and there’s

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.959
certainly no mention of any conspiracy.

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:12.269
Cressen’s main motivation is that he wants
to protect Stannis.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:16.980
Cressen loves Stannis, thinks of him as the
“son [he] never had” , and he feels Melisandre

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.860
is leading Stannis astray by convincing him
to kill his brother , and to sail to war without

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.970
having allies . So while magic is part of
the issue here, the main reason Cressen tries

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.269
to kill Mel is not a maester conspiracy against
magic but a fatherly love for Stannis .

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:35.260
So.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
Where does this leave us?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.839
The maesters could have a lot of influence
on the politics of Westeros.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:45.170
They may have good reasons to oppose Targaryens,
dragons and magic.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.390
Lady Dustin suggests that a maester was involved
in the in the plot to overthrow the Targaryens,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.200
though we don’t really know what happened
there.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.089
Marwyn the Mage claims that the maesters killed
off the dragons, which they might have done

00:14:56.089 --> 00:15:00.760
indirectly by manipulating the Hightowers
to start the Dance, or by maybe by poisoning

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.600
the last few dragons, but we really don’t
have any proof.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.600
Grand Maester Pycelle and Maester Cressen
make moves against Targaryens and magic-users,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.410
but those acts don’t seem to be related
to a conspiracy.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:19.590
So given the complete lack of evidence, a
big conspiracy involving many maesters seems

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.590
unlikely.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:25.700
Marwyn’s claims are probably exaggerated
– in fact, he might have an ulterior motive

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.830
for scaring off Sam from telling the Citadel
about Daenerys.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.860
However, it’s very easy to believe that
at least some of the archmaesters of the Citadel

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.740
strongly distrust Targaryens, dragons and
magic, and might occasionally pull some strings

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.730
to oppose those things.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.040
So the bottom line is that there’s probably
some sneaky shit going on, we just don’t

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.800
know how much.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.800
The good news is that we’ll probably find
out more in the next book – right now, many

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.230
awesome characters are converging on the Citadel
– Sam Tarly has been sent to study and earn

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.500
the maester’s chain, Jaqen H’ghar has
come in disguise and acquired a key said to

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.850
unlock every door in the Citadel, Oberyn Martell’s
bastard daughter Sarella has come in disguise

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:10.440
as the acolyte Alleras, and Euron Greyjoy's
ironborn have started raiding around Oldtown.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.889
There are a lotta disguises going on, lotta
intrigue, lotta mystery – it’s gonna be

00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:21.180
a lot of fun seeing how it all turns out – and
what it might reveal about the maesters.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.630
Thanks for watching – feel free to comment
about what you think the maesters are up to.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.440
Thanks also to Ertaç Altınöz, who kindly
helped out with some imagery for the video.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.399
He has some really awesome art based on Game
of Thrones theories and stuff, so you should

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:36.600
definitely check out his DeviantArt – there’s
a link in the description.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:43.029
Finally, thank you to the Patrons, including
NickHurley, Derek Wing, adc400 and Alice Cottrell,

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:46.930
who made it possible for Alt Shift X to go
full-time this year.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.990
Thanks to your support, we’re already using
better, faster software and hardware, and

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.070
are aiming to release at least two or three
videos per month, hopefully more – so with

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.420
a new Game of Thrones season coming out in
April, 2016 is gonna be big.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.260
So happy new year, and see you next time.
