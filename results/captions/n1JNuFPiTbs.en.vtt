BEN ANDERSON: We think it might
be, but that happened

they do in the break in the

stoned on opium, or are they

or pot, or?

BEN ANDERSON: They smoke
a lot of hash.

We don't know if it was
hash or opium, but it

back in front of our advance,

are doing now is

they'll shoot a couple shots,
get the ANA guys to go crazy,

their guns off.

retreat to get more bullets,

00:07:24.203 --> 00:07:25.985
had been dropped
via helicopter.

00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:28.520
So it was all quiet as they went
out to pick up the water.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.290
And then suddenly all hell
breaks loose from 360 degrees.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.000
And we know there are guys out
there, picking up this water.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.340
MALE SPEAKER: So we're
short of water.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.986
Short of batteries.

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:39.660
Plenty of ammunition.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.370
And plenty of Taliban.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.860
So yeah.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.470
All in all, good going,
apart from the water.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.590
BEN ANDERSON: Seven guys
collapsed by the end of this

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.680
day, and some of them were in
life-threatening conditions.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.000
I saw one guy actually collapse,
and I thought it was

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.520
trauma or shell shock or
something, because I've never

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.420
seen a guy--

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.400
I mean, he took his top off.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.875
He tried to fight his friends,
who were going to

00:07:57.875 --> 00:07:58.520
pour water on him.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.940
He collapsed like a boxer who
has been knocked out.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.100
I didn't realize that heat
exhaustion can be that bad.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.120
And plus, these guys are
soldiers, so they're going to

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.410
deny it to the last minute.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.260
They're going to pretend they're
OK, and struggle on

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.880
through until the very
last minute, when

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.470
it's almost too late.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.150
Despite what's happened, the
day is far from over.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.230
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
far from over.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.500
This is just the beginning.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.732
This is just the beginning
of a very busy day.

00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:23.080
Probably a couple of days,
if not a week.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.730
BEN ANDERSON: Eventually the
Taliban withdrew, and we just

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.430
walked away.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.620
I don't know if they ran out
of ammunition or something.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.320
They packed up and left,
and it stayed quiet.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.270
And within a very short time of
leaving that compound, we

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.190
heard over the radios that the
Taliban had retaken all of

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.559
those buildings that had
been fought for.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.980
MALE SPEAKER: I believe we're
going to go north, go firm,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.858
put a defensive position in.

00:08:51.858 --> 00:08:54.740
And then we'll have a nice
quiet night in the valley

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.022
tonight, by the look of it.

00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:57.410
Not.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.610
BEN ANDERSON: If this small area
of the valley takes this

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.260
much of a fight to clear, how
much is the whole province

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.480
going to take?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.540
MALE SPEAKER: Well, the country
being like it is-- and

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.890
it's classic hit-and-run
country.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.780
It's like Normandy, hedgerows,
ditches,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.150
plowed fields, compounds.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.190
And these guys, they've got all
the time in the world to

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.410
set up what they want to set up,
and where they want to be.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.960
Whereas we've got to advance
into them to flush them out.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.985
So the whole province?

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:25.190
Oh, I don't get paid enough
to tell you that one.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.040
I don't know.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.207
I'm not going to guess.

00:09:27.207 --> 00:09:28.520
BEN ANDERSON: How old are you?

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.530
MALE SPEAKER: 41 years old.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.823
And I was supposed to leave
the army this year.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:37.430
And I was graciously offered two
more years, and I took it.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.030
BEN ANDERSON: Is this
your last tour?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.860
MALE SPEAKER: Probably
yes, he says.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.032
But I did say that last year in
Iraq, that that was going

00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:45.675
to be my last tour.

00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:47.300
And obviously it's not,
so we'll see.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.330
We'll see what happens.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.630
MALE SPEAKER: Probably the
biggest I've had in my career

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.070
since I've been in, mate,
in terms of contacts.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.910
I've been going since
0300 this morning.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.010
It's now 10 past 4:00 in the
afternoon, 1610 hours.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.450
So it's been quite a long day.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.145
It's not over yet.

00:10:07.145 --> 00:10:09.910
We've still got to move off
to our next location, and

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.450
meet up with WFR.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.120
And then we'll see how
we get from there.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.750
But the boys have worked their
nuts off, as usual.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.200
So have the ANA.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.070
Everyone's worked really hard.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.080
BEN ANDERSON: So when he says,
that's the most intense day

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.140
I've ever had as a soldier,
he's done tours of Iraq,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.310
Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern
Ireland, Afghanistan.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.430
That's not said lightly
when he says that.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.920
SHANE SMITH: Right.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.260
So Afghanistan has the
fiercest fighting in

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.390
the world right now.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:34.620
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.590
I mean, the historians and
these guys, they're all

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.380
saying, the most ferocious
fighting since the Korean War.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:40.990
MALE SPEAKER: Lucky today.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.282
We seemed to be near cover every
time it come, didn't we?

00:10:43.282 --> 00:10:45.631
We're lucky.

00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.886
I'm surprised no one's
a casualty today.

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:48.890
BEN ANDERSON: Is it manpower?

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.505
The reason you can't--

00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:50.330
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's manpower.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.900
We haven't got the manpower.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.160
There's not enough
people out here.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.680
Now, they're out to fight.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.655
And it's very rare that
you see them.

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:59.020
But most people here ain't
even seen a Taliban yet.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.320
SHANE SMITH: So they can fight
the Taliban all day for 12

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.250
hours, and they'll have
never have seen them.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.610
BEN ANDERSON: You might
see a bit of movement.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.060
You might see a flash
of light from where

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.210
they're firing from.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.030
That's it.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.920
And they probably have seen lots
of Taliban when they're

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.840
not fighting.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.550
SHANE SMITH: They just
don't know it.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.170
BEN ANDERSON: They're in the
villages and the towns.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.370
But how do you know?

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.490
MALE SPEAKER: As soon as it
starts getting a bit rough,

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.460
and it looks they're going to
get it, they'll fucking pick a

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.840
pitchfork up, and they're
Farmer Joe for the day.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.670
If someone's coming towards
me on the same path,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.102
I'll cross the path.

00:11:24.102 --> 00:11:26.340
I don't want them to get
nowhere near me.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.950
I want to go home.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.830
They're the kind of people that
believe when they die,

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.940
they're going to wake
up with 27 virgins.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.763
So how can you fight against
someone like that, who doesn't

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.456
give a shit?

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.722
It's like as soon as
I die, I'll be

00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:40.150
going back to Tottenham.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.890
I'll fucking run
at the bullets.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.400
BEN ANDERSON: And you regularly
see guys that are

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.880
just dumbfounded.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.780
Like, how can you fight
against someone

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.160
who wants to die?

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.780
Who thinks that dying is an end,
dying is a route to some

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.450
kind of paradise?

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.810
SHANE SMITH: So who is going
to win that fight?

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.300
BEN ANDERSON: People regularly
talk about how the Americans

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.130
and British always beat
the Taliban when they

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.240
meet them in a fight.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.060
That doesn't mean the Taliban
are ever going to give up.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.020
That's the follow-up point that
most people seem to miss.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:04.650
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we'll
come straight

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.390
back today or tomorrow.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.525
But the thing is, because we've
left it, we'll have to

00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:08.310
fucking start again.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.696
So that is just pointless,
isn't it?

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.290
I mean, we don't know what
we're doing now.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.650
That's the hardest
bit, not knowing.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.360
SHANE SMITH: You
went in there.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.100
You fought all day.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.340
You got surrounded.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.185
People are dropping like flies
from heat exhaustion.

00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:24.210
You nearly got bombed by your
own guys three times.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.910
And then you had to leave, so
the Taliban just went in.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.310
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.650
He said we haven't got the
manpower to hold on to land.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.105
And it's the same thing with
the border with Pakistan.

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:34.030
They just haven't got the
manpower to either hold on to

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.540
land or patrol borders
properly.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.390
SHANE SMITH: So it's
all for nothing.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.585
BEN ANDERSON: With existing
levels of troops, yeah.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.390
MALE SPEAKER: I'd say yesterday
was probably the

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.980
hardest day I've had in
17 years' service.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.120
And I think all of the others
who fought in it yesterday

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.420
would probably agree.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.970
It was eight hours of
unrelenting combat against a

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:10.340
canny, wily, determined enemy,
who was prepared to

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.880
fight to the death.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.230
It's extremely difficult in
the Green Zone to maneuver

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.990
your forces.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.470
BEN ANDERSON: Is there a danger
that by flattening

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.090
compounds--

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.890
and obviously civilians are
going to get caught up in the

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.540
compounds from time to time--

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.230
that you could lose
the support of the

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.900
population here entirely?

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.430
That they could either become
indifferent to you being here,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.350
or worse, supporters and
helpers of the Taliban?

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.690
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a fine line.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.770
I think if we were completely
indiscriminate in our fires,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.830
then yes, we could lose
support quite quickly.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.760
As it happens, yesterday there
was an attack aviation strike

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.230
on a compound which had
civilians and my men in it.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.310
I was fortunate that none
of them were injured.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.590
It was me.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.660
I directed that attack.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.100
I gave clearance
for it to fire.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.350
And the responsibility for
it lies on my shoulders.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.930
In this instance, I'm extremely
lucky that there

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.795
were no casualties, either
friendly or civilian.

00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:27.520
SHANE SMITH: What do you think
is happening in Afghanistan?

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.980
BEN ANDERSON: I think
that is happening on

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.690
a much wider scale.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.520
There's no evidence that the
Taliban are even thinking

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.240
about giving up.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.400
There's no evidence that a
military solution is possible.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.625
And there's no evidence that the
Brits or the Americans or

00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:43.280
anyone can control anything
apart from these isolated

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.030
bases and towns.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.290
So the Taliban have complete
free rein, especially over the

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.620
south of Afghanistan.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.810
SHANE SMITH: So we went in
to kick the Taliban out.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.810
The Taliban are getting
stronger and stronger.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.125
There's more drugs coming
out than ever before.

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:55.530
Why are we there?

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.530
BEN ANDERSON: The most
discouraging thing I've seen

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.730
or heard from Afghanistan
recently is when I was there,

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.150
one town was left that was under
control of the Taliban.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.350
That was taken just
after I left.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.090
They put in charge a
guy who's Taliban.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.170
He soon described himself
as good Taliban.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.130
Yeah, that makes you think, why
have we been fighting and

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.710
losing people for six years,
when we could have done

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.970
exactly the same deal
that we've done

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.430
today, six years ago?

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:28.330
