00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:09.509
Welcome to the home of towers and Smythe consulting the corporate scumbags hired by the bigger corporate scumbags in the landmark Neville Reid case

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.529
GSE is a firm fueled by greed duplicity and moral decay a place that ironically squeeze their job applicants for honesty

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.529
loyalty and integrity

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.640
Qualities I had in spades when I was fresh-faced and ready to take on the world my first day here

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.008
And here's me six months later

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.049
Late nights, no respect at the bank coffee all the shit that comes to paying your dues

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.850
But none of it could slow me down

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.850
I was striving for the success my family never had a seat at the big kids table with all the fixin's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.790
all while paying back those goddamn student loans

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.110
But the higher, I rose the more

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.129
I felt like I was losing myself in the process and after discovering that loophole that won. The reed case the requisite promotion quickly followed

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.109
But by then it didn't matter that I thought he was guilty as fuck. I just wanted the corner office

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.170
And for my sins they gave me more

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360
What a dick

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.519

Would you be open to discussing the possibility of deed-in-lieu?

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.789
Mm-hmm you don't know what I'm talking about do you?

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.819
You should see a lawyer. I am a lawyer if you were a lawyer you would know what a deed in Lewes

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.100
You're one of the borrower's aren't you?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.679
So what's the deed in lieu it doesn't matter bank wouldn't agree to it anyway

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.030
Look you're not the first borrower. I pull this kind of scam

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.449
This this is a non-smoking room

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.170
So come stop be sued

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.649
Wait

We just need two more months

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:06.529
Families are involved here, but nobody listens. Not the banks not the lawyers I

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:09.558
Can't get past their damn secretaries

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:13.279
Look I am very sorry. This is happening to you

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:18.889
They don't kick me out the bank is kicking you out the bank is your client. It's the firm's client the firm's partners

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.889
Call the shots

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:28.428
No one raindrop thinks it calls the flood my mother used to say that

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.259
Now I understand what it means

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:40.189
Is there anything else I can do to help you can start by telling me the partner calling the shots on the case sure

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.279
That would be

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.339
Irene Smythe well, I want a word with this Irene Smythe or whoever right now sure you get her on the phone

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.940

Cara Powell Director of Operations

Not effective for client matters, but with all things related to navigating internal company politics. She's fuckin Mussolini

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.140
He called her his siren

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.660
She's got the bosses here

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.569
And her songs are sweet poisoning

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.670
Mr.. Joe

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.530
To see Cara Powell

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.249

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.030

What could I do for you? It's nice mug?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.530
Where'd you get it? I told my assistant to get me one and where did she get it Mac

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.709
Derrick here wants to know where you got the mug

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.010
You're my kitchen downstairs

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.509
Okay, and why did you choose that one because the other ones are filthy?

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.049
And why do you think this one wasn't because the maid cleaned it?

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.830
Incorrect I clean this mug because this mug is mine, and what's mine is mine, and what's yours is yours?

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.409
You're getting to a point Vanda Corp is your client that bloods on your hands oh?

Well, so now you want to share. I can't share what is it mine?

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.859
Vanda Corp has fought more than 100 account cases through us in the last two years well

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.979
Then I hope they have a good case manager you mean managers

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:27.080
No one can work a client that big without delegating and according to the annual work distribution sheets that hasn't been updated in years

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.229
one of Fanta crops complaint cases was assigned

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.700
To you

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:38.259
5:45 egg

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.740
Plead guilty not guilty

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.539
The corpse was found inside your harness you exactly would have find it

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.629
Do you want to take this upstairs great idea?

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:10.569
Take your file

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:20.078
Want to swipe your keycard or should I swipe mine oh, oh I'm sorry I forgot you don't have clearance

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.390
Don't you worry little one

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.299
Daddy will pay for abandoning you and leaving you to die and that cold dirty dumpster

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.310
No, you died when you drowned because mommy left you in the bathtub while she went shopping for shoes

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.770
But don't worry daddy will make her pay

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.849
Too bad mommy outranks daddy mommy's a backstabbing bitch. That's why mommy outranks daddy

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.180
Right now what's his mood? He's drying, Shh

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:57.258
John towers capital t and t SC

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:04.099
King of the castle top of the food chain and total fuckin maniac you know your typical American success story

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.670
Did I mention that he also dabbles in the fine arts?

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.770
Tell me what you see here I

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.359
See that those soldiers lives are in danger sir do you think they'll make it no sir the fuse is too short

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.680
It's too late to run and what do you think they should be doing instead may I sir

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.700
So simple and yet so effective

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.780
Can you see it Derek? Can you see the solution to our problem here?

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.629
I think you mean her problem because she was the one that

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.160
You made the file

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.689
This is our bomb the fuse is already burning

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.039
So should we run like cowards and die we are brave sir? I'm so glad you said that

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.400
Because any second now Vanda Corp is gonna find out about this mess and I'm gonna need some scouts

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.110
so

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:14.400
Who dropped the ball I hate pointing fingers, but may I suggest you check the annual work distribution sheet

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160
someone cooked the fucking worksheet

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.580
sir

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.650
Go on

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:29.710
Have you noticed that whenever there is a problem like this? It's almost always the same soldier involved

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.999
because down in the trenches we have all noticed and

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.910
we wonder if

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.489
Discharging this problem soldier might be the solution to preventing this kind of mess from ever happening again

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.450
And who would that be

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:10.609
Thank You Derek you can leave, let's discuss yes, sir I leave

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.560
Got a sec

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.289
Nothing like a little power meditation this one's new

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.830
Declan's walking already wobbling actually like you were last Friday night

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.799
Thanks for the ride by the way, thanks for puking in my car. It's what friends are for

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:09.929
So debrief me what happened. I just found someone else's shit swept under my carpet. What kind of shit

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.940
bender corporal shit

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.859
It's a seven-figure mistake. I didn't even touch the file don't sweat it

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:25.229
Those clowns working Vanda corpora bunch of serial screw-ups look. I realize you might not want to divulge siren

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.570
All right, let's take a big distraction

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.099
You could possibly be in charge of a case that big, but not big enough to be untouchable

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.620
That's why she shows you you're the perfect fall guy so before even taking this upstairs

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.860
You already took this upstairs and made a mess of things

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.720
But say I punch a rhino in the face, would you call that brave or stupid?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.640
brave

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.160
And stupid she can't bravery and stupidity can overlap

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.890
That you understand that let me give her a call see if I can't find a way to cut you yeah

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.540
She already offered me a deal. I told her it has suck it and that this is war

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.200
War is over one come on Ankara

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:25.080
Oh, so natural selection happened pack your shit boxes are on a second

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.230
Kidding me Derek calm down

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.180
Your blue didn't you?

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.180
Like I need to stoop to that level

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.910
now

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:43.439
Get the fuck out of my face, I'm taking this to the line sure good luck with that and

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160
When we move back

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.910
The nine the company's board of directors

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.709
Good morning. Everybody. This is the Van de Corp file

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.840
No one here goes up or down without their vote rumor has it that they're actually cybernetic organisms

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.419
But that hasn't been officially confirmed yet now

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:10.680
There's a common misconception about the death district during gladiatorial combat the actual phrase used in rolling text doesn't translate his thumbs down

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:18.539
But rather thumbs turned personally. I think we should hang draw and quarter the little fucker but uh you know that's just me

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:26.669
So let's vote that's because the victors finished off their opponents with the sword thrust across the throat so it's unanimous. Oh

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:29.260
Lester

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.479

He takes care of the firm's layoffs he's as cold as his methods are fishing a perfect fit here

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.710
Naturally, we call him the Reaper

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.820
And he's the last person you want to see standing in your doorway

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.790
Mind if I come in Derek

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.070

Do you even know what happened hmm, I don't care what happened you must be good friends don't care of that I

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.900
Hope she dies

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.680
promptly

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.529

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.230

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.379
Sign these documents from upstairs so I can clear accounting to transfer your severance pay into your account

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.070
You know what this is this is a statement?

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:08.059
Saying that I take full responsibility over the vendor Corvis. I will have to file that under end for not my problem

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.060
I could be disbarred I

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.560
Could face legal action from the client

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:19.249
I'm just the messenger Derek yelling at me is like yelling at your watch because you're late. Why would I sign this crap?

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.390
To get rich

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.129
Glad to see we're now on the same page I

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.080
Can see I'm not

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.480
You want to do this the hard way I want to do this the right way I

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:50.100
Want to speak with him in the nine executive decisions are not subject to appeal this one fucking better be

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.100
Because I'm not leaving this building until I plead my case

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.160
understood

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:26.628
Hell is going on one of our pathogen snipers in the building's ventilation

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:30.169
system picked up traces of the ID 7 virus and who

00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:34.189
Authorized you to install a sniffer in my building anyway since the outbreak in Des Moines

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:39.499
Detection devices are now legally required in public places des moines fucked

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:45.498
According to our projections those infected in the building will begin to display symptoms soon, if not already

00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:54.378
Our experts have already released a neutralizer into your ventilation system all traces of the virus should be eliminated in

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.759
Approximately eight hours until then this building is officially under quarantine

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:02.629
So what are we supposed to do for the next eight hours try to remain calm, so?

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:10.279
There I was getting the shit kicked out of me on the lobby floor by this asshole and then something

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.630
I don't want to remain calm. I want this fixed

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:50.669
This incense it's all bullshit you think I like to taste the kale come on

00:22:58.299 --> 00:23:06.238
Just just leave that in your office until the virus subsides and walk out those doors, and don't you back free as a bird

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.059
We crash out what do you say?

00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:28.029
Until the quarantine is over. We'll need your cooperation to keep the situation under control

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.569
We know better than anyone else that this virus

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:38.770
Turns people into main acts of blathering idiots as you may know the virus trigger is a breakdown of moral barriers

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.699
unleashing repressed emotions in the infected including anger depression

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:51.309
fear blast what guilt gain an infected individual would make a coke addict look like a model citizen by comparison we

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.070
Still feel normal the virus can cause

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.990
drastic mood swings with potentially violent and severe consequences

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.280
It would be best if stressful work-related situations were avoided

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.670
Antidepressants stimulants even caffeine can accelerate the virus's effect

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.010
So what happens when

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.220
287 employees

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.799
with average billing rates of

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.559
$200 an hour start working for 8 hours

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.490
You don't know I

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.079
Lose half a million dollars not crack your whips

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.120
Everybody goes back to work, and if they don't like it. They are terminated immediately

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.479
And no severance packages, but the fear of me in them

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.650
What now?

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:09.929
Derek show ones clearance to come up before he that he reconsidered, but he wants to have a word with you and the nine first

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:16.119
Your password is a star 1 9 9 fucking

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.320
Colten Schneider

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.519
Aka the bull the boss is unofficial left hook

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:55.470
Nobody knows his exact job description, but whenever there's a hint of something dirty going on Viktor Foley there he is

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet again

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.990
things came up

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:19.410
You know how it is now. I know what you're thinking. Never read. He got away with murder

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.410
Maybe I can have a little fun here

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.520
Did you really think?

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.560
That I didn't see that coming

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.940
that's

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.330
just bad for my job back, but I

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.120
like their idea, too

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:45.329
Sounds like it hurt is he hurt. Yes sir, no sir

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.719
They say the femur is the most difficult bone in the body to break, but I'll settle for a pinkie

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:15.399
What's happening

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.619
Tell me what the fuck is going on in there

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.900
You killed you and

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.830
spinet accident

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:08.110
Do you have any idea how many billable hours? I'm gonna lose until I find a replacement

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.800
I'm worried about the body right now. I killed it

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:20.439
The virus killed him you're infected you have impunity we have a president in Neville Reed

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.050
They get back up here

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.970
You

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.290
What are you doing here they fired me

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.009
Justice is served for once buta here security called the cops

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.819
But this place was quarantine before they could show up so they threw me in this hellhole

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.640
I'm suing everyone and their grandmother

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:48.599
Paris weird good luck. It's id7. No one's liable for anything that they do

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.380
Just like any other day for you

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.990
Okay Brian Smith the woman that fucking screwed you

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720
She's in the building's penthouses right now

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.330
So what?

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.350
She's all yours

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:22.290
This is our shot to hold these assholes accountable for all the fucking damage that they've done

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.619
And our chance goes away the suit is this quarantine is over

00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:28.919
Yeah

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:36.029
Can I get up now are you gonna stop being an asset it's debatable yes, yes

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.210
Yeah

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:04.679
Yeah, I

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:12.360
Don't think they'd lock us up in a room with working phones don't need a working fuck this

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.130
Though the francophone call who cops can't enter the building

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400
They're calling the cops

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:27.449
Derek chose somehow managed to set up a call with Vander Court CEO, and they wanted you to join in

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:39.119
Sorry to keep you waiting Frank, I'm all ears Oh glad you could join us John

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.460
Yes

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.770
Sir. Yeah, I am still here God John. Can you please remind me?

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.569
Why do I do business with TSE well because it's a jungle out there Frank

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.909
And not only do you need a guide, but you also need a lion walking right by your side

00:32:00.309 --> 00:32:04.379
And we are your lion, and your guide are you?

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:07.648
We're just a touch concern that you may have

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.350
ulterior motives

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.469
We would never turn against our clients brain

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:21.028
Oh that may be true, but derek has alerted me to a certain document that seems to suggest otherwise

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:25.229
It's a report that a TSE different vendor Corp

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:32.819
It analyzes the advisability of finally a multi-million dollar lawsuit against one of Rick's ex business associates. Do you remember this report John?

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:38.759
No, I must say. It's well written. I like how it weighs the

00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:42.869
slim possibility of a positive financial

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:45.419
outcome against the

00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:50.889
Enormous potential litigation costs do you agree with this report Dirk?

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:52.779
No, sir

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:56.919
I do not I believe you could have won the suit then why that your

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.730
Advisers advised me against it your advisors missed the deadline to file the motion so you believe that

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.220
TSE dropped the ball on this one

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.580
I believe they dropped the ball sir

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.549
but then they also

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:13.119
Defecated on the ball and then sodomized

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:22.899
Interesting oh, and John I just happen to have your last invoice here with me

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:33.399
No, I will I

00:33:35.929 --> 00:33:41.138
Will chair up the fucking phone out of his hands his hands off his fucking body now

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:54.520
Yeah, can I please order two pepperoni pizzas and some hot wings yeah, why not throw some garlic bread in there ah

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.070
Do you guys want?

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.600
This fucking phone doesn't work

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.480
Yeah

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:35.539
Christ man fuck your girl, too

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:41.419
Damn suit, you don't even respect each other all right

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.250
You don't

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.179
Know what

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.770
And they better work

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.500
Fuck yeah

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.910
shit

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.910
Started a countdown for the quarantine

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.240
Posting an interoffice app enough time to get the job done

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.459
I mean this place is nothing how the boss is a fucking raging cokehead. There's definitely gonna be more guards fine

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.240
I'll bring more nails only way to the top floors with a keycard or one-time password

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.750
So who do we have to fuck up to get the card you're first?

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.379
There's an asshead on the sixth floor who's got a level 2 keycard

00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:52.209
It can take us to the 7th floor giving us access to the bitch who's got a level 3 key card

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.830
Hey extreme measures, right

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:48.140
Wednesday's back. Yeah yup

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.420
Bang

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:09.159
Really bothers me that women don't get the same treatment as men in the workplace

00:38:11.269 --> 00:38:13.719
I'm all about gender equality here

00:38:54.819 --> 00:39:01.528
Your head I don't need your help suit, but I need yours fuck you fuck you do

00:39:07.509 --> 00:39:14.969
We come in and if I said, no, you'll have to confer with my associate and my gimpy

00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:22.900
What do you want?

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:28.829
Keycard, I'm not the only one with a level two key card. You are the one that fired me

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.259
It's all wrong the firm fired. You don't nail gun the messenger oh

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.759
oh

00:39:36.759 --> 00:39:38.759
my god

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:40.829
You bring up a very good point

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:48.089
I'm so sorry. Let's alright. We're good. We're totally good. Man. I will take it up with the firm

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:52.048
But I would love to know where I could find the firm

00:39:52.809 --> 00:39:59.699
Because I would love to kick the firm's ass you can't kick a firm's ass

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.670
That's the point oh

00:40:03.009 --> 00:40:05.009
Well then that brings us

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.890
back to you

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.730
I was just doing my job

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.699
No one raindrop thinks it caused the flood I

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.200
Get what that means?

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.590
You know what will happen to me if I give you this key card. I'm gonna have to file that under n

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.070

Here take my phone I need you to film some film what?

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:21.319
Case file three two or three seven six the People vs Reed

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:29.029
Now you all know the court case, but let's discuss mr.. Neville read the man shall we by all accounts

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.449
Mr.. Reed was an upstanding pillar of the community

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.049
Earned two masters degrees by the age of twenty one

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:43.189
Married his college sweetheart, and is a father of beautiful twin girls, but the mystery

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.040
contracted the ID 7 virus

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.590
Shit got real

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:54.680
Overwhelmed by pure in Neville Reed became prone to involuntary

00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.229
Aberrant and shocking impulses. He committed a gruesome

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.590
unspeakable act in broad daylight in a room full of witnesses

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:13.070
Now we're witnessing a model citizen here

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.430
transformed into a brutal

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.909
Killing machine at the blink of an infected eye

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:29.929
So I ask you this is it his fault, or is it the viruses?

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.780
He has got Lester's keycard. Oh really that's a shame a real shame sir

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.890
Just wondering did they get it before or after butchering?

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.630
Just calm down

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:11.329
And come up here. They're guarding the private elevator. I can't leave the office then destroy the car. It's my only leverage

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.520
car I

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.939
Promise you I will do everything in my power to ensure. He doesn't get to you, but if he does

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:26.659
You must protect those above you fuck those above me. I'll give you the race who always wanted fuck your eyes

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.019
I'll make you partner fuck you

00:44:31.239 --> 00:44:32.410

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.410
I'll throw it out the window

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:36.869
Thank you

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.430
Matt

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:57.909
Hide this somewhere safe and don't tell me where and make more fucking coffee now stupid bitch

00:54:45.579 --> 00:54:47.939
Why would you do that I wonder, huh?

00:54:48.999 --> 00:54:53.009
You're exactly like every other assistant Meg

00:54:53.859 --> 00:54:55.859
You're a a vapid

00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:58.169
bottom-feeding parasitic shithead

00:54:58.809 --> 00:55:04.048
You're a pair of tits with a zero Talent, so tell me Meg

00:55:04.089 --> 00:55:12.058
You incompetent cunt what could possibly possess you to destroy my key card because everyone upstairs knew you would betray them

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:16.228
So they offered me a promotion in exchange for destroying the card

00:55:16.779 --> 00:55:18.549

00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:22.018

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.839
By the way Bank, she's a little crazy

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.200

You're in luck

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.270
This mortgage is part of a bad batch

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:45.050
Original paperwork has filed so many times. It'd be tough to find he could even be lost

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:50.389
So if I ask the bank for the original paperwork you put him in a tough spot

00:57:54.390 --> 00:58:00.230
Or a signature from upstairs could void it completely really

00:58:04.859 --> 00:58:07.609
Yeah, I'm sorry for not

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:11.210

It's okay

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.680
Just don't do it again, I guess

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.820

There must be another way we can get up there now without the keycard

01:01:15.559 --> 01:01:22.779

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.450

Doctor can't do much until you tell him where it hurts my internet is slower than your brain well

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.889
That's a miracle considering the budget that I have four installs and updates

01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:56.869
Shocked and appalled

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.409
But doesn't mean time. Can you do the job? Oh?

01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:03.109
Cool your bloomers all that

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:11.899
Just sent you a patch the patch. It's a file that you install on that thing in front of you called a computer, okay?

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.889

Could have called that final mean Trojan destroy her the ultimate harddrive breakfast, she still would have installed it

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.660
And we're in

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:54.109
Ok so what we're looking at that those are her funds every last one of them even the porn

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.630
Seems she's got a thing for feet

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.530
What do you want? I want you to pretend that that is a peaceful village inhabited by gorgeous virgin maidens

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:06.199
Yeah, yeah yeah, and you're the you know smelly

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.050

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:11.450
You had me a peaceful

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.749
Aren't you ignoramus that patch thing is two-faced my hard drive

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:29.090
Good news is we have a copy of your hard drive in the backup server

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.020
Bad news is that I have it

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:39.620
Worse news is that if you want it. You gotta come down and get it

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.239
What trade the backup copy for my key card

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:52.890
That backup is worth millions to this firm. Are you actually listening to me? I'm meeting him end of story

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:59.250
Oh great. Should I just remove my pants now to make it easier for him when he comes up here to fuck me

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.410
I'm not gonna give him my key card

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.990

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.540
Just a little pro tip

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.640
Employees IQs of this firm are inversely proportionate to their salaries

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.779
So it's probably not a good idea to try to outsmart someone with a smaller paycheck

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560
Card

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:49.500
Now give me the hard drive. I've got my day not yet gotta sign this first

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:54.390
Oh

Well I could final sure then claim temporary insanity and have it dismissed sorry, sweetie

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:10.629
You can always take it to the man upstairs with that card you've got if you like

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.499

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.929
That's your problem dark vision

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:15.780
No not the nine-to-five

01:16:37.299 --> 01:16:39.299
Look at your bar darts you

01:16:40.269 --> 01:16:46.438
Know what they're thinking right now. They're thinking how big their piece of the pie is gonna get you stop taking yours

01:16:48.099 --> 01:16:53.308
This is where we vote right woman, let's vote make it quick

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.280
Do your dirt

01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:13.650
Can you do it

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:18.210
See was just like I am up here, but you got down there

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.330
when this is all over and

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.060
piss on your corpses well

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:53.580
And so the king falls

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.800
With the quarantine about to lift

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:01.350
I finally got to plead my case to the nine it excuse me eight and have my own day in court

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:07.979
Surprisingly given the fact that I just threw their former CEO off a balcony they seem pretty willing to listen

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.689
In a calm and collected manner I explained to them my

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:18.750
Situation my dedication to the firm the abuse of company resources by those above my paygrade yada, yada

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.750
I don't need to bore you with a long-form version

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:26.189
With a sound defense and in light of the day's events I pled that I think I deserved my job back

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.539
But as they voted it dawned on me

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.569
Something my sister had been trying to tell me for years

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:36.450
Well my new friend reminded me today. I

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:43.739
Didn't have a job the job had me I was just another fucking slave to the grind

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:53.250
Look we paint our paths with the best of intentions, but at the end of the day sometimes it takes a brushstroke of circumstance

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.200
or a deadly virus

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.200
To set us on the right path again

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.770
Oh

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:05.370
And the incident at TSEs are calling it

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:13.200
Ended up being a watershed case to finally accelerate a vaccine to prevent the symptoms of the ID 7 virus pending FDA approval of course

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.850
you're welcome and

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:21.990
For the firm itself well they did what any corporate asshole in a corner would do they offered me towers job?

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.499
Finally a seat at the big kids table

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:53.660
So I took the gig just long enough to make an executive decision and do some good in the world

01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.110
I quit now

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:11.980
I know what you're thinking you'll have to stir it up in a nice little bow and we pretty much just killed a bunch of

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:16.390
People I live with that, but they do say everything happens for a reason

01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:19.330
I'm starting to believe it

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:25.600
