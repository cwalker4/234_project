guys my top 10 things to know when

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:16.740
eating in Japan Japanese food is pretty
awesome as you guys already know from

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.460
watching some of my previous videos but
in this video I wanted to share with you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.869
guys some Japanese restaurant and
Japanese eating tips if you guys think

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.519
any of these are weird disagree or agree
let me know in the comments section oh

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.090
and if you want to help support my
channel check out my sushi girl merch

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.140
I'll leave a link in the description of
the video alright let's do this so let's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.160
talk about sharing food in Japan so
Japan has kind of a weird standard when

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.719
it comes to sharing food so it really
depends on the situation in some

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.340
situations it's not okay to share while
other situations it's okay to share and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
in some other situations you're expected
to share it yeah it's really confusing

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
right first of all it's not okay to
share here are some examples so ramen

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
shops with limited counter space is it
generally not okay to share the reason

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.740
why it's not okay is one they have
limited space and two they usually have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
a high turnover rate for customers and
they want to get customers in and out

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.119
and that one seat is really important
for them to be able to make money on so

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.570
if you take up one of those seats and
you don't buy a ramen bowl that's one

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.979
seat wasted for them but this just
doesn't only apply to ramen shops

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.880
generally if a restaurant has a set meal
places that also have limited spaces or

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.420
whatever when there's actually a long
line and people are trying to get get in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.290
especially during lunchtime and you're
probably gonna not want to share oh and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.250
even nicer sushi restaurants
expect you to order your own meal on the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.670
other hand where it's okay to share your
food is place is like fast food

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.710
restaurants family restaurants and cafes
so coming from the u.s. it is generally

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.549
expected when you go to a restaurant
with friends that you go there and you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.030
order your own meal at the end of the
meal you just pay for what you ordered

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.420
but in Japan it's quite the opposite
when you go to a drinking restaurant

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
also known as an Izakaya, they
expect you to share your food and at the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.930
end
everyone just splits the bill or person of the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.439
most money sometimes pay if you're lucky
now if you have children it gets a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.489
little bit more tricky it's okay to eat
in the places that I mentioned above but

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.599
again you have to really consider what
the restaurant thinks my friends with

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.560
kids what they do is they actually call
in advance to the restaurant to see if

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.099
it's okay to share maybe that's gonna be
a little bit harder if you don't speak

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.670
Japanese but that's what Japanese people
do so if you don't speak Japanese then

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.330
you're just gonna have to go into the
shop and ask when you arrive basically

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.530
it's rude to go to a restaurant order
food and not finish most of it not

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.880
finishing sides you get a pass but it's
considered extremely rude to not finish

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.019
the main course there is some gray area
here so for example if you eat a ramen

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.349
bowl take down a lot of it and you're
super cool but there's still quite a bit

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.370
left might be considered rude because
it's still the appearance of not eating

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.510
that much food on your plate but if
you're concerned with not being able to

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.959
finish your meal you can ask them to
reduce the portion size whether it be

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.349
reducing the noodles or the rice and
they're happy to do it

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.190
it's completely fine oh and one nice
thing though is if you can't finish all

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.049
your food this is one time it's okay to
share the food just as long as the person

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.859
you're with also ordered their own meal
what do you guys think Japan is too

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.840
strict all right so let's talk about a
Western pastime customizing your meal at

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.100
a restaurant customizing a meal in Japan
is not very common like requesting

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.359
no meat in your dish or to take out all
of the onions in general Japanese people

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.480
tend to not request changes to their meal because they think they'll offend

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.840
the chef but if you have an allergy
you should definitely tell them don't

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.950
say allergy they won't understand say ah-re-ru-gi and then what you're allergic to

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.840
The reality of it it's difficult
to do it in Japanese as well so my

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.739
Japanese friend who doesn't eat any meat
she always has trouble at restaurants

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.120
for example she asks a server whether or
not the dish has any meat in it if it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.690
does she tries to ask if they're willing
to take it out the first problem is the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.620
server doesn't really know what's in the
menu when it comes to a lot of the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.579
ingredients so they'll have to ask the
person who's making the food people that

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.690
are making the food are often just
regular workers so they're not able to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.500
change the menu up is so easily they
just follow one recipe for that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.810
particular dish as you can see just
going back and forth

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.799
between the server the cook and yourself
and just trying to figure out what's in

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.600
the meal what they can actually change
is a lot of work just in Japanese so if

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.960
you're gonna try to do this in English
then you're gonna be fighting an uphill

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.220
battle and even though they agree to
give my friend what she wants or what

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.419
she ordered when the dish comes it's
actually not what she wanted and there's

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.919
meat inside so all in all you can try to
customize your meal but more than likely

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.480
you're gonna have issues just like my
Japanese friend one caveat if you go to

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.620
the really nice restaurants like for
example a nice sushi restaurant and when

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.280
you place your order with a server they
will ask you whether or not you have any

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.370
allergies or if there's anything you
can't eat so maybe another option is just

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.790
paying a little bit more and going to a
restaurant that will accommodate your

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.080
allergies or your diet all right now
here's some tips for my vegan fans just

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.990
so you guys know many Japanese dishes
use broth that include meat or fish even

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.910
some veggie dishes use broth that has a
meat or fish there are restaurants

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.229
though that do advertise a vegan menu
and those are the ones you should

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.940
definitely look for otherwise if it's
not advertised then more likely they're

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.870
gonna have broth with meat or fish
although kind of a funny thing I've gone

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.250
to restaurants with my vegan friend and
he's told him that he's vegan and it

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.380
actually asked him if fish was okay the
thing is Japanese just don't have a lot

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.919
of education when it comes to
vegetarians many are unfamiliar or

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.630
simply don't understand Western diets my
best suggestion for you is to do your

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.680
research before going to any restaurants
the information is out there what do you

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.760
say before a meal in all of the streets
videos people are always asking what is

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.260
Maiko saying Itadakimasu

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.539
Itdakimasu

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.450
she's saying  it-ta-da-ki-masu which
literally translates into receiving so

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.380
basically Japanese people say this when
they're receiving the food for the first

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.040
time before they eat the thing is
Japanese people are not saying it for

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.820
any spiritual reason or they're really
thankful that they're receiving the food

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.520
they just say it because that's what
they've always done that's what they

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.690
were taught when they were kids and it's
just the thing to do so if you want to

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.890
be more like a local in Japan then say
itadakimasu before you eat all

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.420
right let's talk about the unwritten
drinking rule in Japan so when you go to

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.710
a restaurant especially at dinner they
actually expect you to order a drink

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.720
whether it be alcohol soda or even tea
so when you go to a restaurant and you

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.770
order water it might be a little bit
surprised although it's not the worst

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.810
thing in the world it's just kind of
weird

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.380
in fact when I go to restaurants
sometimes I just order a water when I

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.330
don't feel like drinking
the kids just got ice cream actually

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.690
this might be a good thing they're
gonna be quiet for a second so we can

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.350
finish this alright let's continue and
now when you guys go to restaurants and

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.430
you see small water cups and the fact
that they don't serve you water very

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.750
often during your meal you might know
the reason why so at the end of the day

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.220
if you want to be more local then do the
local thing in order a drink alright now

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.000
let's talk about slurping this one is
probably something you already know

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.490
but it's worth covering anyway slurping
noodles or soba in Japan is completely

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.090
okay in other cultures that may seem
rude but it's not a problem here in

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.960
Japan but unlike what a lot of people
believe it doesn't mean that you're

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.190
showing the chef that you really like
their food it's just what Japanese do

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.060
like Westerners using a steak knife to
cut a steak let me know in the comments

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.000
section if that's what you were told
because I'd really like to know now

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.730
let's talk about takeout boxes aside
from fast food spots takeout boxes are

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.990
not very common in Japan at the end of
your meal don't expect to be able to get

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.170
a doggie bag to take home your leftovers
in Japan portions are served relatively

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.400
small so there's really never a case
where you're gonna order way too much

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.260
food unless you just really go overboard
but Japanese people usually don't do

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.280
that that's maybe why Japanese have
created the word toriaiezu

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.120
toriaezu means good for now when ordering
in a restaurant so when the server asks

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.380
you if you'd like to order anything else
you can always say I'm good for now by

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.090
saying toriaezu. all right so let's
talk about this one what you do at the

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.050
end of your meal at fast-food
restaurants including ramen shops you're

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.620
expected to put away your plates and
throw away trash when you're done for

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.210
trash sometimes you'll see a very
involved process to throw away your

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.980
items liquids go here plastic goes here
paper goes here please go here plates go

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.800
here
mugs go here cups go here and spoons and

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.880
forks go here you can't just throw
everything away and one bin and for

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.860
ramen shops it's always good practice to
return your bowl at the top counter when

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.640
you're finished if the shop has a return
area then it's always nice to return

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.060
your plate and your trays there all
right now let's talk about money paying

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.170
at the register many restaurants ask you
to pay at the register instead of paying

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.980
at your table when you finish your meal
don't worry there's no tips to worry

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.310
about in this one well one thing you
should know is that there's usually a

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.790
tray that's right next to the register
where you're supposed to put your money

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.480
or your credit card some Japanese and
don't like to transfer money by hand

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.580
because they don't like being touched so
they prefer you using the tray instead

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.560
it's not necessarily rude to do so but
some people just prefer it I personally

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.550
handed over cash to cashiers and they've
had no problem with it while at other

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.140
times I've had cashiers directly point
to the tray and asked me to put the

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.700
money on the tray at the end of the day
it really depends on the person but if

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.300
you want to play it safe then always put
your money or your credit card on the

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.590
tray plus in Japan the smallest bills
are a thousand yen so you're dealing

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.910
with a lot of coins so it does help to
put the coins on the tray to help keep

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.510
you from fumbling around with a change
when you're handing it over to the

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.620
cashier all right so that concludes my
top ten but something to keep in mind

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.700
these are generalizations there's always
going to be exceptions to the rule not

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.560
all restaurants and not all Japanese people
are like this

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.910
so you just got to use this kind of as a
guide and play it by ear when you're in

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.079
Japan so after hearing my top ten what
do you guys think is it weird is it

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:16.230
something that you guys do in your
country or is it completely the opposite

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.920
