00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
Here are 9 things that could happen if Trump
builds “The wall!”

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.719
9 - The Wall becomes a tourist attraction

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.820
According to Donald Trump, the wall will be
at least 35 feet tall and 2,000 miles long.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.369
That’s not nearly as long as the Great Wall
of China, which is 13,000 miles, but it would

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.480
be higher.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.910
The Great Wall was only 26 feet tall at its
highest points, a good 10 feet shorter than

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.910
the Trump Wall.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.630
And still, it’s one of the great tourist
attractions of China.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.579
Another popular wall- turned-attraction was
the Berlin Wall, which was around 12 feet

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.420
tall and ran about 66 miles.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.039
Anytime you build something so massive, people
are going to want to get a look at it.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.770
Two things that make the Berlin Wall and the
Great Wall of China better tourist attractions

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.430
are their accessibility.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.460
You can walk on the Great Wall, and West Berliners
could walk right up to the Berlin Wall and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.810
paint on it.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.710
That might not be the case for the Trump wall.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.109
Americans may be able to get close, but they
sure won’t get to walk on it.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.820
Although, with the cost of maintaining the
wall, Customs and Border Protection may start

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.160
offering paid tours.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.170
In areas like Tijuana the wall will go through
urban areas.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.570
Right now there’s an ugly corrugated metal
wall, but a shiny concrete wall might attract

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.420
the kind of artists that decorated the Berlin
Wall, maybe on both sides.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.830
8 - The Wall goes way over budget
Trump estimated that the wall would cost anywhere

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.130
4 billion to 12 billion dollars; the numbers
keep changing.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.909
Well, the wall will be 35 feet high and 2,000
miles long.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.970
Building experts estimate 10 billion dollars
for the concrete panels, 5 billion for steel

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.320
columns to hold the panels (including labor)
and another 1 billion for concrete footings

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.590
and foundation.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.320
That’s 16 billion dollars before taking
transportation costs into account.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.120
You also have to build new roads to accommodate
trucks hauling concrete and steel to remote

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.200
desert areas.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.380
Let’s say that costs 2 billion dollars.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.450
Now add 30 percent for the management costs,
engineering, and design.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.550
That makes 23.4 billion dollars if everything
goes according to budget.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.380
Now, when’s the last time any major government
project came anywhere near the budget?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.350
And that’s just building the wall.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.640
It also has to be maintained.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.600
The Congressional budget office estimates
the costs of maintaining the wall would exceed

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.180
the building costs in 7 years.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.410
Oh, and you have to staff it.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.390
Even with only one person per mile, that takes
2,000 officers per shift - all federal workers

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.450
with pensions and everything.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.500
Whew.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.410
7 - The Wall Only Stops Half
What do we mean when we stay it only stops

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.820
half?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.390
Around half of the people that are in the
United States illegally came into the country

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.090
through an airport or official border crossing,
all perfectly legal.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.980
They just didn’t leave when their thirty
day visa ran out.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.300
A wall won’t stop these people.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.060
Obviously, there’s no guarantee that a wall
would stop every illegal person coming from

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.480
Mexico either.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.670
During the Cold War, over 1200 people directly
escaped East Germany every year, despite a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.850
massive wall, shoot to kill orders, and a
secret service system keeping tabs on everybody

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.730
and their dog.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.569
People are pretty ingenious, and if there’s
a will, there’s a way.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.701
The sheer length of the US border will make
it hard to control the entire stretch, and

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.590
you can take a short boat trip around either
end.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.340
And there are always tunnels.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.980
Israel, another wall building nation, has
detected at least 30 tunnels under walls in

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.670
its Gaza strip.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.120
Some of the tunnels have been miles long,
60 feet underground, and big enough to ride

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.400
a motorcycle through.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.150
Hey, there may be job openings for Palestinian
tunnel diggers in Mexico!

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.930
6 - The Wall causes environmental change
The Rio Grande river forms the border between

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.580
Mexico and Texas.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.571
The rest of the border runs over mountains
and through New Mexico and Arizona, and even

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:56.320
a city in California.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.900
You can’t build a wall in a river or even
right next to one, because of erosion and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.420
shifting soil.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.350
So you have to move it away from the border,
like a lot of the border fences are now.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.580
An actual wall would stop water from draining
into the river, which would cause floods along

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.850
the wall when it rains, and start drying up
the river.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.150
Animals such as pronghorns and jaguars that
move back and forth to use the river would

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.130
be forced to come up with different migration
patterns.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.650
When President George W. Bush put up fencing
along much of the border, Homeland Security

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.560
had to override over thirty environmental
protection statutes to get the job done, including

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.790
the endangered species act and the safe drinking
water act.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.550
And that was just for a fence!

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.310
5 - The Wall makes Smugglers rich
Just like the best thing you can do for drug

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.230
cartels is make drugs harder to get and drive
up prices, a wall will have the same effect

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.640
on people smugglers, the Coyotes as they’re
called, who take money to guide people across

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.030
the border.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.420
As crossing gets more complex, professionals
get more clients.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.720
Coyotes and drug cartels that profit from
desperate would-be migrants are already using

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.190
the wall as a marketing tool, urging people
to act now before it’s too late.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.690
And it’s working.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.880
Prices are up and still going up, and attempts
to cross increased dramatically since the

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.150
election results of 2016.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.620
But the coyotes know they’ll still have
a business after the wall goes up.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.470
They’ll just be able to charge more, but
of course they’ll have to figure out new

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.720
ways to get around the wall.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.480
4 - Illegal aliens build the wall
President Trump should call the Golden State

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.180
Fence Company in Riverside, California.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.140
That company won a contract to build fences
on the US-Mexico border in 2001 and employed

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.030
750 employees at one point.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.050
They had to change their name to Fenceworks
after they were busted several times for hiring

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.390
illegal immigrants - to build fences to keep
out illegal immigrants.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.560
Why do companies in that part of the world
hire so many illegal immigrants?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.730
Simple, they work for less and they’re available.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.870
The US is going to have a hard time getting
enough people to work in in the remote places

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.950
where the wall will go up.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.330
Most Americans don’t want to relocate to
a labor camp in the desert and slave in the

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.000
hot sun for minimum wage, which is exactly
what illegal immigrants are used to doing.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.110
3 - The Wall helps the Mexican economy
One of the companies that may really profit

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.710
from the wall is Cemex.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.800
Cemex is a Mexican cement company, the largest
in North and South America, with operations

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.200
on both sides of the border.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.850
Cemex’s share price jumped 2.6 percent in
one day and its stock is up 18 percent since

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.430
news of the wall came out.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.960
They and their workers stand to make a lot
of money on the wall construction, since no

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.240
American company is near their size and wouldn’t
be able to provide enough material in the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.800
time needed to build the wall.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.020
Grupo Cementos Chihuahua, another Mexican
construction company, is putting in bids to

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.040
build the wall, and looks to be very competitive.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.370
Already, 70 percent of their business is with
US construction projects.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.760
Other businesses that stand to profit are
naturally the people smugglers, spray paint

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.000
sellers, ladder makers, and dirt mover companies.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.430
2 - Mexico doesn’t pay for the wall
President Trump has promised that Mexico will

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.570
pay for the wall.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.300
His plan is to tell Mexico to pay for the
wall, and if they don’t, he’s going to

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.590
put a tax on money that Mexican workers in
the US send back to their families in Mexico.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:22.380
Or, he’s going to raise tariffs on goods
coming from Mexico into the United States.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.840
He says that the US imports more from Mexico
than they export, so that would be a good

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.320
way to balance that out.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.240
Taxing money from Mexican workers and exports
means taking money from individual people

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.810
and businesses, and not actually getting the
Mexican government to pay for the wall, although

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.190
they’ll ultimately feel the loss.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.320
But Trump also seems to suggest that Mexico
would pay for the wall straight up, just to

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.830
avoid those actions that he’s threatening
to do.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.360
That’s not too likely.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.330
Mexico has political parties that can’t
stand each other, just like in the United

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.800
States, but one thing they do agree on, is
that there is no way they’re going to pay

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.310
for a US wall.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.730
It would be political suicide for any leader
in Mexico to agree to such a set-up.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.560
What about raising border tariffs and stripping
away money from workers?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.790
First of all, Trump can’t raise border tariffs.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.830
He has to ask Congress to do that.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.830
Would they?

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.460
Food prices would go up, a lot.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.020
And if there is one thing Americans agree
on, it’s that they like to eat cheap food.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.990
Congress might not want to go on record for
jacking up food prices.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:27.449
Plus, a lot of agriculture in Mexico is owned
in part by American farm co-ops, who would

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.260
lose out if higher tariffs went into effect.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.590
Those lobby groups have congressmen on their
speed dials, and they will be calling.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.409
Now, the other point about taking away money
sent home to Mexico.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.550
Most of those payments are made through Western
Union, but more and more are starting to go

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.390
through bitcoin and other digital currencies.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.570
Not only is it cheaper to send money that
way, it’s also faster and would be almost

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.270
impossible for the US government to block.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.570
There’s even a service that lets you send
money directly to ATMs in Mexico, where family

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.980
members can get it in pesos.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.990
This trend will only accelerate if the US
puts fees in place.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.190
If the fees were actually successful in siphoning
off money, Mexican workers, many of them legal,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:14.170
might just go home, which would be a huge
blow to American agriculture, which is completely

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.800
dependent on Mexican labor.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.920
Uh oh.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.790
Food just got even more expensive.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.760
1 - The wall never gets finished
Right now, President Trump is pushing the

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.840
wall, but big projects like that take time
to get started.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.290
There’ll be an awful lot of planning involved,
contracts to draw up, roads to build, people

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.390
to hire, and so on.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.310
Bottom line - it’s going to take a while
to get started and quite a while to finish.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.110
It took over thirty years to complete the
first coast to coast interstate highway - I

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.900
80 from California to New Jersey, and that
was flat.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.950
Of course, if the wall is a top priority it
will go faster, but it won’t get finished

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.570
in four years.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.900
If Trump can stay in office that long, he
better get re-elected, or whoever comes after

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.260
him will likely but the kibosh on the wall.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.589
That would leave an interesting, half-completed
ruin, like a pyramid standing in the desert.

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:15.420
Although nowhere near 
as amazing.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:24.149
Here’s what’s next!
