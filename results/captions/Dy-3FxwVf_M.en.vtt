THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND I KNOW THIS IS
A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR YOU

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.196 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE CAST ARE OUT HERE TALKING

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.731 align:start position:0%
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE FINAL
SEASON COMING UP, BUT YOU CAN'T

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.734
REALLY-- YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:09.301 align:start position:0%
HAPPEN.

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:10.336 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.370 align:start position:0%
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT, ALL
OF US IN THE CAST.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:17.810
WE'RE KIND OF TURNING TO EACH
OTHER GOING, WHAT, DO YOU SAY?"

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:19.412 size:81% position:41%
AND I CAN'T EVEN SAY LIES.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.980
I CAN'T EVEN MAKE SOMETHING UP.

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:23.182 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE
STUFF UP?

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.418
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEN THAT GETS PICKED
UP AND THEY PICK THAT APART AND

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:31.824 align:start position:0%
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE TRUE THEY
NARROWED THAT OUT OF IT.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.027
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THROW STUFF IN
THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAPPEN

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start position:0%
LIKE FRODO THROWS A RING IN THE
MOUNT OF DOOM.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.434 size:88% position:44%
WE'VE GOT-- IT'S EVERYWHERE.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.802 align:start position:0%
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT
NOW.

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:47.907
THIS IS ONE OF THE-- I DON'T
KNOW-- 50 COMMEMORATIVE COVERS

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.511 align:start position:0%
OR SOMETHING THAT "ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY" IT PUTTING OUT RIGHT

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.645 align:start position:0%
THERE.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.913 align:start position:0%
ARE YOU GOING TO MISS-- ARE YOU
GOING TO MISS THE FURZE?

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:58.050
JUST TELL ME IF YOU'RE GOING TO
MISS THE SMELL OF WET FUR, KIT

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.919
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT WEIGHS A TON.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
IT SMELLS AWFUL.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.187 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:06.425
WHENEVER WE WENT OUT THERE AND
YOU PUT IT BACK ON YOU FEEL BACK

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
IN THE CHARACTER AGAIN.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:08.961 align:start position:0%
THAT'S GREAT.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.864
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT IS
JUST-- IT-- IT LITERALLY-- I

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:16.202 align:start position:0%
THINK THEY ADDED WEIGHT TO IT
EVERY YEAR.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.738 align:start position:0%

JUST BECAUSE, "A," THE COSTUME

DESIGNER HATES ACTORS,
OBVIOUSLY.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:25.144 align:start position:0%
AND, LIKE, I THINK THEY JUST
WANTED TO PHYSICALLY TIRE US OUT

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:28.648 size:88% position:44%
BY THE END SO WE NEVER, EVER
WANTED TO DO THE SHOW AGAIN.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.018 size:84% position:42%

HAD TO LIVE IN THE "GAME OF

WANT TO LIVE?

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start position:0%
WHAT-- LIKE, WOULD YOU WANT TO
BE YOUR CHARACTER--

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.325 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOT BE ON THE WALL.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start position:0%
NOT BE ON THE WALL.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.995 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOT BE ON THE
WALL.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:44.130
&gt;&gt; I'D GO TO DORN OR SOMETHING.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:45.231 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY'RE ALL TANNED
THERE.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.733 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ALL THE OTHER ACTORS WOULD
COME BACK FROM CROATIA.

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.403 align:start position:0%
IT WAS GREAT, WE HAD SILK
COSTUMES.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:59.979
WE TOOK THEM OFF AT THE END OF
THE DAY WITH OUR MA-GREETERS.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.147 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MARGARITAS.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.618 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW LONG HAS BEEN
IT BEEN SINCE YOU STARTED

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:11.324 align:start position:0%
SHOOTING SEASON 1?

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.460 align:start position:0%

SEASON.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.632 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I COULDN'T EVEN GROW A BEARD
THEN.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:23.769 align:start position:0%
THAT BEARD IS DRAWN ON.

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:24.870 align:start position:0%

HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU WERE

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:30.376 align:start position:0%
GETTING YOURSELF INTO, LIKE,
WHEN YOU STARTED THIS?

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:31.877 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU THINK IT
WAS GOING TO BE 10 YEARS OF

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.011 align:start position:0%
THIS?

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:37.650 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I KNEW-- ALL I KNEW WAS I
BOOKED A PILOT ON AN HBO TV

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
SHOW, AND THAT WAS JUST WINNING
THE LOTTERY ANYWAY.

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:44.056 align:start position:0%
LIKE, WHETHER IT WAS GOOD OR
EVEN GOT PICKED UP WAS BY THE BY

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.491 align:start position:0%
FOR ME.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:48.361 align:start position:0%
SO, NO, I HAD-- OBVIOUSLY HAD NO
IDEA.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:51.430
AND TO THINK I'D BE OUT IN NEW

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:55.768 align:start position:0%
TO THE EMMYS OR THE SAGA,

SOME OF THE PEOPLE I HAVE,
IT'S-- IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:03.542 align:start position:0%
AND IT'S SORT OF, AFTER 10 YEARS
OF IT, I'M STILL PINCHING

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:05.745 align:start position:0%
MYSELF, AND I STILL CAN'T QUITE
GRASP IT.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.649
AND I THINK ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,
I THINK ABOUT WHO I WAS 10 YEARS

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.084 align:start position:0%
AGO, AND WHAT THE THE WORLD WAS
10 YEARS AGO.

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:16.088
AND I THINK ABOUT IT NOW, AND
WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHO I AM

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:16.755 align:start position:0%
NOW.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.624
AND THEY'RE JUST WORLDS APART.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
IT'S-- IT'S BEEN --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS SHOW WAS A

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:24.563 align:start position:0%
BIG CULTURAL DEFINER FOR THE
2010s.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.331 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.633 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO WE CAN BLAME
YOU.

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.737 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: FOR WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.905 align:start position:0%
LAUGH.

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.307
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT THIS THEORY, YOU
KNOW, THAT WE KIND OF SCREWED

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.541 size:75% position:38%
THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:37.810 align:start position:0%
I FEEL LIKE--
<i> (  LAUGHTER  ).</i>

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:41.747 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BY MAKING THE
LANNISTERS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.948 align:start position:0%
RULING FAMILY?

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.419 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, I JUST FELT THAT CERTAIN,
YOU KNOW, POLITICAL FIGURES

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:52.725 align:start position:0%
TRIED TO EMULATE JOFFREE AND
THINGS WENT A BIT WRONG?

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:56.429 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GOT THE HAIR.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:03.102 align:start position:0%
ARE-- DID YOU KNOW HOW THE
SERIES ENDED BEFORE YOU GOT TO

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:04.370 align:start position:0%
THE END?

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:06.572
LIKE, DID YOU HAVE SOME SENSE OF
WHERE THIS WAS GOING BEFORE YOU

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:07.540 size:81% position:41%
GUYS SHOT THE FINAL STUFF?

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.476 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I HAD MY THEORIES.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.180 align:start position:0%
I HAD, LIKE, THEORIES ALL ALONG
AND ALL OF THEM WERE WRONG.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.448 align:start position:0%
THEY WERE ALL WRONG.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.651
AND I'M QUITE GLAD I NEVER TOLD
ANYONE MY THEORIES BECAUSE THEY

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
WERE ALL WRONG.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.620 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN EVEN TELL
US THE WRONG THEORIES.

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:24.223 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, BECAUSE THEN YOU SEE-- I
CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:27.693 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CALCULATEUS
ELIMINATEUS.

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:29.362 align:start position:0%
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.529
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PROBLEM, CEIVE.

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:32.898 align:start position:0%

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:34.800 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:38.637
WE HAD A TABLE READ, THOUGH, AND
I WAS THE ONE PERSON WHO HADN'T

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.939 align:start position:0%
READ THE EPISODES.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:44.377 align:start position:0%
EVERYONE ELSE HAD HAD THEM,
LIKE, THREE DAYS BEFORE AND READ

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.578 align:start position:0%
THEM.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.079 align:start position:0%
AND I JUST-- I THINK I TOLD
EVERYONE IT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.414 size:84% position:42%
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:51.917 align:start position:0%
BUT I THINK IT WAS JUST LAZINESS
THEY DIDN'T READ THEM.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.322 align:start position:0%
LAW LAUGH ANYWAY I GOT TO THE
TABLE READ AND THEY USED ME AS A

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:57.456 align:start position:0%
LITMUS TEST.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.060 align:start position:0%
THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME TO SEE
MY REACTION AS THE EVENTS

UNFOLDED.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.462 align:start position:0%

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:05.030 align:start position:0%
IT WAS ALL FILMED --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR

UNFOLDING.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:18.544 align:start position:0%
