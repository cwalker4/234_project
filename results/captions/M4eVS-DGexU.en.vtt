00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.966
- THIS IS
AN AMAZING STORY.

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.433
OUR NEXT GUEST IS A MAILMAN
WHO BECAME A HERO

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.866
WHEN HE SAVED THE LIFE
OF A ONE-YEAR-OLD BABY

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.100
ON HIS DELIVERY ROUTE.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.500
FROM GREENVILLE,
SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.666
PLEASE WELCOME STEPHANIE
AND HER SON ELI

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.033
AND THE MAILMAN
WHO CAME TO THE RESCUE, CHRIS.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.166
STEPHANIE, TELL EVERYBODY
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.266
- WELL, IT WAS
A FRIDAY AFTERNOON,

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.500
AND ELI HAD BEEN SICK
THAT DAY.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.833
AND HE WAS JUST SNACKING
ON SOME PUFFS

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:27.266
AND SOMEHOW GOT THE WRAPPING
OFF OF THE CONTAINER,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.966
AND SO I HAD JUST TURNED MY BACK
FOR A SECOND,

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.800
AND HE HAD TORN OFF A PIECE
WITH HIS TEETH.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.366
- OF THE PLASTIC.
- OF THE PLASTIC.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.400
- SO MY IMMEDIATE--WAS,
I TRIED TO STICK MY FINGER

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.466
IN THERE
AND SWOOP IT OUT,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.866
BUT I WAS VERY CAUTIOUS,

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.966
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO PUSH IT BACK TOO FAR.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:47.466
AND SO HE SWALLOWED IT
AND STARTED CHOKING.

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.200
AND SO I JUST
TURNED HIM AROUND

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.266
AND STARTED BEATING HIM
ON THE BACK

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.933
BETWEEN HIS SHOULDER BLADES,

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.233
BUT IT WASN'T COMING OUT,

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.866
AND SO THAT'S KIND
OF WHEN I STARTED TO PANIC.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.633
- YEAH, I CAN'T IMAGINE
A SCARIER THING.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:01.400
YOU'RE BY YOURSELF
WITH YOUR BABY,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.533
AND YOUR BABY'S CHOKING.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.866
- YEAH.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.466
- AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW LONG.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.266
IF IT WAS 30 SECONDS
OR 10 SECONDS OR--

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.733
IT JUST MUST FEEL
LIKE AN ETERNITY.

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.100
- YEAH, IT DID.
IT DID.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.466
- SO THEN YOU THOUGHT
YOUR HUSBAND WAS COMING HOME.

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.633
- YEAH, SO I--WHENEVER
I WAS PATTING HIM ON THE BACK,

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.933
I THOUGHT I HAD HEARD
MY HUSBAND PULL UP,

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.133
SO I WAS RUNNING
TOWARDS THE DOOR.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:25.933
AND THIS PROBABLY HAD ONLY BEEN
MAYBE TEN SECONDS AT MOST.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:29.033
AND SO I RAN OUT THE DOOR,
SCREAMING FOR HELP,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.666
AND IT WAS OUR MAILMAN,
WHO I HAD NEVER MET BEFORE.

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.433
- YOU'VE NEVER MET HIM BEFORE.
- NO.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.433
- [chuckles]

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:36.933
- COMING TOWARDS MY DOOR.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.600
SO I WAS JUST SCREAMING
FOR HELP,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.733
AND THERE HE WAS.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.166
- SO, CHRIS,
YOU SEE A WOMAN RUNNING OUT,

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.400
SCREAMING
AND HOLDING A BABY.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.600
- RIGHT.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.633
- AND I THINK SHE JUST PUT HIM
IN YOUR ARMS.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:49.733
OR WHAT HAPPENED?

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.133
- WELL, THE FIRST IMPRESSION
I GOT

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.933
WHEN I FIRST SEEN HER
RUNNING OUT,

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.166
I THOUGHT TO RUN,

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.466
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.166
IF SOMEONE
WAS BEHIND HER, SO...

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:01.333
BUT THEN REALLY SERIOUSLY,
WHEN SHE SCREAMED AND SHE SAID,

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.600
"MY BABY'S NOT BREATHING.
THE BABY'S CHOKING,"

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.933
I WAS LIKE--
I JUST SAID, "WHAT?"

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.333
AND SHE SAID,
"HE'S NOT BREATHING.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.666
HE'S CHOKING.
HELP ME."

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:12.333
AND SO NEXT THING I KNOW,
HE WAS KIND OF IN MY ARMS,

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.466
AND I TOOK MY TWO FINGERS,

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.800
'CAUSE I KNEW
HE WAS KIND OF SMALL.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.633
SO I STARTED GIVING HIM
THE COMPRESSIONS,

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:22.300
AND THE FIRST FIVE
THAT I DID,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.300
IT--I DIDN'T FEEL
ANYTHING.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.500
AND I KNEW BABIES BREATHE
THROUGH THEIR DIAPHRAGM A LOT,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
AND IT WAS JUST NOTHING.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.233
SO I SAID,
"I GOT TO DO IT AGAIN."

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.933
I DID IT AGAIN,
AND THAT FIFTH PUMP,

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.200
IT JUST--
EVERYTHING JUST CAME OUT.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.133
AND THEN HIS EYES
GOT KIND OF BIG,

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.333
AND HE LOOKED AT ME.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.033
I GUESS HE SAID,
"HEY, YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY."

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:41.466
[laughter]

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.266
HE JUST STARTED WAILING,
AND I WAS LIKE--

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:45.133
IT SOUNDED LIKE MUSIC
TO MY EARS,

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:47.166
LIKE MARVIN GAYE
OR SOMETHING.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.366
[applause]

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:49.900
- WHAT A BLESSING
THAT WAS.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.833
THE TIMING OF THAT,
THAT YOU--

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:53.700
I MEAN, HOW LONG
HAD YOU BEEN ON YOUR SHIFT

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
AT THAT POINT?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.366
- WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
EARLIER,

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.600
ABOUT 30 MINUTES EARLIER,
I RECEIVED HELP

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.533
FROM ANOTHER CARRIER
NAMED ANGEL,

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:02.533
AND SHE CAME
AND TOOK SOME OF MY MAIL,

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:04.600
AND THAT DELAYED ME
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR MINUTES.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.566
AND IT JUST HAPPENED.

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.200
THAT TIMING WAS JUST--
GOD JUST SET IT UP.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.900
- IT CERTAINLY WAS.
IT ABSOLUTELY WAS.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.200
THAT WAS JUST
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.833
BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
TO BE CAREFUL.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.833
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO TINY,
YOU CAN'T COMPRESS TOO HARD,

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.166
OR ELSE YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK A RIB.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.166
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD TRAINING IN THIS?

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.866
- WOW, WELL, I FIRST LEARNED
IN THE MILITARY,

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:27.833
WHICH WAS MAYBE 25 YEARS AGO,
IN THE MARINE CORPS.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.033
AND LIKE I SAID,
IT WASN'T ME.

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:32.433
I BELIEVE IT WAS A HIGHER FORCE
THAT JUST GUIDED ME,

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.466
AND THE ANCESTORS
JUST MADE ME BE CALM,

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:35.800
'CAUSE I WAS VERY CALM.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.533
AND AFTER HE STARTED BREATHING
AND HE STARTED CRYING,

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:40.400
I SAID, "MOM, HE'S OKAY.
HE'S OKAY.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.233
HE'S BREATHING,"
AND SHE WAS JUST LIKE,

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:43.700
YOU KNOW,
REALLY JUST HUGGING HIM,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.600
AND, "THANK YOU SO MUCH,"
AND SO--

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.366
- YEAH, YOU MUST'VE SAT
ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:48.766
FOR A LONG TIME
AFTER HE LEFT.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:49.966
- I DID.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:52.966
- WELL, IT WAS DIVINE
INTERVENTION FOR SURE.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.333
THAT WAS
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.833
DON'T EVER LET ANOTHER
MAIL CARRIER BE ON YOUR ROUTE...

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:57.966
- NO, NEVER.

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.533
- BECAUSE THIS IS THE GUY
THAT YOU WANT.

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:02.633
WE GOT YOU A GIFT,
STEPHANIE.

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:05.333
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW--
- YES!

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:06.800
[laughs]

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.266
[applause]

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.866
- THAT'S YOUR NEW MAILBOX.
- THAT IS AWESOME.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:14.000
- ALL RIGHT?
- LOOK, ELI.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.133
[laughs]

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.100
- THAT'S YOUR NEW MAILBOX.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.866
SO CHRIS IS
A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.566
OF COURSE WE WERE DYING
TO HELP YOU IN ANY WAY.

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:24.566
WE WANTED--WE WANT
TO SHOWER YOU WITH GIFTS,

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:28.233
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO RECEIVE A GIFT OVER $20,

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.500
WHICH IS CRAZY.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.533
IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR.

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:33.000
BUT OUR TICKETS HERE
ARE FREE,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.566
AND IN DECEMBER,
WE HAVE REALLY FUN SHOWS,

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.700
AND SO WE THOUGHT
MAYBE WE'D BRING YOU BACK

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.200
TO ONE OF THOSE SHOWS
IN DECEMBER,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.133
WHERE IT'S THE 12 DAYS
OF GIVEAWAYS.

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:42.133
- THAT'D BE GREAT.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:45.066
[cheers and applause]

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:46.633
- ALL RIGHT.

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:48.400
MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME BACK
WITH HIM TOO.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.466
- OH, WELL, YEAH, SURE.

00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:50.900

- THANKS FOR SHARING
YOUR STORY.
