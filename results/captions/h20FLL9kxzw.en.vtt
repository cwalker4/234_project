00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.990
bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: And now to the Philippines,
a country struggling to cope with its rapidly

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.920
growing population.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.929
Tonight's story is part of a new project that
looks at the challenge of feeding the world

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.889
in a time of social and environmental change.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.160
It's a NewsHour partnership with the Center
for Investigative Reporting, Homelands Productions

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.510
and American Public Media's "Marketplace."

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.810
The project is called Food for 9 Billion.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.150
The reporter for tonight's story is Sam Eaton
of Homelands Productions.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.789
SAM EATON, Homelands Productions: The Danajon
double barrier reef off of Bohol Island in

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.370
the southern Philippines is one of the richest
marine biodiversity hot spots had the world.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.679
But just a short boat ride away, more than
a million people depend on these fishing grounds

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.700
for their food and livelihoods.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.609
Rice may be the staple food of the Philippines,
but fish provide most of the protein and daily

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.609
diet.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.620
And as the population of communities like
this one soar, nearly tripling in the last

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.620
three decades, the effect on the reef has
been devastating.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.730
Fishermen are resorting to extreme tactics
to boost their declining catch.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.119
NAZARIO AVENIDO, patrol volunteer: We capture
one boat this morning.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.049
SAM EATON: Nazario Avenido and his group of
volunteers operate 24-hour patrols, trying

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.770
to protect their local fishing grounds.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.590
Illegal fishing has become rampant.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.200
Many use dynamite or cyanide, indiscriminately
killing everything within their reach.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.480
Avenido has confiscated more than 50 boats
and hundreds of illegal nets in recent years.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.590
Today, he seized this boat.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.140
Its owner, who escaped capture, was using
a banned net that wreaks havoc on spawning

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.359
grounds and sensitive corals.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.729
Avenido says the violators aren't bad people.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.329
They're just hungry.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.299
NAZARIO AVENIDO: Because there is no other
solution, especially when they are a very

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.320
poor family.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.810
SAM EATON: Poor in a country that has one
of the highest population growth rates in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.229
all of Southeast Asia, every year adding about
two million more mouths to feed.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.159
WALDEN BELLO, Philippines: It's a hell of
a problem.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.799
I think you just need to look at the statistics.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.500
SAM EATON: Congressman Walden Bello says the
Philippines is already beyond its carrying

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
capacity.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.159
And that's today, with a population just shy
of 100 million people.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.260
WALDEN BELLO: And so the demographers are
really worried because they feel that, most

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.370
likely, at the earliest, we'll be stabilizing
at around 200 million in 2080.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.159
SAM EATON: That eventual doubling of the population
presents an existential threat to the Philippines,

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.250
especially for the people who depend on its
natural resources for food.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.290
I traveled to a rural fishing village called
Humayhumay to see how the issues of population

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.230
growth, food and the environments are connected.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.480
And what I found was surprising.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.269
Jason Bostero and his wife, Crisna, both grew
up in large families typical of this area.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.239
But unlike the generations before them, the
Bosteros made a deliberate choice to have

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.150
only two children: James and Cyril Jean, ages
6 and 9.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.099
JASON BOSTERO, Philippines (through translator):
My income is just right to feed us three times

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.180
a day.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.390
It's really, really different when you have
a small family.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.879
SAM EATON: That choice to have a smaller family
was motivated by memories of going hungry

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.939
as young children.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.299
CRISNA BOSTERO, Philippines (through translator):
In my case, we were really hard-up before.

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.290
Sometimes, we would only eat once a day because
we were so poor.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.450
We couldn't go to school.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.459
I did not finish school because there were
just so many of us.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.019
SAM EATON: The reason the Bosteros were able
to have a smaller family is because they could

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.060
choose to.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.409
A community-based family planning program
has made birth control options like the pill

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.739
accessible and affordable at about 70 cents
a month for the first time in their village.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.739
DR.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.769
JOAN CASTRO, PATH Foundation Philippines:
In villages, we train and identify community-based

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.829
distributors like this to be able to sell
pills and condoms any time.

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.700
SAM EATON: Dr. Joan Castro started the program
here.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.700
DR.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.310
JOAN CASTRO: And this becomes as easy as buying
soft drinks or matches.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.489
SAM EATON: She's with the PATH Foundation
Philippines, a group funded mostly through

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.489
USAID.

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.760
And what makes her program unique is its emphasis
on local partners.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760
DR.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.130
JOAN CASTRO (through translator): Which brand
of birth control pills are you selling more

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.130
of?

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.280
WOMAN (through translator): Well, they like
the yellow one because it's cheaper.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280
DR.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280
JOAN CASTRO (through translator): How much
is it?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.700
MAN (through translator): It used to be 35
pesos.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.500
Then it was 38.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.500
Now it's 41.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500
DR.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.199
JOAN CASTRO: The idea is to be able to bring
access to the people.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.880
SAM EATON: Access that in remote villages
like Humayhumay was nonexistent before the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.560
PATH Foundation came in.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.210
In just six years since the program was first
established here, family sizes have plummeted

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.300
from as many as 12 children to a maximum of
about four today.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.180
This village is one of the PATH Foundation's
longest-running case studies.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.490
And what it's showing is how closely tied
family planning is with environmental conservation

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.789
and putting food on the table.

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.960
Out on the Danajon double barrier reef, where
Jason Bostero fishes every morning, the shift

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.350
to smaller families is already paying dividends.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.370
He and his neighbors have created a marine
preserve to help revive fish stocks.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.610
And it's working.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.060
With smaller families, thinking about future
generations is a luxury fishermen like Bostero

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.680
can afford.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.030
JASON BOSTERO (through translator): Family
planning is helpful, because, if you control

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.210
the number of your children, you don't need
as many fish to support your family.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.729
If you have many children, it's difficult
to support them.

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.920
SAM EATON: Outside of Humayhumay, where birth
control remains largely out of reach, the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.539
struggle to put food on the table from one
day to the next dominates life.

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.449
Down the road, the gymnasium in the region's
main town, Ubay, was filled recently with

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.670
people waiting to collect government assistance
checks for food.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.490
Many stood in line for up to 12 hours.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.050
For the families gathered here, these checks
are a lifeline, making up for the declining

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.009
catch from the sea.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.610
This scene is one that neighboring countries
like Thailand and Indonesia have largely avoided,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.729
thanks to state-sponsored family planning
programs.

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.800
But Congressman Walden Bello says, in the
Philippines, any efforts to do the same have

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.210
faced stiff resistance.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.830
WALDEN BELLO: What's happening is what we
have witnessed recently, which is a hard-line,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.990
scorched-earth opposition on the part of the
Catholic Church hierarchy to any form of artificial

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.849
contraception.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:40.889
SAM EATON: And in a country that's 80 percent
Catholic, that opposition means something.

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.789
For more than a decade, the church's leadership
has rallied against a reproductive health

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.819
bill in Congress that would guarantee universal
access to birth control.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.879
Recently, it even threatened the president
with excommunication for supporting the bill.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.410
OSCAR CRUZ, Filipino Archbishop Emeritus:
That's why I say, don't fool with the church,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.879
because she will bury you.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.460
SAM EATON: Filipino Archbishop Emeritus Oscar
Cruz says the key to everyone having enough

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.230
food to eat is a question of development,
not population control.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:17.690
OSCAR CRUZ: Once, I was asked, which would
you prefer, to have less mouths to feed or

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.490
to have more food to eat?

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.229
And I said, is there a choice there?

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:34.539
Come on, if you have more mouths to feed,
then produce more food to eat, not the other

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:35.539
way around.

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:41.090
SAM EATON: But that challenge to produce more
food is already testing the limits of ecosystems,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.720
both on land and sea.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.900
Today, the Philippines imports more rice than
any other nation on the planet.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.979
And according to the World Bank, every major
species of fish here shows signs of severe

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:53.500
overfishing.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.979
Technological advances have helped boost the
food supply, but they've failed to keep pace

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.440
with the Philippine's surging population growth.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.180
Maternity wards like this one at a Manila
hospital are overwhelmed.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.520
Dr. Esmeraldo Ilem heads the hospital's family
planning unit, but spends most of his time

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.770
these days with new mothers.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.770
DR.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.110
ESMERALDO ILEM, Philippines: She's only 29
years old.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.520
This is her seventh child.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.530
SAM EATON: According to the Guttmacher Institute,
more than half of all pregnancies in the Philippines

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.379
are unintended.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:25.360
It's the poor who come here for maternity
care.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.770
But if they want to prevent pregnancies, they're
out of luck.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:34.540
Absent any state funding for birth control,
Dr. Ilem has little to offer.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.640
That's a stark contrast to the Bohol Island
fishing village, Humayhumay, where family

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.290
planning is as close as the corner store.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.640
Here, the PATH Foundation Philippines program
has taken on a life of its own.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.810
The project is now fully integrated with the
local government's rural health unit.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.810
DR.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:57.480
JOAN CASTRO: The vision of the project is
in this community you see more children educated

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.820
who are able to become leaders and speak out
for themselves in the future and be able to

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.770
become stewards of their own sexuality and
the future environment.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.180
This is the legacy.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.840
SAM EATON: Dr. Castro says success stories
like this one can help overcome traditional

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.310
attitudes about birth control.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.600
Jason and Crisna Bostero, both practicing
Catholics, don't see a conflict between their

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.680
religious beliefs and family planning.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.010
For them, it's about something much more immediate,
like what kind of future they're going to

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.690
pass on to their two children.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.840
CRISNA BOSTERO (through translator): I don't
want them to be like us, just to fish the

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.990
sea, just to farm the land.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.510
This is not an easy way to earn a living.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.790
You are exposed to the sun.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.110
It's better if they can finish their courses,
so they can have comfortable lives.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:53.500
SAM EATON: With both of their children in
school, the Bosteros are hopeful about their

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.500
future.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.510
But it's a future that could easily be overwhelmed
by outside forces.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:04.470
After all, this is only one village in a country
still deadlocked over a family planning law,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.340
in a world that's projected to have nine billion
mouths to feed by the middle of the century.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.250
