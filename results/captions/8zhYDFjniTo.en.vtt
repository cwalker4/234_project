00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.136
The immigration debate
continues to dominate the news.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.972
Families separated,
children in cages,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.108
and now people are going hungry.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.044
A Virginia restaurant
refused service

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.713
to White House Press Secretary
Sarah Sanders.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.115
Stephanie Wilkinson,
owner of the Red Hen

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.618
in Lexington, Virginia,
told the Washington Post 

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.920
she asked Sanders
to leave because she works

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:24.023
for a "inhuman and unethical
administration."

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.758
That's right.
A Virginia restaurant

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.695
tossed Sarah Huckabee Sanders
out and refused her service.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.364
-And I know... No.
-(whooping)

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:33.299
I know that you guys
are cheering, but, I'm sorry,

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:35.468
I think that was
the wrong thing to do.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.403
I think what the restaurant
should have done

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:39.806
is treated her the same way
she treats the press.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.674
Yeah, they should have
just brought her an empty plate,

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.476
and then when she goes,
"Uh, where's my food?"

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:46.879
you go, "Oh, it's right there.
It's right there.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.382
-It's-it's right there."
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.219
She'll be like,
"There's no food."

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:55.354
And they'll be like, "Well,
the chef told us there's food,

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:56.956
"so there must be food there.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.093
And that's our position.
That's it."

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.829
You know, when you think about
it, when you think about it,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.497
asking Sanders to leave

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.833
was probably the nicest thing
they could have done.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.702
The waiter was probably like,
"Listen, if I'm being honest,

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.538
"all the chefs are jizzing
in your food right now,

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.475
"so if I were you,

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.410
"I'd go get a pizza
at one of those places

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:20.813
where you can watch them
make it. Yeah."

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.882
So, look, all in all,
I'm gonna be honest,

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.885
I don't think this was so bad
for Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.088
Of course, she sees the whole
incident a little differently.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.824
Here's what, uh, the press
secretary for President Trump

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.961
tweeted out. She writes, "Last
night I was told by the owner

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.430
"of Red Hen in Lexington,
Virginia to leave

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.265
"because I work
for President Trump

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:40.666
"and I politely left.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.603
"Her actions say far more
about her than about me.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.872
"I always do my best
to treat people,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.541
"including those
I disagree with, respectfully

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.676
and will continue to do so."

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.212
Really?

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.748
You always do your best
to treat people with respect?

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.016
Come on, Sarah.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.418
We've seen how you treat
journalists on TV.

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:01.420
Like, come on,
you can't lie about your job

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:03.890
when your job is on camera.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.892
Yeah. Just ask the police.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.560
It comes back
to bite you every time.

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:08.895
And, actually, and, actually,

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.830
wh-when you look
at what happened,

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.899
Sarah Sanders didn't get
that bad a deal.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.767
Yes, they asked her to leave.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.436
But they had already served
her a cheese board.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.438
Right? It was
a cheese board appetizer,

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.340
which they didn't charge her
for.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.543
Yeah. And, honestly,
if I was Sarah Huckabee Sanders,

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.744
instead of complaining
about this,

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.212
I would use it to my advantage.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:28.014
Yeah. I'd just go
to different restaurants

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.682
in a disguise

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:33.486
and then I'd order all my cheese

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.821
and then once I'd got it,
I'd reveal myself like,

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.090
"Aha! It is I,

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.960
"Sarah Huckabee Sanders!

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:44.297
"From the Trump administration!

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.433
Y'all got cheesed, bitches!"

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:50.169
You'll just be getting free food
the whole time.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.705
Yeah, the-the only way
that wouldn't work,

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.373
the only time it wouldn't work,
is if the restaurant

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.042
was owned by an immigrant.
'Cause, immigrants,

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.177
we don't play those games.
Like, we'll kick you out

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.845
and still make you pay. Yeah.

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:01.581
Yeah, an immigrant owner,
he'd be like,

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.716
"You need to get out. Sarah,
you need to get out. You nee..."

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.384
She's like, "I'm getting out."
"No, no, first you pay.

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:07.119
You pay first.
Then you get out."

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:09.055
"But you're kicking us out."
"Yes, I'm kicking you out,

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.723
"and you're going to pay, okay?

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.925
"Cheese is not free.
Cheese is not political, okay?

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.127
"Cheese is not Trump
or Democrat, okay?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.064
Yeah, you eat the cheese,
you pay, you leave."

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.599
Now, as you might expect, uh,

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.334
the president
of the United States

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.135
quickly jumped
to Sanders' defense.

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:25.738
I mean, not physically, of
course, because of bone spurs,

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.007
but he did it on Twitter.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.809
REPORTER: The president
 just tweeted about it.

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.811
He said, "The Red Hen Restaurant
should focus more

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.146
"on cleaning
its filthy canopies,

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.149
"doors and windows
(badly needs a paint job)

00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:39.285
"rather than refusing
to serve a fine person

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.620
"like Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.221
"I always had a rule,

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:44.156
"if a restaurant is dirty
on the outside,

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.292
it is dirty on the inside!"

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:48.828
I love how President Trump
always goes right

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.563
to the appearance of something,
you know,

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:52.164
even when it makes no sense.
He's like,

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:54.300
"Oh, yeah? Well,
guess what, restaurant,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.503
"you ugly. Yeah.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:01.374
I wouldn't eat there
with Mike Pence's dick."

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.776
Why are you dissing their looks?

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.779
Now, Sanders' farm-to-table

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:09.782
to sidewalk meal
was just the latest incident

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.385
in a string of Trump folks
getting confronted in public.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.886
Last week--
I don't know if you remember--

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.721
Homeland Security Secretary
Kirstjen Nielsen

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.723
had her fiesta gone loco,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:20.192
and, uh, in Florida, in Florida,

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:23.195
left-wing protestors
chased a Trump-friendly

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:25.064
state attorney general,
Pam Bondi,

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.933
from a screening of
the new Mr. Rogers documentary.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.604
Yeah. The weirdest part of that
was when Mr. Rogers joined in.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:35.141
He was like, "Everyone deserves
love and compassion...

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.943
Is that Pam Bondi?
Get the (bleep) out of here."

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:40.713
(laughter, applause)

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:43.282
And now... and now...

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:45.318
And now it's gotten so bad

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:49.188
that even low-level Trump
staffers are feeling the heat.

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:51.657
You know, many say
dating in D.C. is pretty hard.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.859
Yeah, but apparently,
dating in D.C. as a staffer

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.294
of the Trump administration--
even harder.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:57.296
According to an article
by Politico,

00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:59.065
current and former staffers say

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.801
they're often ridiculed
by prospective dates online.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.003
Some say they're denied
when someone finds out

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:06.372
where they work or that
they voted for President Trump.

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:09.008
As a result, many young staffers
say they have decided

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:12.044
to date exclusively
within the administration.

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:14.180
(laughter, loud groaning)

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.182
Oh, that is...

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.883
Yo, that is so sad.

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:19.552
(laughter)

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.321
White House staff can't get
anyone to swipe right on them?

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:25.758
Yeah? Or I guess in their case,
far right, right?

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:28.527
And I... and I know...
and I know they're saying

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.464
they can't get dates online
because they work for Trump.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.366
But just look
at all these male models

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.368
who have worked for Trump,
and, uh...

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.969
Like something tells me

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.105
it's not their political views
holding them back. Yeah.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.207
'Cause I know they want
to blame the president,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.875
but Trump is smashing.
Let's be honest.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:44.076
Like, these guys...

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:46.178
Like, if you ask me,
saying it's about Trump

00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.847
is just an excuse
girls probably use

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.982
to let Stephen Miller down easy.
It's just like,

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:52.218
"Yeah, I can't date you
because of your boss.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.819
"Yeah, it's totally not
because you look

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:57.490
like a Slytherin professor,
who got MeToo'd, yeah."

00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.326
(laughter, applause)

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.429
So, Trump people are getting
a lot of pushback

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:04.830
in public these days.

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:06.699
And there's a lot of debate
going on

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:09.001
about whether
it's going too far, you know.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.771
But if you ask Democratic
Congresswoman Maxine Waters,

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:14.039
this isn't going far enough.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:16.108
MAN: Maxine Waters
 told her supporters

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.078
 to confront other Trump
 cabinet officials.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.228 line:0%
(applause and cheering)

00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:41.167
Damn, I love how...

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.068
(applause and cheering)

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:44.970
I love how...

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:46.972
I love how
Maxine Waters has gone

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:48.941
from formal impeachment request,

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.277
to "We need to jump this fool
and his boys

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.246
"wherever we see them--
gas stations, anywhere.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.048
"They're gonna come correct.

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.984
We're gonna jump them
and tell them how we feel!"

00:06:59.017 --> 00:07:00.953
So, look, honestly, uh,

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:03.689
I feel bad for Sarah Sanders
and her people, you know.

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:05.691
Some restaurants
won't serve them.

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.927
People on dating sites
prejudge them

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.562
before even giving them
a chance.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.363
And every time
they step outside,

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:14.033
they're made to feel like
they don't even belong here.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.601
It's really horrible.

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:18.437
But on the plus side, now the
Trump administration has a taste

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.736
of what it's like
to be a minority.
