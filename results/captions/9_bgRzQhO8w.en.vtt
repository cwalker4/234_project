00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.300
In war, when the chips are down and the odds
are against a military unit, it can be time

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.209
to defy common sense and get creative.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.560
Of course real life has been full of many
instances of small, overpowered armies trying

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.190
unusual tactics and getting destroyed, but
since there’s no novelty value they quickly

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.070
get forgotten by history.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.310
Which just makes it all the more amazing when
some comparatively small or ill-equipped band

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.530
of soldiers wins the day against what seems
like an overwhelming force.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.760
10.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.460
Battle of Gaugamela

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.010
This 332 BC battle was the last one between
the Persian empire under the dominion of Darius

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.899
III and Macedonia’s own Alexander the Great.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.629
Although those who’ve seen the films from
the 300 series might be inclined to think

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.120
that the Persian armies were overconfident
and incompetent, Darius had at least planned

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120
this battle well.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.539
He chose a big, open area where his army of
over 240,000 would not be cramped in any way

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.390
and had the ground swept to help his 200 chariots
function at peak capacity.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.550
When Alexander’s 47,000 person army approached,
Alexander was intimidated enough that he called

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.750
a halt for a day to plan his strategy.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.660
The next day, the Greeks approached the Persians
at a forty-five degree angle with the left

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.750
wing jutting towards the Persians, knowing
that it would entice the Persians to try to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.849
send all their cavalry around that wing, which
they promptly did.

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.110
Darius also sent his chariots at the Greeks,
which were dealt with by the simple but effective

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
method of literally stepping out of the way
of them, waiting for the charioteers to stop

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.500
and try and turn around, then descending on
them en masse.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.670
Alexander left his camp with all of his supplies
and booty unguarded, which induced much of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.350
the Persian cavalry to go raid it instead
of fighting the Greeks, so Darius was drawn

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.990
over to the left wing of the Greek army where
hopefully he could regain control.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.180
When he was within range, Alexander and his
famous personal guard, the Companions, charged

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.530
Darius’s personal guard and overwhelmed
them, throwing such a scare into Darius that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.840
he personally fled the battle and sapped the
Persian army of its fighting spirit, effectively

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.300
turning control of the Persian Empire to Alexander.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.430
9.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.140
Battle of Chancellorsville

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.340
During this 1863 American Civil War battle,
the Northern army had 134,000 soldiers while

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.780
the Southern Army had 62,000.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.890
As if that wasn’t enough advantage, bear
in mind that this Southern Army was full of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.390
troops that were constantly hungry and a lot
of them were barefoot.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.890
The two armies faced off across the Rappahannock
River in Virginia (a few dozen miles north

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.330
of the Southern capital of Richmond and basically
instant victory for the North if they captured

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.330
it).

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.690
Then the Northern commander, Joseph Hooker,
decided that he would keep half of his huge

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.250
army in their current position to distract
the southerners while 70,000 went far downriver,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.450
crossed in secret, then came up the rear of
the Southern lines to hit them on the flank.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.700
Lee’s response was basically to use Hooker’s
own strategy against him.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.870
He sent about a third of his already tiny
army to go behind the 70,000 soldiers that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.580
had just been coming up behind him.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.560
To convince the Northerners that their tiny
flanking unit was actually the whole army

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.710
retreating, the Southerners looped around
and marched down the same route before making

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.760
the twelve mile trek into the Northern army’s
rear.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.540
When they attacked, it so unnerved Hooker
that by the next day his army was already

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.550
mostly in retreat.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.430
It’s worth noting that the results of this
battle were that it cost the life of Stonewall

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.250
Jackson, one of their three best generals,
and made General Robert E. Lee dangerously

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.250
overconfident for the Battle of Gettysburg,
where he effectively ruined the South’s

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.600
last hope of victory.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.680
Sometimes the worst thing an army can do is
be wildly successful.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.780
8.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.820
Battle of Muret

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.340
Alexander’s strategy of drawing the enemy
commander into a position of personal vulnerability

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.540
was taken to another level during this 1213
battle near the city of Muret, between French

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.160
under Simon Montfort and invading Spanish
soldiers under Peter II.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.459
Since there were only less than French knights
and more than 34,000 on the opposing side,

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.180
conventional tactics were out of the question,
so Montfort decided to go a much more direct

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.180
route.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.349
He ordered his knights that they could not
linger, no matter how stiff the resistance

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.939
was, that they must constantly press forward
until they had killed Peter II himself.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.320
While Peter II spread his forces out for a
conventional battle, Montfort went straight

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.000
for Peter in a do or die proposition that
paid off when the Spanish army melted around

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.209
them after he killed the enemy king.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.209
7.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.209
Battle of Singapore

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.720
At the start of the Japanese war with Britain
during World War II in 1941, the group of

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.780
islands called Singapore was considered impregnable
against Japanese forces.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.600
It had a much larger defensive force (90,000)
than the Japanese could throw at it (65,000,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.960
though some sources put it at much smaller).

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.000
On December 9, 1941, Japanese land forces
snuck onto the island through jungles and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.380
swamps while the main British force was expecting
an air and sea attack and had placed their

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.970
troops on the other side of the island, expecting
a naval invasion.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.240
To maintain speed at the risk of looking silly,
their infantry travelled on bicycles when

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.280
they reached solid land, stripping down in
many cases to sports jerseys.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.470
They also found an abandoned British armored
car which listed all their defensive positions

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.490
in it, allowing the Japanese to hit their
targets perfectly and capturing all their

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.060
targets much earlier than they expected, including
the valuable British airfields.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.880
When they did that, the Japanese planes were
easily able to sink the warships that were

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.300
sent to bolster the island defenses.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.070
As the Japanese rode along, they quickly wore
out the tires on their bikes and started riding

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.880
on the rims, and even that worked to their
advantage because the sounds of clattering,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.210
rimless bikes sounded to the British like
tanks, and assuming that more Japanese tanks

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.710
were coming led to more retreats.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.930
Ultimately, tens of thousands of British soldiers
were taken prisoner and one of their most

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.240
important bases was lost.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.240
6.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.560
Battle of Sabine Pass II

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.940
For this 1863 American Civil War battle on
the Texas coast, the North brought 4,000 troops

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.600
and four ships with eighteen cannons.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.280
The South, by contrast, had six cannons and
44 troops, which was less an army than a chorus

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280
line.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.080
Also one of those cannons was in such bad
shape that it was quickly out of commission.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.980
And the Northern cannons were powerful enough
that they could bombard the tiny fort while

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.320
staying out of range of the Southern artillery.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.260
The Southerners went out and put out markers
around the field where they knew the enemy

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.400
was coming meaning for the Southerners could
aim with uncanny accuracy.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.820
It wasn’t an act of clever planning but
just because the Southerners were bored.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.740
It hugely increased the accuracy of their
cannon fire when four Northern gunboats came

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.680
within range and in only half an hour, they
had sunk two of the attacking vessels and

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.320
convinced the other two to retreat, which
was enough to convince the Northern commander

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.320
to call it off landing the rest of their troops.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.510
So the Southerners took three hundred prisoners.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.470
It was a good thing the thirty-six Southerners
didn’t suffer any casualties or they probably

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.360
wouldn’t have been able to handle so many.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.360
5.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
Battle of Leuthen

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.420
Frederick the Great was one of Germany (then
Prussia’s) most effective generals in addition

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.160
to his abilities as a king.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.080
It was vital to the survival of Germany to
this day since in Seven Years War in the 1750s

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.150
Prussia was at war with Austria, Sweden, Russia,
and France at once and his armies were outnumbered

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.199
more than three to one.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.460
In this 1757 battle he defeated an Austrian
army twice the size of his through a method

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.050
as simple on paper as it would be difficult
to pull off in practice.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.830
He began by arraying his army in a long line,
then marching towards the north wing of the

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.020
enemy, compelling the Austrians to move much
of their army up there despite their massive

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.520
numerical advantage.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.181
Frederick then ordered his soldiers to turn
to their right effectively as one, and then

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:23.850
run down to the south in formations that instantly
became columns, then run around the enemy

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.590
on their left flank, catching the Austrians
completely off guard with how fast they moved

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.740
in formation.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.020
The Austrian army was so large and bewildered
that as they attempted to fold their line

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.680
in half, their troops became a confused mess,
which Prussian artillery could easily cut

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.680
down.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.470
The victory in this battle was vital to keeping
Prussia alive to the end of the war.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.470
4.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.660
Battle of Longewala

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.550
While there certainly have been larger scale
battles described in this list, the situation

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.840
in this 1971 battle was no less dramatic than
any of the others.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.000
It pitted thousands of Pakistanis with dozens
tanks as part of a surprise invasion of India

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.580
against less than 120 unprepared Indian soldiers
with a jeep.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.460
The only hope the Indians had was a chance
of air support if they held out overnight.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.720
One of the tricks the Indians used to halt
the advance of the Pakistanis was to lay phony

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.110
“minefields” in the form of areas hastily
ringed with barb wire, which was conventionally

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.150
how minefields were designated.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.440
This allowed the Indians to funnel the Pakistanis
into deep sands, which bogged down their tanks

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.010
so much that some of them caught fire.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.940
These tactics combined to stall the Pakistanis
until an air strike in the morning.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.639
The Indians only suffered an incredibly light
two casualties while the Pakistanis lost hundreds

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:38.789
of vehicles, completely halting their advance.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:39.789
3.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.870
Battle of Auerstadt

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.600
Although Napoleon Bonaparte hogged pretty
much all the glory the French military won

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.980
in the first few decades of the nineteenth
century as far as the public knows, their

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.509
victory won at longest odds was won by his
subordinate, Field Marshal Davout.

00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:57.249
In October 1806, Napoleon was preparing to
attack what he thought was the main Prussian

00:08:57.249 --> 00:09:02.570
army while he sent Davout north with 26,000
men to cut off any desperate retreats by the

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.130
Prussians towards the Russian army.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.600
It turned out he had it backwards, because
the main Prussian army of 63,000 men was coming

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.769
for Davout, with odds of much more than two
to one.

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:16.220
Initially the French troops dug in as best
they could and held off initial assaults,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.670
but after some time, Davout realized that
if the Prussians were not attacking with their

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.480
full force, there must be something with their
organizational structure.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.709
So Davout ordered his final reserve troops
instead to attack, which would have seemed

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:30.760
like suicide at such great odds.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.889
But instead, it caught the Prussians by surprise
and routed them.

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:37.259
Napoleon repaid Davout for his trouble by
dismissing his victory.

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:41.259
He claimed Davout had exaggerated the size
of the Prussian army by saying he “saw double”

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:46.450
(he didn’t, the Prussians own records attested
to it) then taking years to give his best

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.450
general any honors.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.690
Some people it just doesn’t pay to be loyal
to.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.839
2.

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:52.839
Battle of Alesia

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:58.990
In 52 BC, the Roman Army numbering 50,000-60,000
under Julius Caesar confronted the 90,000

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.610
Gaulish (French) army under King Vercingetorix
(who was sufficiently skillful that he united

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.540
a bunch of Gaulish tribes for the first time
in history) around the community of Alesia

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.579
atop a big round hill.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:11.389
Vercingetorix had beaten Caesar during a previous
battle, so Caesar was not about to just attack

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:12.740
the Gauls in their stronghold.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.480
But the Gauls did not want to press the attack
either as legions had also beaten them in

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.800
numerous other battles.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.959
And anyway, Alesia was basically unassailable,
so why risk it?

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:28.040
So Caesar instead built an array of defensive
towers (as much as ten feet high), trenches,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.449
and obstacles around the village that stretched
eighteen kilometers, as if Caesar had brought

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:35.199
WWI to France a couple millennia early.

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:38.970
Before the fortifications were completed,
a group of Gaulish cavalry escaped and Caesar

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.889
knew inevitably they’d be back with a large
relief army.

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:47.189
So he built a second, fifteen mile outer ring
of defenses facing the other way, like a general

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.429
trying to hold a castle while only controlling
the outer wall with a huge army outside and

00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:53.600
the inner sanctum controlled by the enemy.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.660
When the 100,000 strong relief army showed
up and attack the Romans at the same time

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.790
the ones inside the ring of defenses tried
to attack as well.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.740
Each time it looked like the Gauls were about
to break through, Caesar sent German cavalry

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.600
to attack the attacking forces at any point
of the line on the flank and rear until the

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.649
Vercingetorix’s supplies were exhausted
and he surrendered.

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:14.649
1.

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:15.649
Battle of Saragarhi

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:19.000
This battle will be much different from the
others, for in this case it ended up costing

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.339
the outnumbered everything.

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:24.319
But it was a huge, nearly impossible victory
in a larger sense.

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:25.980
It won a war.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.519
During an 1897 uprising in Pakistan, Saragarhi
was a communications outpost defended by twenty-one

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.519
Sikh soldiers.

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:36.899
It stood between Fort Gulistan, an undermanned
but vital stronghold for the British presence

00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:42.810
in Pakistan and an army of 10,000 Pashtun
rebels that were very determined to take Gulistan.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.999
After refusing offers to surrender at 9:00
a.m., they held off the attackers until well

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:50.059
into the afternoon, when a breach in their
defenses opened and the few surviving defenders

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:51.620
had to retreat to a blockhouse.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.829
The Pashtuns ultimately didn’t finish off
the final Sikh soldiers, needing instead to

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:57.989
resort to burning the building down.

00:11:57.989 --> 00:12:02.570
But at the end twenty-one soldiers had held
off 10,000 long enough the at the main fort

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.180
and prize was reinforced and defeated the
attackers, meaning that overall the last stand

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.350
had won the Sikhs the day even at the cost
of their lives.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.350
Reports of the number of casualties the Sikhs
inflicted vary, but the lowest of them is

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.910
180 and it came from their enemies who’d
have little reason to exaggerate how effectively

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:33.750
the Sikhs had fought against them.
