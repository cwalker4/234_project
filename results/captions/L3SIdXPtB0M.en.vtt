00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:01.603
I did go to Zambia though.

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.182
Fantastic place Zambia.

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.082
Went there, visited the
place and had a good time.

00:00:05.107 --> 00:00:07.218
While I was there I had a chaperone
who really made my trip.

00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:09.251
His name was Alinani, sweet guy.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.406
And his job was to get me
accustomed to the Zambian culture.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.759
And every day he would give me a new piece of
information, some more interesting than others.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.047
Like one day he looks at me and goes,

00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:22.407
“Trevor, you know Zambia is a
very, very conservative nation.

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:23.991
I said, “Oh, okay Ali.

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:26.984
He says, “Yea, so please stay away from profanity.”

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.970
And I said I can do that, I assumed he meant swearing.

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.189
But I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t
sure if he meant a person or swearing.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.422
No, no, because in Zambia people have names like Profanity.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.899
So, that’s how I laughed when I met Screwdriver.
It’s the same way I laughed.

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:44.939
Yea, because you see

00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:47.519
In South Africa we have African names you can translate.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.904
Like Happiness, Blessing and Hope. Those kinds of names.

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:52.526
But then in Zambia

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:55.599
People give their names, like they give their children names

00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:57.683
of everyday English words, anything.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.122
So like, table, chair, car, house.

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:03.400
You see, like you just have to get used to it.

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:05.460
It’s very hard, but you have
to keep a straight face.

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:09.789
Which was difficult because I met a mechanic,
who had sons named Brake and Clutch.

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:14.494
And that was not, especially when Brake
was running around causing chaos.

00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:18.187
And his dad was there like, “stop it Brake,
stop it Brake, stop it, stop it Brake.

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.124
And I was like, “Hey, stop it Brake. Ha Ha.”

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:25.938
But you have to get used to it, it’s a cultural thing.

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.560
And so, you have to respect it.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.697
And the second warning Ali gave me, was even stranger.

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:34.367
We are driving thru Lusaka, the capital.

00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:37.323
And Ali looks over at me in the car and goes,

00:01:37.387 --> 00:01:41.669
“Trevor, you know here in Zambia
we are a very God loving nation.”

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:43.902
I said, “Oh, ok Ali. That’s
a good thing to know.”

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:48.351
He says, “Yes, so while you are here don’t be gay.”

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.873
I said, “What?”

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.367
He says, “I know it can be tempting
sometimes but don’t do it.”

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:57.583
“Don’t be gay.”

00:01:58.196 --> 00:01:59.196
“Don’t be gay?”

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.111
I have never been warned of this in my life, don’t be gay?

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:04.376
“Hey bru, don’t be gay. Don’t be gay.”

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:06.601
“Don’t be gay?”

00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:09.469
Crazy, crazy warning to get.

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:11.804
But then I found out why Ali was warning me.

00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:16.221
Turns out in Zambia being gay is illegal.

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:19.116
If you are found to be gay

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.378
you will be arrested and sent to prison

00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:24.602
for more than thirty years, yea.

00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:28.212
Which is a bit of a weird punishment.

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:34.661
When you think about it.

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.403
I mean I am not saying that gay guys would enjoy prison,

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:41.579
I am just saying if I was gay

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.636
That’s not the worst thing
you could do to me.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.871
They would be like, “you
are going to jail!”

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:48.070
I would be like, “Oh no.”

00:02:52.357 --> 00:02:53.872
Don’t be gay?

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.549
I couldn’t believe this, gay is a crime in Zambia.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:02.189
Which got me thinking. If gay is a crime,
that means the police have to monitor it.

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:04.295
They actually have to police gay. Yeah.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.473
Which means in their police force, they have a gay division.

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:11.542
It’s a crime, it’s a crime.

00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.262
So that means they have a murder unit, a
robbery unit, a white collar crimes unit.

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:16.877
And then they got a gay unit.

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:19.276
Yea, they have got a little G unit in their police force.

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:21.984
That’s responsible for all things gay.

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:25.074
That must be the most fun police
force to be in, in the world.

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:28.007
You get to go under cover, dress up really nice.

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.850
Get in touch with your flamboyant
side, have a good time.

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.839
I bet the sergeant’s there every
morning, briefing his detectives.

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:35.912
“Good morning Detectives.”

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:40.511
“Welcome everybody, today we will
be launching a sting operation.”

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:45.801
“We have just been informed of a fashion
show that will be taking place.”

00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.604
“And as you know, the gays cannot
resist the latest fashion trends.”

00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:53.637
“Therefore we will be in full attendance
to apprehend each and every one of them.”

00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:55.196
“Let us make sure we are here.”

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.928
“Detective Chepoa?”

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:57.953
“Present!”

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.066
“Detective Table?”

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.110
“Present!”

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:03.981
“Detective Mongai?”

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.851
“Present!”

00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:10.465
“I think he's in too deep.”

00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:18.132
How do you police gay?

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:21.739
Do they stop you if you look suspiciously gay in the streets?

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:26.187
I mean, gay doesn’t have a look. But maybe you
have a bounce about you, like a bit of pizazz.

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:27.596
Do the police pull up there and is like,

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:29.721
*police siren*
“You, over there!”

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.774
“What is the purpose of that flamboyant scarf?”

00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:37.930
“Put your hands up!”

00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:43.007
“Turn around! Don’t tempt
me, don’t tempt me!”

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.073
“You are going to jail.”

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:49.157
How do you police gay?

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:52.471
Do they have roadblocks?
Like for drunk driving?

00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:53.869
Do they have gay roadblocks?

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:55.371
They are just like stopping people in they’re cars.

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:56.284
“Good evening Officer”

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:57.546
“Good evening Sir”

00:04:58.495 --> 00:04:59.857
“License Please?”

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:02.509
“Thank you very much, Mr. Stylish. Hey?”

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.173
“Tell me Sir, have you been gay this evening?”

00:05:07.368 --> 00:05:11.620
“No, I have not been gay. In fact, I don’t gay at all.”

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:13.873
“I see, not even one or two?”

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:16.335
“No, No. No gays for me. No gays for me.”

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.509
“Okay”

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.120
“Then tell me Sir.”
*sniffing*

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.337
“What is that I can smell on your breath?”

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:24.626
“Is that balls?”

00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:29.551
“No, no, no, I”

00:05:30.238 --> 00:05:32.434
“I don’t even eat Chutney, No”

00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:34.681
“A ha”

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:37.051
“So you are not gay?”

00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:38.265
“No, not gay at all”

00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:41.175
“Then Sir, can you please blow into this?”

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:48.196
Ahh

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:53.641
Don’t be gay.

00:05:55.948 --> 00:05:58.336
I was not gay while I was in Zambia, so I had a good time.

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:00.641
Went around and saw the people.

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:02.772
The highlight of my trip
came when on my day off

00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:04.917
I asked Ali for suggestions.

00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:08.213
Ali said to me, “Maybe you should travel
around Lusaka, meet some of the people”

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:09.534
“just have a good time.”

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:11.377
I said to Ali I want to do something special.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.276
He said, “Oh well, in that case”

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:16.151
“Maybe you can go to the Mall and if you are lucky”

00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:17.778
“maybe you can ride the escalators.”

00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:21.301
I said, “What?”

00:06:21.326 --> 00:06:23.095
“Hey, I am not promising anything”

00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:26.367
“but if you are early, maybe you can go once or twice.”

00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:27.919
I said, “Escalators?”

00:06:27.944 --> 00:06:29.356
“I know, mind-blowing ha?”

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:32.883
I thought he was messing with me.

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:37.021
Until I found out people in Zambia go to the mall

00:06:37.682 --> 00:06:40.193
just to ride the escalators.

00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:45.205
It seems ridiculous until you understand the backstory.

00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:50.693
When we were in Zambia there were
only five public escalators.

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:54.143
Five, in the whole country.

00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:57.408
The first escalator was built in August.

00:06:58.197 --> 00:07:00.633
Not August 19??

00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:03.764
No, no. You remember August. Past August?

00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:06.037
They built they’re first escalators, ever.

00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:09.381
Yea, and so now it is all the rage. People
go to the Mall just to ride escalators.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.282
But now, I don’t want you to
picture some dusty village.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.142
That’s not what Zambia is,
it’s a beautiful place.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.453
They are developing just as we are, they have roads.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.415
They got airports, the have beautiful hotels.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.012
Stunning shopping Malls.

00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:21.998
They’ve got everything we
got, even faster internet.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.676
The have just never had escalators.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:26.528
And now they started building them.

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.999
And because of that people go there, and
they just spend a day riding escalators.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.748
Yea, Dads will go home and fetch their children.

00:07:32.773 --> 00:07:34.718
“Children, we are going to the Mall.”

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:35.958
“To do what Daddy?”

00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:39.087
“To do shopping, and to ride the escalators!”

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.233
“Yay!”

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:44.570
We couldn’t believe this so
we went to the Mall, right.

00:07:44.654 --> 00:07:47.104
We get to the Mall. The Mall is empty.

00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:49.415
Escalators are packed!

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:53.730
People are standing in lines going
around, doubling back on themselves.

00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:56.672
There’s old people, young people, even couples.

00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:58.124
There were couples. Guys that
actually picked up woman by saying:

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:00.927
“I am going to take you to the escalator girl.”

00:08:01.562 --> 00:08:03.979
“Oh, you are so fancy hey?”

00:08:06.154 --> 00:08:10.000
Escalators. Some people didn’t even
know how to ride the escalators.

00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:12.862
Kids were easy, they just jumped on. Old people would panic.

00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:15.699
There was one guy who got on the escalator, and it was going up.

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:18.573
And I guess to compensate for
something in his mind, as it went up.

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:21.085
He started leaning.

00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:24.361
He fell down!
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:28.551
He was hurt so badly.
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:31.898
Oh, it was fantastic to watch.

00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:36.091
We spent like three hours doing this,
watching people riding escalators.

00:08:37.068 --> 00:08:41.236
And you know what? Our patience paid off, because
in hour three the most fantastic thing happened.

00:08:42.116 --> 00:08:45.406
A school brought a class of children to the Mall.

00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:49.920
And their excursion was just to ride the escalators.

00:08:51.005 --> 00:08:52.162
It was magic.

00:08:52.474 --> 00:08:57.443
Thirty kids, about five years old. Cutest things,
they were in their black and white uniforms.

00:08:57.849 --> 00:08:59.541
And they are standing there together holding hands.

00:08:59.613 --> 00:09:03.001
And they were so excited, they were shining.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.282
Not from excitement, they had Vaseline.

00:09:10.848 --> 00:09:14.873
And there is two teachers with the children,
and they grab their hands on either end.

00:09:15.043 --> 00:09:17.399
And in a long train they start marching through the Mall.

00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:20.640
And as they do the start singing at the
top of their lungs like little angels.

00:09:21.116 --> 00:09:23.243
“Escalator”

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:25.113
“Escalator”

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.196
“Escalator”

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:31.303
“Oh, Oh, Ohhhhhhoh Escalator”

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:33.227
“Escalator”

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:35.047
It was the sweetest thing ever.

00:09:35.072 --> 00:09:37.056
People are waving at them, smiling.

00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:39.330
And these kids see the escalators.

00:09:39.627 --> 00:09:42.983
And they lost, their minds.

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.565
These kids went crazy.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.212
They’re not holding hands, they
start screaming and running around.

00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:50.776
It looked like a zombie movie, or something.

00:09:50.801 --> 00:09:53.636
They are jumping, but then you see the smiles on their faces.

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:56.377
It’s like the end of Saraphina. You are
like, “What the hell is going on here?”

00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:59.847
These kids are screaming. They are
jumping around doing cartwheels.

00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:01.876
The teacher can’t control them.
She’s panicking like,

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.369
“Hey! Get back! Get Back!”

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.442
“Two-by-two! Two-by-two!”

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:07.190
Two-by two was one of the
kids, I didn’t know.

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:11.169
She’s like, “Two-by-Two! Next to
me, next to me! Single file, single file!”

00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:13.737
Other kids are still jumping, she can’t control them.

00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:16.532
There was one fat kid. He couldn’t
jump so he just shook himself.

00:10:18.096 --> 00:10:19.323
“Escalator!”

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:22.835
“Escalator!”

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.720
It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.560
It's like I had gone in a time machine

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.820
to a time when escalators were new.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:34.640
Brand new

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.420
and popular

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.800
So popular...

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.480
that people were taking pictures of the escalators

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.620
using their iPhones!

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.100
Technology eh?

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.140
Ah ah ah!

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.440
Who even thinks of these things eh?

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.360
Can you imagine?

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.680
Eh we are in the future now my man!

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.120
Mechanical moving stairs ah?

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.268
What are we going to see next?

00:10:56.268 --> 00:10:57.660
I don't even know, I don't even know!

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.220
I wonder how it works, ah!?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.180
Let me just check...

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.300
Siri, how does an escalator work?

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.580
I don't know
