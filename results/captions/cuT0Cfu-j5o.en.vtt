00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.466
- You're on the lot
a lot, right?

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.033
- I'm on what?
- The lot a lot.

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.200
- Yeah, yeah.
- I said, but you're--

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600
[audience laughter]

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.333
- I haven't been,
but I kind of am now.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.100
- 'Cause you have an office.
- I have an office, yeah.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.100
- Is it near me?
Where are you?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.333
- It used to be right near you,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.533
but now it's down further,

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.266
'cause Todd Phillips and I
joined.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.300
- Oh. Well, come say hi
whenever you're around.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.666
- Yeah, well-- really?

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.000
-'Cause Clint's office is
right across there.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.433
- Right there.
- Do you fed the squirrels

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.433
like Clint does?

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.433
- I've watched him feed them.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.200
I wouldn't dare get involved.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.666
- Why not?
- Well, it's his thing.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.033
- You can also feed the
squirrels--it's not his thing.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:30.400
- Well, I don't know.
[audience laughter]

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.566
- But it's sweet, right?

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.666
He sits, like, peanuts
on his desk

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.200
and the squirrels come in and
sit on his desk and eat the--

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.466
- I thought was a joke
the first time,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.833
but they really come up,
and then he's like,

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.066
[as Clint Eastwood]
"All right, hold on a second."

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.533
[audience laughter]
Then he's like,

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.466
[as Clint Eastwood]
"Come on, you little guys.

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.600
[audience laughter]

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.500
"There you go, little guy.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.933
"That's it, all right.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.233
Okay, what were you saying?"

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.866
[audience laughter]

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.266
- That's a good [inaudible].

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.200
[cheers and applause]
Oh, my God.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.600
[cheers and applause]

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.800
- That's literally what happens.
[cheers and applause]

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.833
- But it's so sweet
that the does that.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:03.933
- And then you talk to him,

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.233
and he's kind of just
waiting to see,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.800
[As Clint Eastwood]
"Oh, hold on, he's back."

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.300
[audience laughter]

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.200
- That's adorable.
- Yeah, yeah, he's amazing.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.500
- I love that he does that.
- Does he ever come on?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.733
- Uh, yeah, he has.

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.700
He walks on sometimes and
surprises somebody,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.966
or he's been on the show.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.766
- Yeah, he's the nicest guy.
- I love him.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.533
- Great sense of humor.
- He does--he's very funny.

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.766
And, "American Sniper,"

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.100
so Sienna Miller was
on the show the other day,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.900
and she was talking
about the fake baby

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.033
that was so obviously fake
in that film,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.333
and it was because he didn't
want a real baby,

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:35.166
because they're not predictable
and you'd save time, right?

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.000
But she--this is what
she said about you.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.100
It's so not a baby, it's--
[audience laughter]

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.433
Didn't y'all know that that
didn't look like--

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:45.766
- I mean, look at--
watch him wiggle the arm,

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.500
to try and make it look
like a live baby.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.400
He does a wiggle with the arm.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.800
- Look, you're judging him
right there.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800
You're saying "Why are you--"
- Look, there he goes!

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.433
[laughter and applause]

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.366
- I love that! It's true.
[audience laughter]

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.133
[audience laughter]

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.966
I literally--
I couldn't believe it.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.066
Like, I couldn't believe that

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.800
we were working
with the plastic baby.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.366
Like, I was just like,
"This is nuts."

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:07.900
And then I was like--
and I remember thinking--

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.900
I made a joke, I was like--
and I was like, as Chris--

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.933
I can't even do it anymore,
but I was like,

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.933
"I'm gonna save y'all
like $100,000,"

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.933
and I just started doing this
with it."

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.233
[audience laughter]
'Cause, you know, you have to

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:21.333
CGI the hand moving.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.033
I was like "Watch this."

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.400
Eat your heart out, Muppets.
- And you're being so serious,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.500
and your thumb is moving--

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.133
- Totally serious!
- I don't know how you did that.

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.466
- Like so dead serious!

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.200
- I mean, didn't you know
your thumb was moving?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.233
- Yeah, I was doing it--
I literally said to the crew

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:35.466
right before, I was like,
"Watch this.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:38.633
"I'm gonna save you guys
$100,000

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:40.066
in visual effects."

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:42.300
And I was, like, talking,
I'm like dead serious, moving--

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.433
- I know.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:44.666
[audience laughter]

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:45.700
- Hilarious.
- Well, I mean--I mean,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.900
you're with a plastic baby.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900
- Right. No.
- Yeah, I mean--

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.866
The suspension of disbelief
is massive.

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:52.866
- It didn't--
it didn't fool anyone.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:55.033
[audience laughter]
Look at--look at that!

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.300
[audience laughter]

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.866
That's--
- But, I have to say,

00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.966
I grew to be very fond of that.
- Uh huh.

00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:02.833
- I really--I fell in love
with that plastic thing.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.466
- Yeah, well, it was very
well-behaved.

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:06.166
- Look at that, isn't that
a cute--look at that.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.800
- Yeah, no.
- He cares for that thing.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.833
- Uh, what?
- He's caring for that.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:12.600
- No, you--well, okay.
- No?
