00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:06.656
[ Applause ]

00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:08.656
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome.

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:10.966
I'm Emma Alberici the host
of Lateline on the ABC,

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.136
and I'm here with Rutger Bregman

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:18.536
who has a fairly
radical proposition.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:23.596
[Laughs] So imagine
everyone gets an income

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.656
and you don't have
to work for it.

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:31.136
Awesome. [Laughs] And on
top of that, if you do work,

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:33.286
you only have to
work 15 hours a week.

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:35.636
And all the borders are open.

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.236
So you go wherever you like and
no one questions you about it.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.126
That's apparently
Utopia for Realists.

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:44.416
I'm not sure that it's
Utopia for politicians.

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:47.036
[ Laughter ]

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:50.066
So Utopia for Realists
examines a different approach

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:54.196
to economics and to life and
it challenges us all to think

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:59.116
in a way that modern politics
wouldn't dare allow us to,

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.466
certainly not with Donald Trump
in the White House wanting

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:07.586
to build walls, and Brexit and
Guilders in the Netherlands

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:12.016
and Marine Lapen in France
and Colin Hanson indeed here.

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:16.106
Rutger Bregman is a Dutch
historian who started writing

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:20.336
about this idea of a basic wage
back in 2013 long before many

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:24.866
of the concepts he espouses
could ever be called mainstream.

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.906
The book is an international
bestseller.

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:29.146
We're lucky to have him here.

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:31.806
Welcome. Join me in thanking
him for being with us.

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:39.676
[ Applause ]

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:41.786
We're just going to be in
conversation for this hour.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:46.706
So I'll open it up and then
I'll start the questions

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.596
and then we've got two
microphones at either side here

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:52.266
and I'll invite you
to participate

00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:53.686
in the conversation shortly.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:57.436
So I guess we'll start by
just the simple question

00:01:57.436 --> 00:02:00.686
of what is a universal
basic income?

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:01.776
Give us the concept.

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.716
&gt;&gt; It's a very simple idea.

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:08.266
So everyone would receive a
monthly grant that is enough

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:13.046
to pay for your basic needs,
food, shelter, clothing.

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:14.016
So that's it.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:17.496
Basic income is really a floor
in the income distribution.

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:19.976
So it's not the same
as communism.

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:21.816
It's not that everyone will
receive the same amount

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:22.106
of money.

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:24.836
It's sort of you could
see it as venture capital

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:26.196
for the people, right?

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:30.676
For the first time, everyone
will have the freedom to decide

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:32.456
for themselves what to
make of their lives.

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:35.416
And say for example everyone
could say no to a job

00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:36.716
that they don't want to do.

00:02:37.126 --> 00:02:40.816
It's a very simple idea with
quite radical implications.

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:42.766
&gt;&gt; But it is the same
amount for everyone?

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:44.676
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it's
the basic income

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.316
that everyone would receive it.

00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:49.576
Whether you're employed or
unemployed, whether you're poor

00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:51.446
or rich, man or woman,
it doesn't matter.

00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:52.116
Everyone gets it.

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:54.346
&gt;&gt; And how is it calculated?

00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:58.856
And how on earth do
countries afford such a thing?

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.746
&gt;&gt; A big part of my book is

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:04.716
about how would this
work in practice?

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:06.976
That is the realist
part of the title.

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:12.086
When I started researching
this subject in 2013, it was --

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.326
well, in the first place
it was completely forgotten

00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:17.786
and what I could find about
it was quite abstract.

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:21.996
So a lot of people thinking
about what is human nature like,

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:23.866
what will you do
with a basic income?

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:24.526
What would I do?

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:25.526
Will we all be lazy?

00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:25.956
Et cetera.

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:28.716
And I was really interested
in the practical question,

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:29.916
you know, has it
ever been tried?

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:32.816
And it turns out there
have been huge experiments,

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:37.086
forgotten experiments in the
'70's in Canada and the US,

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:39.756
and since then in
other places as well

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:41.116
where they actually tried it.

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:43.206
And it turns out that
it works very well.

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:46.416
I even discovered,
which is probably one

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:49.616
of the craziest stories in the
book, is that Richard Nixon

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:52.826
of all people almost
implemented a basic income

00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:53.946
at the beginning of the '70's.

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.516
&gt;&gt; In fact, it was very popular.

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:00.346
I recall something like 90% of
the population were in favour.

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:03.666
Republicans were on
board generally en masse.

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:08.236
&gt;&gt; Yeah. At the end of the
'60's, almost everyone in the US

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:09.976
and in Canada believed
that some form

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:12.216
of basic income was
going to be implemented.

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:15.456
So for example, John Kenneth
Galbraith the left-wing

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:17.236
economist, he thought
it was a great idea.

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:20.416
But also Milton Friedman, you
know, the neo-liberal economist.

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:24.756
They actually agreed on the need
for a guaranteed annual income.

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:27.646
Martin Luther King, he
was in favour of it.

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:31.226
So it's not that Richard Nixon
was suddenly a great philosopher

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:32.086
or utopian thinker.

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.996
He was just saying,
"Oh, everyone wants it.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:34.976
Let's do it then."

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.456
&gt;&gt; And it's interesting because
back then also it united the

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:41.196
unions, the corporate
sector, churches.

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:42.936
And I was just getting
in my notes here,

00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:44.376
because there's a
quote from Nixon

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:46.846
where he says it was the
most significant piece

00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:49.196
of social legislation
in our nation's history.

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:52.736
So why didn't it go ahead?

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:56.496
&gt;&gt; It's a pretty bizarre story
full of crazy coincidences.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.346
&gt;&gt; US politics?

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.106
[ Laughter ]

00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:04.686
&gt;&gt; What happened in the
first place is that, well,

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:06.376
everyone was in favour
of basic income.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:10.176
Richard Nixon had a proposal for
a modest basic income and it got

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.846
through the House of
Representatives twice.

00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:16.756
But then it hit the Senate floor
and Democrats started to think,

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.126
"Well, if this is going
to be implemented anyway,

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:21.446
we want a higher basic income.

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:23.766
So let's just vote
against it now

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:27.606
and then it will probably get
higher in the second round."

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:30.816
Didn't really work out that way.

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.086
So it was basically killed
by the left in the Senate.

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:41.456
The idea finally died in 1978
with an experiment in Seattle,

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:43.316
one of the big basic
income experiences

00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:44.706
with a lot of positive results.

00:05:44.706 --> 00:05:46.276
So crime went down.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.126
Kids performed much
better in school.

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:51.206
You know, healthcare
costs went down.

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:54.006
Basically it turned out that
basic income was an investment

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:55.696
that pays for itself
in the long run.

00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:57.446
But there was one big problem.

00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:02.746
The researchers found out that
the divorce rate went up by 50%.

00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:05.546
[ Laughter ]

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:09.256
So you can imagine at that point
all the conservatives saying,

00:06:09.256 --> 00:06:11.386
"We can't have basic income.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:12.986
This will make women
much too independent.

00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:14.776
You know, we really
don't want basic income."

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:18.376
&gt;&gt; Was there a connexion drawn

00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:21.366
between the basic income
and the divorce rate?

00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:23.886
Was there an obvious
kind of thread there?

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:24.966
&gt;&gt; Well, that's what
they thought, yeah,

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:27.756
that it was really
caused by a basic income.

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:30.346
That suddenly a woman can
say, "I want to leave him.

00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:32.126
Now I've got the
freedom to do so."

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:35.196
The thing is that
years later they found

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:38.226
out that it was a
statistical mistake.

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:40.126
[ Laughter ]

00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:41.886
So in reality the divorce
rate did not go up at all.

00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:44.556
But back then we were already in
the era of Reagan and et cetera

00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:45.806
and the idea was forgotten.

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:49.416
&gt;&gt; How is a basic income
any different to welfare?

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.956
&gt;&gt; I think in a few
important ways.

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:55.406
The most important way in
which it's different is

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:58.006
that a basic income is
absolutely unconditional.

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:03.006
What we've seen in the past 30
years is that the welfare state

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.756
from Holland to Australia
has become more

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:07.876
and more conditional, actually
quite humiliating for the people

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:09.906
who have to rely on it.

00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:11.906
Time and time again,
the assumption is

00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:16.436
that government bureaucrats know
better what the poor should do

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.046
with their lives than
the poor themselves.

00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:22.326
The idea behind basic income
is that poverty is not a lack

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:24.106
of character but
just a lack of cash.

00:07:24.846 --> 00:07:28.836
And you can cure a lack of cash
pretty easily with cash, right?

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.031
[ Laughter ]

00:07:31.046 --> 00:07:31.676
&gt;&gt; How novel.

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:34.316
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Once you've
seen the light,

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:35.856
it's very simple actually.

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.596
[ Laughter ]

00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:40.046
But it actually works.

00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:41.336
I think that's the
most important thing.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.116
My book is I believe a
very evidence-based book.

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:46.376
And I believe that's
also the way forward,

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:49.196
is to do more of
those experiments.

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:50.896
And that's actually
what's happening

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:51.816
around the world right now.

00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:54.716
I mean, Finland is just
doing a big experiment.

00:07:55.196 --> 00:07:56.766
Canada has just announced one.

00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:59.026
A lot of people in Silicon
Valley are enthusiastic

00:07:59.026 --> 00:07:59.806
about this idea.

00:08:00.336 --> 00:08:03.136
So yeah, it's really
spreading around the globe.

00:08:03.706 --> 00:08:06.256
&gt;&gt; But isn't there also
evidence that when people come

00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:09.446
into money, they
often squander it?

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:12.476
That when they haven't
had to work for it,

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:15.126
they make poor decisions?

00:08:15.586 --> 00:08:17.616
&gt;&gt; Well, if you watch a
lot of reality television,

00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:19.716
I can imagine that
you'd believe that.

00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:22.031
[ Laughter ]

00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:25.496
One of the stories in my book is
about a pretty crazy experience

00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:29.876
that happened in London in 2009.

00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:34.196
And this was a social
organisation that worked

00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.736
with chronically homeless men.

00:08:36.156 --> 00:08:38.196
And there were about 13 of them

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:40.976
and they had tried pretty
much everything at that point

00:08:41.036 --> 00:08:42.336
and nothing really worked.

00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:45.246
So it was simply time
for something new.

00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:47.636
And one of the people who
worked there said, "You know,

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:49.956
why not try something
really new?

00:08:50.176 --> 00:08:51.126
Let's just give them money.

00:08:51.446 --> 00:08:53.626
3,000 pounds, and let's
see what happens."

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.286
Now even at that organisation,

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.056
obviously most people
were quite sceptical,

00:08:57.056 --> 00:08:58.986
but they were wasting
money anyway,

00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:00.556
so let's see what happens.

00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:04.776
Now a year after the experience,
7 out of 13 of the men --

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.956
and some of them had been living
on the streets for 40 years --

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:09.596
but 7 of the 13 of them had
a roof above their head.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:11.016
Two more had applied for housing

00:09:11.096 --> 00:09:13.266
and all had made
significant decisions

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:15.316
to invest in their lives.

00:09:15.316 --> 00:09:17.646
So what did they
use the money for?

00:09:17.646 --> 00:09:19.826
One of them bought a dictionary.

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:22.256
Another bought [inaudible].

00:09:22.326 --> 00:09:24.906
One of them took
gardening classes.

00:09:25.346 --> 00:09:28.126
It was pretty incredible to see

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.196
that the money really
empowered the men

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:33.696
and for the first time they
felt like society trusted them

00:09:33.696 --> 00:09:34.766
to make their own decisions.

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:40.986
Now the twist comes at the end
because that's when you look

00:09:40.986 --> 00:09:42.506
at the financial
side of the story.

00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:45.766
You could say, "Well, we've got
to do this because we've got

00:09:45.866 --> 00:09:47.366
to pity the poor or
pity the homeless.

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:48.546
It's the moral thing to do."

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.016
But it actually also
makes financial sense.

00:09:51.576 --> 00:09:54.386
The project in total
cost 50,000 pounds.

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:56.186
That's about seven times less

00:09:56.186 --> 00:09:58.376
than what they would normally
spend on these homeless men.

00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:02.136
So even The Economist, you
know, nota very utopian,

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:03.856
left-wing magazine, right?

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:06.736
Even they wrote, "The
best way to spend money

00:10:06.736 --> 00:10:08.456
on the homeless might be
just to give it to them."

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:13.796
And to be honest, I think that
is almost always the case.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.626
That if we want to
help the poor,

00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:17.866
just solve the problem,
you know.

00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:20.566
Don't try to manage the
symptoms, but solve the problem.

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:22.826
And the problem is
the lack of cash.

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:23.526
That's it.

00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:28.976
&gt;&gt; There's a talk in your TED
Talk about the other approaches

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:32.516
of people thinking
they know what's best

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:34.766
and buying certain
things for them

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:40.716
and giving poor kids teddy
bears in countries and so on.

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:40.886
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:41.316 --> 00:10:42.846
&gt;&gt; Things they don't need.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:48.206
&gt;&gt; When I gave the TED Talk,
I had one line in my talk.

00:10:48.206 --> 00:10:50.886
I said, you know, we should
get rid of the vast industry

00:10:50.886 --> 00:10:54.686
of bureaucratic paternalists and
simply hand over their salaries

00:10:55.066 --> 00:10:56.356
to the poor they're
supposed to help.

00:10:57.036 --> 00:10:59.836
And the TED audience was really
like clapping and laughing

00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:03.336
and I was a big confused because
I'm talking about you guys.

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:11.976
[ Laughter ]

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:17.616
&gt;&gt; So you mentioned this
right at the outset,

00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:20.746
that one of the instincts
people have is,

00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:25.036
"Doesn't this create kind
of a bunch of lazy sloths

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:28.086
who don't work anymore and
just collect the money?"

00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:31.336
That's kind of instinctively
what you think would end

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:31.676
up happening.

00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:31.796
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:32.796
&gt;&gt; A bunch of people
would say, "Well,

00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:34.156
what am I going to
go to work for.

00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:35.296
I'm getting paid anyway."

00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:36.386
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.

00:11:36.386 --> 00:11:39.936
I think we have a very
mistaken image of human nature.

00:11:40.386 --> 00:11:42.686
I mean, if you watch a lot of
the news as most of us do --

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:43.506
I believe it's one

00:11:43.506 --> 00:11:45.266
of the biggest addictions
in our society.

00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:46.256
&gt;&gt; Thank God.

00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:48.196
&gt;&gt; Well, good for you.

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:51.076
[ Laughter ]

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.646
It's a big problem
for me, actually.

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:54.596
I mean, the news is always
about exceptions, right?

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:56.206
It's about things that go wrong,

00:11:56.396 --> 00:11:58.316
about corrupting,
crises, terrorism.

00:11:58.496 --> 00:11:59.936
So if you watch a
lot of the news,

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.606
at the end of the day you
know exactly how the world

00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:03.266
doesn't work.

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:06.846
Because you've only heard
about these weird exceptions.

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:10.626
And you'll have a quite
negative image of human nature.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.316
You'll think that most people,
again, the yare probably going

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.926
to be lazy or want to be
free riders, et cetera.

00:12:16.446 --> 00:12:20.016
So I think the only way to
combat that misperception is

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:22.756
by telling stories about
what actually happens

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:25.336
when you give people
something like free money.

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:27.656
And the book is full of
those kind of stories.

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:32.906
&gt;&gt; A lot of people on the
surface would look at this

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:38.066
and say this is a bunch of
socialist tripe because apart

00:12:38.066 --> 00:12:41.026
from anything else, it would
seem to run entirely counter

00:12:41.256 --> 00:12:44.286
to capitalism and the notion
of kind of small government.

00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:48.126
&gt;&gt; I think it's completely
the other way around.

00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:52.206
I believe the basic income would
be the crowning achievement

00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:52.936
of capitalism.

00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:57.736
It would give everyone the
freedom to start a new company,

00:12:57.806 --> 00:12:59.856
move to a different job,
move to a different city.

00:12:59.856 --> 00:13:01.686
It will make capitalism
much more dynamic.

00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:05.916
I mean, if you think about
it, just the incredible amount

00:13:05.956 --> 00:13:08.956
of talent we are wasting
right now in two ways.

00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:11.086
So still, around
the developed world,

00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:13.056
millions of people are
withering away in poverty.

00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:17.196
That's just a very bad
use of resources to say it

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.126
like an economist would.

00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:23.256
And I think one of the
biggest taboos here is

00:13:23.256 --> 00:13:26.016
that about a third of
the workforce according

00:13:26.016 --> 00:13:28.506
to recent polls is
now stuck in a job

00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:30.886
that they think is
completely meaningless, right?

00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:35.036
So there was a poll in
the UK two years ago,

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:38.886
found out that 37% of
British workers have a job

00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:41.926
that they think is just useless,
doesn't add anything of value.

00:13:42.386 --> 00:13:43.936
Now we're not talking
about teachers

00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:45.916
or garbage collectors
or nurses here.

00:13:46.466 --> 00:13:49.726
We're talking about
consultants and bankers

00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:50.896
and lawyers, et cetera.

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:52.706
So people who are
very successful

00:13:53.136 --> 00:13:55.046
in the knowledge economy,
who have great resumes,

00:13:55.386 --> 00:13:57.936
great salaries, who still
at the end of the day --

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.586
well, maybe you need to
give them one day or two,

00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:03.536
but they'll admit it's not
very useful what they're doing.

00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:05.126
In fact, in the book you talk --

00:14:05.126 --> 00:14:07.636
I think you've called
them bullshit jobs.

00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:10.546
[ Laughter ]

00:14:11.046 --> 00:14:12.046
Am I quoting you correctly?

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:13.636
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a very
scientific concept.

00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:17.031
[ Laughter ]

00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:18.836
It was originally
coined by David Graber,

00:14:18.836 --> 00:14:21.336
an American anthropologist
who wrote a fascinating essay

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:23.806
on the phenomenon
of bullshit jobs.

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:26.756
And it's just astounding.

00:14:26.756 --> 00:14:30.656
You know, when I started
researching it, I first thought,

00:14:30.656 --> 00:14:32.106
you know, "How big can this be?"

00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:34.976
Right? I mean, we've
got capitalism,

00:14:34.976 --> 00:14:38.586
we've got the invisible hand
that is supposed to get rid

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:41.836
of all bullshit, of all jobs
that are not very necessary.

00:14:42.536 --> 00:14:46.496
I started researching it more
and more and when I wrote

00:14:46.496 --> 00:14:48.616
about it people started
sending me emails and tweets

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:50.326
and you know, connecting
on Facebook

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:51.196
and saying, "Yes, yes, yes."

00:14:51.606 --> 00:14:53.196
&gt;&gt; I have one of those jobs.

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:55.066
&gt;&gt; Yes, obviously
this is about me.

00:14:56.016 --> 00:14:58.946
Actually, I've done a few
events, one event just

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:01.916
after the election
of Donald Trump.

00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:05.956
It was probably also because
people were really rethinking

00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:09.836
our lives, you know, that week.

00:15:10.016 --> 00:15:11.276
[ Laughter ]

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:13.186
And I was doing an event, and
the chair asked the audience,

00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:14.156
"Who has a bullshit job?"

00:15:14.156 --> 00:15:17.256
And I think about a third of
all hands went up in the air.

00:15:17.886 --> 00:15:20.346
&gt;&gt; So define a bullshit job.

00:15:21.096 --> 00:15:22.126
&gt;&gt; I don't know,
that's not for me.

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:23.756
That's the brilliant
thing about --

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.906
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what makes
it a bullshit job?

00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:28.626
&gt;&gt; People can define it
for themselves, right?

00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:31.786
So if people say about their own
job that it doesn't add anything

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:34.536
of value, that they're
basically just sending emails

00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:38.056
to other people all day or
writing reports no one reads,

00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:41.736
or inventing financial products
that only destroy value.

00:15:43.051 --> 00:15:45.051
[ Laughter ]

00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:45.846
&gt;&gt; It sounds like politics.

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.286
&gt;&gt; Trying to get people to
click on ads all the time.

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:49.636
I mean, that's basically
what a big part

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:50.796
of the economy is right now.

00:15:50.796 --> 00:15:54.656
There's some interesting
research from when we look

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:58.056
at what graduates of the
Ivy League universities

00:15:58.056 --> 00:15:58.836
in the US do.

00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:01.836
You know, just 30 or 40 years
ago they all went to work

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:05.366
for NGO's, the universities,
government, et cetera.

00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:09.676
Nowadays they go either to
Wall Street or Silicon Valley.

00:16:09.676 --> 00:16:11.116
What do they do in Wall Street?

00:16:11.266 --> 00:16:12.666
They start rent seeking.

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:14.986
They start actually
destroying value.

00:16:15.136 --> 00:16:17.726
If you don't believe me,
read the recent reports

00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:19.306
from the International
Monetary Fund.

00:16:19.306 --> 00:16:20.746
I mean, they're basically
saying the same thing.

00:16:21.256 --> 00:16:24.986
And Silicon Valley, well there's
a great quote from someone

00:16:24.986 --> 00:16:27.476
who worked at Facebook
for a few years.

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:32.406
And he said that the best minds
of my generation are thinking

00:16:32.406 --> 00:16:33.926
about how to make
people click ads.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:38.056
And that's pretty sad, isn't it?

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:42.596
&gt;&gt; There was also, you
write about the strikes

00:16:42.596 --> 00:16:48.426
and different classes of
workers going out on strike.

00:16:48.526 --> 00:16:49.336
Talk us through that.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.326
&gt;&gt; Well, I was just thinking,

00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:53.936
there is one other
way you can find

00:16:53.936 --> 00:16:55.406
if you have a bullshit
job, yes or no.

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:59.396
I mean, just stop doing it,
right, and see what happens.

00:17:00.031 --> 00:17:02.031
[ Laughter ]

00:17:02.046 --> 00:17:02.836
&gt;&gt; Another scientific
experiment.

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:03.496
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:17:03.726 --> 00:17:05.886
I'm just going to look
throughout history

00:17:05.886 --> 00:17:08.326
at what happened when different
professions went on strike.

00:17:08.836 --> 00:17:11.096
So at first I thought, you know,
I want to look at a profession

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.856
that is really, really
important, that if they go

00:17:12.856 --> 00:17:13.946
on strike, it's a disaster.

00:17:14.216 --> 00:17:16.396
I thought the doctors are
probably a good example.

00:17:16.796 --> 00:17:18.946
So I looked it up, and actually
when doctors go on strike,

00:17:18.946 --> 00:17:20.256
life expectancy goes up.

00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:22.066
[ Laughter ]

00:17:22.066 --> 00:17:23.846
So that was probably
not a very good example.

00:17:24.056 --> 00:17:26.966
But I thought, well,
probably garbage collectors.

00:17:26.966 --> 00:17:28.266
They are probably
a good example.

00:17:28.266 --> 00:17:31.356
And throughout history,
you know, whenever they go

00:17:31.356 --> 00:17:33.156
on strike, it is a disaster.

00:17:33.326 --> 00:17:36.716
So in the book I tell
the story of a strike

00:17:36.716 --> 00:17:39.666
of garbage collectors
in New York in 1968.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.916
It lasted for just six days

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:43.976
and the emergency state
had to be declared.

00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:46.166
And it turns out, you know,
a big city like New York,

00:17:46.426 --> 00:17:48.946
they really cannot do
without garbage collectors.

00:17:49.626 --> 00:17:52.856
And then I wondered, you know,

00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:56.656
has it ever happened
throughout all of world history

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.446
that the bankers went on strike?

00:17:58.446 --> 00:17:59.876
I was really curious about that.

00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:02.326
So I started researching
it and researching it

00:18:02.326 --> 00:18:07.386
and I started actually, I don't
know, 3000 BC with the rise

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:08.606
of finance, et cetera.

00:18:09.146 --> 00:18:11.626
And I found only one example
in all of world history,

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.416
and this was in Ireland, 1970.

00:18:13.816 --> 00:18:16.726
The bankers were angry that
their wages were not keeping

00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:19.966
up with inflation, so they said,
"You know what, you'll have it.

00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:22.826
We'll just stop working and then
you'll see just how important

00:18:22.826 --> 00:18:23.116
we are."

00:18:23.606 --> 00:18:25.876
And at that point, all the
experts, all the economists,

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:28.286
they all predicted this
would be a heart attack

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:29.316
for the economy, right?

00:18:29.446 --> 00:18:31.406
We really cannot do
without these bankers.

00:18:32.006 --> 00:18:38.506
The strike started and
nothing much happened actually.

00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:40.056
[ Laughter ]

00:18:40.056 --> 00:18:41.986
The garbage collector
strike was six days

00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:44.776
and this strike was
six months actually.

00:18:45.276 --> 00:18:47.656
And then the bankers came
back and said, "All right,

00:18:47.656 --> 00:18:48.306
all right, all right."

00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:51.091
[ Laughter ]

00:18:51.166 --> 00:18:52.276
"We'll go back to
work this year."

00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:54.916
&gt;&gt; Who would have thought that
bankers have bullshit jobs?

00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:56.746
&gt;&gt; Who'd have thought, yeah?

00:18:58.031 --> 00:19:00.031
[ Laughter ]

00:19:00.046 --> 00:19:02.036
And I think what actually

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:04.266
in reality happened was
even more interesting,

00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:08.326
is that what the Irish did is
they immediately invented their

00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:09.636
own financial system.

00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:13.016
So they started writing
IOU's to each other you know,

00:19:13.016 --> 00:19:16.496
on the backs of cigar boxes or
on toilet paper or whatever.

00:19:16.896 --> 00:19:18.856
&gt;&gt; This is the Irish.

00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:20.116
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:19:20.506 --> 00:19:24.516
And what's also important
here were the pubs.

00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:27.316
So there were 15,000 pubs
at that time in Ireland.

00:19:27.776 --> 00:19:29.786
And the owners of the
pubs basically became the

00:19:29.786 --> 00:19:30.366
new bankers.

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.006
[ Laughter ]

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.626
&gt;&gt; That's so harsh.

00:19:36.016 --> 00:19:37.056
[ Laughter ]

00:19:37.056 --> 00:19:38.926
&gt;&gt; There's one economist who
later wrote that you know,

00:19:38.926 --> 00:19:40.946
if you sell liquids
to your clients,

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:42.306
then you probably
also know something

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.716
about their liquidity, right?

00:19:45.016 --> 00:19:46.136
[ Laughter ]

00:19:46.136 --> 00:19:46.826
So that is what happened.

00:19:46.826 --> 00:19:48.476
They invented a new
financial system.

00:19:48.476 --> 00:19:49.796
The economy just kept growing.

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:52.006
Businesses just kept operating.

00:19:52.156 --> 00:19:53.356
It wasn't a huge deal.

00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:57.276
And actually, when
one journalist wrote

00:19:57.276 --> 00:20:02.196
about this event, 20-30
years later, she said, "Well,

00:20:02.686 --> 00:20:05.516
people don't remember much about
it, probably because you know,

00:20:05.516 --> 00:20:06.606
it didn't change much."

00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:08.516
And that's probably why so
many people have forgotten

00:20:08.516 --> 00:20:11.096
about this, the one and
only strike of bankers

00:20:11.096 --> 00:20:12.326
in all of world history.

00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:15.526
And I think it also
shows that sure, I mean,

00:20:15.526 --> 00:20:19.036
we need a financial sector
or we need a money system.

00:20:19.466 --> 00:20:21.296
The Irish immediately
invented a new one.

00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:25.456
But we can do without
a lot of the bullshit

00:20:25.596 --> 00:20:27.046
that is in the current one.

00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:29.016
You know, all the
speculation and stuff.

00:20:29.726 --> 00:20:37.886
&gt;&gt; So if it makes as much
imminent sense as you say

00:20:38.396 --> 00:20:43.396
and so well articulate the idea
of the basic universal income,

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.376
why hasn't it been
more widely adopted?

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:48.876
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:20:48.876 --> 00:20:53.646
As a historian, I don't
believe in big historical laws

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:54.806
or reasons or whatever.

00:20:54.806 --> 00:20:59.156
But if you really delve into
the history of basic income

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:02.516
in the '70's, that
you'll just be astonished

00:21:02.576 --> 00:21:06.316
by the coincidences and that
it could easily have gone the

00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:06.756
other way.

00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:11.796
What I think is fascinating is
that if you look at these kind

00:21:11.796 --> 00:21:15.896
of utopian ideas, crazy
ideas you could say,

00:21:16.306 --> 00:21:19.276
is that they always start
on the fringes of society.

00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:21.556
They always start with
people who are dismissed

00:21:21.556 --> 00:21:24.016
as unreasonable and
unrealistic, et cetera.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:27.086
And then they start to
move towards the centre.

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.486
So if you look at the basic
income debate, you know,

00:21:29.486 --> 00:21:31.756
it started in the '60's
and then at the end

00:21:31.756 --> 00:21:33.846
of the '60's everyone thought
it was going to be happening

00:21:33.846 --> 00:21:35.706
at the beginning of the '70's.

00:21:36.126 --> 00:21:38.766
Or Nixon said, "Sure,
let's implement it."

00:21:39.356 --> 00:21:40.726
And I think we can sort

00:21:40.726 --> 00:21:43.496
of see history repeating
itself right now.

00:21:43.496 --> 00:21:48.386
I mean, just a few years ago,
in 2013 when I first wrote

00:21:48.386 --> 00:21:52.176
about basic income -- well, you
should know that the Dutch word

00:21:52.176 --> 00:21:56.736
for basic income is [Dutch word]
which sort of means base salary.

00:21:57.256 --> 00:21:59.546
And we only used it in
one context back then,

00:21:59.546 --> 00:22:01.696
as the base salary
of the bankers.

00:22:02.186 --> 00:22:05.976
So when I wrote about basic
income, people thought,

00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:07.966
"You want to have base
salaries for bankers?

00:22:07.966 --> 00:22:08.766
What are you talking about?"

00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:12.846
And now, I mean just a few
years later you see all these

00:22:12.846 --> 00:22:14.166
experiments popping up

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.466
and actually sometimes even
politicians are debating it.

00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:19.236
But I think it also shows you

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:21.446
that it never begins
with politicians.

00:22:21.746 --> 00:22:22.626
It only ends there.

00:22:22.916 --> 00:22:25.236
Just like it almost
ended with Nixon,

00:22:25.326 --> 00:22:26.776
but it will never start there.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:33.706
&gt;&gt; Is it now gaining currency
and a certain inevitability

00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:40.066
because of the rapid pace
of automation and the talk

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:41.486
of artificial intelligence,

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.366
meaning robots are going
to take all our jobs?

00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:47.696
You know, some of the
predictions of 50-60%

00:22:47.696 --> 00:22:51.016
of all jobs done now won't exist
in sort of 20 or 30 years --

00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:54.126
is that just going to
necessitate this conversation

00:22:54.126 --> 00:22:58.046
where we have to find a way
to survive one way or another?

00:22:59.236 --> 00:23:03.036
&gt;&gt; Well, again, as a historian,
if you look at that debate,

00:23:03.186 --> 00:23:05.696
that the robots are going
to take all our jobs,

00:23:06.096 --> 00:23:08.466
you sort of have the feeling
like, "I heard this before."

00:23:09.146 --> 00:23:12.426
And then you go back to
the archives for the '60's

00:23:12.426 --> 00:23:13.726
for example, or also

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.756
in the 1920's people
were saying that as well.

00:23:16.646 --> 00:23:17.856
This is a very old story.

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:20.086
So if you are a journalist right
now working for, I don't know,

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:22.556
Wired or something like
that, or a tech magazine,

00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:25.286
I really recommend go to
the archives, copy, paste,

00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:27.226
publish again and
you're done for the day.

00:23:27.586 --> 00:23:31.816
So I think what we
underestimated is

00:23:32.196 --> 00:23:35.106
that capitalism has a quite
extraordinary ability to come

00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:37.446
up with new bullshit
jobs, right?

00:23:37.966 --> 00:23:39.576
This can go on for
a very long time.

00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:41.326
And that's really something

00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:42.796
that people didn't
predict in the '60's.

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.686
They thought, "You know,
if the robots are going

00:23:44.686 --> 00:23:47.056
to take all those jobs,
which they did, you know,

00:23:47.056 --> 00:23:48.706
then we'll just start
living the good life

00:23:48.706 --> 00:23:50.886
and boredom will be the great
challenge of the future."

00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:54.166
But they never thought that
capitalism would be so adaptive.

00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:59.396
And I mean now it's 30% or 40%,
could be 60% in the future.

00:23:59.916 --> 00:24:01.026
Could be 100%.

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:03.836
I mean, it's theoretically
possible that we'll live

00:24:03.836 --> 00:24:05.736
in a society where
everyone is just pretending

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:09.406
to work while we're all in
reality browsing Facebook.

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:11.836
I mean, many workplaces are
already like that, right?

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:13.286
&gt;&gt; Exactly what I was thinking.

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:17.256
Yeah. Look, one of the
other issues you raise

00:24:17.586 --> 00:24:20.776
in the book is the
concept of open borders,

00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:24.426
which we've actually talked
about on this stage before.

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:29.946
It's a radical concept
and for most people,

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:32.996
especially the Parliament,
they think chaos.

00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:37.066
You only have to look to Germany
they would say and what happened

00:24:37.066 --> 00:24:39.106
with a million people
flooding in.

00:24:39.856 --> 00:24:40.886
&gt;&gt; Well, it's not chaos there.

00:24:40.886 --> 00:24:42.586
I live quite close to Germany

00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:44.526
and they're doing
quite well actually.

00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:47.846
&gt;&gt; It's certainly the story the
politicians want to tell us.

00:24:47.846 --> 00:24:48.656
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:24:49.136 --> 00:24:50.996
You know, the idea
of open borders

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:53.146
around the globe is
definitely the most radical idea

00:24:53.146 --> 00:24:53.626
in my book.

00:24:54.056 --> 00:24:56.756
But it might also be
the most important one.

00:24:57.006 --> 00:24:59.466
Because I believe that
Utopian thinking always starts

00:24:59.466 --> 00:25:01.276
with thinking about
what is wrong

00:25:01.596 --> 00:25:03.706
with our current society
or the current world.

00:25:04.126 --> 00:25:06.506
It always starts with the
injustices in the hear and now.

00:25:07.076 --> 00:25:10.266
So a basic income is the
answer to millions of people

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:12.506
in meaningless jobs,
millions of people in poverty,

00:25:12.936 --> 00:25:15.626
the idea of a 15-hour work-week
is the answer to you know,

00:25:15.746 --> 00:25:18.226
so many people that are
completely stressed out

00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:20.926
and have no time
to devote to things

00:25:20.926 --> 00:25:22.156
that they really care about.

00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:24.116
And open borders is the answer

00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:26.816
to probably the biggest
injustice in all of the world,

00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:30.526
is just the incredible
inequality that still exists.

00:25:31.176 --> 00:25:34.146
And meanwhile, we've got
a mountain of evidence.

00:25:34.146 --> 00:25:36.336
And I go over all that
evidence in the chapter

00:25:36.336 --> 00:25:39.716
about open borders that shows
that so many of the things

00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:44.556
that we have against immigration
are simply factually incorrect.

00:25:44.556 --> 00:25:47.686
So they're not lazy.

00:25:47.686 --> 00:25:49.746
They don't take our jobs.

00:25:49.746 --> 00:25:51.376
They actually create more jobs.

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.656
It's not true that they're
all violent criminals,

00:25:54.656 --> 00:25:55.366
et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:55.366 --> 00:25:57.416
If you look at the actual
data, it's simply not true.

00:25:57.886 --> 00:26:00.696
So I felt I had to talk

00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:03.676
about that most utopian
of ideas as well.

00:26:04.476 --> 00:26:06.386
&gt;&gt; What happens to the
countries left behind?

00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:11.746
So the countries that are
not wealthy or prosperous

00:26:11.746 --> 00:26:15.176
and in conflict and so on?

00:26:15.846 --> 00:26:18.356
If everyone flees, what happens?

00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:19.926
They just become failed states.

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:23.396
&gt;&gt; I think the evidence shows
that home countries benefit

00:26:23.396 --> 00:26:24.576
from immigration as well.

00:26:24.726 --> 00:26:27.926
So if we look at something
like the amount of money

00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:30.186
that immigrants send back
to their own country,

00:26:30.476 --> 00:26:32.866
it's triple the amount of
official development aid.

00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:34.076
So that's pretty huge.

00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:36.456
And if we have actually
breathing borders,

00:26:36.586 --> 00:26:39.176
so people are able to get
into a different country

00:26:39.176 --> 00:26:43.096
but also get back, then you
know, almost everyone wants

00:26:43.096 --> 00:26:46.036
to get back to their home
country at some point.

00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:51.256
There's some fascinating
evidence about the border

00:26:51.766 --> 00:26:53.796
between Mexico and the US here.

00:26:54.156 --> 00:26:58.706
So in the 1970's and in the
1980's, hundreds of thousands

00:26:58.706 --> 00:27:00.166
of Mexicans moved to the US,

00:27:00.446 --> 00:27:02.446
and it was very easy
to get to the US.

00:27:02.706 --> 00:27:04.816
And about 80% of them
moved back again,

00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:06.726
because it was easy
to get back as well.

00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:11.246
Now, still hundreds of thousands
of Mexicans go to the US,

00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:12.336
but they don't go back anymore.

00:27:12.776 --> 00:27:14.506
So that's what you do
when you build walls.

00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:17.166
People still come, but
they don't go back anymore.

00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:20.396
So they're very, very
counterproductive.

00:27:20.396 --> 00:27:22.056
So the same thing is
happening in Europe right now.

00:27:22.296 --> 00:27:24.766
The higher the walls, the more
illegal immigrants you're going

00:27:25.486 --> 00:27:27.286
to get.

00:27:27.486 --> 00:27:29.706
&gt;&gt; Is there likely to be
any political appetite

00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:31.526
for open borders anytime soon?

00:27:32.456 --> 00:27:33.106
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:27:33.276 --> 00:27:36.576
I mean, I think that the real
politicians are not in places

00:27:36.576 --> 00:27:39.206
like Cambara or Washington
or Westminster

00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:39.916
or something like that.

00:27:40.316 --> 00:27:42.596
I think that real politics
with a capital P is

00:27:42.596 --> 00:27:45.866
about changing the zeitgeist,
right, talking about new ideas,

00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:46.976
what we're trying to do here.

00:27:48.046 --> 00:27:53.776
And if more and more
people recognise

00:27:53.776 --> 00:27:57.486
that the status quo is
simply infeasible, you know,

00:27:57.486 --> 00:28:00.736
that we need new ideas, which is
I believe happening right now --

00:28:00.786 --> 00:28:04.366
I mean, after 2016
with Trump and Brexit,

00:28:04.736 --> 00:28:06.746
I mean it's obviously
clear to so many people

00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:08.526
that we can't go on like this.

00:28:08.706 --> 00:28:14.316
So yeah, I always say that I'm
not an optimist or a pessimist.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.366
I'm a possiblist.

00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:17.546
You know, I believe that
things can be different.

00:28:17.886 --> 00:28:20.066
But if we want it to
be different, you know,

00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:22.546
we've got to get up and
do something, right?

00:28:23.776 --> 00:28:25.806
&gt;&gt; With the issue
of open borders,

00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:28.956
just in a very pragmatic
sort of logistic sense,

00:28:28.956 --> 00:28:31.936
if everyone floods into a
country at the same time,

00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:33.236
how does the state cope?

00:28:33.536 --> 00:28:34.436
Where do they sleep?

00:28:34.596 --> 00:28:37.396
How are they fed if they
haven't got any money?

00:28:38.206 --> 00:28:39.246
What do they do?

00:28:39.396 --> 00:28:40.066
&gt;&gt; Now don't get me wrong,

00:28:40.106 --> 00:28:44.516
the idea of open borders is a
utopian vision for the future.

00:28:44.836 --> 00:28:49.836
I think that the road to
utopia is always about a lot

00:28:49.836 --> 00:28:51.826
of small steps that you
can take in the direction.

00:28:52.216 --> 00:28:53.716
Like taking a little
bit more immigrants

00:28:53.716 --> 00:28:54.806
and a little bit
more, et cetera.

00:28:54.986 --> 00:28:58.106
Experimenting along the way
and seeing what you can manage.

00:28:58.526 --> 00:29:01.126
I think that is what we
should be striving for,

00:29:01.126 --> 00:29:04.366
and maybe in the future,
you know, in the year 2200

00:29:04.366 --> 00:29:08.936
or 2300 we'll look back on our
time and wonder about you know,

00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:13.806
what a crazy, unjust system it
was, that people were not free

00:29:13.806 --> 00:29:14.976
to move wherever they wanted.

00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:23.276
&gt;&gt; Underlying a lot of what you
talk about as being utopia is

00:29:23.276 --> 00:29:25.796
about trying to address
inequality.

00:29:25.836 --> 00:29:29.276
And I'm wondering
what you thought

00:29:29.276 --> 00:29:32.026
of the Occupy movement
coming as it did

00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:34.146
after the global
financial crisis.

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:36.006
It seemed sort of
very well-timed

00:29:36.106 --> 00:29:40.296
to capture the international
anger about inequality

00:29:40.296 --> 00:29:44.126
and the mood would have seemed
to have been right for change.

00:29:44.486 --> 00:29:47.026
Did you think the
Occupy movement was a bit

00:29:47.026 --> 00:29:48.026
of a lost opportunity?

00:29:48.556 --> 00:29:51.226
&gt;&gt; I think so, yes.

00:29:51.466 --> 00:29:56.286
What I've always been really
fascinated by is the huge role

00:29:56.286 --> 00:29:59.906
that crises play
in world history.

00:30:00.046 --> 00:30:02.556
So if we look for example at
the rise of neo-liberalism,

00:30:02.556 --> 00:30:05.316
it's quite interesting that
it all started at the end

00:30:05.316 --> 00:30:09.096
of the 1940's with Milton
Friedman the economist,

00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:11.306
Fredrick von Haag the
philosopher coming together

00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:12.666
with a few other guys.

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:15.056
And they were very
lonely back then.

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:17.496
They said, "You know, everyone
is a socialist right now.

00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:19.706
Everyone is a Keynesian
right now.

00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:23.056
But what we are going to
do is we are going to try

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:25.646
to build a movement,
develop ideas, you know,

00:30:25.956 --> 00:30:28.376
start new institutions,
think tanks, et cetera.

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:31.036
And there will be a time at
some point in the future,

00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:33.306
and it might take years and
years, but there will be a time

00:30:33.746 --> 00:30:36.876
when the current economic
system or the current body

00:30:36.876 --> 00:30:38.486
of it just breaks down."

00:30:39.436 --> 00:30:40.396
And they were right.

00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:43.936
I mean, in the '70's with
stagflation and the oil crisis

00:30:44.126 --> 00:30:47.436
and the inflation, et
cetera, it was suddenly clear

00:30:48.136 --> 00:30:50.406
that it was time for
something new according

00:30:50.406 --> 00:30:51.386
to many people at least.

00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:53.716
And they really grabbed
that opportunity

00:30:53.716 --> 00:30:56.446
and they injected those new
ideas, neo-liberal ideas

00:30:56.486 --> 00:30:59.076
that they had been inventing
and developing for so long

00:30:59.526 --> 00:31:00.766
into the public debate.

00:31:00.956 --> 00:31:02.656
So it wasn't Reagan or Thatcher

00:31:02.656 --> 00:31:05.496
that started this
revolution, you know?

00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:08.996
They inherited these
ideas from other people.

00:31:09.606 --> 00:31:13.236
The problem with 2008
with the financial crash

00:31:13.236 --> 00:31:16.726
and the Occupy movement was
that there were no new ideas.

00:31:17.186 --> 00:31:20.966
I mean, I think that is
still the problem so often

00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:21.986
with the left these days,

00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:25.276
is that it only knows
what it's against, right?

00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:27.526
Against austerity,
against the establishment,

00:31:27.526 --> 00:31:31.406
against homophobia, against
racism, against everything.

00:31:31.706 --> 00:31:34.256
I mean, that was even a title
of a book recently published

00:31:34.256 --> 00:31:36.536
by a New York intellectual,
Against Everything.

00:31:36.776 --> 00:31:38.316
First chapter, Against Exercise.

00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:41.031
[ Laughter ]

00:31:41.046 --> 00:31:41.816
I'm against it all as well.

00:31:42.086 --> 00:31:44.176
But you also have to be
for something, right?

00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:46.886
We need some vision
of where we want to go

00:31:47.176 --> 00:31:49.106
because that is what
progress is always like.

00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:51.486
It is always, as Oscar
Wilde once wrote,

00:31:51.486 --> 00:31:53.126
"The realisation of utopias."

00:31:53.196 --> 00:31:55.166
So we need some vision
of utopia.

00:31:56.216 --> 00:32:01.076
&gt;&gt; So you mentioned in the
book that back in the '70's,

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:04.526
this was trialled in
Canada, the basic income.

00:32:04.736 --> 00:32:05.096
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:32:05.096 --> 00:32:07.416
&gt;&gt; Talk us through that
and why it was abandoned.

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:12.186
&gt;&gt; This experiment
started in 1974 and it was

00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:14.736
in Dothan, a small town there.

00:32:15.246 --> 00:32:17.166
What they did is, well,

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.746
they basically eradicated
poverty there.

00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:22.626
So everyone that fell below
the poverty line, his income

00:32:22.626 --> 00:32:24.346
or her income was
immediately topped up.

00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:26.406
It was called the
town with no poverty.

00:32:26.636 --> 00:32:29.086
&gt;&gt; How many people in the town?

00:32:29.126 --> 00:32:30.186
&gt;&gt; A few thousand.

00:32:30.186 --> 00:32:31.876
So the amount of families

00:32:31.876 --> 00:32:35.346
that received support
was 1,000 families.

00:32:35.806 --> 00:32:39.226
Now what happened is that for
four years there were a lot

00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:42.356
of economists and
sociologists and anthropologists

00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:45.186
who all descended on the
town and did their research,

00:32:45.256 --> 00:32:48.156
did interviews, collected
data, et cetera.

00:32:48.796 --> 00:32:50.256
Now, after those four years,

00:32:50.256 --> 00:32:52.566
they wanted to start
analysing the results.

00:32:52.946 --> 00:32:54.886
But you know, it was 1978

00:32:54.886 --> 00:32:57.526
and a new conservative
government had come to power.

00:32:58.236 --> 00:32:59.096
And they thought, "You know,

00:32:59.096 --> 00:33:00.826
this is a really
weird experiment.

00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:01.606
What are you doing?

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:04.336
I mean, you're just giving free
money to people and now you want

00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:05.276
to analyse the results?

00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:06.926
Well, we already know
what the results are.

00:33:07.336 --> 00:33:09.626
It was a disaster,
I mean, obviously."

00:33:09.736 --> 00:33:13.276
So there was no money left
to analyse the results.

00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:16.306
What they did is they put all
the interviews, all the data,

00:33:16.306 --> 00:33:18.646
they put it all in the
archives, 2,000 boxes

00:33:18.836 --> 00:33:21.036
and everyone forgot about it.

00:33:21.636 --> 00:33:23.916
It was only 25 years later

00:33:24.056 --> 00:33:28.126
that a Canadian professor Evelyn
Forgier found the records,

00:33:28.186 --> 00:33:31.746
did the analysis and discovered
that it had been a huge success.

00:33:32.326 --> 00:33:33.866
Healthcare costs went down.

00:33:34.106 --> 00:33:38.576
Hospital admissions went down by
8.5% which is huge if you think

00:33:38.576 --> 00:33:40.666
about just how much we're
spending on healthcare

00:33:40.716 --> 00:33:41.936
in developed countries
these days.

00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:45.426
Again, crime went down,
performance better in school,

00:33:45.426 --> 00:33:46.866
domestic violence went down.

00:33:47.186 --> 00:33:48.856
And mental health
complaints were down.

00:33:49.276 --> 00:33:53.466
And you know, what people
worry most about or often is

00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:55.196
that you know, was
everyone lazy?

00:33:55.406 --> 00:33:59.596
No. Like total work hours
declined by about 1%

00:33:59.966 --> 00:34:02.206
and almost every time
this was compensated

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:06.346
by people doing more volunteer
work or going to school longer

00:34:06.596 --> 00:34:07.326
or that kind of thing.

00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:11.706
So this is one of the
most thorough basic income

00:34:11.706 --> 00:34:13.686
experiments that was ever done,

00:34:13.756 --> 00:34:16.186
but we had forgotten
about it for so long.

00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:20.166
&gt;&gt; Why was it abandoned
if presumably,

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:22.666
anecdotally at least,
they knew it was working,

00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:24.756
they would have felt
that it was working?

00:34:25.026 --> 00:34:27.036
&gt;&gt; I think it was
really the zeitgeist

00:34:27.036 --> 00:34:28.236
that was shifting back then.

00:34:28.276 --> 00:34:31.776
So I mean, it was in the '70's

00:34:31.866 --> 00:34:36.126
that obviously neo-liberalism
took off, right?

00:34:36.926 --> 00:34:40.086
And a conservative government
came into power in 1978

00:34:40.436 --> 00:34:42.876
which was already incredibly
influenced by these ideas.

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:46.606
I mean, it was only a few
years later that Reagan

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:48.186
and Thatcher took the stage.

00:34:48.756 --> 00:34:50.736
So yeah, I think the
basic income sort

00:34:50.736 --> 00:34:52.376
of missed its opportunity
to become real.

00:34:52.576 --> 00:34:59.076
&gt;&gt; If you want to start
making your way to the --

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:00.416
it's very hard for
us to see over here,

00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.836
but if you've got a
question for Rutger,

00:35:03.136 --> 00:35:07.266
just hop over to number
one or number two over here

00:35:07.266 --> 00:35:10.436
and I'll draw you
into the conversation.

00:35:11.046 --> 00:35:12.936
Go ahead.

00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:13.286
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:35:13.286 --> 00:35:15.386
&gt;&gt; You're quick.

00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:17.346
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Dani.

00:35:17.476 --> 00:35:21.806
I'm actually part of the
Basic Income Network.

00:35:22.076 --> 00:35:22.286
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:35:22.366 --> 00:35:25.706
&gt;&gt; We're a global
group that are trying

00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:27.716
to promote basic
income around the world.

00:35:27.716 --> 00:35:30.826
And part of the challenge
that I'm having in Australia

00:35:30.826 --> 00:35:33.286
at the moment is that the
conversation isn't being

00:35:33.286 --> 00:35:34.156
taken seriously.

00:35:34.566 --> 00:35:36.956
I think you saw the
idea very much,

00:35:37.046 --> 00:35:39.086
that a lot of people
were nodding their heads.

00:35:39.086 --> 00:35:40.446
So I think that's
a really good sign.

00:35:40.856 --> 00:35:45.416
But what's your advice
for getting corporations,

00:35:46.006 --> 00:35:49.906
getting politicians to actually
start listening and to listen

00:35:49.906 --> 00:35:53.126
to people like me and not think
I'm just some leftist young

00:35:53.126 --> 00:35:56.366
person who doesn't know
what she's talking about?

00:35:56.366 --> 00:35:58.876
&gt;&gt; What I've discovered
in the past few years is

00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:01.956
that it's really effective
to use right-wing language

00:36:02.096 --> 00:36:03.946
to defend progressive ideas.

00:36:05.016 --> 00:36:06.046
[ Laughter ]

00:36:06.046 --> 00:36:08.186
So what I'm saying all the
time to these business leaders

00:36:08.186 --> 00:36:09.196
or politicians, I'm saying,

00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:10.536
"Well maybe you don't
have a heart,

00:36:10.536 --> 00:36:12.066
but at least you have
a wallet, right?"

00:36:12.386 --> 00:36:12.476
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:12.476 --> 00:36:14.776
&gt;&gt; So it simply makes
financial sense.

00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:18.866
I think it's no coincidence
that so many people

00:36:18.866 --> 00:36:20.376
in Silicon Valley
are now interested.

00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:26.936
If we sort of point out that
basic income is an investment

00:36:27.376 --> 00:36:29.676
that in the long
run pays for itself,

00:36:29.676 --> 00:36:31.956
and in that sense it's
literally free money,

00:36:32.476 --> 00:36:37.826
that is probably much
more convincing to people

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:39.506
on the other side of
the political spectrum

00:36:39.736 --> 00:36:41.706
than if you just
keep on saying, "Oh,

00:36:41.706 --> 00:36:43.206
the current system is so unfair.

00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:45.476
And we need to pity these
poor people, et cetera,

00:36:45.476 --> 00:36:47.886
and it's immoral to let
them live in poverty."

00:36:48.106 --> 00:36:49.346
Which I think is true.

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:54.886
But it will only appeal to a
certain part of the population

00:36:54.886 --> 00:36:57.296
and we need to get
bigger than that.

00:36:57.296 --> 00:36:59.896
&gt;&gt; And when you're talking
about the financial benefits

00:36:59.896 --> 00:37:01.866
and it paying itself
back, you're talking

00:37:01.866 --> 00:37:04.146
about the lower health costs

00:37:04.146 --> 00:37:05.196
and all the other
things that accrue?

00:37:05.196 --> 00:37:05.766
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:37:05.766 --> 00:37:09.596
There was one study in
the 1990's, actually sort

00:37:09.596 --> 00:37:10.636
of a natural experiment.

00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:13.806
What happened is that a casino
opened in North Carolina

00:37:14.456 --> 00:37:17.766
and it was operated by the
eastern band of Cherokee Indians

00:37:17.956 --> 00:37:21.466
and they were allowed to just
distribute the earnings among

00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:22.026
their members.

00:37:22.416 --> 00:37:25.306
So suddenly thousands of people,
many of them left in poverty,

00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:27.726
received $8,000-9,000.

00:37:27.936 --> 00:37:30.686
And there's an economist from
UCLA, his name is Randal Aiki

00:37:30.686 --> 00:37:33.976
who later calculated
that the savings again

00:37:33.976 --> 00:37:36.876
in lower health care costs, kids
performing better in school,

00:37:36.876 --> 00:37:39.326
lower crime rates, these
savings were bigger

00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:40.876
than the cash grants themselves.

00:37:41.306 --> 00:37:42.936
Now just think about that.

00:37:43.086 --> 00:37:45.766
That is really radical
and really fascinating.

00:37:45.766 --> 00:37:50.706
It has huge implications for
what we should do about poverty

00:37:51.126 --> 00:37:52.576
and about this whole debate.

00:37:52.576 --> 00:37:54.126
Because normally the
debate goes like this.

00:37:54.176 --> 00:37:56.076
The left says, "We've got
to help these poor people."

00:37:56.076 --> 00:37:59.056
And then the right says, "Yeah,
maybe, but it's too expensive."

00:37:59.366 --> 00:38:00.236
End of debate, right?

00:38:01.816 --> 00:38:04.666
But you can really flip
it around if it's like,

00:38:05.526 --> 00:38:07.136
"We've got to do this
because it makes sense.

00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:08.346
I mean, this is an investment.

00:38:08.346 --> 00:38:10.546
It's just a good
business decision."

00:38:10.856 --> 00:38:14.106
&gt;&gt; Does it end up harmonising
what everybody says?

00:38:14.336 --> 00:38:19.116
So it in itself is
more equalising?

00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:21.036
&gt;&gt; That's a really
great question.

00:38:21.306 --> 00:38:24.836
And it's also one of the
most overlooked effects

00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:25.636
of a basic income.

00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:29.756
So just imagine, if you are a
garbage collector, a teacher

00:38:29.756 --> 00:38:32.876
or a nurse and you suddenly
receive a basic income,

00:38:33.296 --> 00:38:36.526
well it is also a
universal strike fund, right?

00:38:37.006 --> 00:38:39.206
You can go on strike
all the time.

00:38:39.206 --> 00:38:40.806
So you'll have a lot
more bargaining power

00:38:40.806 --> 00:38:42.746
and your wage will
probably have to go up.

00:38:43.076 --> 00:38:45.876
Now if you are a banker
or consultant or a lawyer

00:38:45.876 --> 00:38:47.486
or whatever, and
you go on strike,

00:38:47.486 --> 00:38:48.566
well nothing much happens.

00:38:48.876 --> 00:38:50.516
So you don't have
extra bargaining power

00:38:50.516 --> 00:38:53.106
and your wage will probably
go down a little bit.

00:38:53.686 --> 00:38:55.746
So if we implement
the basic income,

00:38:55.796 --> 00:38:59.276
in the long run wages will start
reflecting the social value

00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:01.266
of different jobs much more.

00:39:01.616 --> 00:39:03.276
And we could move
towards a society

00:39:03.276 --> 00:39:05.126
where cleaners earn
more than bankers.

00:39:05.596 --> 00:39:07.466
And I'd like to live in
that society actually.

00:39:08.016 --> 00:39:10.016
[ Laughter ]

00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:16.596
[ Applause ]

00:39:17.096 --> 00:39:20.206
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'd like to know where
will the money come from?

00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:22.696
Will it be like a tax
of the multinationals?

00:39:23.046 --> 00:39:25.416
And also, who are your
staunchest critics

00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:26.616
and how do you navigate them?

00:39:28.656 --> 00:39:31.636
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is obviously
a very important part

00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:32.816
of the whole basic
income debate.

00:39:32.816 --> 00:39:35.286
Like how are we going
to finance it?

00:39:35.946 --> 00:39:39.046
And I believe that the devil
is really in the details.

00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:40.806
So there are many,
many ways to do it.

00:39:40.806 --> 00:39:43.876
There are some forms of
basic income out there

00:39:44.766 --> 00:39:46.446
that I believe would
be a disaster.

00:39:46.746 --> 00:39:50.686
There are some neo-libertarians
on the right who say,

00:39:51.046 --> 00:39:53.006
"Let's just get rid of
the whole welfare state.

00:39:53.326 --> 00:39:55.236
You know, let's get rid
of universal healthcare,

00:39:55.236 --> 00:39:56.906
let's get rid of
public education

00:39:57.286 --> 00:40:00.976
and just give people one cash
grant transfer and that's it."

00:40:01.856 --> 00:40:03.186
That's not what I'm arguing for.

00:40:03.316 --> 00:40:05.616
I think that basic income should
be the crowning achievement

00:40:05.616 --> 00:40:07.796
of capitalism, but also
of social democracy.

00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:11.536
It should really be
implemented as a supplement

00:40:11.676 --> 00:40:14.886
to universal healthcare
and public education,

00:40:14.886 --> 00:40:17.496
which are incredibly
important achievements

00:40:17.496 --> 00:40:19.346
of the 20th century.

00:40:19.476 --> 00:40:21.986
Now I'd like to finance
the basic income in a way

00:40:22.106 --> 00:40:25.766
with taxes, so not just print
out money, but with taxes

00:40:25.846 --> 00:40:28.106
from the welfare
state right now.

00:40:28.846 --> 00:40:31.636
I'd like to fund it in a way
that it will reduce inequality.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:36.376
And well, there are probably
different sources you'd need,

00:40:36.466 --> 00:40:39.806
but the most obvious thing
to start with is wealth.

00:40:41.116 --> 00:40:44.846
Just if you look at the
incredible inequality

00:40:44.846 --> 00:40:47.016
that is growing around
the world, you know,

00:40:47.016 --> 00:40:51.156
in the western world as well,
I mean everyone has heard

00:40:51.156 --> 00:40:52.976
of Thomas Beckett, right?

00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:56.526
We didn't actually read his
book, but we know his argument.

00:40:56.656 --> 00:41:01.046
That's probably the most
logical lace to start.

00:41:01.686 --> 00:41:04.486
But there are many
versions out there.

00:41:04.486 --> 00:41:07.986
So we should be wary of --

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:10.326
well, it sometimes happens
that people say, "Oh,

00:41:10.396 --> 00:41:11.806
everyone is in favour
of basic income,"

00:41:11.806 --> 00:41:13.236
but we're actually talking
about different things.

00:41:14.016 --> 00:41:17.836
So that's something
to look out for.

00:41:18.016 --> 00:41:20.076
&gt;&gt; And the second part
of your question was,

00:41:20.156 --> 00:41:24.156
who are your staunchest critics
and how do you navigate them?

00:41:24.876 --> 00:41:29.976
&gt;&gt; I think that like the biggest
criticism that comes up time

00:41:29.976 --> 00:41:32.906
and time again is that
people basically say, "Well,

00:41:32.906 --> 00:41:34.636
this all sounds very
nice and well,

00:41:35.206 --> 00:41:37.126
but you've just got
a misguided view

00:41:37.126 --> 00:41:38.676
of what humanity
is really like."

00:41:38.846 --> 00:41:41.836
That is something that people
go back to all the time.

00:41:41.836 --> 00:41:47.296
Like in the end, humans are
just corrupt and we want

00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:49.676
to be free riders and you know,

00:41:49.786 --> 00:41:52.436
deep down we're just
monsters or animals.

00:41:52.436 --> 00:41:54.336
And civilisation is
this very thin layer

00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:57.366
and you're just being very
naïve about all this.

00:41:57.836 --> 00:41:59.946
What I think is that that vision

00:41:59.946 --> 00:42:02.056
of human nature is very
unrealistic and very naïve.

00:42:02.056 --> 00:42:06.566
That is something that the
evidence actually shows us.

00:42:06.856 --> 00:42:09.216
But deep down or fundamentally,

00:42:10.026 --> 00:42:12.226
the debate around basic
income is a debate

00:42:12.226 --> 00:42:13.806
around what we are really like.

00:42:14.456 --> 00:42:15.996
Are we nice and creative?

00:42:16.256 --> 00:42:18.066
Do we want to contribute
to the common good?

00:42:18.066 --> 00:42:20.056
You know, are we
essentially social beings,

00:42:20.916 --> 00:42:26.486
or are we all freeloaders, free
riders that just are selfish

00:42:26.486 --> 00:42:27.836
and want to get as
much for ourselves.

00:42:28.246 --> 00:42:31.636
That is the big debate that
is behind basic income.

00:42:32.476 --> 00:42:33.166
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:34.476
Yes?

00:42:35.626 --> 00:42:36.186
&gt;&gt; Hi, Rutger.

00:42:36.266 --> 00:42:38.976
Thank you for putting forth
your thoughts this afternoon.

00:42:39.276 --> 00:42:43.016
I'm a fan of the universal
basic income as an initiative.

00:42:43.126 --> 00:42:45.466
I've come across
it and read a bit

00:42:45.466 --> 00:42:46.916
on it the last couple of years.

00:42:47.116 --> 00:42:49.716
I think it's important for
it to be understood not

00:42:49.716 --> 00:42:52.176
as a new concept but
rather as something

00:42:52.176 --> 00:42:54.376
that has been around
for a while.

00:42:54.376 --> 00:42:57.206
Maybe it's just gotten lost
a bit in the last generation.

00:42:57.936 --> 00:43:02.226
I guess my thoughts on it is
that there seems to be a lot

00:43:02.226 --> 00:43:05.106
of distrust from both sides
of politics as to how it's

00:43:05.106 --> 00:43:07.016
to be administered on
a government level.

00:43:07.426 --> 00:43:11.026
So I suppose my question
is this:

00:43:11.366 --> 00:43:17.746
how best can it be administered
on a government level?

00:43:17.996 --> 00:43:19.346
Yeah, that's basically
my question.

00:43:19.906 --> 00:43:22.646
&gt;&gt; What will probably
not happen is

00:43:23.466 --> 00:43:25.946
that a basic income will be
implemented in one stroke.

00:43:26.636 --> 00:43:29.686
We will probably get
there gradually, you know,

00:43:29.956 --> 00:43:31.356
one small step after another.

00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:34.286
And there are many
roads to utopia.

00:43:34.906 --> 00:43:37.426
So one of the roads is
the roads of experiments.

00:43:37.456 --> 00:43:39.276
You know, just doing
more of those experiments

00:43:39.276 --> 00:43:41.196
and seeing what works
along the way.

00:43:41.226 --> 00:43:42.536
I mean, that's happening
in Finland,

00:43:42.536 --> 00:43:44.116
in Canada and in other places.

00:43:44.726 --> 00:43:45.916
The other thing you could do is

00:43:46.006 --> 00:43:50.946
to make our current welfare
system more basic income-ish,

00:43:51.156 --> 00:43:53.976
you know, to move it
in that direction,

00:43:54.126 --> 00:43:56.206
make it a bit more
unconditional,

00:43:56.636 --> 00:43:58.306
make it a big more universal.

00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:00.426
Make it a bit more individual.

00:44:00.766 --> 00:44:02.776
&gt;&gt; But the political
problem with that --

00:44:02.776 --> 00:44:03.436
pardon the interruption --

00:44:03.436 --> 00:44:05.676
the political problem
with that always is

00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:08.666
that society generally
doesn't want

00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:11.356
to give wealthy people
more money.

00:44:11.356 --> 00:44:15.236
&gt;&gt; It just really depends
on how you frame it.

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:22.126
So with a basic income,
if you would finance it

00:44:22.166 --> 00:44:26.036
with the welfare for example or
with progressive taxation, sure,

00:44:26.036 --> 00:44:28.296
the rich will receive a
basic income, but they'll pay

00:44:28.296 --> 00:44:31.856
for five basic incomes or ten
basic incomes or whatever.

00:44:32.206 --> 00:44:34.906
If we compare different
countries now internationally,

00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:38.356
it's actually the countries
with the most universal systems

00:44:38.356 --> 00:44:40.506
where for example
also the middle class

00:44:40.506 --> 00:44:43.346
or even the rich benefit from
free childcare or whatever,

00:44:43.426 --> 00:44:46.216
free public education,
it is those countries

00:44:46.476 --> 00:44:49.016
that are best at
reducing poverty.

00:44:49.296 --> 00:44:50.526
And the reason is very simple:

00:44:50.896 --> 00:44:53.976
if everyone benefits it's
just very difficult to get rid

00:44:53.976 --> 00:44:56.886
of a certain policy or system.

00:44:57.196 --> 00:44:59.946
The problem in the
UK and the US is

00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:02.206
that they are very
targeted systems of welfare.

00:45:02.696 --> 00:45:05.526
Then if a politician comes
along and is looking for money,

00:45:05.526 --> 00:45:08.066
you know, it's very easy to
get rid of those policies

00:45:08.066 --> 00:45:11.766
or that kind of very small,
targeted welfare state.

00:45:12.096 --> 00:45:14.586
And these people are not really
able to defend themselves.

00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:17.726
They'll lose a lot of
votes when they do that.

00:45:17.976 --> 00:45:21.206
Now if you have a very
universal welfare state

00:45:21.326 --> 00:45:23.576
like in northern Europe
or in Australia as well,

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:26.416
especially when you look
at universal healthcare,

00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:28.736
it's nearly impossible
to get rid of.

00:45:29.046 --> 00:45:31.816
You know, in many countries, as
a politician, if you really want

00:45:31.816 --> 00:45:33.096
to touch universal healthcare,

00:45:33.276 --> 00:45:34.716
I mean you're finished
as a politician.

00:45:35.186 --> 00:45:36.646
Now, we've got one state

00:45:37.046 --> 00:45:38.996
that has implemented
a small basic income.

00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:40.266
That's Alaska.

00:45:40.806 --> 00:45:45.876
They finance it with oil money
and it's about $2,000 each year.

00:45:46.416 --> 00:45:51.636
Now if as a politician in Alaska
you want to touch that money,

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:53.376
which some politicians
have tried,

00:45:53.856 --> 00:45:54.816
it's the end of your career.

00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.736
&gt;&gt; And that operates
throughout Alaska?

00:45:58.436 --> 00:46:01.536
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, so I believe
if you've lived there

00:46:01.536 --> 00:46:03.076
for a few years, you'll get it.

00:46:03.076 --> 00:46:05.226
&gt;&gt; And does it cancel out
other welfare payments?

00:46:05.566 --> 00:46:06.026
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:46:06.026 --> 00:46:10.366
&gt;&gt; It's in addition to other
specific welfare measures?

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:13.136
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And the framing is
also again very different.

00:46:13.176 --> 00:46:14.706
So a basic income is a right.

00:46:15.086 --> 00:46:15.996
It's not a favour.

00:46:15.996 --> 00:46:19.726
It's just something you deserve
simply because you exist.

00:46:20.366 --> 00:46:22.476
Now the language we use

00:46:22.476 --> 00:46:24.276
around our current welfare
system is really one

00:46:24.276 --> 00:46:25.266
of conditionality.

00:46:25.296 --> 00:46:29.426
Like only the deserving poor
can get it and you really have

00:46:29.496 --> 00:46:31.816
to prove time and time again
that you're sick enough,

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:33.246
that you are depressed enough,

00:46:33.466 --> 00:46:35.326
that you are really
a hopeless case

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:38.116
that will never get anything
done in your whole life.

00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:39.836
And once you've proved that,

00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:43.246
then you'll get a very
small amount of money.

00:46:43.316 --> 00:46:45.056
Now just imagine what
that does to people.

00:46:45.256 --> 00:46:48.146
If you've got to fill
in thousands of forms

00:46:48.146 --> 00:46:49.176
and interviews, et cetera,

00:46:49.176 --> 00:46:52.626
where all the time you're
basically talking yourself down,

00:46:53.036 --> 00:46:54.956
well is it really surprising

00:46:54.956 --> 00:46:57.036
that then people
become depressed

00:46:57.036 --> 00:46:59.376
and find it very hard
to get a job, right?

00:47:01.516 --> 00:47:05.926
[ Applause ]

00:47:06.426 --> 00:47:07.336
&gt;&gt; Hi, Rutger.

00:47:07.486 --> 00:47:09.976
My name's Mark and
as a bureaucrat

00:47:09.976 --> 00:47:12.316
in a bullshit job I take a lot
of offence at what you said.

00:47:13.166 --> 00:47:15.166
[ Laughter ]

00:47:15.316 --> 00:47:18.566
But as you know, the modern
welfare state has indexation

00:47:18.566 --> 00:47:21.156
regimes that keep the
rate of payment in line

00:47:21.156 --> 00:47:22.386
with things like inflation.

00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:22.456
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:22.456 --> 00:47:25.116
&gt;&gt; So what kind of indexation
regime are you envisioning

00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:26.906
for a universal basic income?

00:47:27.226 --> 00:47:31.666
And if you give people that base
level of income, won't the price

00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:34.426
of products just rise in
accordance with that level?

00:47:35.016 --> 00:47:36.996
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:47:37.036 --> 00:47:39.906
So it really depends again
on how you finance it.

00:47:39.966 --> 00:47:42.886
If you just fund the basic
income with printing a lot

00:47:42.886 --> 00:47:45.596
of extra money, then
you're obviously going

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:46.736
to get inflation
in the long run.

00:47:46.776 --> 00:47:49.856
Now there are some economists
right now who say we should do

00:47:49.856 --> 00:47:52.576
that because there's not a
lot of demands in the economy.

00:47:53.106 --> 00:47:55.036
And Milton Friedman called
this helicopter money,

00:47:55.396 --> 00:47:57.326
like just throwing money
out of helicopters.

00:47:57.596 --> 00:47:59.536
Other people call it
quantitative easing

00:47:59.536 --> 00:48:00.326
for the people.

00:48:00.476 --> 00:48:02.986
Like we're now doing it only
for the banks, but for everyone.

00:48:03.366 --> 00:48:06.706
But obviously, in the long run,
that's not a solution, right?

00:48:06.756 --> 00:48:08.216
Because you'll get
mass inflation.

00:48:09.106 --> 00:48:10.256
So what we have to do is

00:48:10.296 --> 00:48:12.146
to finance the basic
income with taxes.

00:48:12.646 --> 00:48:14.726
Now this means that
the money supply,

00:48:14.726 --> 00:48:17.126
the amount of money
will just be the same.

00:48:17.806 --> 00:48:22.006
But inflation is still a risk,
but only if people will turn

00:48:22.006 --> 00:48:23.136
out to be massively lazy.

00:48:23.566 --> 00:48:25.016
Because then you'll
have the same amount

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:29.976
of money chasing fewer
products and services

00:48:29.976 --> 00:48:30.986
and then you'll get inflation.

00:48:31.246 --> 00:48:34.296
Now a big part of my book
is obviously about showing

00:48:34.296 --> 00:48:35.806
that that is simply
not the case,

00:48:36.076 --> 00:48:38.146
that actually it would
probably make the labour market

00:48:38.146 --> 00:48:39.696
more dynamic.

00:48:41.266 --> 00:48:45.976
Now if inflation is locally
for example still a problem,

00:48:45.976 --> 00:48:48.016
then there are side
policies you can use

00:48:48.016 --> 00:48:50.396
like indexation, et cetera.

00:48:50.696 --> 00:48:55.556
And we've got a lot of great
researchers around the world

00:48:56.056 --> 00:48:57.796
that try and answer
the question, you know,

00:48:57.796 --> 00:49:00.596
how much money do you need
to live a proper life,

00:49:00.596 --> 00:49:01.536
you know, without poverty?

00:49:01.536 --> 00:49:02.856
And it differs from
country to country.

00:49:03.286 --> 00:49:05.676
But I always say the basic
income has to be high enough

00:49:05.706 --> 00:49:08.846
to get people out of poverty and
just support the basic needs.

00:49:09.356 --> 00:49:12.466
&gt;&gt; Okay, go on.

00:49:12.896 --> 00:49:13.526
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:13.526 --> 00:49:15.426
Did you want to ask
a follow-up question?

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:19.246
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, poverty
is a relative concept.

00:49:19.246 --> 00:49:21.426
There are five different
measurements of poverty

00:49:21.426 --> 00:49:22.526
that I know of off
the top of my head.

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:26.036
It's like a relative
concept you're talking about.

00:49:26.036 --> 00:49:28.756
That it has to be set at the
poverty level, I don't mean

00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:33.656
to be offensive, but it's
almost a meaningless statement.

00:49:33.656 --> 00:49:35.316
&gt;&gt; To be honest, I
get that remark a lot.

00:49:35.316 --> 00:49:37.346
Like, "Oh, there will
always be poverty there

00:49:37.346 --> 00:49:39.436
because we've defined
it in a relative way."

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:43.726
But I mean, if you live in
poverty, even in a rich country,

00:49:43.726 --> 00:49:48.886
you simply cannot participate
on a proper level in society.

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:50.606
And there's not much
relative about that.

00:49:51.176 --> 00:49:55.486
And there's a lot of
research out there that shows

00:49:55.486 --> 00:49:57.406
that we can eradicate
it, you know?

00:49:57.406 --> 00:50:00.716
We can have a society in
Australia or in Holland

00:50:00.716 --> 00:50:03.336
where I'm from where
everyone has the means

00:50:03.456 --> 00:50:05.226
to make their own choices.

00:50:05.226 --> 00:50:09.536
Where no one has to worry about
being able to pay their rent

00:50:09.766 --> 00:50:12.356
or feeding their
children or whatever.

00:50:12.706 --> 00:50:16.256
And every society should
obviously have a discussion,

00:50:16.256 --> 00:50:17.376
a democratic discussion

00:50:17.376 --> 00:50:20.366
about what the definition
of poverty is.

00:50:21.046 --> 00:50:23.606
And sure, when we get richer,

00:50:23.606 --> 00:50:26.156
then probably the
poverty line will go up.

00:50:26.286 --> 00:50:28.746
But that's what progress
should look like, right?

00:50:29.436 --> 00:50:30.926
&gt;&gt; Thanks, guys.

00:50:31.836 --> 00:50:32.206
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:50:32.906 --> 00:50:34.266
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hi.

00:50:34.266 --> 00:50:38.726
My question is about how do you
see this working in countries

00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:40.236
of different income levels?

00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:42.366
So middle income, low income?

00:50:42.786 --> 00:50:47.226
And how do you also see
this as a possibility

00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:53.076
of maybe changing how our
economic power is concentrated?

00:50:55.536 --> 00:50:59.346
&gt;&gt; Right now in India, there's a
lot of interest in basic income.

00:50:59.536 --> 00:51:03.466
Actually, on a high
political level you could say

00:51:03.466 --> 00:51:04.856
that they are ahead
of other countries.

00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:07.776
Why? Well the reason
is very simple.

00:51:07.776 --> 00:51:10.016
India has hundreds
or maybe thousands

00:51:10.016 --> 00:51:13.016
of anti-poverty programmes
that are very ineffective.

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:13.816
I mean, there's a lot

00:51:13.816 --> 00:51:15.386
of corruption, a
lot of bureaucracy.

00:51:15.736 --> 00:51:18.546
And the actual amount of
money that reaches the people

00:51:18.546 --> 00:51:22.166
that really need it is little
compared to the amount of money

00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:23.566
that is sent in the first place.

00:51:24.016 --> 00:51:28.786
So it's probably true that basic
income is a more promising idea

00:51:28.866 --> 00:51:31.716
for the developing world
than for the developed world.

00:51:32.596 --> 00:51:34.606
It could really make a
huge difference there.

00:51:34.606 --> 00:51:37.296
And the thinking behind
it is already making a

00:51:37.296 --> 00:51:38.896
huge difference.

00:51:38.896 --> 00:51:41.426
In the book I talk about an
NGO called Give Directly.

00:51:41.756 --> 00:51:42.816
Well the name says it all.

00:51:42.816 --> 00:51:44.316
They just give money directly

00:51:44.376 --> 00:51:47.116
to extremely poor people
in Uganda or Kenya.

00:51:47.506 --> 00:51:51.346
&gt;&gt; On a per capita basis
rather than channelling it

00:51:51.346 --> 00:51:52.176
through the government.

00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:52.586
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:51:52.586 --> 00:51:56.356
Exactly. Just $500 or
$1,000 in huge cash amounts.

00:51:56.566 --> 00:51:58.886
They're also doing the
biggest basic income study

00:51:59.266 --> 00:52:01.436
that has ever been done
with 10,000 participants.

00:52:01.436 --> 00:52:01.996
&gt;&gt; In Uganda.

00:52:02.186 --> 00:52:03.036
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in Kenya.

00:52:03.626 --> 00:52:04.416
Really exciting.

00:52:04.696 --> 00:52:08.096
And what's also very interesting
about this organisation is

00:52:08.096 --> 00:52:09.516
that in the first place,

00:52:09.876 --> 00:52:12.346
technological breakthroughs
have made this possible.

00:52:12.826 --> 00:52:15.596
So what they can do is
just give people a sim card

00:52:15.976 --> 00:52:19.426
and transfer the money to
it and that works very well.

00:52:19.426 --> 00:52:21.126
That as simply not
possible 30 years ago.

00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:23.546
And the second place is

00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:27.836
that they do incredibly
thorough scientific research

00:52:28.266 --> 00:52:34.036
on the charity that they
do, which is a big exception

00:52:34.036 --> 00:52:36.666
in the world of NGO's
and charity NGO's.

00:52:37.286 --> 00:52:40.826
And again, these randomised
controlled trials time

00:52:40.826 --> 00:52:45.226
and time find that it's
just a really effective way.

00:52:45.356 --> 00:52:47.616
I mean, it's pretty crazy
if you think about it

00:52:47.656 --> 00:52:51.006
that we are sending
white people in SUV's

00:52:51.226 --> 00:52:54.566
to incredibly poor countries,
where if we just sell the SUV

00:52:54.566 --> 00:52:57.836
and hand over their
salaries, I mean it's going

00:52:57.836 --> 00:52:58.996
to be a lot more effective.

00:52:59.506 --> 00:53:01.786
But we are such incredible
paternalists.

00:53:01.786 --> 00:53:03.796
We always believe that we
know what's best for the poor.

00:53:03.796 --> 00:53:06.186
We know what's best for
them -- well, we don't.

00:53:06.436 --> 00:53:09.496
We really have no idea.

00:53:10.516 --> 00:53:13.016
[ Applause ]

00:53:13.516 --> 00:53:16.676
&gt;&gt; It's the same basic
concept around micro financing

00:53:17.076 --> 00:53:19.136
in developing countries.

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:19.706
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:20.946
&gt;&gt; That you give them a loan.

00:53:21.346 --> 00:53:23.096
&gt;&gt; It's just that
the cash transfers --

00:53:23.856 --> 00:53:27.046
I mean, they come out
as much more effective

00:53:27.046 --> 00:53:28.926
in recent scientific research.

00:53:29.886 --> 00:53:34.996
It's just much more -- yeah,
if you look at the outcomes,

00:53:34.996 --> 00:53:36.686
there's quite a lot of --

00:53:36.686 --> 00:53:40.396
there's actually hundreds
of studies right now,

00:53:40.396 --> 00:53:42.616
especially in the
global south, where NGO's

00:53:42.616 --> 00:53:44.136
and governments have
experimented

00:53:44.526 --> 00:53:46.476
with just giving free cash.

00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:48.326
Or sometimes with small
conditions such as you've got

00:53:48.576 --> 00:53:51.056
to have your kids vaccinated
or send them to school.

00:53:51.446 --> 00:53:52.746
But it's a very different kind

00:53:52.746 --> 00:53:54.446
of welfare state
than we are used to.

00:53:54.656 --> 00:53:56.616
&gt;&gt; How long has Finland
been doing it?

00:53:56.616 --> 00:53:58.646
&gt;&gt; Oh, just since the
1st of January this year.

00:53:59.006 --> 00:53:59.916
&gt;&gt; And how's that going?

00:54:01.276 --> 00:54:02.146
Is it the whole country?

00:54:02.146 --> 00:54:03.036
&gt;&gt; Still waiting
for the results.

00:54:03.036 --> 00:54:05.606
No, it's just an experiment
with 2,000 participants.

00:54:06.546 --> 00:54:09.316
But it's interesting to
see what will happen.

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:10.386
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:13.756
&gt;&gt; My name's Ava and I'm a
well-known local stirrer.

00:54:15.031 --> 00:54:17.031
[ Laughter ]

00:54:17.046 --> 00:54:17.196
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:54:17.196 --> 00:54:18.296
&gt;&gt; And I'm part of a
group that's trying

00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:21.136
to get the basic income
going in Australia.

00:54:21.686 --> 00:54:26.006
We are spending a large amount
of money on the opposite

00:54:26.006 --> 00:54:28.596
of a UBI at the moment,
spending it particularly

00:54:28.596 --> 00:54:30.726
on something called the
cashless debit card.

00:54:31.186 --> 00:54:34.146
Where we're persecuting the
poor by taking away their cash.

00:54:34.696 --> 00:54:37.546
I reckon that we need to ask our
government, and I'm interested

00:54:37.546 --> 00:54:41.316
in your viewpoint, to put some
of that cash into an experiment

00:54:41.316 --> 00:54:43.356
by giving the same
indigenous groups,

00:54:43.356 --> 00:54:46.176
mainly indigenous
communities that have been put

00:54:46.176 --> 00:54:49.436
onto a highly conditional card
where they have no control

00:54:49.436 --> 00:54:51.326
over their cash,
or only 20% of it,

00:54:51.366 --> 00:54:53.056
maybe 50 in the Northern
Territory.

00:54:53.746 --> 00:54:56.906
To actually experiment and
give the same people a two-

00:54:56.906 --> 00:55:00.866
to three-year break on
an unconditional card.

00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:03.696
Because I think given the
evidence you've put up here,

00:55:04.006 --> 00:55:05.766
it would provide
evidence for a country

00:55:05.766 --> 00:55:08.436
which is extremely
means-test oriented

00:55:08.736 --> 00:55:10.516
and extraordinarily
paternalistic,

00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:13.676
that we could actually show
that that particular way

00:55:13.676 --> 00:55:15.776
of paying money is
much more productive.

00:55:15.776 --> 00:55:16.416
What do you think?

00:55:16.866 --> 00:55:19.196
&gt;&gt; Well, I completely
agree with you.

00:55:20.516 --> 00:55:22.716
[ Applause ]

00:55:23.216 --> 00:55:25.366
&gt;&gt; There's a whole
story in the paper today

00:55:25.366 --> 00:55:28.336
where the minister's come out
delightedly saying, "It works.

00:55:28.336 --> 00:55:29.746
I've been going through
the data."

00:55:29.746 --> 00:55:32.306
And I used to teach research
methods and he's wrong.

00:55:32.306 --> 00:55:33.136
It doesn't work.

00:55:33.136 --> 00:55:35.396
His data is all wrong.

00:55:35.656 --> 00:55:37.756
&gt;&gt; Well, there's
one small problem

00:55:37.756 --> 00:55:41.066
that I've encountered a few
times, is that you know,

00:55:41.066 --> 00:55:43.026
when you talk about
experiments, you really have

00:55:43.096 --> 00:55:45.956
to be a barbarian to be
against experiments, right?

00:55:46.026 --> 00:55:47.846
We've always got
to try new stuff

00:55:48.026 --> 00:55:49.516
and see what works
and what doesn't.

00:55:49.516 --> 00:55:53.356
I mean, every big company is
doing experiments all the time,

00:55:53.356 --> 00:55:55.226
but somehow governments
are not experimenting.

00:55:55.426 --> 00:55:56.276
But that's what you should do.

00:55:56.276 --> 00:55:58.346
I mean, that's the way
you learn new things.

00:55:58.826 --> 00:56:02.306
Now what I've had a few times
-- I actually had a conversation

00:56:02.306 --> 00:56:05.786
with a conservative politician
a few months ago in Holland.

00:56:06.306 --> 00:56:08.756
And he said, "Yeah,
experiments are interesting,

00:56:08.756 --> 00:56:09.636
et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:09.716 --> 00:56:11.176
But the problem is
that it might work."

00:56:12.081 --> 00:56:14.081
[ Laughter ]

00:56:14.146 --> 00:56:15.726
&gt;&gt; I think that's what
they're scared of here.

00:56:15.726 --> 00:56:16.226
That's probably right.

00:56:16.226 --> 00:56:18.986
&gt;&gt; That seems to be what you're
actually seeing right now.

00:56:19.176 --> 00:56:21.056
So that is I think what
some politicians are afraid

00:56:21.056 --> 00:56:22.606
of with the basic
income experiments.

00:56:22.606 --> 00:56:24.796
They are really afraid that
it might work very, very well.

00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:25.546
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:25.766 --> 00:56:27.816
&gt;&gt; Why would they
be scared of that?

00:56:27.856 --> 00:56:30.136
&gt;&gt; Well, then their whole
ideology would crumble, right?

00:56:30.906 --> 00:56:36.586
You'd have to revolutionise
the welfare state.

00:56:37.276 --> 00:56:40.366
So that is something that people
don't like changing their minds.

00:56:41.016 --> 00:56:43.406
That's something that we find
very hard as individuals.

00:56:43.406 --> 00:56:45.796
And that's also why these
crises play such a big role

00:56:45.796 --> 00:56:47.876
in world history,
because these are moments

00:56:47.876 --> 00:56:48.946
where everything breaks down

00:56:48.946 --> 00:56:50.866
and no one knows
what's true anymore.

00:56:51.086 --> 00:56:53.046
And that's the moments
that things change.

00:56:53.356 --> 00:56:55.246
&gt;&gt; And some good opportunity
for things to change.

00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:55.686
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:56:56.796 --> 00:56:57.326

Just getting back
to financing again,

00:57:08.086 --> 00:57:10.256
you touched on automation
previously,

00:57:10.256 --> 00:57:12.816
so given the possibility

00:57:12.816 --> 00:57:16.266
that we'll have perhaps
nearly all human labour wiped

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.736
out by robots in the long-term,

00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.606
and given that in the
tech industries, you know,

00:57:21.736 --> 00:57:24.676
generally the activity is
dominated by single players --

00:57:24.676 --> 00:57:26.306
Facebook, Google, Amazon.

00:57:26.516 --> 00:57:28.156
Do you see the possibility

00:57:28.156 --> 00:57:31.066
that half a dozen companies
could be controlling the bulk

00:57:31.216 --> 00:57:32.926
of the world economy?

00:57:32.926 --> 00:57:35.266
And how are we going to
get the money off them?

00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:36.596
Do we socialise at all?

00:57:37.226 --> 00:57:38.536
Do we tax them 90%?

00:57:38.536 --> 00:57:38.976
What do we do?

00:57:39.206 --> 00:57:40.496
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I gave a talk

00:57:40.496 --> 00:57:43.366
at Google X a few
months ago while I was

00:57:43.366 --> 00:57:44.546
on a book tour in the US.

00:57:44.586 --> 00:57:47.986
And it was quite
shocking actually.

00:57:48.346 --> 00:57:50.216
Someone said to me, "You know,

00:57:50.216 --> 00:57:51.736
basic income, that's
a great idea."

00:57:52.126 --> 00:57:53.816
Alphabet could finance
that, you know,

00:57:53.816 --> 00:57:55.116
the parent company of Google.

00:57:55.116 --> 00:57:57.316
"We could give about
$100 to everyone

00:57:57.316 --> 00:57:58.906
in California, no problem.

00:57:58.906 --> 00:58:00.116
We'll get basic income."

00:58:00.406 --> 00:58:01.216
And I thought, well,

00:58:01.676 --> 00:58:04.636
maybe Google should
start paying taxes first.

of laughing it off.

unrealistic of me to assume.

00:58:20.716 --> 00:58:22.836
&gt;&gt; To assume that
they should pay taxes.

00:58:22.836 --> 00:58:24.036

[ Laughter ]

00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:30.216
But yeah, I completely
agree with you that one

00:58:30.216 --> 00:58:32.066
of the great challenges of
our time is that there is

00:58:32.066 --> 00:58:36.426
so much power now concentrating
in a very small number

00:58:36.426 --> 00:58:37.576
of these huge companies.

00:58:38.136 --> 00:58:40.706
And yeah, that is a
challenge we've seen before

00:58:40.896 --> 00:58:43.576
in the 19th century and we came
up with solutions back then.

00:58:44.036 --> 00:58:46.106
We broke up some
of those countries.

00:58:46.436 --> 00:58:49.186
Some of them were
even nationalised

00:58:49.186 --> 00:58:50.586
or taxed very heavily.

00:58:50.856 --> 00:58:52.886
I mean, there is lots of
stuff you can do about that.

00:58:52.886 --> 00:58:57.486
But it's obviously that
democracies will be threatened

00:58:57.486 --> 00:59:01.136
if you don't do something about
that kind of power accumulating.

00:59:01.886 --> 00:59:05.756
&gt;&gt; To ask a follow up, so if
we're talking about these kind

00:59:05.756 --> 00:59:08.806
of measures, at the moment
these players are relatively --

00:59:09.286 --> 00:59:10.606
you know, they're
relatively small compared

00:59:10.606 --> 00:59:11.826
to what they will
be in the future.

00:59:12.206 --> 00:59:14.616
Therefore, they're not the
same vested interest today

00:59:14.616 --> 00:59:16.836
that they would be when
you actually needed

00:59:16.836 --> 00:59:18.036
to have these measures in.

00:59:18.036 --> 00:59:19.666
Do you think these measures need

00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:21.656
to be implemented
sooner rather than later?

00:59:22.116 --> 00:59:23.556
&gt;&gt; Oh, we should have
done it 40 years ago.

00:59:24.696 --> 00:59:27.176
I mean, some people say
we need basic income

as an insurance policy for
the rise of the rowboats.

00:59:30.106 --> 00:59:31.416
We've already got the evidence.

We can't waste much
time on this, I believe.

I mean, there are now millions

00:59:38.016 --> 00:59:39.576
of people withering
away in poverty.

We are now wasting a
huge amount of talent

00:59:42.496 --> 00:59:44.876
of people doing completely
useless jobs.

00:59:44.906 --> 00:59:46.276

00:59:46.536 --> 00:59:49.346
So this is not just
some abstract future I'm

00:59:49.346 --> 00:59:49.846
talking about.

00:59:49.906 --> 00:59:52.306
It is a very practical idea
that we can do tomorrow.

00:59:52.716 --> 00:59:55.846
It's actually probably the
least radical idea in my book.

00:59:56.286 --> 00:59:58.636
I mean, really rethinking
work or open borders,

00:59:58.786 --> 01:00:02.066
much more radical and utopian.

01:00:02.956 --> 01:00:05.056
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry, everyone,
we are out of time.

01:00:05.056 --> 01:00:06.636
I need to wrap up the session.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:10.376
But you can continue
chatting to Rutger

01:00:10.486 --> 01:00:14.066
when he signs your
books out there.

01:00:14.066 --> 01:00:16.096
Do continue the conversation.

01:00:16.096 --> 01:00:19.876
But for now, please join me
in thanking Rutger Bregman.

01:00:21.516 --> 01:00:27.500
