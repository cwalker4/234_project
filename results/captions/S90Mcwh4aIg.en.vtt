00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.469
Probably about five years ago

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.560
We became just interested in tiny houses. There wasn't that much of a movement so much back then or a trend.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
We just always lived simply so we were looking for how we might live simply in

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.440
Our next iteration of doing that. And about three years ago

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.800
We got to the point where we felt like I was working too much

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.718
I was working about 60 to 80 hours a week, and that wasn't what...

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.229
We weren't living our priorities or our values as much as we want it to be so we wanted to put our relationships

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.200
And the family and friends in the natural world come back into the center and one way of doing that was to

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.170
have

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.340
Really low overhead expenses every month so that I could work part-time.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.109
And we can open up that space and so between been to California. We rented one [for] a while

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.120
Just to make sure it was going to work for us. We started to look more seriously at building a tiny house [and]

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.760
Eventually [we] ended up deciding to do it. We didn't build it we designed it with our builder and then our builder

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.800
actually built it for us. He's really...

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.160
He's an artist. Really, we feel like we live within a big piece of artwork.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800
seeing the tumbleweed homes and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.859
the beauty of them combined with the practicality

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.540
Was one of the things that really started us thinking

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.940
Well, we might be able to do this. And we'd lived tiny a lot before we lived in tents

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.940
and we lived in Twelve by Twelve and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.290
small Cabins and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.749
We wanted that same

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.309
Kind of experience, but instead of being totally off the grid [we] wanted to be able to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.130
have really good light in a house and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.639
we didn't want to carry our water we wanted to be able to turn on the faucet and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.830
We seemed to move around a lot and the other thing about

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.720
Tiny houses on wheels is that it gives you that option

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.600
We've lived off grid quite a lot in our lives and when we were

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.290
thinking about

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.620
how to design tiny we were really trying to think about who we are now and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.300
rather than who we were five or ten or fifteen years ago, and what are our what are our current needs and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.460
What's realistic in terms of us staying in tiny Long-term.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.500
And so, you know, right now we actually are set up so that we're connected to septic and a well

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.280
And that's...

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.649
That's what works for us right now there there was a time in our lives where [we] would have wanted to have every single

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.149
Sustainable technology possible and there's and there's still a large parts of a part of us that would like to incorporate more sustainable technologies

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.250
But at this point in time and also felt like moving in

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.840
275 Square feet was probably a pretty big sustainability move in and of itself.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.930
Our tiny house is 25 feet long

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.019
By eight and a half feet wide - which is the maximum width you can have and pull yourself - by thirteen and a half feet high

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.299
which is the maximum height that you can pull in a road and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.270
we are on a three axle trailer. Each axle can hold six thousand pounds, and it turns out that Tiny actually weighs 14,000 pounds

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.790
So we've got we had plenty of weight to play with.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.290
Probably the most unique part of our design is our doggie elevator

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080
That has to do with our

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.490
Soon-To-be ten-Year-Old corgy. (His birthday is on Monday)

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.420
He has always slept on our bed and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.030
originally we thought "he's only nine and a half we can retrain him to sleep downstairs" and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.280
We sat with that for about two weeks, and we thought "no no no it's not about him. It's about us!" 
Yeah! [gigles]

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.140
We really want him to be with us and we did design stairs up to our main loft

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.350
Because I tend to use the washroom at night

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.669
and I didn't want to be climbing down a ladder

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.849
But they are a little bit steep for him, and he has a little bit of a bad back, so

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.209
Matt our builder is fantastic and he

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.669
stared into open space for a long long time and then he eventually came up with this idea for a doggie elevator.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.949
It's on a winch that pulls up an anchor, essentially. And so Shanty steps into it get down in the bed

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.050
to us

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.120
Wanting to think about living in a tiny home, and it's a totally different one to actually

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.128
experience it so we wanted to experience it and the one that we were in didn't have very much storage and

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.459
Even though we knew that we are going to give away a lot of what we owned

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.769
We still were going to need some storage so we have lots of little nooky places

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.129
And where we have storage both into our stairs

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.169
Underneath the fireplace underneath the couch

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.829
We have tow-kick drawers in the kitchen really anywhere where there is any potential extra space we built in storage

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.879
I think we also we didn't want to lose the richness of our lives

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.829
we wanted to bring with us the kinds of things that are important to us, so

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.288
We have a place for some of my family's dishes from like the 1800s

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.610
Which I thought I was going to have to give up

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.280
But as we did the design it turned out that there were little places for that and we have

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.349
art supplies because we like to do things like visual journaling and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.959
we knit so we have a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.810
place for our yarn

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.319
Yeah, we did a lot of repurposing so we had a dresser drawer

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.899
That was a little bit broken and it turned into our bathroom cabinet and shelving

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.559
We did as much local as we could so most of the wood

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.579
Not all of it, most of it is local the beauty I think was important to us

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.190
We we didn't want to feel like we're living in a cabin

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.880
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we want to feel like we're living in a real home for

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:23.689
[people] who are thinking about tiny homes? I think though living in it for a while like we were talking about earlier and

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:30.439
Really thinking about who you are and what you value and not in a superficial way

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.279
But in a really deep way. Ya really designing it for your own needs

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.229
so the kitchen was really important to us we have a full-size fridge which many tiny homes don't have

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.720
Some people don't have ovens we wanted an oven. Why do we want an oven?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.300
French fries. Because we make french fries!  French fries are our junk food

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.960
So we had to have an oven.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:56.550
Also, I have chemical sensitivities, so we were really careful with making sure that air was going to circulate well

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.699
We do have an HRV. Which is a bit of an expense. It's like a human nose in fact. We call it tiny's nose and

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.400
essentially it expels

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.439
Used-up air while while holding on to about 80 to 85% of the heat from that air

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.260
And then it brings in cool air from the outside preheats it and brings it in so there's always circulation

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.960
We were also really careful about material so a lot. I slept with a lot of materials for a couple weeks

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.070
to make sure that nothing was going to off gas and

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.240
Which of course brought up the expense that plywood for example any plywood on the inside of the house is

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.090
formaldehyde free and wears on the outside

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.219
It's fine, but that plywood cost four times as much here as it does the regular plywood

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.759
So you know there's there are compromises in that that we made along the way too, but never in relationship to our health

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.830
we have 17

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.220
Windows so loss of natural light and

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:57.059
Which also means that we need to work a little bit with

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.840
it not getting too hot here in the summertime and also having not too much heat escape via the windows in the wintertime and that's

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.829
That's something that we're still really experimenting with and figuring out for ourselves

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:14.519
Mostly we came up against minimum size limits. Part of the challenge in Cape Breton anyways

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.139
Is that a tiny house isn't a designation in any kind of codes or anything

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.220
and so after a lot of conversation with

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.559
with the City planner we came to an understanding that we are designated as

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:36.810
a Travel trailer which meant that we could live anywhere that is, we can live rurally, we couldn't live in in the city

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:44.729
But we didn't want to anyways and and we could live in places that were not designated as a rural residential subdivision

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.159
Other than in those places, we could live and as long as we were connected to septic

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.450
So even if we have had a composting toilet it wouldn't have mattered for the greywater

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.750
We would need to be connected to septic. We found

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.469
this piece of land which was for sale at the time, and we couldn't afford it and

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.780
But we contacted the owners, and we said well, how about we pay you a little bit of rent per month

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:13.289
and that'll pay your taxes until it sells, and then you know we'll figure it out from there, and so we went to the

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:19.649
Planning folk and they said that's fine. You're only there temporarily because you're renting and there used to be a mobile home here

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.710
So there was already a well and a septic in place

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.460
So we really just we you know put a little bit more gravel down on the Pad

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.099
But essentially we drove in and connected to systems. It was really important to me that we were

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.799
That we were set up in a legal way

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.260
we had read a number of logs about

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.450
Tiny houses who were you know sort of hidden off into the bush and and good for them

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.250
Totally support that too

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:51.839
and we read this one blog about somebody who had been living in Iowa city or something and pretty much illegally for six years and

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.670
Nobody had ever asked him to leave

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:59.760
but it just got more and more stressful for him knowing that somebody could ask him and he found that he was hiding himself and

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:04.460
eventually he chose to leave on his own so we want it to be legal because we feel like

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.359
Part of our living tiny is to help people understand that you can live a different lifestyle, and we don't have any

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:19.009
Expectation that people would live in 175 square feet, but maybe by our living in that size someone who's living

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.649
in 2,000 square feet might be able to see oh

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:28.519
I could live in a thousand or 800 or 600 so so we're hoping to inspire people to live smaller though, not necessarily

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:36.079
tiny.  I also think that that being legal was important to you because we want to educate. Exactly. And

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.449
what happens when you are stuck away, and nobody knows you're there is that nothing changes. Right. And

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:49.789
While we're not out working in education actively as teachers we want our lifestyle to be teaching

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.830
Yeah, I don't think this is a caution so much as just something that we're encountering and still trying to figure out how to work

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.059
Best with and that's high humidity levels. So we are

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.900
Well practiced that whenever we're in the bathroom the fan is on and whenever we're doing anything in the kitchen even if it's just boiling

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.110
water our

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.550
Hood fan is on so and we have an HRV that

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.810
we don't use in the summertime, but in the wintertime the air is circulating and

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:34.759
yet our humidity levels are incredibly high and it's really all because of two people and a dog breathing and

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.739
In the summertime and in the spring it doesn't seem to be that much

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.829
of an issue, whereas in the wintertime we found a little bit of mold in a couple of places where

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.470
the floor meets the wall

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:54.499
In areas where there's extra metal on the trailer, so the wheel wells for example

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.719
And so it was just a little bit colder there

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.959
and the humidity was

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:03.679
condensing in that area which then started to create a little bit of mold so we we posted on a tiny house Facebook page

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.570
and just asked if anybody else had this issue. What are you doing? We got over 150 responses

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:16.729
And apparently people have been experiencing which is not talking about it much for some reason and off of it somebody another

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.959
Tiny house builder wrote a really nice article actually bringing together

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.690
He had he showed a picture which looked

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.869
what had happened in his house and it looked exactly like our wall

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:35.090
Really so and brought together some nice potential things to try and all which we have tried, and it hasn't reduced our humidity

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:41.540
But part of it is that we we live in a very humid area and so in terms of living in Eastern Canada its

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.390
Probably just something that you need to deal with as best as you can

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.259
I'm not sure it's something that we're going to resolve so to speak

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.270
But it's still part of our adventure

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.350
Well the other thing that was interesting was as we started to look at how do you deal with?

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.210
Moisture and mold issues. We thought it was a tiny house issue and we discovered that

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.239
It's an issue for people in big houses, too

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.210
and

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:09.710
In areas that are high humidity. And one of the responses to us, when we posted on the

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.840
Facebook tiny house page, what do you do with

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:19.129
high humidity levels was somebody from I think was maybe living in Ontario, but was from Germany, I don't remember but

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.660
her solution was

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:27.649
called "lüften" and it was basically a process that you do in Germany where depending on the month

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.840
And how cold it is relative to the humidity you open all your windows for a certain amount of time

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.609
Several times a day and you just exchange the air now we have an HRV

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.420
So the air is exchanging anyways

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.840
But in the wintertime we ended up doing we ended up opening our windows for three to five minutes

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.710
Two or three times a day and it did help bring down the humidity

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.560
So we weren't able to find insurance for the actual moving of tiny so it might be out there

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.670
We just weren't able to find it

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.229
Which is why we decided since it wasn't a very long move we actually hired a tow company

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:06.149
And they're insuring whatever they're towing so tiny was insured in that sense

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.510
and then in terms of actually insuring tiny as a home and

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.720
again, tiny houses don't Exist on

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.700
insurance people's screens, and so we're actually insured as a mini home and

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.250
To be a mini home

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.059
We had to skirt tiny so you can't actually see her wheels right now

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.959
but they're there and we had to tie her down which means that she has a

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.899
pieces of rebar that are going down into the ground so we're not just going to go up and and

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.330
Drive away in the middle of night we're hoping that

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.719
Tiny house become a little bit more common, so that house insurance

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.649
Becomes a little bit cheaper because again they've never heard of a tiny house

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.310
But there was actually only one company of all the companies that our friend explored. He's an insurance broker. That would even

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.659
Attempt to insure us, so we were incredibly grateful that somebody would

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:06.219
I think a lot of people got themselves in pretty deep with home ownership

00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:13.449
Big homes take a lot of money to keep up and a lot of life energy and

00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:19.479
I think that people have started to rethink the big house and

00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:22.118
big expensive life and

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.730
somebody was pretty smart and

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.019
Began to

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:29.198
publicize tiny houses and

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:31.749
I also think because

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:34.269
And Tumbleweed was one of the first

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.889
People to do that because what they were presenting felt like a house

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.439
people who maybe wouldn't have considered

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:44.558
Whatever you want to call that and cabin living

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:48.219
said, Oh I could live in that, that's beautiful

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:55.239
And it has everything that I need. I think that's one of the reasons that it's been attractive

00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:59.079
it's like almost like a pendulum where

00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:01.989
people lived in sort of

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:08.229
Normal size houses smaller houses a thousand square feet and then they went to these massive

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:10.660
McMansions McMansions

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:17.949
And I think the Pendulum is is still swinging. We just read a really interesting thing that said that it might be that the

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:20.869
most efficient

00:16:20.869 --> 00:16:28.238
Size in terms of how much it costs to build and to live in is around five hundred square feet which I thought was

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:29.809
interesting

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:31.809
Data that wasn't even around

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.969
Before the tiny house movement. I think tiny houses right now are mostly attractive to a

00:16:38.119 --> 00:16:40.749
two segments of the population I'd say and we actually

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:45.308
Kind of aren't in either, but so a slightly younger

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:51.159
Segment of the population where real estate prices are just way too high and their salaries aren't

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:53.569
You can't do it

00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:54.589
and

00:16:54.589 --> 00:17:00.878
Also very much to the retirement population. I've met a number of people that are afraid to leave their work

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:04.808
They're afraid to return because they don't think they'll be able to afford their lifestyles, and they probably

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:08.859
many of them won't be able to but they could afford and

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.399
be in a tiny house and and still live in a beautiful space

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:19.678
and do what they want to be doing with their lives. You know in terms of the future. I don't think it's a

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:23.398
Be-all and End-all solution to the housing crisis

00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:31.589
At all it's a solution for some people. I think tiny houses are being used in some good ways and in the u.s.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.590
in particular in terms of Homelessness

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.049
There's some really interesting projects happening down there

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.710
how it will evolve you know I think a lot of a

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.159
Lot of that will depend on how zoning and regulations evolve
