00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.055
- Today I'm gonna talk
about a very hot topic.

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:06.738
Is Micro Four-Thirds dead or not?

00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:09.988
(soothing synth music)

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.243
Hi, there.

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:17.220
I'm Peter Forsgard, an Olympus visionary

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.100
from Helsinki, Finland.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.940
And, that's my disclaimer.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.340
When I talk about Micro
Four-Thirds and Olympus cameras,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.960
you have to remember that
I am an Olympus visionary.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.230
So, I have a very positive view

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.240
on Olympus cameras, of course.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.960
But then, also you have to
remember that I've been shooting

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.010
with Olympus cameras for four years

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.910
and been only two years a visionary;

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.500
so, I picked Olympus
before they picked me.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.390
And please, continue to
subscribe to my channel,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180
and hit that bell so you get noticed

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.760
when there is new video online.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.533
I post videos from every
Tuesday and every Friday.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.940
My channel is all about you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.070
getting to be a better photographer.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130
This video was not endorsed by Olympus

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.820
or neither did they say that
I had to make this video.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.030
I wanted to make this video

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.940
because I think it's an
interesting matter to discuss.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.990
Tony Northrop made a video,
or actually it was a podcast,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.540
but it was also a video on YouTube.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.940
And the topic was, Micro
Four-Thirds Is Dead.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.680
And then Joseph Ellis, a wedding
and portrait photographer,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.572
from Dallas, Texas, who
is an Olympus image-maker

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:23.770
said in his video, some
comments about the video.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.060
And I'm commenting actually
both of those videos.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.190
And I think it's very good for
me, also, to address on those

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.460
because I know I have a lot of subscribers

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.950
that are Olympus users and
Micro Four-Thirds users, also.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.580
So I think it's a very
important topic in my channel

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.080
to little bit discuss the
future of Micro Four-Thirds.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.460
The whole thing actually
started when Panasonic announced

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.350
that they are going full-frame.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.120
They also said that Micro Four-Thirds

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.230
is going to be in their line-up.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.430
And Tony Northrop said in his video

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.380
that Panasonic will drop Micro
Four-Thirds in a few years.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.810
And he had a very good reason to say so.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.126
He says that the Panasonic S1

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:11.600
fullframe line-up is totally new.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.130
So, they have to put
a lot of R and D money

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.310
into that system, which makes sense.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.657
And then, they also have
to have some R and D

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:20.930
in the Micro Four-Third's world.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.330
So, to keep making better
Micro Four-Third cameras,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.610
they need to R and D theirs, also.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.290
So, they have to split
the cost of R and D.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.140
And he explains, of
course, the cost of R and D

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.960
has to come back in sales.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.063
And if, let's say, that Micro
Four-Thirds is not selling

00:02:38.063 --> 00:02:43.063
why would they invest
money on R and D on things

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.250
that doesn't sell?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.870
But, then I wanna ask a question.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.870
Why does he assume that
the fullframe is the one

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.830
that will survive in Panasonic?

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.730
That is, I think that's
a reasonable question.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.710
There are no really good lenses;

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.380
or actually there are very
good lenses, but not too many,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.455
and very expensive like a lens is.

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:06.640
And of course what makes it
easier for Panasonic is the fact

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.358
that Sigma and Leica are with them

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:11.770
in the new L mount system cameras

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.080
that are going to be on
the market for Panasonic.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.323
And also Sigma has said

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:19.450
that they might be making
a fullframe camera.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.562
But then my question is who
is going to invest in a system

00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:26.253
that does not have too many lenses, yet?

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.500
There are a lot of
people that have Canons,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.420
they have Nikons, and
they have Sony cameras.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.360
Most likely, if you have
a Canon or Nikon DSLR

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.730
if you still want to stay in fullframe,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.540
you're going to pick up

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.210
the DSLR or the Nikon ZET series cameras.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.890
I don't think there's gonna be a massive

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.700
movement to Panasonic.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.620
So, I think Panasonic, with the fullframe,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.450
that's the bigger risk,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.050
just because they don't
have that many lenses, yet.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.340
And who says that DS-1 or DS1R cameras

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.220
are going to be really good?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.610
Most likely they are.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.670
But, we don't know because the
camera does not exist, yet.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.242
But, it's going to take a
lot of money for Panasonic,

00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:12.220
when they invest in the new system.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.920
And, if it does not start
selling, they might ditch that.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.753
Who knows?

00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:19.180
There was talk about smartphones.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.784
And that's one reason that compact cameras

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:25.220
is, kinda like, non-existing any more.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.776
Of course, there are some
specialty compact cameras,

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:31.640
like super zoom cameras.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.360
And then there are these top series

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.088
where they have this
water-proof, splash-proof,

00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:41.860
and you can throw-them-around
kind of cameras,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.570
which are really good.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.060
And, that's, of course,
those things are gonna change

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.010
because the mobile phone
is not an action camera.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.240
But my prediction about smartphones

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.750
is that they are going to kill

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.270
the entry-level system cameras.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.580
And it's gonna affect the DSLR market

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.650
and the minerals market because of the new

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.580
computational imaging
that most new phones have.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.870
What's the biggest reason

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.499
for people taking photographs these days?

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:16.840
Sharing it in social-media.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.570
And which device would you
use if you want to share

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.690
all the time your images to social media?

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.260
Well, the smartphone, of course.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.593
And Joseph Ellis in his video
said that he does not believe

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:32.920
that it's going to affect that
much the entry-level cameras,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.379
because people still need long lenses

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.390
when they want to make images
of their kids doing sports.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.240
Yeah, there is a point.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.157
But, I do not think that
there are so many people

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:50.157
that want to buy a DSLR,
because they wanna make images

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.720
of their kids playing sports.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.720
That would make some camera
manufacturer so profitable

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.200
just on that niche.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.660
I don't think so.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.560
And then there's the third thing

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.920
that was in Tony Northrop's podcast/video.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.840
He had an example of a 600
millimeter Nikon lens that was F4

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.773
and then the Olympus
M.Zuiko 300 F4 pro lens.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.840
And he said that, of course,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.140
the size of the 600 millimeter
F4 lens for fullframe

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.823
is huge, compared to the
300 millimeter F4 lens.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.810
And, if you compare the lenses

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.740
and you compare the price of the lenses,

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.120
the Nikon lens costs about, as Tony said,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.340
and I haven't checked it out on-line

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.243
but, I believe what
Tony says, it's $13,000.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.150
And you can get the Olympus
300 F4 and M.Zuiko lens

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.760
for, let's say, it's less than 3,000.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.870
I think it's 2,700 now.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.880
Around that, anyways.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.810
But it's a lot lot less.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.430
You can get three of those

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.163
in price of one of the Nikon lenses.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.770
And, I believe when Tony said

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.410
that the image quality is
better with the fullframe

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.640
and with the 600 millimeter F4 Nikon lens,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.473
I don't doubt that.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:13.306
I believe that.

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:16.761
But, is it so much better that you justify

00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:18.680
the huge amount of money.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.670
Let's say there's a about
a $10,000 difference.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.670
Are your pictures gonna
sell so much higher price

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.970
if you shoot with the Nikon
or the Olympus system?

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.963
I don't believe so.

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:35.170
As he said about the R and D things,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.640
that you have to justify
the R and D costs,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.701
and you have to sell cameras

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:41.800
to make up the R and D costs.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.220
And exactly the same thing

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.240
when you're doing photographic business.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.860
if you're selling bird photographs,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.030
are your pictures so much better?

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.840
Is the client going to
pay so much more money?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.630
that you can justify
the $10,000 difference?

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.900
And when we can consider that the 300 F4

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.900
has a image stabilizer,
and with the E-M1 Mark II

00:08:06.142 --> 00:08:09.730
you have six stops of stabilizing

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.373
versus the Nikon's,
which is a little less.

00:08:13.373 --> 00:08:14.820
To be honest, I don't know what it is,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.810
but I know it's not six stops anyways.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.260
And then there is the talk
about the depth of field.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.680
Always on these questions
about depth of field

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.320
you assume that you
want your depth of field

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.930
to be as narrow as possible.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.890
But, what if you need

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.840
more depth of field?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.370
With the F4 600 millimeters,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.872
you have a subject

00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:45.060
that's 10 meters away.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.310
Your depth of field is
about seven centimeters.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.669
With the 300 millimeter F4,

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:55.790
and a MIRRORLESS Micro Four-Thirds body,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.799
the depth of field in 10 meters
is around 14 centimeters.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.800
So, it's about a double,
which makes sense.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.750
In this case,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.630
is the seven centimeters
worth that 10,000 bucks?

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.630
I know that this is just a small example

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.250
and just a small niche example,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.340
but, so is Tony's example
of 600 millimeter, anyways.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.430
So that's why I'm addressing exactly that.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.720
What if you need some more

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.480
depth of field with your fullframe camera?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.670
You have, to get that 14
centimeters at the same situation,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.400
you have your subject at 10 meters

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.450
and you have the 600 millimeter F4,

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.060
you have to stop it down to
F8 to get 13 centimeters.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.103
And there you lose two stops of light.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.420
So, you have to either
get a longer shutter speed

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.867
or boost up the ISO.

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:52.950
And if you boost up the
ISO, in Tony's word,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.423
you have the same image quality, anyways.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.130
But, look at the price.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.110
You get the same quality
with $5,000 to $6,000

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.360
versus $16,000 when you have the body,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.960
because you need the body, also.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.090
So, it's not that simple.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.640
And to me, as I said in the beginning,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.750
I've done my images for four years

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.120
with Micro Four-Thirds camera,
with an Olympus camera,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.120
and not once has someone asked me

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.300
what camera do I use?

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.610
Or paid me less because
I have a smaller camera

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.480
or a smaller sensor.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.840
No, never.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.860
And that's what I'm saying.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.410
That is the image quality so much better

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.030
that you justify the higher price?

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.427
And then when it comes
to the size of the lenses

00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:49.130
like Tony said in his video

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:54.130
that like now I am filming
this with 25 millimeter F1.2,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.220
which is equivalent in the
sense of depth of field

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.220
and the field of view is a 50 millimeter

00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:08.302
2.4 in a fullframe,

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:11.503
Which some consider not so fast a lens.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.250
But, if there is a 50 millimeter
2.4 lens for fullframe

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.520
would it be as good as this lens

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.353
that I'm using now,

00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:27.050
25 millimeter F1.2?

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.060
And would it be weather-sealed?

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.600
And would it be dust-proof?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.433
I doubt that.

00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:34.560
I don't think it will,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.150
because that would be a
low-end lens for fullframe.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.980
There will be one point
four, one point two lenses

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.780
that are pro-grade

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.563
like my Olympus 25
millimeter F1.4 lens is.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.200
So, it's not equivalent.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.650
It is smaller

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.210
because of the pro-grade
that I have in my lens.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.440
The same size for fullframe
would not be a pro lens.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.790
So, you would lose image quality.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.250
So it's not the same thing.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.703
And because the F stop is 1.2 and 2.4,

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:06.210
I have a different exposure,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.890
faster shutter speeds, lower ISO.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.070
You can boost up the ISO,
of course, on the fullframe.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.720
But then, of course, you get more noise

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.610
off of the fullframe and
you lose some image quality.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.870
So the gap gets smaller.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.030
I don't think that Micro
Four-Third is going to die.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:30.030
But, of course, if Olympus
is going to be the only one

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:35.030
who's making Micro Four-Third
cameras, is going to survive,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.380
it needs, of course,
to do a lot of R and D.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.170
What they have so far,
they got very, very unique

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.870
and good features in their cameras.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.120
One is that they have the live composite,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.300
which is very unique.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.360
ProCapture, which is 60 frames per second.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.150
So what they really need
to keep up their R and D

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.860
and make great cameras and great lenses.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.690
And that's the way they will survive.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.250
Because, at least so far,
there has been quite a lot

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.765
of professional photographers

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:10.765
who has come from the
fullframe to Micro Four-Thirds.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.451
Also, I'm guessing, but
I know Olympus, anyways.

00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:17.610
And if that thing keeps on going,

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.700
and I don't see any reasons why not,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.680
then there's no problem
with the Micro Four-Thirds.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.030
But, as I said,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.340
they need to keep their R
and D really high-quality

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.502
and make really great cameras.

00:13:31.502 --> 00:13:34.570
But, as Tony said, and as I am saying,

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.930
and probably Joseph agrees with me, too

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.760
that we do not know what
happens in 10 years.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.760
10 years ago, Nokia from Finland

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.960
was a powerhouse making mobile phones.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.310
Then came Apple, and
what happened to Nokia?

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.230
They doing something,
they still doing great,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.260
but they doing something else.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.140
There aren't very many
Nokia phones around anymore.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.685
So, we never know which ones will survive.

00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:03.320
But hey, this was my
two cents on this matter

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.140
and thanks for watching.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.493
Bye, for now.

00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:09.743
