cruel things were Jewish world deceiving
um plans for black world but by the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:41.670
grace of God I am here speaking for the
glory of his name once once trying to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.750
destroy the church but now I am trying
to establish the Church of God

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:56.340
strengthen it and cherish my love toward
all other nations including Muslims and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.119
Jews I've come from the country Iran I
have got some photos to show you how is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.659
that going to come there ah from this
country from the northern part of this

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.950
country from this section was born in a
nominal Islamic family many Muslims are

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.100
nominal and they do not know Islam but
simply they call themselves Muslim my

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.509
parents picked me up from you know
amongst the 12 children of the house

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.329
because I was quicker in learning and so
they nominated nominated me to be the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.810
religious boy in the family and they
invested in my life I learned very

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.119
quickly the Arabic reading of it and
reciting the Quran reading the Quran in

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.439
Arabic does not Iranian language at the
age of nine I became famous people even

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.600
called me to their you know religious
ceremonies and I recited the Quran for

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.580
them you imagine in nine years old boy
we learn from childhood that Christians

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.760
and Jews are unclean that's
in the Koran we learned from the mosque

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.790
and from the community don't touch them
if you see them don't shake hand with

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.280
them because they are unclean and then
you become unclean you need to rush and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.989
wash yourself before washing yourself
don't touch any Muslim you make them

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.080
unclean too now this is not unclean that
doesn't mean you haven't made you know

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.010
taking shower that's unclean is
spiritually they are not human kind we

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.260
also use this especially from the area
I'm coming from people use these two

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.810
words words Christian and you have swear
words to Moslems fight with each other

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.340
they call each other Christian or Jew
Iranian government with Saddam's

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.980
government did that eight years the
Iranian government was calling Saddam a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.280
Jew in the war and Saddam was calling
Iranian government a Jew

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.260
so that's the mindset of people you not
you're brainwashed from childhood that

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.970
they are not human kind and they deserve
to die and you do not feel for them

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.700
unfortunately I am coming from there and
I glorify his name that he changed my

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.030
life and my family's life I have stories
with him that's not my work to come to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.380
him he has really brought me I have
stories with him from since I was a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:51.750
young lad from the year no7 I was 12
years old my first story started with

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.620
Jesus one day in our sport hour we were
playing in the playground of their

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.459
school seven boys got together you know
trying to play with each other trying to

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.530
find also a game to play with each other
one of the boys said I know a game he

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.150
took a paper from his notebook divided
in seven went in a corner wrote

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.900
something inside each folded them rolled
them very well and came to us and mix

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.310
them very well he said this is the game
each one was going to take one and open

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.270
in turn
the things written inside each she said

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.190
shows our future
so we've took one and then we were

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.080
fighting with each other who should be
the first second third or the last one

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.770
some of us were fighting to be the last
one but I succeeded I was the seventh

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.449
one we were in year seven seven boys I
was the seventh one opened it the first

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.880
one opened there was written you'll
become a teacher we tried to make her

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.820
time fun with each other you know jumped
you know clubbed show the excitement the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.850
other one you'll become a mayor the
other one you'll become an engineer or

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.130
army officer at the end I open mind
there was written you'll become a

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:27.240
Christian no fun anymore I was
embarrassed I was more religious than

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:37.199
them full of shame angry my face changed
and I said I have to go and kill this

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:43.199
boy I attacked him he screamed I said
I'm going to kill you why did you write

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:49.560
this for me he was crying he said to me
did I write that for you you didn't see

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.630
I mix them very well I could have taken
that it's your problem it's your future

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:02.310
you're blaming me he was right he did he
put in my hand he was right for that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.149
reason I didn't kill him
but I did not play with them anymore I

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:15.799
went and found a corner you know satyr
cried and wept cry to Allah complain to

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:21.699
him that you embarrass me improved on
this voice so that was my first story I

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:28.099
finished my high school entered the
University in the university I became a

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.409
radical Muslim followed Ayatollah
Khomeini Ayatollah in that time was in

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:40.309
Iraq because he was Shiite and sat down
Sunni they didn't like each other

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:45.769
Saddam forced him out and he went to
France unfortunately France welcomed him

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:52.629
very warmly and Western countries are my
goodness you need to wake up really

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.539
because they were going to use him as a
shield in front of the Russia and

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.069
communism but they didn't know that
Islam doesn't let anyone to become a

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:05.149
sincere friend with you there are ample
of verses in the call and said don't

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:11.929
become friends with Christians and Jews
so through their health we didn't know

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:17.209
that we thought that the miracle of
Allah and through his guidance we

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:23.449
overthrow the most powerful King in the
Middle East and the King escaped we

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.119
captured the country Ayatollah entered
the country that in that day I cried

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:35.360
with many other students we were so
excited we said we are going to have

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.669
freedom and democracy because Ayatollah
promised us Islam when we come there and

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:46.699
rule the country we will have democracy
he was lying to 70 million people

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:53.689
well Islam says if it is necessary you
can lie to 70 billion people to hold the

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:59.629
world you know until you get you know to
the power we didn't know that zealous

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:04.399
Muslims young people I was reading the
Quran from the beginning to the end

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:09.110
without understanding what Quran is say
because it's in Arabic you just get the

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:17.119
blessing when you recited in Arabic we
were so excited Ayatollah entered in the

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:20.570
second week with my group
and I'm welcoming very warmly this is

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:26.360
the photo I have taken from him is
sitting here we committed ourselves to

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.970
him in that day promised him to make
every single Iranian radical Muslim and

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:38.440
to take Islam to the end of the world
after that because I was a famous boy I

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:50.900
was invited with two others to start the
Revolutionary Army this is me here now

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:56.600
have you heard about the world Hezbollah
this is the word produced in Iran first

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:04.940
we were Hezbollah we wanted Hezbollah
means the party of Allah then the horse

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.330
of Allah and we will call to start the
Revolutionary Army the major goal of the

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:17.440
Revolutionary Army was to go and capture
Israel to make Israel as a capital state

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:25.310
for all Islamic world and we touch to
attract the attention of wide expectrum

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.530
Muslim in the world and say to them you
have to start from wherever you are to

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.720
fight against Christians and Jews you
know to do that we needed to establish

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:43.910
our army in a country nearby so we
started Hezbollah in Lebanon Iranian

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.880
started Hezbollah the Iranian paid now
to Hezbollah Hezbollah's bosses in Iran

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:59.750
Hezbollah in Lebanon and so that was one
of the major goals of this army that

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.240
gain there this is me here praying in a
mountainside Islamic prayer three boys

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.910
are following me in that fray we see two
boys are sitting there they are moderate

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:16.670
Muslims we were trying to make them
radical in five or ten minutes many

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.800
people thinks wow this radical Muslim
I've studied a lot now just I think

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.680
every Muslim from childhood learns how
to be anti Christian anti do so they

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:34.519
have to some extent and then you need
to work a little bit you know to make

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:38.660
them radical especially when they live
in an environment that too full a

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.439
radical modern day and mountain also is
so important for commuted radical Muslim

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:50.149
you have heard so far many times that
was AMA bin Laden is in Mountain

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:56.209
you know Taliban is in mountainous area
even those four boys who were involved

00:10:56.209 --> 00:11:00.759
in suicide bombing in England they just
came from Mountain you remember that

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:06.439
because it's important mum Mountain is
you know is a place you can speak freely

00:11:06.439 --> 00:11:13.120
there and you can hide yourself there
after that I became involved with

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.860
mobilizing young boys and girls for our
second major goal that's my photos oh

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:24.829
they're just photo shows three of us
dead our second major goal was to

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:32.079
destroy America to do that we needed to
mobilize all our young boys and girls

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:37.819
why America because America is a
superpower Christian country in the

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:43.459
world that's embarrassing to Islam a
Christian country superpower Islam is

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:49.790
going to be superpower Islam should be I
make us millions of Jews unbearable to

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.980
Islam America's many you know our me
agreement with many countries including

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.100
Australia helping many countries if we
destroy America then it's easier to

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.230
capture other countries they spend
billions of dollars you know over

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:12.259
America so for that reason we attracted
the attention of many young boys and

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:16.339
girls and took them to the army camp and
taught them to terrorist techniques in

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:21.410
the future to send them as students or
through different channels to Western

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:28.939
countries and especially America to
fulfill our goals this is my wife she

00:12:28.939 --> 00:12:36.860
was also a radical Muslim a fiery girl I
said wow this is mine

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.440
because every a leader who thirsts for
the blood of others should have really

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:50.390
such a lady you know to fight side by
side so for the same interest we got

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:55.490
married this is her also two other girls
they are learning that rifle how to use

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.830
it
our marriage was held in the mosque

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:09.380
that's not popular in the Middle East we
did that for the sake of Islam we wanted

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:15.200
really to bring the culture of Muhammad
to our time mosque should be the center

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.170
of everything you have to teach your
followers especially two important

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:28.420
things should be in the mosque start
from the mosque first one is jihad

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:36.850
fighting against non-muslims
that's a center a fortified center for

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:43.460
Muslims not many Muslims really go to
mosque for that reason but the leaders

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.040
know that and the committed radical
Muslim know that that this is the place

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.220
for us in the future we will kill these
people if they do not become Muslim I

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.090
think I don't need to teach you you see
from Iraqi when Shiites and Sunnis are

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:03.710
killing each other that had to start
from the mosque you know they killed the

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:09.020
people in Indonesia just clergy spoke in
the mosque and they went out and killed

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:14.030
just you know two years ago they were
going to kill three four Christian girls

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.860
one of them survived
just start from the mosque so for that

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.600
reason that was you know the major
reason one of the major reason the

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:32.690
second one involves non-islamic
countries in the Quran is written world

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.040
is yours
- Muslims even the lands you haven't put

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:44.480
yourself in chapter 33 verse 27 in
Islamic doctrine also you have to prove

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.890
that this country is mine you have to
build your mosque there

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.790
according to Islamic doctrine if you
build a mosque in a country that country

00:14:53.790 --> 00:15:01.590
after that is an Islamic country so is
there any mosque in Australia when Islam

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:08.730
says it is not yours
also you're not a true citizen of this

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.200
country
you're a second-class citizen when Islam

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.910
comes and rules that this country and
then you have to buy your life and your

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:25.520
families like every year in order to
survive according to the Quran chapter 9

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.650
I'm not here to frighten you I'm here to
encourage you that if you the follower

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.440
of Jesus Christ you need to claim this
country for the Lord Jesus Christ

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:44.220
because he is good you claim everything
for good thing and he is the best it's

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:52.410
so good to hand over this country to
Jesus rather than to Muhammad so that

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:57.420
was our goal that for that reason we
invited them to come to the church to

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.860
the mosque and to our wedding now this
is our marriage that you see any smile

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.490
on their faces

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:16.110
now Islam is the religion of anger I'm
not talking about Muslims again you

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:21.300
better go and read the Koran it's easier
now just go to the internet download

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:31.050
click they're killing verses or hatred
you will find plenty it's just opposite

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:37.680
to the face of Christ the greatest mark
our Islam is anger the greatest mark out

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:47.430
Jesus is joy love that's why we needed
to teach seriousness or tocharian his

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.930
spirit you know leadership to our
followers there is a subject that was a

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.550
subject called angry subject I was the
teacher of that angry subject to my

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.949
follows
how to become angry how to hate do you

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:08.309
think it's easy to cut the head of a
person you teach them gradually and then

00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:18.510
they kill for that reason so that's um
why we are not smiling they're after our

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:27.750
marriage see my face there my daughter
is five and a half years old here that's

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:36.210
why she's not covered like my wife you
cover your daughters as a committed

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:44.030
Muslim from the age of seven because age
of seven is the age of marriage in Islam

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:54.419
that's why you younger girl need to
praise the Lord Jesus Christ he is so

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:59.159
good at 25 years I have studied all
other philosophies and religions he's so

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:06.299
good every day you need to say Jesus I
love you I praise your name one of

00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:10.110
Muhammad's wife was six years old
Aisha she has got a lot of writings

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:17.730
actually in Islamic writing and Mahmud
was 49 years old and Islamic tradition

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:24.320
says she was consumed ated at the age of
eight or nine you're eight or nine

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:33.179
that's why she's not covered my family
myself this photo was everywhere in my

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:36.840
hometown because I was in the second
year I became the leader of the

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.490
political party influential politician
announced my candidacy for Islamic

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:48.210
Parliament but this time we were our
positions so Ayatollah we can still the

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:54.570
second year we discovered that this
whatever this man said to iranian was

00:18:54.570 --> 00:19:05.190
lie and then he said another said that
was for the sake of islam now okay

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:10.640
you said we will have freedom we are not
going to give this freedom to jews

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.730
Christiane's or Zoroastrians we are your
Muslim brothers now it doesn't work you

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:25.710
have to blindly now follow the leader
even as a Muslim it's hard for Iranian

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:31.590
Iranian are the most open Muslims in the
world not that's not because I have come

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:39.059
from Iran because my doctorate is about
culture cultural differences we said now

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:46.170
we want freedom we won my colleague
became the president of the country with

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:53.640
98 percent of people's vote the first
president after Islamic Revolution for

00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:00.140
government fell in our hand but that
angered Ayatollah and especially his

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:07.290
clergy friends first in secret they
started to kill the members and

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:13.410
opposition's three times they sent
rocket to the living place of president

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:20.790
and eventually president escaped from
Iran government was you know destroyed

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:26.580
some of us were able to escape some were
killed I was one of them kidnapped in

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.740
night time put in a dead cell it was a
toilet I lived first three months in in

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:39.000
a toilet painful treason in that prison
you beg them to kill you I don't know

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.230
you really believe me or not because
they do not kill you once they

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:52.740
unfortunately you have to enjoy by
giving pain to your opposition unto your

00:20:52.740 --> 00:21:01.410
enemies especially if you're a girl our
position and when you get the death

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.950
penalty
that's so pain for you and for your

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:14.330
family to kill a virgin girl is sin you
have to sleep with her first and then

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.390
kill her
now the pain is after that because in

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:26.710
Islam is a religion of fear you have to
frighten every member of the family

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.850
that's why they are trying to frighten
the world and unfortunately many Western

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:37.720
people are afraid unfortunately sadly
after killing that girl you take the

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.780
dress of that girl
that's your religious obligation you

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.970
need to do that and you go and talk to
her mom you knock the door I want to

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:52.270
talk to this girl mom mom comes there
you say your girl was mine I slept with

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.140
her we killed her and this is the dress
of your daughter

00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:01.659
they broke the heart of many Iranian
mothers were they Jews Christians or

00:22:01.659 --> 00:22:08.980
Austrians no Muslims Islam my friend is
a cruel religion even the slaughters

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:14.770
Muslims many Muslims are here even in
this country in other countries they do

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.419
not know that when these leaders get to
the power they will kill first their own

00:22:19.419 --> 00:22:26.919
followers Iranian government Iranian
system killed between 50 to 60,000 only

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:35.080
young Iranian girls and boys that's the
prison I'm talking about they shocked

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:41.020
you really which you know immoral words
they kidnapped me with my pajamas you

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:47.169
know I'm sorry they were just you know
looking inside on my body and saying to

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:53.409
me who is going to sleep with your wife
tonight because outside they show

00:22:53.409 --> 00:22:57.909
themselves righteous Iranian really do
not think that these people are rude

00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:03.220
that much and they were to one of them
said well he's going to finish it's you

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:10.179
on me that's the reason from there they
took me to another prison with my four

00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:16.960
other friends we were waiting in the
death row with four other friends in a

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.970
in a Cell all four were killed and I
could escape

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:30.659
by the grace of God it's the longest
story it's a painful story - if I say

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.950
that to you
this section takes one and a half hour

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:41.580
but I just simply say to you by the
grace out Jesus I could escape even

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.429
though I didn't know him but he had a
plan for me

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:49.259
you remember that ballot and I have
other stories are the prophecies even

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:56.580
Moslems prophesied so I could escape the
death penalty and from the country Iran

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.929
to Turkey in Turkey I was a wandering
man I didn't know about my future I

00:24:02.929 --> 00:24:08.940
started to learn the language and
entered university to make myself busy

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.200
in the second year I found a fellow
Iranian man he had business state we

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.429
became friends with each other after a
while he invited me to put my money with

00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:23.429
his make the capital larger I did but
later my friend took all my money and

00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:29.460
his escape to Germany another pain came
to my life I couldn't do anything

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.669
because everything was written in his
name now he was going to a church there

00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:39.870
he was not a Christian he was Muslim
there was an Iranian Christian

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:44.850
Fellowship in Istanbul in Turkey those
Christians who were not able to live

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.230
inside the country he ran after the
Islamic Revolution they escaped and they

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:55.110
went to Turkey and with some other
foreign friends American and European

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.399
they started the fellowship and they
having fellowship with each other and

00:24:59.399 --> 00:25:05.429
also working among Iranian refugees they
built friendship with many and this man

00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:13.080
was one of them he was going today to
that church sometimes that caused me to

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.870
go to that church to ask them why this
happened to me this man was coming here

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.879
he was my friend he took all my money on
a scale for the first time in my life I

00:25:23.879 --> 00:25:30.090
am going to a church challenging and
scary we're challenging because church

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:35.789
is an unclean place
scary's the you know was the strongest

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:42.150
part now I have escaped from the death
penalty now I'm going to create another

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:48.929
one for myself especially a politician
like me why you're going to a church and

00:25:48.929 --> 00:25:56.669
especially in that area there were very
committed Muslim Turks there anyway my

00:25:56.669 --> 00:26:03.570
money encouraged me to go in I entered
the church I was shocked people were

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:10.380
playing music and they were singing
inside the church music is evil in Islam

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:16.080
you remember just last year the leader
Muslim leader here in Australia said to

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.850
the Muslim we throw your children from
music class because it's evil I was

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.390
shocked
now everybody was standing and singing I

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:29.370
said I'm not going to stand to share
this evil spirit with them that's not

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:34.200
Iranian really they stand with you but I
was afraid to a stand with them I said

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.149
no I'm going to sit i sat behind
everybody closer to the main door I said

00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:44.850
it's good to sit here if something
strange happen easier to run out that

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.350
again is the mindset of committed Muslim
and radical Muslim you think that they

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:54.360
are united with each other only fear is
bringing them together uncertainty is

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.330
everywhere there anyway nothing happened
inside the church after the fellowship

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:04.470
they came and welcomed me very warmly I
said they story - then they became so

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.890
sad that I had lost a big money to a man
who was sometimes going to that church

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:15.990
they promised me to help me we can help
you they said we have many friends in

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.669
Germany we are going to write to them to
find this man and to beg him to give

00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:24.840
your money back they encouraged me to go
to the church they said we if we get any

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.220
response from them we would be able to
share that with you after that week

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:34.350
after week I went to the church I never
missed any Sunday

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:50.700
for my money week after week I saw these
people are so nice people my goodness we

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.900
call these people immoral people because
Christians are the most immoral people

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:02.630
in the world in Islam is this immorality
this is so nice

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:09.000
we call this people ungodly infidel
unclean people I said what a wonderful

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.120
people this ungodly unclean people are
they're sacrificially helping muslims we

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.590
say don't touch them but not only they
are touching us they're sacrificing

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:29.310
their time their money for us
their messages also was so powerful my

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:34.470
friend I was teaching philosophy in Iran
and I was very much interested in

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:41.610
Iranian poetry in Iranian poetry it
encourages you to search for God in this

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:48.060
world I loved really to have God in my
life but for the first time I was shaped

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:54.570
by their messages they said we belong to
the kingdom of God not Satan anymore God

00:28:54.570 --> 00:29:03.000
is mighty isn't he every Muslim knows
God is mighty can mighty God save this

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.460
is a powerful question you can ask you
know people from every religious group

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.580
if your God mighty why he is not able to
save you here

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.770
if you call your mother and father I
need you please come and help me do they

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:24.240
ignore you why your God is not helping
you to save you here why he is leaving

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:32.070
you in uncertainty what kind of God is
this we are saved we are in the kingdom

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:38.400
of God if God is with you who can be
against you

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:48.360
powerfully stuff it worked here I loved
it but they didn't say to them I love it

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:56.950
because they had some ideas I didn't
like them Jesus is God Muslim skulls

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:04.300
hate this Quran hates that they believe
Quran says Christians have made a man as

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:10.330
God for themselves Quran doesn't know
Muhammad doesn't know scholars know do

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.890
not know it's not a man-made God it's
God who made himself a man this is

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:22.030
different philosophy they said also
Jesus is the only way only Savior I said

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:30.460
this is selfish what about others jesus
is the son of God oh my goodness this is

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:37.390
the worst one you're the worst of
creatures you go to hell and you have to

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:44.020
be killed they also spoke a lot about
Jews often the Bible read it Jews

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:54.460
closeted Jews I hated use I said what is
wrong with this nice people beautiful

00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:03.420
people funny ideas I said I'm going to
help these people

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:09.630
these people are so nice people they're
going to get my money back I have to pay

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:15.240
back this much I can do there are often
people that's good you can criticize

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.789
them they do not kill you if you
criticize them because if you criticize

00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:25.950
anybody in the Middle East you're in
problem chorim your fingers should be

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:32.970
chopped first and then your head chapter
8 verse 10 to 13 33 36 nobody can speak

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:37.860
about the world's own Muhammad so it has
penetrated the life of people even for

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.250
normal things you cannot criticize each
other but these people you can criticize

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:46.980
them I remember one day I went to the
pastor of the church he was an American

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.820
I said to him sir I think you did a
mistake

00:31:49.820 --> 00:32:02.429
he said just one I do a lot of mistakes
said I was embarrassed I said wow I was

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:09.210
expecting his to say something you know
you know aggressive to me and he really

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.159
was an humble man he said sir thank you
so much for reminding me for telling me

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:20.429
that could you do a favor to me it's so
hard to carry them mistakes with

00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:23.460
yourself
I just want to repent to God now and

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.559
he's repented to God you know he's an
old man Iranian people respect really

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:32.850
old people
it was so humbling to me so that's why I

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.110
said I can help these people I can go to
them I said friends you're nice people

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:40.010
but I think you're far behind

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:45.610
but glory to Jesus they changed my life
oh my goodness

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:53.379
you know the values of Jesus are so
powerful are so powerful you just need

00:32:53.379 --> 00:32:58.239
to be a simple follower of Jesus Christ
so simply follow him to change their

00:32:58.239 --> 00:33:04.059
life upheaval and these people would
those people there really and if your

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:10.419
simple he comes into your life in a
mighty way works through their life you

00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:17.710
know be in in your life and he did I was
thinking to change them they changed my

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:23.259
life and also Jesus was supernaturally
working in my life one night I had a

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:30.340
dream there was earthquake fire
everywhere violent wind I was in my

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:36.039
father's house exactly my father's house
so frightening houses were destroyed

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:42.220
people did you know died I I called God

light appears to me said to me I am

00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:51.970
Jesus I will help you come up from your
father's house I rushed out the house

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:57.489
fell down I woke up I saw that was a
dream I couldn't sleep anymore it was

00:33:57.489 --> 00:34:03.039
the middle of the night for very painful
the following Sunday I went to the

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:09.429
church I was amazed a preacher was
preaching there the title of his message

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:16.599
was the house under rock out Jesus in
his message he said everything I had

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:22.599
seen in my dream heard in my dream come
out from your father's house come out

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:27.040
from your old house leaving the house
that Jesus has built for you your

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.000
father's house is the old tradition you
have inherited from your forefathers

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.790
it's the House of Pain it's the house of
sin is to have some hostility ignorance

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:42.129
indifference every pain is coming from
that house come out leaving the house

00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:48.069
that Jesus has built for us the house of
absolute joy absolute peace absolute

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:53.200
freedom Jesus like eagle soaring under
high because I saw

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.300
as a light there in the high his calling
us come to me I will establish you on a

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:03.579
higher ground this is the ground of God
Satan cannot reach there come to him do

00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:10.180
not ignore him fully amazed and shocked
I said what is this man talking but this

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.369
is this was my dream in that day I
became interested to read their books

00:35:15.369 --> 00:35:21.550
they gave me in your Testament by
reading that book I was amazed I was

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:29.740
really amazed Bible is an amazing book
not because I'm a Christian I'm saying

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.510
that honestly I'm saying to you because
I've studied all other scriptures this

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:44.680
is an amazing book it really changed
whole dimension on my life destroyed my

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.630
philosophy implanted this philosophy
there I discovered from the just first

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:56.890
pages of the gospel that God in the
Bible is the relational God jesus said

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:02.020
the kingdom of God is in you if God is
not relational how can he come in you in

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:07.180
philosophical language it's called
personal God I didn't know there is one

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:13.300
God who is personal all gods are
impersonal because they are impersonal

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.260
they do not have any attributes and
personality in order to relate to other

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:24.030
people so they just stay away
that's why Mohammed didn't visit his God

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:35.910
because he is impersonal but God here is
relational it I was amazed because

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:45.880
gospel opened my eyes if God is
impersonal how he can create a personal

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:54.060
being God must be personal in order to
create personal being by the way

00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:00.609
impersonal gods do not reveal themselves
if someone does not reveal himself how

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:07.500
he is going to touch take
ape dust and breathing it and give

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:13.920
everything you know a living your spirit
H was so powerful no gospel is not

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.930
saying this directly but because I was
teaching philosophy it just was so

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:27.270
powerful and amazing to me
Wow Wow Wow can I have God hear gospel

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:35.370
is saying that can I be with God can I
be saved here can I get rid of the in

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:43.410
uncertainty Muhammad died in uncertainty
Muhammad the prophet of the so-called

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:54.360
perfect religion if religion is perfect
sir why you died in uncertainty but this

00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:03.090
tiny little community is saying to me I
am with God I am with God I was amazed

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:10.530
doctrinally I was reading Paul's words
in Romans chapter 5 he says one man

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:18.780
brought into this world oh this is the
yummiest part one man brought into this

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:24.060
world whereas in all other religions
including his lung gods brought into

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:31.170
this world
what is there a God who does not touch

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:39.210
sin who does not create scene that was
powerful and that chapter is a powerful

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:44.690
chapter Paul is a wonderful Vanna fact I
can say to you really daily here

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:51.660
this man's philosophy and doctrine is so
powerful he is saying that through the

00:38:51.660 --> 00:39:00.090
scene our one man all people will craft
that Adam did sin and sin came into the

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:07.410
life of people therefore through their
life and through the work of a righteous

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:15.720
one all will be saved you see this is
making sense because in all other

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.109
religions
there is not any righteous one to send

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:26.099
even gods are not righteous if a God
creates seen can you call that God are

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:33.240
you able to call that God a righteous
God no if you touch sin you live with

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:39.000
sin you're creating you're not righteous
but this is a powerful chapter one

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.109
senior made old people led them astray
one righteous has come to take them that

00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:52.319
it was powerful it really touched my
heart

00:39:52.319 --> 00:40:01.980
yeah God is holy he can save people in
other religions if they created sin you

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:08.579
cannot save people because if there is
not any essence of sin in you how do you

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:14.400
create sin you have created senior
unrighteous it was so powerful if you're

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.690
amazed doctrinal if you're amazed
philosophically of course you'll be

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:24.180
amazed socially politically morally - I
was really amazed that Jesus he changes

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:30.119
in m-u in every dimension of your life
socially I discovered that I can love my

00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:39.839
wife love your wife oh my goodness you
better read the Quran about ladies to

00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:46.140
see really what kind of heartbreaking
verses are their greatest scholars like

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:53.910
Razi subs very unfortunately many of
them are Iranian Buhari ladies are mute

00:40:53.910 --> 00:41:01.260
animal you do not love animals
possibly you Westerners do not

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.270
understand you because you love your
animals do

00:41:12.299 --> 00:41:19.509
gospel says love your wife as love your
body the second wife is adultery which

00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:27.729
you just share the love with one oneness
is so important in the love of Jesus

00:41:27.729 --> 00:41:34.959
Christ and about is morality I haven't
got time to talk to you here I'm saying

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:41.439
to you really the values of Jesus are so
powerful especially younger people you

00:41:41.439 --> 00:41:46.299
need to really learn this and amazed
people morally Muslim thinks that

00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:51.279
Muslims are the best moral example for
the world sir if you're not saved if

00:41:51.279 --> 00:41:55.509
you're not in the kingdom of God how can
you be a good example to other people I

00:41:55.509 --> 00:42:01.089
am in the kingdom of God I can't be a
good example to people I am living with

00:42:01.089 --> 00:42:08.859
God I am sharing the holiness of God I
am in the presence of God I can teach

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:15.029
you freedom I can teach you peace I can
teach you joy

00:42:15.029 --> 00:42:24.910
you cannot sir because I am mean it
I am leaving with God that's why I'm

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:30.640
saying that it's amazing we can amaze
people if you learn that I said I'm

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.529
going to give my life to Jesus he's so
good

00:42:34.529 --> 00:42:41.170
and after that he did other amazing
things in my life you see I'm a smiling

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.380
there

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:54.430
now this is this is the pastor I said to
him sir you did a mistake a wonderful

00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:01.390
brother brought my family they joined me
in Turkey God in an amazing way changed

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:06.880
the life of my wife I was standing in
the airport waiting for my family

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.049
praising Jesus thank you Jesus my
family's going to join me I'm going to

00:43:11.049 --> 00:43:16.450
talk to my wife today on the way home
she didn't know I was Christian if you

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:28.030
say they do not come I forgot she is not
coming with Cour

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:34.569
I forgot she is Muslim I was just
talking to Jesus thank you I'm going to

00:43:34.569 --> 00:43:38.770
talk to her
as soon as I saw her with four three

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:48.880
others sad people walking I said no I'm
not going to talk to her today possibly

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.290
later I was afraid to talk to her
unfortunately all my you know

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:58.150
experiences in prison came to my mind
that frightened me as a Christian you

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:03.280
not you should not be afraid you should
not be afraid

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.020
one other brothers word I wasn't
speaking many people in the West are

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:13.900
afraid please don't do that please don't
do that fear is terrible thing anyway I

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:19.000
was a baby in Christ I left it for lady
in the second week she said to me why

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.930
you're treating me like this I was nice
to her

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:35.100
are you changed that was a wonderful
sentence are you changed I was so

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:48.150
excited I jumped and brought my Bible I
said I've given my life of Jesus you

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.550
remember I was talking to you I said to
her she was in need when I was in

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:57.300
Istanbul we were talking through
telephone once she asked me what are you

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:03.660
doing I said nothing I found a friend I
couldn't say this friend is Jesus she

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.490
actually made fun of me she said you're
very clever in finding friends you found

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.850
one who took your money and escaped I
don't know what is this one going to the

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:23.460
video I said this friend is Jesus I gave
my heart to him he has changed me she

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:28.020
heard that she was terrified
unfortunately that's terrifying for a

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.500
Muslim to become Christian it's
terrifying

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:38.310
especially you're a lady whole lotta
things can happen to you but God was so

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:43.890
good and he heard our prayers I was
praying other brothers and sister were

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:50.340
praying we encouraged her to go to the
church meetings - ladies meeting she

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.180
didn't call she made a lot of excuses I
was encouraging ladies really to invite

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:59.190
her but they were not successful I put
fresh around the church ladies you have

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:03.960
to have my wife in your myths they said
well she's not coming you better talk to

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:10.380
your wife I said I can't talk to her she
is not letting me to talk after that she

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:16.530
became dictator you know I was coming
down she was going up unfortunate last

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:22.080
the culture someone should be dictator
unfortunately but as I mentioned to you

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:28.050
I encourage the church ladies that tried
it again and she went to their meeting

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:34.110
she actually went for a different
purpose she said this ladies made me

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:39.000
sick call me come come come
I'm going to go there and find the

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.900
good excuse and after that I will use
that excuse and will not go there

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:49.080
anymore but Jesus is so clever he knows
what he's doing she went there she was

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:57.540
amazed they were sharing each other you
know blessing one of them said the Lord

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.420
spoke to me this morning
the other one said the Lord spoke to me

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:06.230
last night she said who is this Lord
which is speaking to the ladies ladies

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:12.390
she was amazed she said my goodness I am
called a mute animal they're a

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:20.340
second-class citizen but God is speaking
to ladies year as she continued to go to

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:25.260
their meetings after two and a half
months early in the morning I woke up

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.570
and she woke up she said she had a dream
with Jesus what was the dream well we

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:35.970
were several ladies walking with Jesus
in a mountainous area they all could go

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:42.630
through a steep valley but as if I was
afraid to go Jesus called me come I said

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:48.120
if I come I fall down I'm afraid jesus
said be not afraid take your first step

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.040
she took the first step the valley was
lifted up the mountain was brought down

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:58.440
all mountain side became level and she
walked to Jesus as soon as I heard I was

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:03.900
amazed I jumped and brought my Bible I
said this is written in the Bible this

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.070
is the message of Isaiah you read Isaiah
always speaks about that the voice of a

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:13.290
calling man in the dead all valleys and
mountains will become level why because

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:19.800
mighty God is walking in front of you if
he walks in front of you all valleys and

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:26.160
mountains of your life will be flattened
I was reading the passages to her she

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.740
was crying that was the morning she
opened her heart to the Lord a beautiful

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:40.770
morning she was crying I was crying that
was the morning I poured out my heart to

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:46.620
her and I apologized her for all the
terrible things in the name of Islam I

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:51.260
had done to her an Coulter
that was the morning for the first time

00:48:51.260 --> 00:49:03.319
in my life I called her honey because
our Lord is honey I'm so so humble in

00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:12.410
his presence so so humble I think I can
speak to every person in the world but

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:19.490
really when I come to his presence I
just feel so humbled because he's so

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:24.319
sweet
he's sweeter than honey his yummy is

00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:33.950
delicious his words are powerful we need
really to leave as his words and he

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:40.300
changed us our life and brought us and
made us one with each other

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:58.840
they are the princesses of the Lord
Jesus Christ they are beautiful aren't

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.790
they
I don't want them to close their faces I

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.880
just want to see their faces look at
them

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.240
and I'm sure my Heavenly Father more
than me

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:17.020
loves to see them their beauty their are
the princesses of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:23.520
Islam says to them you're second class
Islam Muslim scholars says to them

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:32.920
you're animal but Jesus says you're my
princess you ladies your girls are the

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:38.920

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:22.410
put him in the first priority he is
better than everything I have to love

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:27.539
him more than my spouse more than my
children because if I do not love him

00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:31.710
more than my family more than my friends
then I will not be able to love my

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.549
family
you know appropriately he is so good let

00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:42.690
us live for him may the Lord Jesus
Christ empower all of you touch all of

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:50.460
your heart so that you can renew your
vow with the Lord Jesus Christ and I

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:56.150
stand for him boldly thank you so much
for your time

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.530
you
