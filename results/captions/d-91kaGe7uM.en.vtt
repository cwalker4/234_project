00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.802
we didn’t have shows last week,
which,

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:04.004
in the era of Donald Trump,
is always risky,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.606
because the news moves so fast.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.808
At the end of five days off,
we could be back

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.076
and been like,
"Well, we’re back.

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.211
"President Trump
and Vice President Flavor Flav

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:15.082
just announced that they will
steal Seattle back from Mexico."

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:18.919
Thankfully, though, we
didn’t miss too much last week.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.788
But we did want to catch up
with some fun Trump highlights,

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.390
starting with this one.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.926
Last Wednesday, in a moment
during an advisory board meeting

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.128
at the White House
that was caught on camera,

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:31.598
President Trump called Apple CEO
Tim Cook "Tim Apple."

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.468
I used to say, "Tim, you got
to start doing it over here."

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.270
And you really have.
I mean, you’ve really,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.272
uh, put a big investment
in our country.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.340
We appreciate it very much,
Tim Apple.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.276
(laughter)

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.615
Tim Apple.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.083
You know what I like
about this one?

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.019
It’s just dumb. All right?

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.421
Yeah. It’s just a fun,
dumb mistake that Trump made.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.090
Or maybe, maybe this is
just how he says names.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.093
He calls you by what you do
and your first name.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.562
It’s Tim Apple.
It’s, uh, Jeff Amazon.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.732
It’s Jussie Unemployed,
uh, you know?

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.269
And this should have been
just a fun slip of the tongue.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.338
We laugh, we move on.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:15.275
But because Donald Compulsive
Liar can’t let anything go,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.811
this morning, he tweeted this.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.681
"I referred to Tim and Apple

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:24.017
"as Tim/Apple
as an easy way to save time

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.186
and words."

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.121
(laughter, applause)

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.825
Really, Donald?

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.227
Really?
That’s what you were doing?

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:37.364
Well, allow me
to save time and words.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.233
Get (bleep) out here!

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.169
Like, you’re saving time

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.705
by saying a confusing sentence
and then, days later,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.306
tweeting a long explanation
about it?

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.508
And, also, since when
does Donald Trump care

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.843
about saving time, right?

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.179
No one wastes more time
than Donald Trump.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.315
He spends as much time on
the golf course as Tiger Woods

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:59.219
and as much time on porn stars
as Tiger Woods, okay?

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.190
So Trump wants us to believe
that Tim Apple is fake news.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.826
But there’s actually
some fake news

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.761
that is plaguing the president
right now.

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.429
It’s about Melania.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.765
REPORTER: The fake Melania
 conspiracy is back

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.701
 after the first lady’s visit to
 Alabama and Georgia this week.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.170
 The theory that Melania Trump
 had a body double

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.439
 for public appearances
 began in 2017.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.575
 That was denied
 by fact-checkers.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.977
 Now though, again, Twitter
 users are comparing this

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.847
 to other images, arguing
 it’s not the same woman,

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:29.516
 but many also commenting
 lighting and makeup

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:32.519
 are likely causes
 for the mistaken identity.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.855
H...

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:38.125
How is this on the news?

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.726
How is this even a thing?

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.996
Of course, Melania looks
a little different

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.531
on some days, all right?

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.066
She’s a person.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.602
Every person looks different
day to day.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:51.805
This was me, like,
two months ago, okay?

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:55.008
This was me three years ago,
all right?

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.877
This was me yesterday,

00:02:56.877 --> 00:03:00.547
when I found out
J.Lo is engaged, okay?

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:01.615
(applause)

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:03.683
I look different...

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.019
I look different,
because, clearly,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.489
I’m so happy... for her...

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.826
and, like, the 20th best Yankee.

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.297
I’m very happy.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.234
(sniffles)

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.303
I’ll be fine. I’ll be fine.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.304
I just--

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.639
I wanted A-Rod for myself.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.507
(laughter)

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.476
So, please, guys,
let’s stop with this whole

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.878
fake Melania business, all
right, because it’s not true.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.346
Although I will say this,

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.348
if you do zoom in
on that picture,

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.150
there is something
a little suspicious,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.487
and that is
that they’re holding hands.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.957
-(applause) -So, on second
thought, maybe fake Melania.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.625
But conspiracy theories aside,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.961
there’s another story
that Trump wishes was fake news.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.430
Remember, a few weeks ago,
uh, when Robert Kraft,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.499
Patriots owner
and guy you always see naked

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.368
on a nude beach, got caught up
in a Florida prostitution sting?

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.771
Well, it turns out
Kraft’s happy ending

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.773
may lead to a sad one
for Donald Trump.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.175
There is a new twist
to the prostitution scandal

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.711
involving Robert Kraft.
The woman who once owned

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.247
the Florida massage parlor
tied to that case

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.049
appears in a selfie
with President Trump.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.786
Here’s the picture. This is
a picture of 45-year-old Li Yang

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:15.055
at a Super Bowl party
that was hosted by the president

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.923
at his Mar-a-Lago resort
in West Palm Beach,

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.658
and it was taken
the day of the game.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.528
Kraft and the president, as
you know, are longtime friends

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.964
and they have socialized
at the golf resort before.

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:27.667
This woman was
at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.737
All right, that’s just dangerous
for both of them,

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.706
especially for her,
because you never know

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:35.609
when Trump is gonna pull
another Tim Apple, you know?

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:39.079
Might be just be like, "This is
my friend Cindy Handjobspa."

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:42.082
(laughter, groaning, applause)

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.684
And...

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.686
And it’s not just...

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:49.322
It’s not just that she’s taking
photos with the president.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.726
It’s that she might be
pimping him out, too.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.327
MAN:
 Her name is Li Yang.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.829
 She goes by "Cindy."

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:58.398
 She’s been spotted
 with the who’s who of the GOP,

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.501
 including the president’s sons
 at Mar-a-Lago.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.638
WOMAN: 45-year-old Li Yang
 runs a consulting business

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.941
 that has offered
 to sell Chinese clients access

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:10.410
 to the president
 and his family at Mar-a-Lago.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.445
 The company boasts
 that it has arranged

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.114
 taking photos
 with the president,

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.816
 and suggests
 it can set up a White House

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.752
 and Capitol Hill dinner.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:21.087
Goddamn, man.
How does every scandal

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.456
somehow lead back
to Donald Trump?

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.859
Like, this dude is like
the Kevin Bacon of corruption.

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:27.661
-(laughter)
-I’m serious.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.396
Like, you could probably link
Donald Trump

00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:31.698
to Kevin Bacon
just through scandals.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.301
You go, uh,
Kevin Bacon had money stolen

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.670
in a Ponzi scheme
by Bernie Madoff, okay?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.106
Uh, Madoff also stole money
from Governor Eliot Spitzer.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.342
And Spitzer was busted
in a prostitution ring

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.878
after a tipoff from Roger Stone,
who was just indicted

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:47.380
by Mueller in the investigation
of Donald Trump.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.382
-Boom! Four moves, baby.
-(applause and cheering)

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:51.251
Four moves.

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.320
Everywhere you go.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.022
And basically,
that’s our world now.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.058
A rich guy can’t get jerked off

00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:59.726
without it somehow leading

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.095
to a possible
Trump campaign violation.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.731
So, even though
President Trump never went

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.732
to that massage parlor,
somehow they still (bleep) him.
