00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.370
There are lots of things that can go wrong
in a house.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.080
When the plumbing goes, you've got real trouble.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.200
I've got a leak in my garage.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.100
Jenny's got a leak in her water heater.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.460
But it's a leak we created.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.860
It's not at all serious.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.270
Is there anything currently wrong with this
hot water heater?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.270
Not at all.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.270
There is nothing wrong with it.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.230
Mark Gablehouse is a licensed plumber in Phoenix
with over 30 years in the business.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.230
It's an excellent unit.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.230
It's 3 years old.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.610
It's virtually a new unit.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.660
We asked Mark to create a common problem that
a legitimate plumber should be able to figure

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.660
out.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.320
If you can see there is water here right now.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.240
All he did was unscrew this nut to create
a slow drip.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.420
We just loosened this nut a little so that
the water would seep out.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.530
All you'd have to do to fix it is tighten
the nut.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.600
Takes about 10 seconds.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.250
If a technician is doing his job, he's going
to check these connections as a first thing.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.940
It looks like my water heater is leaking in
my garage.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.220
So will the plumbers Jenny calls be able to
diagnose the problem and fix the drip?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.440
Will it be Jenny's bank account that gets
drained?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.540
Here comes Adrian with No Worries Rooter.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.460
Hey how are you?

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.460
Doing good.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460
Jenny.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.830
Nice to meet you.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.750
Adrian, come on in.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.680
It's electric, 50 gallons.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.920
Jenny heads inside leaving Adrian alone in
the garage.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.200
But Adrian doesn't try to diagnose or fix
the problem.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.159
Instead he walks around in circles for a while
chatting on his cell phone.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.170
Apparently, he's already made up his mind.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.700
He did no diagnosis whatsoever.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.510
Jenny, you need a new water heater.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.510
I need a new water heater?

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.510
I just called my guy.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.510
We have one in stock.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.510
It's exactly like that.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.560
Why would a plumber call somebody about a
new water heater before he's even diagnosed

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
the problem.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.760
Obviously he shouldn't have.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.900
Adrian asks if Jenny wants hot water, she
has no other choice.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.920
So this is a must do right now?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770
Well it's definite.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.840
So how much will it cost?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.799
For the water heater total, everything with
installation, $760.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.919
$760?

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:20.400
Seven hundred and sixty dollars to replace
a water heater that works just fine.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.739
It's time for me to have a chat with Adrian.

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.099
Hey how's it going?

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.099
Doing good.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.099
How are you?

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.829
What have we got going on?

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.420
Uh, water heater that's leaking.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.249
Can you tell me where the leak is?

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.650
I can show you.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.709
OK good.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.579
Alright....so this is a water leak here.

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.480
Usually this is an indicator that this is
a leak.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.219
So once it starts leaking here....

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.139
Adrian says there's another problem.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.640
He says the leak has caused the inside of
the tank to corrode.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.499
Usually once these start corroding, and it
starts going through the water heater, it

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.480
effects the cylinder.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.249
Remember, all that really needed to be done
was to tighten this nut.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.199
What would you bet me that I could fix this
in about 2 seconds.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.430
Show me.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.430
OK.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.249
So you brought me out here to fix this yourself?

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.959
No, I brought you out here to see what you'd
do.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.579
Because there's something you got to know.

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.510
I'm Chris Hanson with Dateline NBC.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.510
Yes.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.120
And we're doing a story on the quality of
work of repairmen who come out to houses.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.829
You came in, you barely looked at the thing,
you walked around in circles and you called

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.620
your guy, to try to get a brand new water
heater.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.109
The way that appears, that makes it look like
you were trying to sell our Jenny a water

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.760
heater she didn't need without doing any diagnosis
on the water heater itself.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.540
I'll be honest with you that once a water
heater goes bad in corrosion, there's no hope

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
for it.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.090
In my expertise I'll be honest with you, this
is what I see.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.349
There's corrosion right here, if you bring
this camera down here...Of course there is

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.659
no corrosion.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.470
Our expert says that what Adrian is pointing
out is just dirty water.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.609
And there's no way a plumber could look at
this and say this is corrosion down below,

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:11.609
you need to replace this?

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.609
Absolutely not.

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.930
So why wasn't Adrian able to figure out the
problem?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.500
There's one possible clue.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.390
Adrian, are you a licensed plumber?

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.470
I am not.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.740
No I'm not.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.360
I lost my job with Wells Fargo, I have a baby
girl and had to start my own business.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.510
I had to rely on something I knew what to
do and that was plumbing, drain cleaning business.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.110
But the reality is, you told her something.....The
reality is, to make your story look really

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.380
good is that I'm unlicensed, OK, and you want
to make this story look like I'm the criminal

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.930
here when in fact I'm here just trying to
make a living.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.440
As Adrian heads to his car, he tells us he
should've seen this coming.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.450
This should've been the big indicator here...this
bike.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.780
The infamous bike laying on the carport.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.950
Why is that infamous?

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.890
Because I watch your shows and every time
there's some type of setup going on there's

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.210
a real crazy bike....I don't know.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.560
I'm a big fan though.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.790
We're not sure what he means, but we appreciate
the fan.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.100
These 3 plumbers are with a company called
DrainPro.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.260
We've got a leak.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.700
Is your electric turned off?

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.700
No.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.840
I'm going to go turn it off.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.870
Again, none of the servicemen seem to do anything
to diagnose the problem.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.980
After chatting for a while, this technician
named Don delivers the bad news.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.160
The water heater is shot.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.660
OK, this one cannot be fixed?

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.660
No.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.270
It's leaking out of the actual tank itself.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.610
Don the plumber says a leaking tank can be
very dangerous.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.410
Once that water starts flowing like that,
it can literally explode.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.300
The pressure on the inside.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.590
Did you say explosion?

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.200
Yeah, they can explode, absolutely.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.940
Like blow up, yeah.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.480
Oh god, you're kidding?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.140
Again, all it was, was a loose nut.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.140
That is not good.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.670
It wouldn't blow up the house, but it would
literally tear down part of the garage.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:20.090
If you were in there...Even worse, he says
if he hadn't been there to turn off the electricity,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.070
Jenny could've been in even more danger.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.070
Don to the rescue.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.940
You're safe now, but you don't want to turn
it back on.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.830
We also turned the electric power off to it.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.560
You won't be electrocuted by stepping in the
water and touching it.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.050
It's completely safe now.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.560
You just need to get it replaced.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.560
Explosion?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560
Electrocuted?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.300
I head downstairs to speak with Don.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.600
Hey.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.600
So what just happened?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600
What have we got going on?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.900
What's going on is basically the tank is going
to be filled up with pressure, and the hard

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.750
water deposits that we have in Arizona, start
to eat through the tank.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.420
It's time for me to let Don know he's failed
to spot a simple problem.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.730
Well here's what I think.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.440
I think that you're lying to me.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.600
I'm lying to you?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.050
Why would you think that?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.760
Because I know that all you have to do is
tighten that and the problem goes away.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760
This thing right here?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.070
You know how I know that?

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.980
Well you tell me I guess.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.200
Something you have to know is that I'm Chris
Hanson with Dateline NBC.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.780
OK...and we're doing a story on the quality
of work done by repairmen.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.950
We had experts inspect this, and actually
set up this scenario by loosening this.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.950
OK.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:37.550
So what you did was come in here and try to
hustle Jenny into a new hot water heater and

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.850
charge her about double the going rate for
what's going here.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.970
The water heater is also under warranty, I
didn't have to tell you that but it is.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.340
But all you had to do is look down here and
see that.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.590
But what you did do, was tell her that this
water heater could explode and it could take

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.590
down the garage.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.830
It could, part of the garage.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.830
That's what I said.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.150
I didn't say it could blow up the house.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.150
That was an exaggeration.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.970
OK well you guys can have fun here.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.230
Well why would you do that?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.270
Don't you think you give other repairmen a
bad name by doing something like that?

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.169
You told her she needed something she didn't
need.

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:07.290
She does need a new water heater.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.290
She does not.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.230
The water heater works perfectly.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.230
Anything else you want to say?

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.460
See you on the news.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.740
Coming up, an air conditioner repairman who
knows a lot about television.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.760
We have cameras all around.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.280
Oh I'm sure.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.810
I know how that works.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.889
So what does he know about air conditioners?

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:27.620
This is your capacitor.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.910
It's testing bad.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.740
When Dateline continues.
