00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.830
- Say something pretty in my ear.

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:05.192
- Oh?

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.210
My god, he's either
going to take me captive

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.785
or he's going to do
very nice things to me.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:15.618
(laughs)

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:18.930
(instrumental music)

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.090
- My name is Georgina.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.093
- My name is Yanna.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.890
- I'm here, I'm gonna be guessing.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.190
I don't know what I'm
gonna be guessing about.

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:29.783
- Oh, okay!

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.823
- Several, yeah.

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:34.710
I speak fluent Chinese, I lived there

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.410
for 15 years, and I'm a translator.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.409
- I speak Mandarin,

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.160
and then I speak Flemish,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.550
which is like a dialect similar to Dutch.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.300
- I just speak Spanish and English.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.510
- It used to be really good when I was

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.343
in elementary school.

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:48.590
I don't know how it is now.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.883
- Oh my gosh!

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.478
Without seeing them?

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:56.228
That's gonna be hard.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.312
Oh my gosh, okay.

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:05.723
(heels clicking)

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:09.502
- So, do you start or do I start?

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:10.335
Whoa.

00:01:14.172 --> 00:01:15.922
Damn, this is brutal.

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:20.443
- (speaks in foreign
language) I like that.

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:22.090
- Can you say something mean to me?

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.273
Like insult me.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.590
- Say, hey we're gonna
go (snaps playfully)

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.913
get some food.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.440
It sounds Southeast Asian to me,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.580
and that's just because
I'm from Southeast Asia,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.320
so maybe I think it's sounds similar

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.880
to something I've heard there.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.090
- This is gonna sound real bad,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.400
but it sounds like the
Thai restaurant I go to.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.230
- A Scandinavian accent maybe?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.360
Like the girl in the tattoo movie,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.060
she kind of sounds like (mumbles).

00:01:58.357 --> 00:01:59.331
- Hey, wait a minute.

00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:00.998
What'd you just say?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.290
Mongolian?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.123
- Yes!

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.539
- Oh my gosh!

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.337
(laughs loudly)

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:10.493
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:02:10.493 --> 00:02:11.570
- It's okay.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.490
- I've a good portion Mongolian.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.340
I'm actually a good portion Mongolian.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.320
- What's the name of the guy

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.790
who raped everybody?

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.960
- Genghis Khan?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.730
- Genghis Khan, there we go.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940
- Well he had 500 like wives.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.220
- So we probably are product

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.053
of one of those wives.

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:26.886
(laughs)

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:28.185
- So I lived in China for 15 years,

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:29.270
and I went to Mongolia just once,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.040
but I met a couple of
other Mongolian people.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.400
My impression is that the Mongolians

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.363
are not terribly fond of the Chinese.

00:02:35.594 --> 00:02:37.498
- (exhales sharply) That is true.

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:38.331
- Yeah.

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.250
- People in Mongolia are really

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.593
protective of our own country.

00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:42.426
They're like--

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:43.440
- So you got Russia, you got China,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.273
and then you're like a little--

00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:45.106
- Right, it's just like

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.050
in the middle.
- Right.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.200
- Can I learn, I'm sorry?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.533
(laughs lightheartedly)

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.494
- Bye.

00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:02.100
(speaks foreign language)
means, "Are you okay?"

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.093
in French.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.403
- Did you just say like,

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:06.236
"My name is Jenny"?

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:08.180
- Mhm.
- Oh, see I'm good.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.630
I'm picking up little pieces.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.880
I feel like there's like parts

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.970
of French in there.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.803
It sounds really good.

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:15.983
I want you to teach me this language,

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:17.260
because it sounds way better

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.194
than the last one.

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.419
(chuckles softly)

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.950
Oh, no offense Mongolia.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.950
- Can you say hello?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.500
We're gonna do this the ugly way.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.670
Can you tell me how to say yes

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.520
in your language?

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.520
What?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.707
- She makes like a

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.750
oh sound when she speaks.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.850
It sounds kinda like from Africa.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.599
- I'm guessing this is

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.432
an African language

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.843
with some influence from France.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.250
Okay, there we go.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.980
I'm not gonna guess the actual language

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.330
or the actual origin country.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.970
I'm sorry that's disappointing.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.410
I got as close as I'm gonna get.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.330
- Swahili?

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.163
- Ooh.

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:02.493
- Um, what do they speak, Zimbabwean?

00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:07.115
- Me?
- Yeah!

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:08.740
(laughs nervously)

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.573
No!

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.480
- I'm just going by the movies you guys,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.350
I'm so sorry.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.183
I don't travel.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.073
- How close was I?

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:17.906
- You said Africa,

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:19.665
so you got the origin.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.560
- (chuckles) It's a big place.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.393
- Yeah.

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:22.226
I'm from Congo,

00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:23.640
and we were colonized by Belgium.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.910
- Oh, I did almost say Congo.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
- Yeah.

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:26.576
- In part because it was the only

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:27.440
country that I could remember

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.149
exactly which, who it had been

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.157
colonized by.
- You should have said it.

00:04:30.157 --> 00:04:31.332
- I know, I should have just, okay.

00:04:31.332 --> 00:04:32.165
- Yeah.

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:32.998
- What is the name of the language...

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:33.900
- Lingala.
- Lingala.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.733
- Yeah.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:35.566
- Is there a large community

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:36.785
over here that speaks Lingala

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:37.618
or do you just kinda have

00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:38.690
an island out here?

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.900
- I speak with my family mostly.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.733
- Okay.

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:42.566
- How do you say like,

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:43.537
"What is your name"?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.853
- Yeah.

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:49.190
You can say, your name is

00:04:50.864 --> 00:04:51.697
- Uh huh.

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:54.012
- And then you say your name.

00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:56.920
- (speaks foreign language) Jordan.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.836
- Almost

00:04:57.836 --> 00:04:58.669
(laughs)
- Aww, we're working on it,

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.836
working on it.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.683
- Oh my gosh.

00:05:05.683 --> 00:05:07.700
- How do you say happy birthday?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.593
Can you sing it?

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.260
That noise you're making right now

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.293
is crazy man.

00:05:16.492 --> 00:05:18.720
(scoffs emphatically)

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.812
- Klingon?

00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:21.890
(laughs astoundingly)
- Like I have no idea.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.800
- It's something Middle East,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.010
a Middle Eastern language.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.820
- Hebrew or Arabic.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.080
He's like, "You're very close."

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.617
Is that what you're saying?

00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:31.006
Yes!

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:31.839
Can you say no?

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.340
Okay, so yeah, that was no!

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.610
Oh my gosh, I'm so wrong.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.180
- I'm gonna go completely

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.290
in a different direction and guess

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.970
that this a Native American language

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.203
of some sort.

00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:46.190
How do you say no in your language?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.311
Oh, well then maybe that was a yes huh?

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:49.640
(laughs triumphantly)

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.473
- Hello.

00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:51.990
I have no idea, I can't even guess.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.823
What is it?

00:05:52.823 --> 00:05:54.293
- Okay, so I speak Makah.

00:05:54.293 --> 00:05:57.070
So a Makah tribal Indian reservation.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.940
- It's a Native American language.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.370
- Yes, Native American.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.590
- Is that the language that you speak

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.220
like most of the time when you just...

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.800
- No, we try as much as we can,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.560
but we don't have any
fluent speakers anymore.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.393
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:10.900
So we have seven of us teachers.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.970
We're trying to...

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.820
- To bring it back in?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.835
- Yeah, so.

00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:14.668
- Okay.

00:06:14.668 --> 00:06:15.501
- And you're the only ones,

00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.334
teaching the,
- Yes.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.244
Teaching the language?

00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:18.077
- Whoa.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.510
- Can I touch your throat so I can

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.425
feel the sound?

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:21.258
- Sure.
(laughs)

00:06:21.258 --> 00:06:22.610
- No, like really that's how I taught

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.260
my kids to talk.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.220
Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.053
You don't feel weird?

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:26.886
- No.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.080
(laughs softly)
- It's so weird.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.890
He eats the words, like
that's how it sounds.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.740
- Would you like to learn something?

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.573
- Yeah, sure.

00:06:34.573 --> 00:06:35.843
Something with a difficult sound.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.260
- It means like, hello, like, is that you?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.093
- Oh!

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.410
That's not right, is it?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.232
- It's a tough one though,

00:06:49.232 --> 00:06:54.232
it took a long time.
(laughs deeply)

00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:03.680
- I feel like I just walked
into Game of Thrones.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.667
- Say something pretty in my ear.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.538
My god, he's either
going to take me captive

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:14.371
(deeply laughs)
- or he's going

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:15.923
to do very nice things to me.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.520
- Is that Russian?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.353
- Russian!

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.320
- Uh you sound like a very large

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.230
white man, who is I don't know,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.880
from Eastern Europe or something.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.894
Damn, I was way off.

00:07:33.894 --> 00:07:34.840
(chuckles)

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.673
(claps)
Fuck.

00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:39.660
(laughs loudly)

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.930
- You look very surprised

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.763
when you took off the...

00:07:41.763 --> 00:07:42.630
- No, I was surprised

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.023
because the only color that you see

00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:47.340
on a Russian on the TV is white.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.173
I'm sorry.

00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:49.006
- That's true, that's true.

00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:49.839
- And you speak Russian

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:50.672
because you grew up there

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:52.150
or you enjoy..
- No, I've been to Russia,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.270
but I have a degree in Russian language.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.400
- And what were you yelling at me

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.410
in the beginning?

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.830
- Hello, you dirty bitch.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.554
- Ah, I thought it was
something like that.

00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:00.387
(laughs)
- I said,

00:08:00.387 --> 00:08:01.541
"Suck my dick passionately

00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:03.167
"like a real whore."

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:04.200
(laughs quietly)

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.800
- Um, but I mean that's how Russian is.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.060
They curse real bad.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.940
- You're gonna have to teach me

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.910
some of those words here

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.360
because if I've been called a

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.210
dirty bitch on camera, I at least wanna..

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.550
- Okay, so (speaks Russian) means dirty

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.793
and (speaks Russian) is bitch.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.450
Do not say this to Russian people

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.445
because they might be
a little bit offended.

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:25.278
- Oh yeah, there we go.

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:28.567
Thank you very much.
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.420
- Wow.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.731
That is so smokey.

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:39.052
(laughs softly)

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.720
- There's a lot of throat in there.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.030
Are you Egyptian?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.660
- I think it's Arabic.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.000
- See, the, (low exhale)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.833
- That!

00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:50.490
- It reminded me very vaguely

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.603
of Arabic, but it wasn't Arabic.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.593
Hebrew!

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.790
- Oh my gosh.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.843
- What did you think?

00:09:01.577 --> 00:09:03.080
- I'm very wrong.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.440
- You're not totally wrong.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.273
It's like middle east
- It's in

00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:06.640
the Middle Eastern family, okay.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.910
- Okay, areas.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.743
- Semitic.

00:09:08.743 --> 00:09:09.576
- Hebrew, I don't know.

00:09:09.576 --> 00:09:10.420
Is that what you're speaking?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.253
- Yes.

00:09:11.253 --> 00:09:13.000
- Ah, I should know that.
- Nice

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.789
- My dad's not gonna like this video.

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:15.622
(chuckles)

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:16.840
- What's going on, what's your dad?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.729
- My dad's Jewish.

00:09:17.729 --> 00:09:18.960
- Uh oh.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.480
- If I need to learn one thing

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.070
in Hebrew, what's the most important thing

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.903
I need to say?

00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:25.322
- Oh, what does that mean?

00:09:25.322 --> 00:09:26.155
- I love you.

00:09:26.155 --> 00:09:26.988
- Oh, I love you.

00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:27.821
Aww!

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.845
- Yeah.
- Thank you,

00:09:29.845 --> 00:09:30.998
- It was nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you.

00:09:30.998 --> 00:09:31.998
- Thank you.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.710
- Oh, that sounds cool.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.160
- Can you insult me actually?

00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:42.570
Ah man, that didn't sound good.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.790
- Say something you know like kind

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.783
of sweet to me.

00:09:46.963 --> 00:09:48.250
(stammers)

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.280
Okay, say, "I'd love to
take you out to dinner

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.779
and buy you flowers."

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:53.612
(stammers)

00:09:53.612 --> 00:09:55.862
(chuckles)

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.900
- I think it's Hindi

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.730
because I have a friend that speaks Hindi

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.880
and it sounds kinda like this.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.040
- I'm guessing an Indian language.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.050
- Ooh.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.896
- Oh, I've created a
political problem here.

00:10:19.896 --> 00:10:21.586
It's probably Pakistani language.

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:24.380
- Oh, see, a close to it.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.800
Where you from?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.920
- Kansas.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.290
- What language were you speaking then?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.123
- Urdu.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.070
- Where's that from?

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.400
- Mostly in Pakistan.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.470
- It kind of sound like my friend

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.490
that (mumbles)

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.663
- Yeah!

00:10:38.663 --> 00:10:39.950
- The similarities between Hindi and Urdu

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.913
is like 95%.

00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:41.746
- Ah.

00:10:41.746 --> 00:10:42.750
- So, a lot of my friends are Indian

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.350
and they speak Hindi,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.960
so we can communicate that way,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.360
and just make fun of all the

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.450
- Who are probably idiot foreigners?

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.362
- No, they're white people.

00:10:51.362 --> 00:10:52.195
(gasps dramatically)

00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:53.390
Although if I'm getting the pronunciation

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.470
wrong, I could just as
easily be saying horses.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.303
- What's the difference?

00:10:56.303 --> 00:10:57.136
Say, horses and then white people.

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:58.160
- I don't know the difference man,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.860
it's very very subtle.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.830
- If I ever get airdropped into Pakistan,

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.804
that's what I'll say.

00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:04.800
(shouts in foreign language)

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.020
- How would you hit on me at a bar

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.853
or a club?

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.660
I would like to dance.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.663
I think you said something about dancing.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.673
- Flemish?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.263
Was I close?

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.846
A bit.

00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:24.000
(chuckles)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.120
Keep going, please.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.603
It's Dutch maybe.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.030
They are blonde and have pigtails

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.880
and big skirts, and they milk cows.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.080
I think that's exactly what this

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.980
person looks like.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.207
- Hello.
- Oh.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:47.100
(giggles)

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.933
Is it Dutch?

00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:48.973
- It is Dutch.

00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:50.110
- Okay, have you ever milked a cow?

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.490
- No, I have not actually.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.460
- Are you Dutch?

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.580
- I lived in the Netherlands

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.710
for seven years.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.543
- Okay.

00:11:55.543 --> 00:11:56.376
Alright, you gotta teach me one

00:11:56.376 --> 00:11:57.700
like one bad word, something mean

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.650
to say to somebody.

00:12:00.194 --> 00:12:01.200
- Mhm.
- And what's that?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.033
- Ugly.

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:02.866
- Ugly?

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:05.563
- Yeah.

00:12:05.563 --> 00:12:07.570
- We could speak full
conversation right now.

00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:11.894
(laughs)

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.973
(screams)

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.323
- No?

00:12:28.116 --> 00:12:30.563
- Are you speaking your Native language?

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.110
Is that African?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.440
- It sounds like it
could be Southeast Asian

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.770
or an Asian language of some sort.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.500
- I'm thinking it's either Southern Asian

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.493
or Middle Eastern.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.434
- Mongolian?

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:50.267
I'm joking.

00:12:50.267 --> 00:12:51.100
(laughs loudly)

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.330
- I'm gonna go ahead and have you

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.957
explain to me what
language you're speaking.

00:12:54.957 --> 00:12:56.410
- I'm speaking Khmer.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.670
- Khmer, what is that?

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.780
- It's a from a country called Cambodia.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.390
- Are you, teach, teach me something?

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.250
- Yeah, what do you wanna know?

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.083
- Curse words.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:03.980
- You can use this one

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.700
in multiple situations.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.550
If it's a good thing, you'll be like,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.670
But if you're like, oh
that isn't what I mean,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.503
- Oh.

00:13:12.503 --> 00:13:13.336
So that's like, Fuck!
(chuckles)

00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:15.838
- So you're either like, fuck or fuck.

00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:17.640
- Yeah, that's sort of thing

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.070
- Yeah.
- Well that's easy.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.043
- Thanks (laughs)
- Nice to meet you.

00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:21.626
- Nice to meet you.

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:26.960
I got you (mumbles)

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.207
Not close enough huh?

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:30.950
(gentle laughter)

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.126
- Oh yeah, that's right.

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:33.486
I guessed one!

00:13:33.486 --> 00:13:34.319
Yes!

00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:35.550
(applause)

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.803
That's right, I'm gonna
learn Russian, you guys.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.095
- I wish I would have got the Hebrew

00:13:42.095 --> 00:13:44.090
as well, I feel like should've just

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.923
gotten that one.

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:48.290
- Oh, no.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.560
Probably not.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.400
It just reminded me how long it takes

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.233
to learn a language

00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:53.160
and what a huge pain

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.993
in the ass it is.

00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:57.120
- These just teach me how much we need

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.800
to learn about other
cultures, other countries,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.973
and I need to stop watching movies
