&gt;&gt; IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.423 align:start size:94% position:6%
WE'VE GONE OUT TO DINNER
20 TIMES.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.559

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.202 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW
HER NAME.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:45.939 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; NO, OF COURSE I DO.
IT'S MISSY?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.079 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE?
&gt;&gt; KAREN!

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.949
&gt;&gt; TODD, I'M SO SORRY.
INTERESTING CHOICE TO APOLOGIZE

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:03.223 align:start size:94% position:6%
TO HIM.
AS OPPOSED TO HER.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:06.426
I GUESS YOU JUST DON'T CONSIDER
HER A HUMAN BEING.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.561 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF HORRIBLE GAME
SHOW IS THIS?

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:15.535 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT'S THAT NAME.
&gt;&gt; COURTNEY, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.137 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER WALK ON
CLUE.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:22.575 align:start size:94% position:6%
♪♪♪
&gt;&gt; HEY, IT'S JAKE FROM YOUR

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.111
ADVERTISING FIRM IN WHICH YOU
ARE THE ONLY FEMALE PARTNER.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:30.984
&gt;&gt; AND I'M HIS WIFE.
NOW, WE MET AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:35.255
WHEN I SHOWED UP, YOU GAVE ME A
BIG HUG AND SAID, "THANK GOD I'M

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.458 align:start size:94% position:6%
NOT THE ONLY WOMAN HERE
ANYMORE."

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.661
EVERY TIME YOU SEE ME, YOU SAY,
"HEY, LADY" OR "HEY, MAMA."

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:57.577 align:start size:94% position:6%
WHAT'S MY NAME?
&gt;&gt; MAMA?

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:58.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; OOH, NOT GOING TO CUT IT,

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.179 align:start size:94% position:6%
MAMA.
AUDIENCE?

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.513 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; ALLISON &gt;&gt; BUT, LITTLE THAN
YOU KNOW.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.681 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WORSE THAN ME.
&gt;&gt; HOW IS THAT WORSE?

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:06.686
YOU KNOW, THE CAMERA IS ON HIM.
GET ALL THE CAMERAS ON HIM.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:11.357 align:start size:94% position:6%
FINISH THAT THOUGHT, DOUG.
IT'S WORSE BECAUSE --

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.027 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, SHE'S A
WOMAN.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.828
SO AT A PARTY, YOU THINK SHE
WOULD WANT TO TALK TO THE OTHER

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:18.865 align:start size:94% position:6%
WIVES.
&gt;&gt; OTHER WIVES?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:25.805 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; SHE'S A GOD DAMN PARTNER AT
THE FIRM, BUDDY.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:32.745 align:start size:94% position:6%
UNREAL.
ROUND TWO.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:39.118 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.487 align:start size:94% position:6%
I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF A JERK.
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU'RE A JERK.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.523 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; NAME YOUR FRIEND'S WIVES.
&gt;&gt; THOSE GUYS?

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:50.396 size:81% position:41%
THEY DON'T HAVE WIVES.
I ROLL WITH A CREW OF

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:55.735 align:start size:94% position:6%
PROBLEMATIC BACHELORS AND WE
CALL OURSELVES THE SQUAD.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:59.138 align:start size:94% position:6%
LET'S LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
OUR CONTESTANTS.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:03.743 align:start size:94% position:6%
SHALL WE?
COURTNEY IT SAYS HERE THAT

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.245 align:start size:94% position:6%
YOU'RE A WOMAN WHO DOESN'T
SUPPORT OTHER WOMAN.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.615 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:15.855 align:start size:94% position:6%
LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE GIRLS
WATCHING AT HOME?

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:16.923 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; NOPE.
&gt;&gt; GOTCHA.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.626
DOUG, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ALL
THE YOUNG GIRLS WATCHING?

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:24.430 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.
YOU ARE AS GOOD AS ANY MAN.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; TERRIBLE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:36.709
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
&gt;&gt; CAMERA THREE, PUSH IT ON ME.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:57.163
I WOULD LISTEN.
TIME FOR THE FINAL CLUE AND THIS

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.933 align:start size:94% position:6%
IS VIEWER'S CHOICE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT SEEING DOUBLE.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:07.307
THERE IS THREE WOMEN THERE.
THERE IS THREE WOMEN THERE.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.976 align:start size:94% position:6%
THESE ARE THREE OF YOUR WIFE'S
BRIDESMAIDS.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.144
AND THEY ARE NOT HER SISTERS OR
YOUR SISTERS.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:16.516
NOW, DOUG, YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF
THESE WOMEN'S NAMES.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.684 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CORRECT.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S THE

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.718 align:start size:94% position:6%
DEAL.
YOU PICK THE ONE YOU THINK YOU

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:23.022 align:start size:94% position:6%
HAVE GOT THE BEST SHOT AT.
&gt;&gt; UM, MIDDLE ONE.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.792 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; AWE, THANKS.
&gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:36.169
DUMB DONKEY, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE
YOU ALMOST ALL THE LETTERS.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.871
&gt;&gt; CAN I HAVE THE FIRST LETTER?
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.208
THAT WOULD BE ALL OF THEM.
&gt;&gt; DO I HAVE TO LOOK AT HER

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:47.947 align:start size:94% position:6%
WHILE I GUESS?
&gt;&gt; RIGHT IN THE EYE.

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:54.887 align:start size:94% position:6%
FOR $10 MILLION.
WHAT'S THAT NAME?

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:56.989 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; I'M SO SORRY.
LARA.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:01.260 align:start size:94% position:6%
DARA.
JARA.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.930 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK HER NAME IS JARA?
&gt;&gt; TARA.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.234 align:start size:94% position:6%
MARA.
DARA.

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:12.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE?
&gt;&gt; MARA.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:18.378
&gt;&gt; I SAID MARA.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.047
&gt;&gt; HEY, VINCE BLAKE, WHY DO YOU
DO THIS GAME?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:30.123 align:start size:94% position:6%
WHAT'S IT ALL FOR?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:34.861 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; IN A WORD, CHAOS.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:39.866 size:75% position:38%
AND THAT'S THE GAME.
NO WINNER, I GUESS.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.535
BUT STICK AROUND BECAUSE DOUG'S
OUR GUEST ON ANOTHER GAME SHOW,

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.137 align:start size:94% position:6%
"DOES THE HOUSEKEEPER HAVE A
SON?"

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; NO, SHE DOESN'T.
&gt;&gt; HE'S 16 YEARS OLD.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.876 size:81% position:41%
ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT.
