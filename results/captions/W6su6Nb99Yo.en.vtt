00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.880
The US Navy accepted delivery of the USS Gerald
R. Ford on May 31st.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.410
Ford class super-carriers are being built
to replace some of the United States Navy's

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.359
existing Nimitz-class carriers from 2017.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.009
Nimitz class carriers have been one of the
most important assets of the US armed forces,

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.230
and have enabled power projection far off
from the US homeland.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.260
The Nimitz design has accommodated many new
technologies over the decades, but its ability

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.970
to accept the most recent technical advances
is limited.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.260
Major limitations include limited electrical
power generation.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.579
The ships of Ford class are expected to be
in service with the US Navy till 2065.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.399
The first ship of this class is USS Gerald
R. Ford.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.100
Like all the Nimitz class carriers, the USS
Gerald R. Ford is also build in Newport News Shipbuilding.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.420
It costs around $12.8 billion.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.000
In this video we will look into the 5 definitive
reasons, why Russia and China should fear it ?

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.440
Nimitz-class carriers got planes moving for
takeoff using steam-actuated catapults.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.360
The system required a lot of steam piping,
a large condensate return, and tons of fresh water.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.500
They tend to have a lot of maintenance issues.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.120
Plus, with steam-actuation, the majority of
the force is being transferred to the airplane

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.950
at the beginning of the stroke—in a jolt.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.360
This puts stress on an airframe, and thus
reduces lifespan of the multi-million dollar plans.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.360
Ford class uses Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch
System (EMALS).

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.140
The system uses linear induction motor with
an electric current to generate a magnetic feild.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.240
That field then propels a carriage down a
track.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.060
Since the power delivery is linear, it negates
the deficiencies of steam catapult.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.750
The hydraulic arresting system is installed
in Nimitz class.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
Hydraulic arresting system is designed for
traditional carrier based aircrafts.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.220
Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) is capable of
working with all current and projected future

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.780
carrier-based aircraft, from the lightest
unmanned aerial vehicles to the heaviest manned

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.620
fighters and are more efficient.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.940
It is to be noted here that Russia and China,
are still using using ski jump, which are

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.560
generation behind steam-actuated catapults
of Nimitz class, and two generation behind

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.980
EMALS of Ford class.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.090
Also no Russian or Chinese carrier is expected
to field AAG in near future, limiting their

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.440
ability to field futuristic Unmanned Combat
Air Vehicle (UCAV).

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.880
Ford class has newly designed reactors.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.069
2 Bechtel A1B nuclear reactors are installed
on USS Gerald R. Ford.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.160
Each one these are capable of producing 300
MW of electricity, triple the 100 MW of each Nimitz-class.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.500
The huge power supply provides for the legroom,
required for future expansions like inducting

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.610
Lasers and Rail Guns.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.840
Also, compared to the Nimitz-class reactor,
the Ford reactor have about half as many valves,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.430
piping, major pumps, condensers, and generators
which reduced maintenance cost and lower space requirements.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.640
Being nuclear powered, they practically have
unlimited range and need refueling once in

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.510
about 20 years.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.520
It must be noted that, neither Russia nor
China currently has any nuclear powered carrier,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.640
and may require at least a decade before they
will have one.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.100
The technological gap in this regard is huge.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.400
USS Gerald R. Ford has an integrated Active
Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) search

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.120
and tracking radar system.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.650
The dual-band radar (DBR) utilizes a multi
tier, dual-band tracker, which consists of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.790
a local X band tracker, a local S band tracker,
and a central tracker.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.470
The central tracker merges the two signals
to provide a comprehensive situational awareness.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.160
The X band tracker is optimized for low latency
to support its mission of providing defense

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.620
against fast, low-flying missiles, while the
S band tracker is optimized for

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.680
large area coverage.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.590
This new system has no moving parts, therefore
minimizes maintenance &amp; manning requirements.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.100
Also, replacing 6 to10 radar antennas with
a single 6-faced radar increases the deck spaced.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.880
Russia or China doesn’t have anything close
to being as sophisticated as this radar.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.960
USS Gerald R. Ford implements high levels
of automation, which gives it, increased capability

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.580
with reduced crew.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.680
Automation has been implemented wherever possible.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.580
Ford-class carrier has 25% less crew compared
to Nimitz class.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.729
This will result in the vessel being much
more efficient, and also reduce faults due

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.180
to human error.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.430
The Ford class also has a newly designed deck,
which provides more space for flight operations.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.560
It has 3 aircraft elevators instead of 4 in
Nimitz.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.900
These 3 are much more advanced than the 4
in Nimitz.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.199
The result of Automation &amp; superior elevators
is impressive.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.729
Ford class is capable of generating 30 % more
sorties (flight missions) per day than Nimitz‐class.

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:38.419
The carrier carries 75+ aircrafts, a 30% increase
results in massive gains, since the offensive

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.479
as well as defensive capabilities of the carrier
gets a major lift.

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.029
Also, eliminating 1 of the elevators further
increased the ship's capabilities by leaving

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.760
room for other things like having dedicated
helicopter-landing pad.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.779
Initially the Ford class will have 2 squadrons
of 10 to 12 F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, 2

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:12.869
squadrons of 10 to 12 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets,
5 EA-18G Growler electronic attack jets, 4

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:18.870
E-2D Hawkeye airborne early-warning and control
aircraft, and 2 C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.150
delivery (COD) planes.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.509
It will carry 8 MH-60S Seahawk helicopters
as well.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.349
But the Ford class carriers have also been
envisaged to be future proof.

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.749
Keeping this in view, special attention has
been given to increase deck space and power.

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:37.689
These two factors come together to enable
Ford class to accommodate two game changing

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.240
technologies in coming days:

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.199
1. Lasers: Recently the US Navy has tested a
$40 million, 30-kilowatt laser mounted on

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.610
the deck of the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.740
Unlike missiles, lasers travel at the speed
of light, so they hit their target almost

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.199
instantaneously.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.340
Not only can they take out a swarm of deadly
drones, they can act as a missile defense system.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.960
2. Rail Gun: The US Navy recently test fired
a railgun.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:09.069
Railguns use electromagnetic energy to fire
projectiles at 7 to 9 times the speed of sound.

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.180
There is no way to defend against these shots.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.100
Russia &amp; China are far off from incorporating
this technology in their vessels.
