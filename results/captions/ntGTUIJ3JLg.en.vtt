SIX MONTHS AGO.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.775 line:92%

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:57.891
HE IS FASCINATING-- WELL, HE'S
GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH DAVID

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.859 line:92%
BRENT THAN SOMEONE LIKE J.F.K.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.762
DAVID BRENT WANTS TO BE FAMOUS
AND LOVED AND HE'D DO ANYTHING--

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.697 line:92%
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE SEEMS VERY
FRAGILE.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.370
&gt;&gt; BUT DAVID BRENT IS SORT OF
LIKE AN OLD-- THE DIFFERENCE

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.405
BETWEEN "THE OFFICE" AND THIS
MOVIE, IS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.773 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
IN 15 YEARS.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:18.011
IT'S MUCH HARSHER, AND SO BACK
THEN, DAVID BRENT SEEMED LEAK A

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.580
BIT OF AN IDEA AND HE WAS LIKE A
NARCISSIST.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.148 line:92%
IT WAS ON A REALITY SHOW.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:28.021
BUT BY TODAY'S STANDARDS, HE'S
NOT THAT BAD BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.622 line:92%
NEW-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.427
THERE'S A NEW FAME, THERE'S A
NEW-- PEOPLE DO ANYTHING TO BE

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:34.928 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
FAMOUS.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.729 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING TO BE
FAMOUS.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.400
AND WE'VE HAD THINGS LIKE "THE
APPRENTICE" WHERE PEOPLE GET ON

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.903
IT BY SAYING, "I WOULD DESTROY
ANYONE WHO STANDS IN MY WAY."

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.538
THERE IS A NEW SORT OF ALPHA MAN
OUT THERE.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.473 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
IT'S QUITE SAD.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.308

ALPHA MALE?

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.342 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; NO, HE'S NOT.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:52.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE WANTS TO SEEM
LIKE AN ALPHA MALE.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:59.452
&gt;&gt; HE SEEMS A BIT HELPLESS
BECAUSE HE'S 55 DISPP NOW HE'S A

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:03.089
TAMPON REP, AND HE WANTS TO BE A
ROCK STAR LIKE EVERYONE DOES,

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:06.259
AND HE'S HEMORRHAGING CASH AND
HE PUTS A BAND TOGETHER AND HE

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:06.759 size:78% position:39% line:92%
GOES ON THE ROAD.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.728 line:92%
AND IT'S REALLY TRAGIC.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:12.031
BUT HE JUST WANTS TO BE LOVED,
DEEP DOWN, JUST LIKE DONALD

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:12.232 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%

&gt;&gt; Stephen:, YOU KNOW, I THINK
SO, TOO.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:19.239
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S YANKING
MERRICK GARLAND INTO THE PHOTO,

STAND NEXT TO ME.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:24.077
&gt;&gt; HE GOES ON TWITTER AND SAYS
THINGS LIKE, "EVERYONE LOVES ME.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.178 size:75% position:38% line:92%
I WAS THE BEST."

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.112 line:92%
HE'S LIKE A 10-YEAR-OLD.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.947 line:92%
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.184 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:31.851 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
&gt;&gt; IT'S CRAZY.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.353 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE 10-YEAR-OLD
WITH THE LAUNCH CODES.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.955
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORRYING THING,
ISN'T IT?

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.224 size:88% position:56% line:92%
HE HAS GOT THOSE, HASN'T HE?

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
MAYBE THEY'VE GIVEN HIM FAKE
ONES.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.671 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.172 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S TWO.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:56.209
THERE'S A SHINY RED BUTTON AND
THERE'S A BLUE BOTON, AND ONE'S

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.345
FOR PIZZA LIKE THAT AND THE
OTHER ONE DOESN'T REALLY WORK.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:03.149
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SPEAK OF PEOPLE--
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST BLEW UP CHINA,

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.550 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
MR. TRUMP.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.150 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
"GOOD, GOOD."

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.320 align:end position:100%

THIS STUFF BUT HE ISN'T REALLY.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.021 size:84% position:42% line:92%
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.389 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT WOULD BE
NICE.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.056 size:84% position:42% line:92%

IT'S NOT TRUE, BUT IT WOULD BE
NICE.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.861
NOW, SPEAKING OF PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO BE ROCK STARS, SOME PEOPLE

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.897 align:start size:88% position:13%
OUT THERE MAY ALREADY KNOW

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.214 align:start size:88% position:13%

HIT?

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.081 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
&gt;&gt; NO, NEARLY.

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:39.018
IT WAS NOON 83-- I'M A FINE OLD

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.486 line:92%
THANKS FOR BRINGING IT UP.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.854 line:92%
BUT IT'S 30 YEARS AGO.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:46.292
THIS THING ONLY COMES OUT NOW
BECAUSE I'M FAMOUS FOR SOMETHING

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:46.492 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
ELSE.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.729
AND THEY BRING IT OUT AND GO,
"LOOK AT YOU."

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE THINK I'M EMBARRASSED
ABOUT HOW I LOOKED THEN.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.801 line:92%
I AM EXWARLSED HOW I LOOK NOW.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:58.104 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.206
THIS STH WHO DAVID BRENT THINKS
HE IS?

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:04.377
&gt;&gt; DAVID BRENT-- NO, WE DIDN'T
MAKE IT.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:09.349
WE RELEASE AID FEW SINGERS AND
THEN A GOT AN A NORMAL JOB IN AN

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.352
OFFICE FOR 10 YEARS WHICH IS
WHAT "THE OFFICE" IS BASED ON.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.455
YOU USE ALL EXPERIENCES, GOOD
AND BAD PICHES AID FAIL

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.423 line:92%
MUSICIAN, SO I FUSED THE TWO.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.760
THERE WERE THINGS THAT HAPPENED
IN THE FILM THAT HAPPENED TO ME.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.165 align:end position:100%
I REMEMBER IN 1985, WE DID A
GIG, AND WE DID THE SOUND CHECK,

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:31.771
AND THE GUY SAID, "YOU MIGHT AS
WELL STAY UP THERE, BECAUSE

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.472 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
YOU'RE ON NOW."

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.174
AND I SAID, "WHEN ARE THEY
OPENING THE DOORS TO LET PEOPLE

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.276 align:start size:88% position:13%
IN?"
THEY SAID, "THEY'RE OPEN.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.945 align:start size:88% position:13%
NO ONE'S COME THROUGH TO SEE
YOU."

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.081
I SAID, "OH, LET'S TREAT IT LIKE
A FREE REHEARSAL."

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.584
AND WE JUST PLAYED 10 SONGS TO
NO ONE.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:45.685 size:81% position:41% line:92%
IT WAS ANSWER ZEN.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.553 size:88% position:56% line:92%
BUT YOU TAKE THOSE WITH YOU.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:51.357
AND IN THE FILM, OBVIOUSLY,
DAVID BRENT, HE'S HIRED THESE

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:54.560
VENUES AND HE'S TRYING TO GET
PEOPLE TO COME BUT IT'S QUITE

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.361 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
SAD THIS FILM.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.396 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
BUT IT'S FUNNY.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.033 line:92%
IT'S REALLY FUN NEA TRAGIC WAY.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.367 align:start size:88% position:13%

FUNNY.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.971 align:end position:100%

MIDDLE-AGED MEN TRYING TO BE

COOL.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.507 align:start size:88% position:13%

WAS-- HONESTLY.

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.676 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.912 align:start size:88% position:13%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: A LITTLE BIT.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:17.750 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE
MUPPETS HAVING A GO.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.187
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF ONLY, IF ONLY I
COULD HAVE SOMEONE'S HAND UP MY

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.922 line:92%
ASS MAKING ME DO THAT.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.342 size:88% position:56% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: 6,000 YEARS OLD.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:19.445 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SORRY, SORRY, MY BAD.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:19.645 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%

( LAUGHTER )
I LIKE TO SAY THINGS LIKE,

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.718
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY EARTH, 4.6
BILLION YEARS OLD TODAY."

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.054
SO THIS GUY CAME OUT-- IT'S A
GENTLEMAN-- I LOOKED AT HIS

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:28.955 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
OTHER TWEETS.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:29.822 size:88% position:56% line:92%
HE'S A GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.224 line:92%
I WON'T SAY HIS NAME.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE'S BEEN EMBARRASSED ENOUGH
I JUST RETWEETED IT.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.129 size:88% position:56% line:92%
AND HE GOT VERY, VERY ANGRY.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.998
YOU COULD SEE HE WAS MAD BECAUSE
IT'S ALL IN CAPITALS.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.067
EVERYONE-- MAD PEOPLE --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S WRITTEN ON

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.535 line:92%
THE BACK SO PEOPLE CAN SEE.

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.269 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%

&gt;&gt; SURE SO-- LET ME READ IT.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.944 line:92%

OKAY, OKAY.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:07:03.756
"YOUR SCIENCE" MY SCIENCE AND
SCIENCE IS SPELL SCIENTS,

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:09.562
SCIENCE, LIKE IT'S THE PLURAL OF
SCIENT.

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:13.399
YOUR SCIENCE WOWNT HELP YOU,
HE'S TEXTING UP TO A SATELLITE

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.402
DID&amp;DOWN TO ME SO IT'S SORT OF
HELPING HIM.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:20.473 size:88% position:56%
"YOUR SCIENCE WON'T HELP YOU
WHEN SATAN--," OF COURSE, HE

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.741 size:81% position:41% line:92%
BELIEVES IN SATAN.

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:22.608 size:75% position:38% line:92%

IN SIX DAYS.

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:27.814 line:92%
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SATAN?

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.650
NO, THAT'S A BIG IRRATIONAL, YOU
KNOW.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.985 line:92%
SO HE BELIEVES IN SATAN, RIGHT.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:37.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
"YOUR SCIENCE WON'T HELP YOU

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
BRITISH ASS."

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.328 size:78% position:39% line:92%
HE'S GOT A POINT.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:45.531
BECAUSE IF I-- NO, HE HAS-- HE
HAS GOT A POINT.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.635 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:54.707
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF I DIE AND I FIND
MYSELF IN HELL BEING RAPED BY

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:57.677
SATAN, SCIENCE IS PRETTY MUCH
LET ME DOWN.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:00.213 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:00.780 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S TRUE.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.682 line:92%
THAT'S VERY OPEN MINDED OF YOU.

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:03.449 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:08.788
BUT THIS IS-- SO, SO THIS IS MY
FAVORITE BIT.

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.624 align:start size:88% position:13%
"YOUR SCIENCE WON'T HELP YOU

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:12.291 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
BRITISH ASS.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.894 size:81% position:41% line:92%

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:18.297

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.299 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

HE'S THERE!

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:26.973
SO HE'S-- HE'S-- HE'S A
FUNDAMENTALIST CREATIONIST WHO

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.809
HAS LIVED HIS LIFE BY THE OLD
TESTAMENT.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:30.042 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
HEIDIZE.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.945
HE GOES-- HE FINDS HIMSELF IN
HELL.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:37.016
HE SEES ME BEING RAPED AND HE
GOES HA!

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.417 line:92%
AND IT CHEERS HIM UP.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.719 line:92%
LIKE, HE'S OVER IT ALREADY.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.355 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S A
COMPLIMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE A

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:42.622 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
COMEDIAN.

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.223
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAKING SOMEONE
LAUGH IN HELL.

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:47.126 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'M AN ABILITYIST COMEDIAN.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:51.831 align:end position:100%
LIKE SATAN WOULDN'T THROW ME
ASIDE AND BE WITH THE CHRISTIAN

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.566 line:92%
IF HE FOUND HIM IN HELL.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.434
THAT WOULD BE SATAN'S BEST DAY
EVER.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:59.272 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH ME
ANYMORE.

00:08:59.272 --> 00:08:59.605 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.507 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S WHY IT'S MY FAVORITE
TWEET.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:03.709 line:92%
AND ALL IT WAS RETWEETING IT.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.913
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU SAID-- WHEN
YOU RETWEETED YOU SAID, "I

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:10.850
BELIEVE THIS TWEET SHOULD GET A
KNIGHTHOOD."

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.084 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I DID, YES, I DID.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.353 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WANT TO TALK
MORE ABOUT THAT WHEN WE COME

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:14.554 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
BACK.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.721
WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK
RIGHT HERE.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:16.389 align:start size:88% position:13% line:92%
STICK AROUND.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.390
