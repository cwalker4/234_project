00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.402
Ms. Sanders:  Good afternoon.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.573
Earlier today, the President
signed a bipartisan,

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.541
anti-sex trafficking bill

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.443
that provides law
enforcement officials,

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.980
including state attorneys
general and local prosecutors,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.615
invaluable tools.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:16.983
The new law makes it clearer

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:19.119
to take legal action
against websites

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.888
promoting advertisements
for this modern-day slavery.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.923
Human trafficking 
is one of the most

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.859
barbaric types of exploitation,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.360
and President Trump
has been clear

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.062
that it has no place
in our world.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.931
Advocates have long pointed
to these websites

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.400
as profiting
from trafficking,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.101
including of children.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.937
It also provides new legal
recourses for victims

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.507
and law enforcement
by enhancing penalties

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:43.276
for people who promote
or facilitate prostitution.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.946
Yesterday, the President
signed an Executive Order

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.848
on Reducing Poverty in America

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.518
by Promoting Opportunity
and Economic Mobility.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.155
The order provides nine
principles of economic mobility

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.489
that will guide agencies

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.058
that administer public
assistance programs

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.895
to review all regulations
relating to work

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.530
and send a report
to the President

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.632
on what they can do
to get Americans back to work.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.602
The Trump administration
recognizes that many states

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:13.072
have been successful enacting
commonsense work requirements

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.641
and are seeing
positive results,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.911
improving the lives of thousands
of individuals and families.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.780
Many others have noticed
and are leading the charge

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.883
to provide greater opportunities
to their citizens.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.586
President Trump believes
we can lift our citizens

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.121
from welfare to work,

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.856
from dependence to independence,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.624
and from poverty to prosperity.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:36.529
We are also glad to see
California Governor Jerry Brown

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.264
work with the administration

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.866
and send members
of the National Guard

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.734
to help secure
the southern border.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.937
And with that,
I'll take your questions.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.104
John.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.140
The Press: Sarah, the Russian
military has come out

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.210
and said that there was
no poison gas attack.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.212
That was Sergey Lavrov
the other day

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.613
who said they got
no evidence of it.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.216
Today, a Russian
military official says,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.684
oh, there was an attack,

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.352
but it was staged
by the White Helmets

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:03.790
brigade component
of the rebels in Syria.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.025
What do you say to
the Russian statement

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.928
that this thing was staged
by the White Helmets?

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.898
Ms. Sanders:  The
intelligence provided

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.133
certainly paints
a different picture,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.604
and the President
holds Syria and Russia

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.874
responsible for this
chemical weapons attack.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.208
The Press: I have
an unrelated question

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.678
on the Cohen raids
the other day.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.347
It now looks
as though prosecutors

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.849
were looking for some
sort of documentation

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.951
that might have been connected
with the Access Hollywood tape,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.419
as you know came out
during the campaign,

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.687
which you were a part of.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.957
And that is an effort
to connect the dots

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:42.295
between subsequent payments that
were made to keep people quiet,

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.031
which may constitute
some sort of FEC violation

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.633
for an illegal
campaign contribution.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.436
If the Mueller investigation
has now morphed

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.605
from looking at
Russian collusion

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.174
to an illegal
campaign contribution

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.743
by the President's
personal attorney,

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.112
would the President 
consider that to be

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.313
the Mueller investigation

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.448
has strayed outside
of its initial mandate?

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.083
Ms. Sanders:  The President
certainly has been clear

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.652
that he has a very deep concern

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.954
about the direction
that the Special Counsel

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.556
and other investigations
have taken.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.459
This investigation started off
as Russia collusion,

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.661
of which there was none.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.030
It has been very clear

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.132
that nothing has come up
over the last year,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.734
and the President has spoken
at length on this topic.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.736
While the media continues
to focus on this,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.606
despite the fact that there's
been no evidence after a year,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.108
we're going to continue
to stay focused on the issues.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.209
Yamiche.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.078
The Press: A source, today,

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.213
told me that
President Trump is concerned

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:38.217
that Paul Ryan's retiring
and not seeking reelection

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:41.020
might encourage
other Republicans

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.122
to also not seek reelection.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.191
What do you say about that?

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.394
Ms. Sanders:  We certainly hope
that Republicans will continue

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.330
to remain in the House,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.566
especially those that support
the President's agenda.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.369
And those that are campaigning,

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.972
we look forward to a number
of them coming out

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.740
and also supporting
the President's agenda.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.442
I can't get into
a lot of details

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.111
about specifics of individuals
running for office.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.813
But the President
has been very clear

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.616
about how he feels
about Speaker Ryan.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.085
He knows that he's
a truly good man

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.886
and will leave a legacy
of achievement

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:15.021
that nobody can question.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:17.123
And he wishes him well as he
moves forward in his future.

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.925
The Press: And Representative
Scalise told me today --

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.827
he said that there's
a tough political climate

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.796
in that Republicans were already
facing a lot of challenges

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.798
and a lot of problems
going forward.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.501
There are some people, though,
that think that President Trump

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.303
is part of the problem
that Republicans have --

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.270
that his rhetoric,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.673
his actions have made it
harder for Republicans

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.375
to win midterm elections.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.442
What does the President
think about that?

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.845
And does he actually plan
to campaign with people?

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.414
And does he think at all that
he could hurt the chances

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.316
of some Republicans
if he goes out in the field?

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.651
Ms. Sanders:  We think
that Republicans,

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.618
particularly the President,

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.388
have a great story to tell
moving into the midterms.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.456
We've had an incredibly
successful first year

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:55.128
and a half, focused on tax cuts,
deregulation,

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.497
working towards
the defeat of ISIS,

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.232
remaking of the judiciary,

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.000
and a number of other things
that we consider

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.736
to be great successes
and great things for Republicans

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.439
to talk about as they look
forward to the future.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.674
Michelle.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:08.908
The Press: Thanks, Sarah.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:11.811
With Syria set to chair the U.N.
Conference on Disarmament

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.680
next month,
will the President consider,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.648
or does he have any plans
to pull the U.S.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:19.485
out for the duration of Syria
presiding over that group?

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.787
Ms. Sanders: I don't have any
specific announcements

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:21.754
on that front right now.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.089
The Press: And is
the White House concerned

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.258
with Facebook's efforts
to silence conservatives?

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.794
It's been a topic on the Hill
today and yesterday.

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.896
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly,
the White House would always

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.964
support not just conservatives

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:35.835
but everyone having
the ability to speak freely

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.671
on a number of platforms
across this country,

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:41.374
and we certainly support
the Constitution

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.842
that provides that right.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.444
Steven.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.545
The Press: Two questions about
the President's statement

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.779
this morning.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.582
What does "Get ready
Russia," mean?

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:52.251
Is the United States planning
to target Russian assets,

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:54.487
personnel in Syria
as part of the attack

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.623
that the President himself
said is coming --

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.158
the missiles are coming?
What does it mean?

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:00.526
Ms. Sanders: We're maintaining

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:01.994
that we have
a number of options,

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:04.163
and all of those options
are still on the table.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.599
Final decisions haven't been
made yet on that front.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.067
The Press: So does it mean
anything at all?

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.268
What does it mean?

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.503
Ms. Sanders:  It
certainly means --

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.438
I think there's a lot there
that you can read from.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:14.307
But at the same time,
the President has a number

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.642
of options at his disposal,

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.644
and all of those options
remain on the table,

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:21.013
and we're continuing to look
at each one of them.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.615
The Press: If I might follow up
with a separate question

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.417
about another one of the
President's tweets this morning:

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.819
Can you explain how the
Special Counsel investigation

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.621
has made for "bad blood"
with Russia?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.525
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly, I think
that the President

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.494
has been extremely clear

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.663
that the constant
focus of the fact

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.832
that the President
and his campaign

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:43.636
had any collusion with Russia
has hurt those relationships.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.873
The President has maintained,
for a very long time,

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.474
that the United States
and Russia

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.244
having a good relationship
is good for the world.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.712
He certainly
still believes that.

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.816
But at the same time, that's
hampered the ability to do so,

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.585
as well as the actions --

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.921
particularly the bad actions --
that Russia has taken,

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.690
including meddling in our
election among other things.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.193
But tying the President
to that has created

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.228
a lot of unnecessary problems.

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.163
Mike.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.230
The Press: Two quick questions.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.865
You said that the final decision
on Syria hasn't been made yet.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.301
Does the President's
emoting on Twitter

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.303
complicate the planning on this

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.238
or present
a national security risk?

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.773
Ms. Sanders:  Not at all.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:26.312
The Press: And on Michael Cohen,
the Wall Street Journal

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.614
and others have reported
that Rosenstein signed off

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:30.783
on the search warrant here.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:31.918
Does the White House believe

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.086
this was a wrong decision
from Mr. Rosenstein?

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.922
And do they think
he should step down?

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.290
Ms. Sanders: Once again,
I'm not going to get into

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.291
the process,

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.859
and that was something
that you would have to talk

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.594
to the Department
of Justice about.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.729
In terms of personnel,
I don't have any announcements.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:44.697
Hallie.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:45.832
The Press: Sarah, two on Syria.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.733
Given your comments
given here at the podium,

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.168
given the President's
tweets this morning,

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:51.871
is the White House prepared
for the possibility

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.873
of direct military
engagement with Russia?

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.676
Ms. Sanders:  Once again,
all options are on the table,

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.511
and I don't have any
further announcements about --

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.513
The Press: It sounds like a yes.
Just -- I want to be clear.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.381
Ms. Sanders:  It sounds like
all options are on the table,

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.150
and a final decision
hasn't been made,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.451
but we'll keep you
posted once it is.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:06.452
The Press: And then let me
ask that follow-up, too.

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.855
The President, as you know,
back in 2013,

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.289
talked about why,

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:12.225
when it comes to Syria,
we can't just, in his words,

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:15.795
 be quiet and, if we attack
at all, catch them by surprise. 

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.231
Obviously, the President didn't
talk about a date or a time

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.565
for any kind of attack on Syria,

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:22.235
but he did talk about,
as Steven points out,

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.502
"get ready" for something.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:26.706
Why this time is the President
not taking his own advice

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.541
and being "quiet," as he put it?

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.376
Ms. Sanders:  The President,
like you said --

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.578
and actually answered
my question for me --

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.747
has not laid out a timetable,

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:37.149
and he has a number
of other options as well.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.118
And we're considering
all of those options

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.020
and a number
of different timetables

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.455
of what any action we may

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.756
or may not take would look like.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.658
The Press: So that 48-hour
timetable is out the window

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:48.594
that he talked about Monday?
We should disregard that?

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:50.062
Ms. Sanders:  In a public sense,

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:53.032
certainly the President
has made some decisions.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.869
He made a decision
not to travel to Latin America

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.271
so that we could focus on this.

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.805
That was the first step
in this process,

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.875
but we're continuing to look
at a number of options.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.876
Jon.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.444
The Press: But, Sarah,
the President was direct

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.046
in talking about missiles.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:10.016
He said,  Get ready Russia,
because they will be coming,

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:12.118
nice and new and  smart!' 

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.619
Why is the President

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.088
telegraphing military
intentions on Twitter;

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.357
announcing, effectively,
an attack on Twitter?

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.493
Ms. Sanders:  Again,
the President has not

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:21.894
laid out a timetable

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:25.464
and still leaving a number
of other options on the table.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.767
And we're still considering
a number of those,

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:30.036
and a final decision
on that front hasn't been made.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.005
The Press: And if I could ask --
another one of the tweets,

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:36.242
which Steven asked about,
is also pretty direct here.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.111
He says,  &amp;bad blood with Russia

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:42.348
is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt
Russia Investigation. 

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:45.751
Isn't it Russia's support
for what the President himself

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.753
calls a  Gas Killing Animal, 

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.022
or its meddling
in our elections,

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:53.059
or its military
intervention in Ukraine --

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.227
aren't those the actions
that have cause bad blood?

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.729
(Inaudible)
Robert Mueller?

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:57.897
Ms. Sanders: It's both
of those things.

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:00.066
Neither one of those things
are good for our country.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.334
The President has been clear

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:03.102
that the relationship
with Russia

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:05.638
is at a new low, and that's due
to a number of factors.

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:08.174
Certainly, the things
that you listed off,

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.642
as well as the investigation,

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.544
are all things that have hurt
that relationship.

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.779
The Press: So, Robert Mueller's
actions are similar to --

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.548
I mean, another --
Ms. Sanders: I didn't say that.

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:16.983
You're certainly putting
words into my mouth.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.584
The Press: Well, he's the one
that said "is."

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:19.652
He's the one that --

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:20.820
Ms. Sanders:  I said that both
of those things are bad

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.721
for America,
that's all I said.

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.722
Jeff, go ahead.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:23.923
The Press: Sarah,
Russia responded

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:24.924
to the President's tweet
by saying,

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.993
"Smart missiles should
fly towards terrorists,

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.394
and not towards
the lawful government." 

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.596
What's the White House's
reaction to that?

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:33.199
Ms. Sanders:  I think that the
President has been pretty clear

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:35.001
what his position
is on this front.

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:39.071
Russia has proven themselves to
be responsible in part for this.

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:43.142
They guaranteed that the use
of chemical weapons by Syria

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.878
would not happen again.
They failed at that.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:50.316
They've also helped enable Syria
by vetoing six different

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.953
U.N. resolutions that
have helped protect Assad.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:56.689
So they certainly hold
some responsibility in this,

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.958
and certainly have
proven themselves to be

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.659
bad actors in this process.

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:02.995
The Press: Is the White House
or the State Department

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:05.464
in any kind of backchannel
discussions with Russia

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:07.166
to defuse the tension?

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.135
And does the President
still hope to meet

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.303
with President Putin
sometime soon?

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:13.139
Ms. Sanders: I don't have any
announcements on either front.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.508
I can't get into the specifics
on any conversations.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.542
David.

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.877
The Press: Jim Mattis and Mike
Pompeo were spotted today.

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:20.379
Did the President meet with them
to talk about Syria?

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.448
And if so, what came out
of that meeting?

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.150
Ms. Sanders: The President's
national security team

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.418
met today.

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.887
That meeting was chaired
by the Vice President

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.455
to discuss a number of options.

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.323
Blake.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:33.659
The Press: Sarah, you just said
that the intelligence provided

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:35.928
certainly paints
a different picture,

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:37.963
and that the President
holds Syria and Russia

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:39.331
responsible for the attack.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:44.236
However, earlier this morning,
the Defense Secretary said,

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.172
"We're still assessing
the intelligence --

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.607
ourselves, we're still
working on this."

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:51.944
So what has changed over
the last handful of hours

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.646
from when the Defense
Secretary said,

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.581
 We're still assessing
the intelligence, 

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.116
and now, to where
you clearly point

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.351
the finger at Russia and Syria?

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.489
Ms. Sanders:  As I just stated
to both Jeff and Jonathan,

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:06.158
Russia holds some responsibility
in the fact that they guaranteed

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:09.128
that Syria wouldn't use chemical
weapons again, and they did.

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.697
They also hold some
responsibility in the fact

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:15.134
that they have the six
U.N. resolutions

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:17.069
that they vetoed
to help protect Assad.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:20.773
Both of those things
lie at Russia's feet

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:23.008
in terms of responsibility
in this process.

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.678
The Press: So then you still are
assessing the intelligence

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:27.680
then as the Defense Secretary
stated before?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.814
Ms. Sanders: Certainly, 
there are things that are

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:29.782
being assessed.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:30.983
I can't get into the details.

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:35.387
But we're confident
in the part of this process

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:36.722
that we're in
to feel comfortable

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:40.326
making the assertions
that we have earlier today.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.393
Francesca.

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:42.094
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:44.130
You said all these things
about Russia

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.564
and that
they've been bad actors,

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:49.401
they voted against the United
Nations Security Council

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:51.270
resolutions, as well.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.771
And this morning,
the President, on Twitter,

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.175
said that Russia is supported
a  Gas Killing Animal. 

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:58.711
So does the President
now believe

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:01.313
that Russia has firmly
established itself

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.781
as an enemy of America,

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:04.350
especially since Russia has said

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.018
that it will shoot down
U.S. missiles

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.753
if the President
fires upon Syria?

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:08.954
Ms. Sanders: We certainly think
they've proven

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:09.855
to be a bad actor,

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:12.258
and we hope that
that will change.

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:13.192
April.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.527
The Press: What about
an enemy, though?

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:16.462
Are they an enemy, though,
of America at this point?

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:19.231
Ms. Sanders: That's something
that Russia needs to play

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.332
a role in determining.

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:22.835
We hope that
they will continue --

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:26.138
or not continue, I'm sorry,
to be a bad actor,

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.706
and make some changes
in their behavior.

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.808
But that's something that Russia
will have to play a role

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:30.976
in determining.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.077
The Press: And one separate --
just really quick.

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:32.978
Ms. Sanders: Sorry, Francesca,
I'm going to keep going.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.213
April.

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:35.347
The Press: Sarah, as you say,
"All options are on the table"

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:36.649
when it comes to Syria
and Russia.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.685
Has diplomacy been exhausted?
That's an option, as well.

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:42.354
Ms. Sanders:  As I said,
all options are on the table.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.790
The Press: So, it has not --
is there -- are you saying --

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.592
Ms. Sanders:  Again, all options
are on the table.

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:50.095
That contains a number
of different things.

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.830
The Press: So, diplomacy
could still be in play?

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.299
Ms. Sanders:  It could be.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:55.234
But there are a lot
of other options

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.635
that are also on the table.

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:58.871
The Press: Sarah,
four senators -- two Dems,

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:02.341
two Republicans -- have a bill
to ensure that a Special Counsel

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.476
isn't fired
for political reasons.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.345
Does the White House
support that bill?

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.914
Does the White House think
a bill like that is necessary?

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.316
Ms. Sanders: We don't have
an administrative policy

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.217
on that right now.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:12.318
John.

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.552
The Press: Yeah, thank you,
Sarah, two questions.

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:17.790
On Monday I asked you
if the President had contacted

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.227
President Macron
and Prime Minister May

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:25.130
about an alliance
with France and England,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:31.637
not unlike that that President
Obama tried to forge in 2013.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:35.107
He has had two conversations
with both of them.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.209
Have there been
any new developments?

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:41.213
I mean, has he spoken with
any other world leaders,

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.916
especially those
in Central Europe,

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:47.319
about a larger coalition
instead of the U.S.

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:48.754
going it alone in Syria?

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.356
Ms. Sanders: Yeah, we've had
regular contact

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.224
with regional allies
and partners,

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:55.594
including Israel, Saudi Arabia,
France, and the UK,

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:58.964
as well as a number of other
countries at various levels.

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:00.966
The Press: What about
Central Europe?

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:01.934
Ms. Sanders:  We provided
readouts of the conversations

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.636
the President has directly had,

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:07.172
but both the National
Security Advisor

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:10.409
as well as the
Secretary of Defense,

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:12.111
the Acting Secretary of State,

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:13.946
and a number of others
within the administration

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:17.049
have had regular contact
with their counterparts

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.517
from a number
of other countries.

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.352
The Press: And the other thing
I wanted to ask:

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:23.989
The President has
a good relationship

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:25.324
with Congressman Scalise,

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:28.827
a good, personal relationship
with his family.

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.163
What does he think
about the reports

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:35.334
that Congressman Scalise
will run for Speaker soon?

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.603
Ms. Sanders:  The President has
a great relationship

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.873
with a number of members
in the House of Representatives

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:42.775
who support his agenda,

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.743
and he looks forward
to working with all of them

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:47.579
over the course
of the next six and a half --

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.948
seven years, I guess,
my math is not great.

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:50.916
Tamara.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.651
The Press: Yeah,
is the President considering

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.353
firing or in other ways

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:55.754
pushing out Rosenstein?

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:57.723
Ms. Sanders: I don't have
any personnel announcements

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.258
on this front.

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.993
The Press: Just one other thing.
Paul Ryan today

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.362
said that he's been given
assurances by the White House

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.397
that the President
isn't planning to fire

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.266
Rosenstein or Mueller.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.001
Do you know where he's
getting those assurances?

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.402
Is it coming from the President?

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:12.905
Is it coming from others?
Where is it coming from?

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.139
Ms. Sanders: Again, I don't
have any announcements

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:14.606
on that front.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.008
Steve.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.343
The Press: Sarah,
Senator Markey,

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:18.711
a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee,

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:22.881
said today that the President
must come to Congress

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.483
for authorization

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.052
prior to another
military strike on Syria.

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.121
And there are others
who are also saying that.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.989
Does the administration
intend to do that?

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:32.624
And if not, why not?

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.960
Ms. Sanders:  Obviously,
the administration will follow

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.196
whatever laws and regulations

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.398
are necessary
for any actions that we take.

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:41.834
Because we haven't laid out

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.669
any specific actions
that we plan to take,

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.572
I can't tell you
exactly what needs

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.040
we would have to
go to Congress with.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.575
Jim.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.709
The Press: It sounds
like the President

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.211
hasn't really left
a lot of wiggle room.

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.279
You said that all options
are on the table,

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.981
but when the President says,

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.983
 Get ready Russia&amp;they
will be coming, 

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:00.719
the missiles are coming,
how is that anything

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:03.655
but an announcement
of a pending airstrike?

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:05.324
Ms. Sanders: That's
certainly one option,

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:06.892
but that doesn't mean
it's the only option

00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:09.561
or the only thing that
the President may or may not do.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.864
Just because he does one thing
doesn't mean

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.966
he can't do a number
of other actions as well.

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.334
The Press: Isn't
that telegraphing?

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.269
Ms. Sanders: And he certainly
hasn't laid out the timetable

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:22.207
which would be broadcasting
his intentions.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.543
The Press: One other quick thing
on Speaker Ryan's announcement.

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.845
There are some fears up
on Capitol Hill,

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:28.514
and we understand some
in the White House,

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:30.783
that a Democratic wave
is coming;

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.719
it could sweep the Republicans
out of power in the House

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.955
and that could potentially lead
to impeachment proceedings

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.491
that the Democrats
could bring forward.

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.527
What is the President's
thinking on that?

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:42.795
What is your thinking on that?

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:43.962
Ms. Sanders:  Like I said
earlier,

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:46.665
we are very confident
in the record

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.700
that we have and the very
successful first year

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.669
and a half that the President
has had in office,

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:52.704
and we expect to talk
about that a lot.

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.307
We'd love for you guys to talk
about that a lot more, too.

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:57.276
And we'd be happy to send you
some talking points

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.444
if you need
some guidance on that.

00:17:58.444 --> 00:17:59.411
The Press: Do you think
a wave is coming?

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.612
You think a wave is coming?

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.714
Ms. Sanders:  We certainly think
we have a great story to tell,

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:07.186
and we think America will be
ready to listen to that

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.455
and certainly has, I think,
felt the impact,

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:11.824
certainly from
an economic standpoint

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:13.959
for this administration.
And we're proud of that.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:15.594
I'll take one last question,
right here, Andrew.

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:18.397
The Press: Just to follow up
on Jeff and April's question,

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:21.333
is there anything
that Syria or Russia

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:23.435
could do at this point
to avoid military action?

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.038
Ms. Sanders: Again, I'm not
going to get ahead of anything.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.907
But certainly, like I've said
a few times today,

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.776
all options are on the table

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:35.214
and we'll continue conversations
with our allies and partners

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:36.915
and move forward
from that point.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.650
Thanks so much, guys,
have a great day.
