Islam in Europe, Muslims in Europe, Muslim Population in Europe

00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.899
in this video we'll learn how Islam came
to Europe what is the present percentage

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.040
of Muslims in Europe and we will also
try to examine the common perception

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.410
that Islam is taking over Europe so keep
watching Europe is the world's second

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.169
smallest continent it is comprised of 50
countries 47 of which are united as the

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.360
Council of Europe 28 countries are in
the European Union which sets economic

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.710
and political laws for the region
one-third of the world's wealth is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.480
located in Europe Europe is the world's
richest continent he the largest

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.260
religion in Europe as Christianity with
seventy six point two percent of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.460
Europeans considering themselves
Christians including Catholic Eastern

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.740
Orthodox and various Protestant
denominations

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.200
according to the Pew foundation about 5%
of Europe's population is Muslim this

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.380
accounts for only 2.4 percent of all
Muslims worldwide

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.980
Islam entered Europe at three different
occasions

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.870
Islam first gained a foothold in
continental Europe in 711 with the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.640
Umayyad conquest of hispania on the
Iberian Peninsula the Arab boom on

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.990
Caliphate became at the 8th century the
largest empire that ever existed in the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.550
history spanning from Pakistan to
Portugal the spread of the Arabs on

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.490
Iberian Peninsula started on the early
8th century in 733 the Battle of Tours

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.560
allowed Charles Martel to block abd
al-rahman army the Arab territory in

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.369
southwestern Europe reduced to become a
more organized and stable state

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.410
al-andalus until the eviction of the
last mayor Rodell who left the Iberian

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.229
Peninsula in 1492 secondly the mongols
from the beginning of the 13th century

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.700
became a leading if not the dominant
force in the world particularly under

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
jenga's khan they were extremely
tolerant toward religion many of them

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.190
eventually converted to Islam
Muslim Golden Horde spread from Central

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.120
Asia to Eastern European plain from the
late 13th century to the beginning of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.979
the 16th century even if they sacked and
destroyed numerous cities in Eastern

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.900
Europe the Christian kings of Hungary
Russia Crimea Lithuania were already

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.520
used to the mongol military tactics and
they regained many territories the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.230
golden horde collapsed at the end of the
15th century the tatters are the last

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.100
legacy of this mongol entity in the
regions and Russian army often had to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.970
control the tatters raids in
southwestern Russia until 18th century

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.920
the third time in Balkans and Anatolia
the spread of Islam came from the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.870
ottoman
side the slowly feeling but still

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.830
powerful Byzantine Empire the Turks
slowly penetrated and surrounded the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.810
Empire in the mid 14th century they had
already absorbed most of the southern

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.600
Balkans and also Anatolia current-day
Turkey the Ottoman Empire accustomed to

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.650
the Mongols and Arabs war strategies
became the most powerful state in Europe

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.840
and Middle East and crushed most of its
opponents in the mid 17th century the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.760
Empire spread from Algeria to Iraq and
from Yemen to Hungary the Ottoman forces

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.760
reached and besieged Vienna in 1683 but
never conquered the city after that the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.390
Empire slowly shrinked under the
European pressures and concentrated on

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.330
present-day Turkey after World War one
even though only 5% of the population of

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.550
Europe identifies as Muslim Islam is the
second largest religion in Europe the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.630
second most popular religion is Islam
concentrated mainly in the Balkans and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.750
Eastern Europe Bosnia and Herzegovina
Albania Kosovo Kazakhstan North Cyprus

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.170
Turkey asar by John North Caucasus and
the Volga Ural region more than 20

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.420
million Muslims live in the 28 countries
that form the European Union their share

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.030
of the population across Europe grew
from 4% in 1990 to 6% in 2010 according

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.000
to the Pew Research Center in 2030
Muslims are projected to make up 8% of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.170
the continents population
7.5 percent France has the most Muslims

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.700
as a proportion of its population in all
of Western Europe that figure is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.049
expected to increase to more than 10
percent by 2030

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.759
before proceeding further here are some
quick facts about Muslim population

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.659
living in Europe the Muslims share of
Europe's total population has been

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:33.060
increasing steadily Muslims are younger
than other Europeans Germany and France

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.669
have the largest Muslim populations
among European Union member countries

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.710
Muslims make up 5.8 percent of the
population in Germany 4.8% in Britain

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.740
and 3.7 percent in Italy by comparison
Muslims in the United States make up 1

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.570
percent of the population
now we try to find out the answer to the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.650
question that is Islam taking over
Europe Islam is the fastest growing

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.080
major religion in Europe primarily due
to immigration since the 1960's

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.130
immigrants from Muslim countries started
to appear in numbers in Western Europe

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.140
especially in Germany France and Belgium
although large Muslim communities

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.940
existed on the continent long before
this especially in the Balkans this was

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.620
the first major wave of immigration of
Muslims to North Western Europe

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.199
Muslims in Europe are not a homogeneous
group they are various national ethnic

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.660
and racial identities the top countries
of origin of Muslims in Western Europe

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.930
are Pakistan turkey Morocco Algeria and
Tunisia Muslims also vary in terms of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.620
their religious commitment some adhere
very strictly to the tenets of Islam

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.870
while others have largely assimilated
into secular European culture in Western

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.790
Europe Muslims generally live in major
urban areas often concentrated in poor

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.310
neighborhoods of large cities total
number of Muslims in 2017 in Europe is

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.949
about 50 million which comes out to be
6% the French capital of Paris and its

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.000
metropolitan area has the largest number
of Muslims out of any city in the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.530
European Union London also has a
substantial community of Muslim origin

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.940
if the current rate of migration of
Muslims to Europe and the Muslim

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.889
fertility rate remains constant by 2030
people of Muslim faith or origin are

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.479
predicted to form about 10% of the
French population and 8% of the European

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:33.389
population looking at the data one can
say that number of Muslim population in

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.060
Europe is on the rise and it is mainly
due to two main reasons one Europeans

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.550
are taking lots of immigrants from
Muslim countries to unlike Europeans who

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.320
seem to be reluctant to have kids
Muslims for various reasons make lots of

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.190
babies and those babies who happen to be
Muslims are considered European because

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.060
they were born in those EU countries and
thus making the Muslim population of

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.190
those European countries grow
dramatically

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.660
in conclusion we can say that in general
you can never just look at a trend and

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.490
assume it will continue indefinitely
very many panics of the past have made

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.050
the mistake of assuming that you can at
the moment Muslim immigrants have a high

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.760
birthrate in Europe while the non-muslim
European population in most countries is

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.120
slowly shrinking because people aren't
having enough children to replace

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.590
themselves immigration from
predominantly Islamic countries is also

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.930
relatively high it is said that by 2050
there will be as many Muslims as there

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.250
are Christians in the world
