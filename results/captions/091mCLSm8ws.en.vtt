00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.910 line:84%
They say a good compromise
leaves everyone unhappy.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.320 line:84%
Well, that's not
really an option

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.220 line:90%
if you're a hostage negotiator.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.400 line:84%
Fortunately, there
are some tricks

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.390 line:90%
to getting what you really want.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.340 line:84%
And as you're about
to see, those tricks

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.415 line:84%
can be used in
all walks of life.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.640 line:84%
MALE SPEAKER: Ever try
to negotiate a good deal

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.430 line:90%
on a car or a home?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.720 line:84%
Or maybe you've wanted to
ask your boss for a raise.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.460 line:84%
Having been the FBIs leading
international kidnapping

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.590 line:84%
negotiator and working over
150 cases from the Middle East

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.250 line:84%
to Haiti, Chris Voss
knows a thing or two

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 line:90%
about the art of negotiating.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.890 line:84%
In his book "Never
Split the Difference,"

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.240 line:84%
Chris teaches you
how to negotiate

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.720 line:90%
as if your life depended on it.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.480 line:84%
So whether you're
trying to make a sale

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.905 line:84%
or talk to your
troublesome teenager,

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:57.990 line:84%
Chris wants to show you how
to use world class negotiation

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.870 line:84%
skills that give you the
competitive advantage

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.310 line:90%
in any discussion.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.760 line:90%
Chris Voss is here with us now.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.875 line:84%
And Chris, welcome
to our program

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:06.130 line:84%
it's so good to
have you here today.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.340 line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.380 line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.160 line:84%
Let's talk, if
we can, about what

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.360 line:84%
happened in the last several
hours-- couple of days.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.260 line:84%
Here was a guy who
was a terrorist

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.200 line:84%
and his goal was to kill
as many people as possible.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.560 line:84%
So what level of
negotiating do you

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.974 line:90%
have with someone like that?

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:31.140 line:84%
If that's their end goal,
how do you deal with that?

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.240 line:90%
Well this is two things.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.070 line:84%
It was a tactical
empathy that we

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.510 line:84%
used as a-- in
hostage negotiation,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.630 line:84%
which actually applies to
everything is first of all,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.620 line:84%
understand what somebody
is really after.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.010 line:84%
And then at what point in
time you've encountered them,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.630 line:84%
a guy like this is
actually on what's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.150 line:90%
called the killing journey.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.340 line:84%
And every single time that
we prepared, we had to-- what

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.090 line:84%
if we had caught that guy a
block away from the night club?

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.870 line:90%
What would we have said to him?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.320 line:84%
If for some reason we had gotten
a few seconds to talk to him,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.730 line:84%
even the slightest moment,
wherever I can get an edge,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.050 line:90%
wherever I can get an advantage.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.740 line:84%
Understanding the
adversary is not

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.360 line:90%
the same as agreeing with them.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.280 line:84%
And when you begin to
make that distinction,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.630 line:84%
you find that you
can talk to anybody.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.430 line:84%
If they'll talk back, and
once they start talking you've

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.340 line:90%
got leverage.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.900 line:84%
Well, our government has
sort of a longstanding policy

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.270 line:84%
that we don't negotiate
with terrorists.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.300 line:84%
But you don't necessarily
think that's wise.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.250 line:84%
Well, you know, actually
there's a nuance to the policy

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.480 line:84%
that a lot of people don't
understand because it's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.730 line:84%
complicated to explain, but
we don't make concessions

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.390 line:84%
to terrorists-- that's
what the policy says.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.060 line:84%
Because we look-- I
used to always say,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.320 line:84%
when I used to brief
the White House,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.153 line:84%
I'd say, we don't
negotiate with terrorists,

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:41.920 line:90%
we negotiate against them.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.000 line:84%
So we begin to use
negotiation as a way

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.480 line:84%
to get what you want
without compromising.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.810 line:84%
One of the things that
you talk about utilizing

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.202 line:84%
is something you
call mirror words.

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:52.410 line:90%
Talk about that a little bit.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.120 line:90%
Talk about that a little bit?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.560 line:84%
So what we do is we
do what I just did.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.140 line:84%
I mirror the person
I'm talking with.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.650 line:90%
That was well done. [LAUGHTER]

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.940 line:84%
And it made you want to
talk with me, didn't it?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.205 line:84%
I mean, what you feel like
that is you want to open up--

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:06.640 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN (VOICEOVER):
I'm listening to you.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.810 line:84%
---you want to extend
the conversation,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.580 line:90%
it connects us even more.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.380 line:84%
So I try to connect
us even more.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.500 line:84%
And it also helps you think,
and it expands your thought

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.130 line:84%
processes, and it
gives both of us

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.930 line:84%
a moment to move forward
together collaboratively.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.280 line:84%
You know, sometimes
very often, in fact,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.280 line:84%
the people who are perpetrators
of these kind of acts

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.990 line:90%
have mental issues.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.090 line:84%
So do things like mirror words,
and some of the other tactics

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.490 line:84%
that you talk about,
work with someone

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.692 line:84%
who's delusional or suffering
from mental incapacity?

00:03:35.692 --> 00:03:36.900 line:90%
Well everybody has patterns.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.970 line:84%
It doesn't matter who you
are, you've got patterns.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.110 line:84%
And the crazier that
they are, they're

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.230 line:84%
crazy because we don't
like their patterns.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.637 line:84%
But it's my job as a negotiator
under any circumstance

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:49.220 line:84%
to be able to figure
out your patterns

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.490 line:90%
and then to work with that.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.850 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN (VOICEOVER):
To kind of define them.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.200 line:90%
Right.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.033 line:84%
It's a little creepy,
it's kind of like you

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.460 line:84%
got to go inside somebody's
head and start thinking

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.570 line:90%
like that a little bit.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.610 line:84%
Well you compartmentalize
and again,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.190 line:84%
if you can make the distinction
that understanding is not

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.520 line:84%
agreement, there is
tremendous power in that.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.580 line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.960 line:84%
You say that the
word no is something

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.779 line:84%
you're working toward in a
negotiation with someone,

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:13.820 line:90%
what do you mean by that?

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.780 line:90%
Well no is protection.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.760 line:90%
Yes is commitment.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.902 line:84%
When you say yes, you commit
yourself to something,

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:20.610 line:84%
you begin to immediately
worry about what

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.600 line:90%
you've gotten yourself into.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.970 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN
(VOICEOVER): Yeah.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.790 line:84%
Can I fulfill what
I've promised here?

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.540 line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.960 line:84%
And so-- but when people say
no, they center themselves,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.470 line:90%
they feel protected.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.520 line:84%
You know, it's little
things like-- and everybody

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.210 line:84%
that works for me,
nobody ever says,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.751 line:84%
when they call
somebody on the phone,

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:38.441 line:84%
have you got a few
minutes to talk?

00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:40.190 line:84%
Because you wonder
what you let yourself--

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.270 line:90%
what you let yourself in for.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.645 line:84%
Everybody that
works for me says,

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:43.920 line:90%
is now a bad time to talk?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.420 line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.070 line:84%
I like that. [LAUGHTER] I
like that, I might use that.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.690 line:90%
Please do.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.320 line:84%
You also talk about
the word compromise,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.070 line:84%
that compromise isn't
necessarily a good word,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.940 line:90%
though we think of it as such.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.440 line:90%
Right.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.750 line:90%
Right.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.860 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN (VOICEOVER):
Talk a little about that.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.276 line:84%
Well there's a difference
between a high value trade

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:02.650 line:84%
and whether or
not we compromise.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.190 line:84%
And compromise
most of the time is

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.190 line:84%
like, you know when I
came in this morning,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.064 line:84%
if I wasn't sure whether
or not I should wear

00:05:08.064 --> 00:05:09.990 line:84%
black shoes or brown
shoes I compromised and I

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.220 line:90%
wore one black and one brown.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.880 line:90%
So that's what compromise is.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.380 line:84%
And actually, I
probably should have

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.935 line:84%
done that, I would
have caught you

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:18.090 line:84%
off guard if I were to wear
two different color shoes.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.200 line:84%
We don't want to hold
your feet to the fire.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.394 line:84%
But, you know, compromise
is usually short cut.

00:05:22.394 --> 00:05:24.310 line:84%
Because I don't know
what to do and you end up

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.610 line:84%
with two solutions that
don't work well together.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.100 line:84%
So what's the
alternative to that?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.440 line:84%
What do you-- what
would you prefer?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.730 line:84%
Well let's talk a little
bit more about what you have

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.030 line:84%
that you could give me
that is really worthwhile

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.370 line:84%
and let's make a
high value trade.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.220 line:84%
I spoke to a Bar Association
in Memphis one time,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.145 line:90%
and my fees can be high.

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.020 line:84%
But they said-- they
had a magazine and said,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.100 line:84%
we'll put you on the
cover of the magazine.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.240 line:84%
Now that costs them
nothing and it's

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.550 line:90%
a rare thing for me to get.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.760 line:84%
And it was a perfect
trade-off and they got me

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840 line:84%
in there for a much reduced
fee because of how much

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.550 line:84%
valuable-- how much
value they gave to me.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.660 line:90%
Black swans, what are they?

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.360 line:84%
The things that you never guess
that make a huge difference.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.347 line:84%
In every negotiation, you're
keeping stuff from me,

00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:08.180 line:90%
you're hiding cards.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.000 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN (VOICEOVER):
Like the nugget

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.070 line:90%
that you're looking for.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.570 line:90%
Right.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.570 line:84%
And the black swan is really
where those unknowns overlap.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.440 line:84%
And what we need to do is
I need to get you talking.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.020 line:84%
I need to mirror you, I
need to paraphrase you,

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.020 line:90%
I need to summarize you.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.640 line:84%
And I need you to look at
me and say that's right.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.850 line:84%
And at that point
in time, you'll

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.940 line:84%
probably say something
that you had no idea

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.160 line:90%
was really important to me.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.720 line:84%
And I'll go like, holy cow
that makes all the difference

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.650 line:90%
in the world.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.770 line:84%
What's the most
difficult negotiation

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.630 line:90%
you've ever been in?

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.250 line:84%
Well when people
stop talking entirely,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.230 line:84%
if the other side won't talk at
all, that's the most difficult.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.450 line:84%
And there have been different
times when we actually

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.179 line:84%
learned to negotiate
through the media

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:58.470 line:84%
because we couldn't get the
other side to talk with us.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.330 line:84%
But we knew they were paying
attention to the media

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.200 line:84%
and so we put something
out in the media

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.910 line:84%
and we'd influence them
and they wouldn't know it.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.260 line:84%
So you say body
language is important.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.210 line:90%
In what way?

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.720 line:84%
Well, you know, body
language probably

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.550 line:84%
constitutes about
anywhere from 75% to 95%

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.290 line:84%
of your reaction from
me to figure out.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.250 line:84%
Now the fascinating thing
is if you are negotiating

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.530 line:84%
with several parties, you want
to watch the body language

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.020 line:90%
of people that aren't speaking.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.100 line:84%
Because everybody-- the talker
knows everybody's attention

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.900 line:84%
is on the talker, so
the people on their side

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.620 line:84%
that are listening,
they don't think

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.370 line:84%
they're watch-- that
you're watching them.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.930 line:84%
And so when their talker says
something that they don't like,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.712 line:84%
you don't-- they'll make all
sorts of shifts in their chair

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.670 line:84%
because they'll think
nobody's looking at them.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.086 line:84%
And those are really the people
watching the negotiations.

00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:48.780 line:84%
So I think the big
question probably

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.560 line:84%
everybody is wanting
to know is how do you

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.550 line:90%
ask your boss for a raise?

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.952 line:84%
You look at your boss and you
say, do you want me to fail?

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.300 line:84%
You'll be stunned at what
people are willing to say no to.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.860 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN
(VOICEOVER): Really?

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.820 line:90%
Absolutely stunned.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.450 line:84%
And your boss will
say, of course,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.710 line:84%
of course I don't
want you to fail.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.050 line:84%
And then you'll say,
well in order for me

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.190 line:84%
to do what you want me to do,
how am I supposed to do it

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.330 line:90%
unless I get these things.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.850 line:84%
And that opens up
the conversation.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.230 line:84%
What you've also
just done there is

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.050 line:84%
you made what you want a
path to what they want.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.360 line:84%
If you want me to be
successful for you then how can

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.800 line:84%
I do it unless I
get these things.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.200 line:84%
And that's a conditional
how question and there's

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.059 line:90%
great power in how.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.600 line:84%
TERRY MEEUWSEN
(VOICEOVER): There is.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.766 line:90%
There's great power in how.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.960 line:84%
There's great power in
what you share in the book.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.260 line:84%
I just want to say,
these are great insights.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.150 line:84%
The book is called "Never
Split the Difference,"

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.030 line:84%
negotiating as is if
your life depended on it.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.600 line:90%
The author is Chris Voss.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.990 line:90%
It's available nationwide.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.340 line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.506 line:90%
Thank you for having me in.

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:52.350 line:90%
Great wisdom.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.129 line:90%
Great wisdom.

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:54.670 line:84%
Fascinating background
that you have.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.170 line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.700 line:90%
Thank you.
