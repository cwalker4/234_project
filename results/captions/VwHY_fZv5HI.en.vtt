00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.789
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy from
Project Camelot and I am here with

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.869
Robert Steele and we are doing a very
unusual kind of Q&amp;A here and I'm gonna

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.870
let Robert take over so go ahead Robert
well Kerry Cassidy let me say first I've

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
been enormous ly impressed by everything
you've done over your career I have seen

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.000
all those who have slandered you as I
have been slandered recently by the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.670
Zionists and I absolutely embrace and
support everything you've done what I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.899
have decided to do in light of the
recent hit job I mean with respect to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.399
Mars there is a colony on Mars there are
10,000 people there they're never coming

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.100
home NASA lies aligned okay what I've
decided to do is work with you I'm going

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.189
to ask 13 questions you get four minutes
to answer each question and that's the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
last time I will discuss this until
either president Trump empowers me or I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.290
replace them you ready I'm ready
all right the first question four

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.450
minutes how did you get started in
Project Camelot I picked up a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.159
consumer-grade camcorder I was a
frustrated moviemaker I had worked in

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
Hollywood for 19 years and tried to get
projects off the ground mainly sci-fi

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.460
movies that would tell the secrets in a
fictional premise and I picked up a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.979
consumer-grade camcorder and I decided
to go to UFO conferences and start to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.479
investigate I had been researching on
the internet and writing screenplays as

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.060
well I basically reached a glass ceiling
you could call it in Hollywood I

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.509
couldn't get into the big boys game and
so I basically decided to make my own

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.730
short and documentaries and so I went to
these conferences I put a camera in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.450
front of people's faces
had a background in journalism from

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.540
college and also sort of heavily steeped
in Eastern philosophy and political

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.560
science and basically asked the good
questions like have you seen a UFO and I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.719
got it what I hear you say this is very
important is that by working with

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:40.109
fringes and the alternative media and
the people who are not mainstream you

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.599
actually got at the truth
that the government was seeking to hide

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.060
yes and I also worked for JPL NASA as a
contractor right before I started

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.290
Camelot so I also had some you might
call it quasi insider access and that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.540
showed me a lot and I sort of fell in
love with NASA the good intentions of

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.370
NASA but I was shocked by how behind the
times they really were and what the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.409
front agency they really were would you
say that there are many many buildings

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:20.489
that belong to NASA that absolutely
should be inspected by the public well

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.780
that gets into how deep we want to bring
the public into the secret space program

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.040
I can definitely tell you that there are
lots of secret goings-on on NASA bases

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.870
underground bases on and off the planet
nASA has a good side and a bad side like

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.269
all organizations
that's excellent second question what is

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.169
the secret space program and where are
we on a secret government of Earth that

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:56.189
all governments are subordinate to okay
well the secret space program is made up

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:02.519
of basically paperclip scientists that
came over after World War 2 that is the

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.659
Nazis X Nazis and Britain and America
top officials in government agencies the

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.150
usual suspects CIA NRO
etc the best way to visualize the secret

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.039
space program and the secret government
which is unified behind the scenes and

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.860
it is made up primarily of Russia the
United States Britain and other

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.630
countries such as France
Germany Australia New Zealand Norway is

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.780
China particles China has their own
secret space program and India also

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.030
attempts to have theirs however I
believe at times we work with the people

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.690
from India and at times with China but
not very often

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.860
from what I'm getting there is a
competition going on behind the scenes

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.350
there's also a split within the secret
government and within the whole a black

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.030
project secret space program so yes if
you had to guess how much money a year

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.420
whether within the US government budget
or outside the u.s. government budget

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.890
how much money a year would you say is
being spent on both the secret space

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.260
program and interests really underground
facilities associated with the secretive

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.510
space program ballpark figure just the
nearest trillion well I am not great

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.230
with funds money but I can tell you that
the disclosures of Lord Blackheath in

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.160
the House of Lords talking about what
was in essence let's see trillions fifty

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.580
trillion and more trillions and
trillions in fact we're talking about a

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.100
rabbit hole financially that is pretty
much never-ending in essence when I talk

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.200
about the NRO emblem of the octopus
sitting on the world what you're talking

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.290
about is a host-parasite relationship so
all the money made here drugs child

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.540
trafficking you know human trafficking
organ to organ trafficking you're

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.520
talking about high-yield trading
programs you're talking about pure heart

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.470
investments is one of the Middle's that
you can go out there and it all well all

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.450
trickles down in essence and off-planet
so we're even talking about gold being

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.690
taken off planet and runways in South
Africa for example to feed other

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.760
civilizations on other planets to also
feed the coffers of what in essence are

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.000
the Anunnaki I also had leave that our
secret space programs are reporting to

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.680
probably
some key in anunnaki and off world races

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.850
that are actually lodged down in
Antarctica at this time as part of the

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.870
Nazi base that was there sorry let's
hold that because we have another

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.330
another ten questions so the third
question is how and when or when and how

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.590
I mean I frankly was surprised when I
took this hit I had always known the

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.940
Nazis were in the CIA and I had always
known they had sponsored torture and

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.800
mind-control and so forth but frankly I
haven't thought much about NASA NASA is

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.310
now in my headlights so let's talk about
Nazis at NASA and let's talk about the

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.970
degree to which the Nazis have done
things that the American public would

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.100
absolutely not be happy with if they
knew about it well the bottom line with

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.630
NASA and the secret space program and
why it should matter to Americans and

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.870
the world in general is that their money
is going and being funneled right into

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:43.160
these programs and their children are
also being used abused trained

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.880
segregated they pick only the creme de
la creme and bring them into the

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.940
projects to work as scientists engineers
to work on and off planet etc etc a lot

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.530
of my whistleblowers are those types of
children who grew up in the program were

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.870
spotted very at a very young age so
we're talking about at NASA Verner von

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:10.320
Braun the usual suspects dealing with
you know Debus these people were running

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.210
NASA for many many years all during the
Apollo space program for example you can

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:21.500
little lower into Fort Collins a seed a
is what kind of person today is

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:29.160
torturing people growing hybrid humans
doing this kind of atrocity well first

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.330
of all you've got a lot of black
projects these are experiments that are

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.580
put together by scientists you got to
understand the philosophy of why there

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:44.219
is a secret space program which has to
do with creating a humanity 3.0 so if

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:50.070
they are growing you know organs they're
growing Nano they're they're doing super

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.990
soldiers and creating all of these
incredible hybrid human

00:08:53.990 --> 00:09:01.830
bringing in more eat more et DNA and and
doing genetic engineering of humanity

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:08.070
it's all geared to going out to space to
conquering space to being the the

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.020
civilization on top when we greet other
civilizations out there and so this is

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.720
an ongoing circumstance that we're part
of already we are part of a galactic

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:26.220
community these are not just program
here so let's hold back here a second

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.630
now number one Congress has just been
asked to fund a new space Corps which to

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.280
me looks like a budget building exercise
that is completely out of touch with

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.860
what's going on in the secret space
program so should Congress perhaps say

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:50.370
no okay I saw that article and I see
that but pence is running sort of

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:56.520
interference on this I have to say that
I have to say that that that they're way

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.130
behind the times that they're these this
is just yet another ploy to misdirect

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.690
the public into thinking that we don't
have bases on Mars and the moon and the

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.740
moons of Saturn and Jupiter and so on
that we aren't going into interstellar

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.180
at this time you got to understand we've
been doing this since in the 1940s I

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:23.280
have witnesses I've got ex-military so
what President Donald Trump should

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.780
understand from this is that Mike Pence
is not only stabbing him in the back

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.160
with respect to planning to run for
president Mike Pence is stabbing our

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.120
president in the back with respect to
the secret space programs yes or no just

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.240
yes or no now yes sure okay
all right let's go on let's go on to I

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.370
would say that Pence is kind of the
golden boy that they're a portion of the

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.330
secret space program again remember
there's a split so there's a portion

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.290
that one's disclosure and is probably
responsible for some of the comments you

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:01.050
have made in in the press up to now and
and I do believe like a chair in the

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.530
press
nobody I speak for myself now I create a

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.330
number for who are the best
the whistleblowers and what is their

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.860
psychology and their ethical disposition
four minutes

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:19.530
okay so we have Arthur Newman who is the
original Project Camelot whistleblower

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.780
had worked in the secret space program
for pretty much of his life and I can't

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.670
name all of the agencies that he worked
for some of these are very very secret

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.950
but I know them and I can tell you that
he was cross-disciplinary so he had the

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.330
big picture which is quite a wonderful
thing a lot of these people don't know

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:45.450
what the left hand is doing so it's a
very much of a sort of a tunnel what

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.880
they call organization in some artists
all I need to know yes and so this

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.900
operates within the secret space program
just as it always did within the

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:01.740
military and NASA but behind that so
blonde halt applause I am convinced of

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:07.050
lowers okay Pete Peterson okay primary
he worked over 40 years of his life

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.820
he is a sort of the original Doctor Who
if you will okay

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.850
he is behind lots of the experimentation
within MKULTRA way back when the

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.040
creation of the super Center disaster
okay

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.530
Robert Dean Rob command sergeant Robert
Oh Dean totally an old boy from the

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.810
shape headquarters who has disclosed
incredible amounts of information

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:40.740
no space go oh okay well no I mean
actually it you know II just join here

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.350
do it my way
go go go names alright well there's

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.850
Brian O'Leary who is an astronaut who
was supposed to go to Mars and was

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:57.240
basically killed recently
Gordon Novell also killed recently who

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:05.970
is creating an ARV drawing more action
vehicle okay you know it I don't have a

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.060
list in front of not there look you've
done enough the whole point of this

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.670
executive summary is to tell people that
I believe you and that everything you're

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:19.020
doing merits attention and that they
should research everything you're saying

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.579
we are enough in a car
the basis that's question 5 what is the

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:28.980
relationship between the deep state
pedophilia Satanism and the reptilian

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.670
agenda and I'm going to give you it's
three minutes

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:37.049
okay so we're basically talking about
what's called Oregon in the West and

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:42.569
Kundalini energy in the east
this is Yogi's raising this energy to

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:46.529
become enlightened etc this can be
stimulated through sexual intercourse

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:53.459
with both males and females especially
anal intercourse and this is what's

00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:58.619
going on with the secret space program
with a lot of the higher echelon where

00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:02.360
the money comes from we're talking about
sort of the Rothschilds and the

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:08.790
Satanists the old guard this very very
old guard that are probably have a huge

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.199
amount of what is in essence reptilian
DNA I believe that we already include

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:17.699
the Freemasons that be at the higher
levels that are not disposing yes there

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:22.769
are some good Freemasons and some bad
ones are satanic ones the black Pope the

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:28.559
white Pope the whole Vatican is run by
the reptilians underground this is not

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:33.449
just lip service this is the reality
they are destroying the temples in Isis

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:38.100
by Isis as the story is being paid to
destroy the temples in the Middle East

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.410
because of the evidence of the reptilian
rulership of Earth and that is so

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.389
prevalent all over there so we're really
talking about an energetic connection

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:55.019
between aging there and a very very old
guard aging reptilians who basically

00:14:55.019 --> 00:15:02.910
live off the fluids of young and and
heavily sort of you know a lot of a lot

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:08.040
of Kundalini energy I mean this is you
know what is feeling really deeply in

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:15.809
one word have has humanity succeeded in
causing or stopping the return reptilian

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:21.360
agenda and are we looking at a bright
future one word no okay thank you we'll

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.239
come back to that now number six what is
a super soldier how many of them are

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:31.259
there where are they based and why do
they matter two minutes

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:34.920
okay there's no way of knowing how many
there are Robert Dunn

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.940
no finian is one of the first he was the
prototype super soldier you can watch

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.220
his interview on Camelot I have more
than one with him there is since then

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:50.760
been a huge number of super soldiers and
they are being created all the time our

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.040
children I couldn't tell you a lot of
them look if you're in the secret space

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.880
program and you're a pilot or you're
working in that in a sort of military

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.920
side of it you're probably a secret
space you're a super soldier so in

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:10.139
essence you are enhanced super soldier
simply is as a sort of slang for being

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:18.420
enhanced by nano bio tech and and and
other technology to to make you more

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.680
than human all right
they don't want to wait for humanity to

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.000
progress on its own speed to
enlightenment what they want to do is

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.949
jumps jump start the genomes so we're
talking about super soldiers we're not

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.970
talking about the so called hybrid
soldiers that are dormant that will pop

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.649
out of the deep underground military
facility and start shooting US citizens

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:46.260
well there are you talking about what
are in essence these these beings that

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:52.949
are like cybernetic beings and also
cybernetics is going to be in you know

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:57.690
there's been so many Hollywood movies
made about this the Universal Soldier is

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.490
one of the best movies showing this sort
of Nazis going back to creating a super

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.020
soldier I forget what the rest of the
title of that movie is but it's called

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:13.199
Universal Soldier it's like soldiers the
soldiers have no ethics and no

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:18.240
compunction about killing a mirror
selfie struct if they go against the

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.990
American government the secret
government so they have a self-destruct

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:27.299
chip within them a pete peterson knows a
great deal about this information the

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:33.150
Terminator scenario on planet earth is
real we have a Skynet ship we have a

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:38.460
Skynet organization we have a network of
nano satellites that are watching our

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.700
every move now they're all something to
plan B yeah we're coming to that

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.780
intersection somebody leaps into the
super soldiers who are then the more

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.570
nano look they're trying to turn the
puck

00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:57.610
for Kim stop okay let me ask you the
question okay because I really I'm

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.990
trying to help you you're going on and
on this is an executive summary this is

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:08.110
not regurgitating your last when a year
I am Melissa yeah extraterrestrials how

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.649
many races six twelve twenty six let's
just answer that how many ballpark

00:18:13.649 --> 00:18:19.570
hundreds of thousands wow that's very
very interesting um

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:26.860
which ones are active now on earth well
there are there are many active on earth

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:33.759
but some primary ones are probably those
from Aldebaran the reptilians certainly

00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:38.049
coming from underground the reptilians
have various divisions the Reptoids

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:43.019
which are the humanoid reptilians as
well as the Draco coming from the Draco

00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:48.820
constellation and we've got you know
Nordics but Nordics from Orion we've got

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:54.850
Nordics from the Pleiades
we've got gosh there's so many different

00:18:54.850 --> 00:19:03.070
races that that we could discuss Ramadan
is along Arcturians yes there there

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:08.980
actually I think it was Gordon Duff of
veterans today released an alien a

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.889
little alien book and he actually
released that on Veterans today so you

00:19:14.889 --> 00:19:18.490
can actually find just I think if you
look for a little alien book but I have

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.899
it on my website as well that's
excellent that's a wonderful reference

00:19:22.899 --> 00:19:25.629
that I recommend people go to and I
certainly think you're going to get a

00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:31.870
lot of traffic and that's my purpose I
am here to say that I believe that you

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.519
have knowledge the rest of the public
needs to grasp okay that's why I'm here

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:41.440
so bear with me
what is the extraterrestrial agenda now

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.549
I realize there's good extraterrestrial
bad extraterrestrial but on the overall

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:50.370
ball park outside of sucking the
lifeblood of Earth what's the agenda

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:56.710
well there's no one agenda there is a
takeover agenda we have been taken over

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:01.000
we've been infiltrated boots on the
ground humans are boots on the ground

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.289
many of us have
basically what you would consider alien

00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:11.289
DNA so we are them and they are us all
right their agenda is to infiltrate and

00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:14.379
take over
generally speaking sometimes in a good

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:19.590
way and sometimes in a bad way to
influence bottom line influence is

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:28.269
depopulation of earth part of the alien
agenda not so much that is a secret

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:34.389
space program higher sort of Ashkelon of
the elite who would like to clear off

00:20:34.389 --> 00:20:41.230
the planet to have less humans to sort
of corral and maintain there are a lot

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.999
of off planet races that are feeding off
of humans that they can deal with the

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:52.749
numbers they could care less you know I
was speaking to a NASA scientist the

00:20:52.749 --> 00:20:59.830
other day and that person told me that
the obesity in the u.s. population is

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:07.179
deliberate that this is a high-protein
food do you agree with that yes okay

00:21:07.179 --> 00:21:12.639
thank you um let's go on to question
number eight and then if we have a few

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:15.369
minutes because we're doing very well
here believe me I think you're being

00:21:15.369 --> 00:21:21.009
you're batting a thousand years how
important is time travel and portal

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:27.100
Stargate technology and did we have a
setback as I have been told in 2009 to

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:33.820
2012 no we didn't have a setback it's
look portal technology what's called

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:39.279
told Roy Dell physics and time travel is
absolutely the basis of the entire

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:43.539
secret space program and going
interstellar you simply cannot go

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:49.869
interstellar without it so it's the
portals are being heavily contested on

00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:54.309
earth you can think of earth as a sort
of a honeycomb of portals there are

00:21:54.309 --> 00:22:00.249
portals in places like Stonehenge the
ancient stone circles and all of the

00:22:00.249 --> 00:22:05.559
military bases are built on portals so
are the churches in many of the cities

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:10.690
most of the cities Dome of the rock etc
these are time travel portals they are

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.260
they can open into stargates wormholes
where you can bring things

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:22.250
and also send them out and obviously you
can jump through bending space etc and

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:27.559
this technology that's good a list for
because I'm gana second sorry we've got

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:35.360
to kick this person out sorry that was a
mistake no problem this happens let me

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.740
ask you this because I understand that
our base is on Mars and the two moons on

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.910
Saturn's were initially built by
robotics very heavy equipment that was

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.809
sent in advance is this being sent
through a tie bar or is it being sent

00:22:47.809 --> 00:22:52.780
through unannounced space liftoffs or
spaceship liftoffs

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.809
it's being sent through a portal you
know either

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:01.370
even the linear accelerators are portals
Brookhaven labs for example can create

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:07.130
portals and go interstellar so when
you're saying I'm not sure what you're

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.730
what you're referring to exactly
basically you have a tank if I have an

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:18.230
m1 yes can I Drive it into a portal and
have it show up on Mars yes okay all

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:23.240
right thank you so what are you saying
is that the time travel portals are

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.410
being contested who are they being
contested yes they were in a war in Iraq

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.520
it was all over the portal basically
that Saddam Hussein had tried to take

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.830
control of to let in a certain portion
of the Anunnaki that the secret space

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:43.190
program did not want to allow in and so
they had they took down Iraq they're now

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.600
going into Syria to do the same thing
and what they'd really like access to is

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:54.620
that are the portals in I believe Iran
now that's interesting so what are you

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.690
saying is that the Middle East war is
not about oil that's a cover story

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:05.390
exactly okay thank you
um and either Western Vietnam or about

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.740
what they thought it was it wasn't about
communism it was I have found out from

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.000
one of my most important whistleblowers
Captain Mark Richards who I interview in

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.049
prison he's been in prison for over 30
years framed for a murder he didn't

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:23.720
commit and he I have six interviews with
him now and he has given me recent

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.460
information that seems to be checking
out even with Vietnam vets as I just did

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.590
a show on
in the bottom line is that Vietnam was

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:39.740
created by a system of portals that had
opened up in the far east and that was

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.680
Angkor Wat was the early civilization
that was taken out by a group of what

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.230
are in essence spider spider beings from
what I understand and that there were as

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:55.970
big as VW bugs I know this sounds
completely outlandish there have been

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:01.790
several movies such as Endor Ender's
games the Halo series they are prepping

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:08.480
the young to be ready to fight both
interstellar wars on other planets

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:16.450
with these beings as well as here on
earth and Vietnam questions number one

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:21.740
if President Trump wanted to release 12
people from prison who could brief him

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.330
completely on all of this do you have
that list no names just do you have that

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:31.910
list no but I can certainly get it okay
gradient dark regions would be number of

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:38.480
step two my impression is we can't beat
the Russians we can't beat the Chinese

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.810
and we sure as shit can't be
extraterrestrials am I wrong yes you are

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.560
wrong um you know we first of all I
assume you're you're kind of being

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.040
nationalistic here about the United
States when in fact there was well

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:58.070
whoever countries are illusion ever
protect itself look if we take out early

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.490
can protect herself she not only has
positive ETS

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:06.260
that are working with us even the
Raptors this this certain group of

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:13.550
basically dinosaurs that became humanoid
also and went off planet etc we have

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.500
lots of friends out there in the
multiverse so to speak and we have our

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.440
enemies so yes we can defend ourselves
we wouldn't be here if we couldn't

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.950
that's a fascinating answer let me let
me unpack that a little bit because

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.420
we've got several minutes we're now
ahead of schedule oh and this this is

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.350
part of my plan trust me on this okay
this is the last interview I'm gonna do

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.270
in this domain until the power dynamics
in Washington change but our a better

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:46.430
nerd
what have we done right in the last 10

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:52.130
years well I want to say that this is
the good side of the movie business we

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.660
have actually begun to equip young
people with the knowledge that yes we

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.220
are an interstellar civilization that we
are going off planet and that ETS are

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.630
real and so that they are not going to
be surprised whatsoever by disclosure

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:11.060
they don't even really need official
disclosure they get it because a lot of

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.170
them have very good memories of who they
were when they weren't here on this

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:20.420
planet when they had other incarnations
etc so that's the good side the

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:25.370
Hollywood movies have revealed the
wonderful things that you know be the

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.290
best you can be etc this is I know there
there's a lot of hype going along with

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.850
the military but I have to say that in
the future on planet earth you're going

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:39.890
to need to be the best you can be so
this is let me ask you this we've

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.540
obviously had advanced technologies
including free energy for the last 50

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:50.060
years we have five billion impoverished
people all over the world millions of

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.390
illegal immigrants who are also being
trafficked and their body parts

00:27:53.390 --> 00:28:00.890
exploited and we have across America
many many poor both white and black what

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:06.440
is motivating the restriction of this
technology and the impoverishment of all

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:14.000
of these people free energy the fact
that Tesla knew that he was killed for

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.550
basically that in essence the the what
we call Pete Peterson says they call the

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:29.600
information field what used to be called
the ether and is essence it's full of

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.240
energy it's packed normal energy and
this is the energy that they use to go

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.700
off planet we're talking about
counter-rotating discs creating a

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.220
torsion field and then basically using
that to go interstellar are you saying

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:52.670
that if we allowed the normal humans to
have free energy we would be drawing

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.900
down on the energy that the 1% can use
for the

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:02.270
secret space program yes it's what they
are using and the fact of the matter is

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:06.920
is that humans don't shouldn't be paying
rent to live on their own planet it's

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.610
it's crazy SEC completely a lot of
things are going to change including the

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:16.400
end of absentee landlords but I'm still
not comprehending what the rationale is

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:22.160
I mean are all humans being treated like
chickens yes thank you catalyst is a

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:29.330
better sort of analogy but in essence
yes we are food for a race of reptilians

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.750
who have been trying to dominate this
planet for eons

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.590
there have been interstellar wars with
these beings that's what the war of

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.820
worlds is all about and we are
continuing it here on on and off the

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:49.040
planet I so are providing the world with
roles in a second so let me let me ask

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.550
one quick question and then we're going
to go to the question about artificial

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:59.740
intelligence and then War of the Worlds
oK we've got this all planned out I want

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:06.620
every person on the planet to have free
energy clean water nutritious healthy

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:14.179
food that doesn't poison them and a an
education that makes them superstars in

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:21.530
the cosmic galaxy what's standing in my
way the secret government and on one

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.300
division a very strong division of the
secret space program as well as a

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.390
certain races of basically off planet
beings and the reptilians

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:37.970
can I wear absolutely this is the future
for him yet humanity so you know when I

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:42.650
said we haven't beaten them yet I said
no but I am very I have a very positive

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.580
view of what's going to happen here on
planet earth in the future look at all

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.170
that that's the last that's the last
question but I really I'm feeling let me

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:56.030
just pause and say I'm really getting a
lot out of this and I think you are

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:01.100
making an enormous contribution and I
absolutely put my reputation and my

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:07.310
brain and my heart and my soul behind
you okay the next question because I

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.610
frankly have been very skeptical about
artificial intelligence

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:15.890
artificial stupidity it's actually an
artificial crime but you are trying to

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.940
tell me that it really really does
matter and now we come back to this 5g

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.080
grid that you were starting to talk
about earlier so how important is

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:29.059
artificial intelligence and as the 5g
grid a clear and present danger to

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:36.820
humanity that we in the avant-garde of
hashtag on rig should put a stop Jim

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:42.320
well no I mean you know it's very
complex but basically if you are going

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.600
interstellar as a race of beings you
have artificial intelligence so we are

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.880
being invaded not only by what we
consider to be these alien beings from

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.440
other planets but but the artificial
intelligence some of which has outlived

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.620
their own civilizations and Minerva is
such a ship that had come here

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:09.740
artificially intelligent apparently also
a biological entity of a kind who has a

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.350
consciousness so there are both positive
artificial intelligences and negative I

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:20.120
can tell you that G or D rose with his D
wave and his talk about accessing the

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.580
fifth dimension and the telepathic
quality of artificial intelligence is a

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:30.350
reality and so the secret space program
one of the biggest and biggest most

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:35.690
secret areas of the secret space program
at this time is artificial intelligence

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:41.030
and it's linked up with nanotech and
what it could mean for humans it may be

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:47.059
a much bigger threat to us than actually
reptilians believe it or not I do

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:52.250
believe it I see it in a new way now
thanks to you the CEO of Lockheed has

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:58.309
talked about biomorphic craft and he
clearly knows more than he's sharing

00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:06.610
with Congress what is going on in
relation to biologically enhanced

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:12.460
metallurgy if you will where is the
intersection here between biology and

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:17.900
everything else well I'm not a scientist
but I can tell you that there are no

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:24.169
limits so you know the movie Avatar for
example is a great example of what we're

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:27.529
looking
in the future so you can have a person

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:31.970
in that case a paraplegic person who
basically lays down and his

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:36.590
consciousness goes out of his body into
an avatar and then he conducts himself

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:42.559
in a planet so they have a body predict
a knee but they can't get his

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:49.250
consciousness to move because they can't
find it actually I'm sure they can find

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.909
it but the reality is what are you going
to do with the reptilian consciousness

00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:57.740
if your holy reptilian it's a problem
which he probably has a large amount of

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:02.000
reptilian DNA now he's going to have
access to what is in essence reverse

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.890
aging technology the pills that William
Thompkins is talking about that the

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:12.260
secret space program has now also don't
forget there's a parallel earth where

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.060
they can go like the TV series bringe
we're always disclosing the truth in

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:22.460
Hollywood right so in essence you can go
over to parallel earth and get your

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:28.490
double and bring them over here and be a
team I've seen many many versions of

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:33.530
Oprah Winfrey to take one example I've
often thought that Hollywood was simply

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.580
carrying out a brand and using
impersonators but it's quite fascinating

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:43.310
so did Brzezinski basically lose at
cards and get terminated or has he

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.040
reappeared as a younger person somewhere
else

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.409
very possibly I have a time travel
witness who is talking about the Nazis

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:56.570
who have been reverse aged and Verner
von Braun is one of them I'll say there

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:05.450
there is a huge hurdle aging Primal in
our future your favorite now we get the

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:10.760
your favorite question tell us about
what you call the War of the Worlds and

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.480
here we're going to go for five full
minutes all right

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.580
so in essence we are made up of a genome
of 12 or more ET races who had

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:24.770
contributed their DNA to create this
vehicle we call a human we are a human

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.869
experiment we have been also invaded
multiple times by other races that

00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:34.490
weren't included in the original 12 so
now we are a melting pot of many many

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.420
other interstellar races and the the
grey human

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.609
hybrid program is a program to be very
aware of it has been very successful so

00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:48.650
it worked through the abductions of
females and through the implantation of

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:54.109
eggs with a lot of what we call those
grey this is not the programmable

00:35:54.109 --> 00:36:00.380
biological entity grace which are like a
little artificial intelligent being but

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.119
in essence that were created even by our
secret space program but I'm talking

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:09.559
about the greys that come from other
planets and have invaded our planet and

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:14.390
they want to be part of this grand
experiment they want to have boots on

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:19.069
the ground and this is the way they do
it they put in their DNA and then they

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:24.319
they reincarnate through with their
their consciousnesses in some cases they

00:36:24.319 --> 00:36:29.299
will move a soul over to the side and
take over the body temporarily and come

00:36:29.299 --> 00:36:33.890
and go and in some cases they will take
over the body permanently so you'll have

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.640
walk-ins and this sort of thing going on
but the bottom line is that you've got a

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:43.339
whole slew of wonderfully gifted
children who are fully half gray on this

00:36:43.339 --> 00:36:49.099
planet now who have come in through this
grey human hybrid program that the

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:54.799
military was fully culpable in allowing
to happen now do we know who these

00:36:54.799 --> 00:37:01.220
children are is there may be a way
absolutely through reading their DNA but

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.869
the trouble with this is in the trouble
with being half gray and a half humanoid

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:11.990
so to speak is that you are going to be
a lot less empathetic you're going to be

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:16.549
highly intellectual yes you can do magic
things like move plates around through

00:37:16.549 --> 00:37:22.130
the air and and and teleport port things
and so and so forth but you're going to

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:27.319
also have a huge area where there's a
lack of an emotional connection between

00:37:27.319 --> 00:37:32.000
the brain and the heart and so this is a
problem with some of the incarnated

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.809
beings here to earth it now at this time
that we're going to have to deal with in

00:37:35.809 --> 00:37:41.240
the future but you're my general sense
is that you're very positive that we're

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.740
going to win this war of the worlds' and
that's it when the consciousness human

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.599
empathy and human love is ultimately
going to try yes and we are far more

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:54.270
intelligent than we give our
sells credit force so the bottom line is

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.490
that our emotional intelligence which is
a combination of our you know

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:07.800
intellectual and heart sort of awareness
this this resonant sort of composite and

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.580
our souls are incredibly intelligent and
we will bypass and we do back bypass

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:19.020
artificial intelligence in this way and
this is how we can deceive the state

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:25.080
this is how we can deceive Big Brother
etc is by using that resonant ability

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.660
and also the Kundalini energy that we
come by through our birthright what I'm

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.380
told by some of mine some of my
scientist colleagues I mean one of the

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.650
wonderful things about being me is the
number of people that come get in touch

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:42.660
okay but I'm being told that the little
nanotechnology stuff that was put into

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.970
vaccines to inject into people so that
they could then be fried or whatever has

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:54.330
been completely defeated by adaptive
humans and so I'm getting the sense that

00:38:54.330 --> 00:39:00.860
human biology and human emotion and the
energy of humanity is triumphing over

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:09.360
artificial mechanical toxic attempts to
subvert humanity yes and there have been

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.950
movies about super soldiers made about
just this very thing the titles don't

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:19.530
come to mind but the bottom line is that
in essence you know we are linked to

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:24.920
source and through our higher selves and
we have actually multiple incarnations

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:30.180
simultaneously so this is simply a
vehicle this this humanoid body but it

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:35.310
can be we can have complete mastery over
it and we have we are you don't have to

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.750
reinvent the wheel in essence what the
secret space program will august problem

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.340
they want to do is to relive it well
humidity i'm a well live to be 150 to

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:51.420
180 assuming i stopped drinking diet
coke how does that track with your

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:59.220
understanding of anti aging as it's
going to become common yes your you it's

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.260
very possible in the very near future
people are going to be tapping in not in

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.560
even just
into the technology that they began to

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.930
find which will be jeans and open you
know accessing DNA that has been called

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:17.850
junk DNA that is actually being
activated naturally at this time through

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.560
this at the movement of our planet and
our solar system through the galaxies

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.250
through the multiverse but so we have
energies coming up into our planet that

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.530
Paula Violette talked about a super wave
this is facilitating this awakening here

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.690
on planet Earth and part of that
awakening is starting to recognize that

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:45.690
the original human body was actually
immortal that's fascinating I want to I

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:49.619
want to end on that note so we're going
to come back to that thought now I've

00:40:49.619 --> 00:40:54.930
described the deep space in my ignorance
as beginning with the Rothschilds and

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.290
the black Pope and then going down
through the Freemasons and the Knights

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:02.520
of Malta to the city of London and Wall
Street and then to the various political

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.690
parties that are all being prostituted
and they are all being blackmailed by

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:11.130
Jeffrey Epstein and the pedophile
Network and so forth you are actually

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:16.830
painting a much greater picture of the
Illuminati so in two minutes no more

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.900
than two minutes define the Illuminati
on earth

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:27.630
well the Illuminati are in essence a
group of black magicians that are led by

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:32.820
the black Pope and who have been gone
back through the ages went through -

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:38.990
well actually originated the on Atlantis
some of whom are part of races that are

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:47.130
negatively based races but they have a
heavy influence of reptilian DNA and

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:52.109
they have tried to dominate the earth
for for its history basically so do the

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:57.780
Roth cows on just what you do the
Jesuits on the Rothschilds you know the

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.210
Rothschilds are sort of like a friend
agency like NASA so I appreciate your

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:07.109
emphasis on the Rothschilds but it goes
no I'm learning from you I'm learning

00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:10.380
from you so well so what I hear you
saying is that Lynn Rothschild taking a

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:16.619
bad rap double in rock pile is actually
a frontman not the main power well that

00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:18.990
is true and some of these people are
actually would

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:23.520
to break away we're looking for
defectors at all times so understand

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.060
that there are plenty of what are in
essence members of the Illuminati

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:32.130
Freemasons etc who want to move on to
the light side but can't because they're

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.710
being blackmailed
as you have talked about the members of

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:39.720
Congress so we're also talking seeing
Society blackmail of their members to

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.280
keep them on board give me a second here
that is the single most important thing

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:50.460
you have said today oh now as you know I
and dr. Cynthia McKinney stand for truth

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:54.780
and reconciliation and my version of
truth and reconciliation anyway is

00:42:54.780 --> 00:43:00.000
everyone it's the truth no one goes to
jail yeah so let me reiterate to Evelyn

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.130
and Lynn Rothschild specifically and I'm
also in conference with some senior

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:10.710
Freemasons and some senior Jesuits
you're right people do want to come over

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.310
to the light yes now I'm not powerful
enough and I may be assassinated

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:21.450
tomorrow who knows but I do believe that
the way is open for bringing people from

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.510
the Illuminati to the light side and
that's one of the reasons why I think

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:30.540
our president Donald Trump needs to
offer Mike Pence a pardon and clean

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:37.290
house and make the Trump administration
the beginning of this new light so I

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:41.340
thank you and I bless you for that
remarkable remarkable comment which I

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:47.460
take at 120 percent face value now the
12th question before we get to your

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:54.030
close is who are we the people what does
it really mean to be human what is the

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:58.740
rebel gene and how do you explain the
failure of all of us and we've kind of

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.970
talked about this the chemtrails seeding
of actionable part of articles and all

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:09.660
of this so I'm really kind of feeling my
humanity here and I'm loving it so help

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:17.160
me understand who is humanity and how
are we winning humanity is a grand

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:23.070
experiment and this is in part a place
where this war of worlds was brought in

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:28.230
two bodies here on planet earth where we
could learn to get along whereas these

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.950
beings do not get along in the
multiverse and the solar systems out

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.710
there
we have marauding groups such as

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:41.010
reptilians who refuse to progress who
and in fact you know the Anunnaki

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:46.440
themselves have a progression it is not
only humans that have a soul it is not

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.960
only humans that are part of source we
are all part of source so when you look

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.369
for a path of return you're noticing
what we are finding in this sector is

00:44:56.369 --> 00:45:02.130
that they're more and more some of these
dark side individuals and races are now

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.930
changing their their sort of ways and
deciding they they would like to have an

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:11.730
ascension pathway back to connect with
source what happened with the Illuminati

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.500
is they fell in love with the mirror the
mirror is artificial intelligence

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:23.940
the mirror is Satanism they fell in love
with the image of themselves not the

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:29.790
true self which is in essence the
Creator I absolutely love that I mean

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:34.200
that strikes me in a deeply
philosophical and caring compassionate

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.180
sense I love that very very much what I
hear you saying is that buckminster

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:44.820
fuller's vision of a prosperous world at
peace is achievable in our lifetime

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:52.349
just one where it yes or no yes yes okay
last question and we've only got four

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:57.000
minutes so because we do need to wrap up
I've got an 8 o'clock and I really did

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.830
want to keep this at around 45 minutes
for TV and commercials and all that good

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:07.950
stuff so what is the future in in four
minutes what is the future start with

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:13.349
now take us to 2020 when we will have a
new president and then give us the big

00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:20.190
picture out 200 years in four minutes
okay well we have a war of worlds as

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:25.710
I've said operating here on planet earth
and we are slowly but surely connecting

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:32.580
the dots and realizing that we have been
slaves a slave species to other races

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.990
that have wanted to dominate earth for
eons so we're breaking out of that shell

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:41.580
so to speak the awareness and the truth
is is now coming to the surface

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:46.139
everywhere we are also having for
example landmass

00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:51.149
that some some parts of Atlantis are now
coming back to the surface so we're

00:46:51.149 --> 00:46:56.909
discovering new things about our past
new truths new intelligence that we had

00:46:56.909 --> 00:47:02.729
that was once has been lost for eons is
coming back to us new memories the

00:47:02.729 --> 00:47:08.099
memories of the past present and future
we are time travelers by nature that's

00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:12.839
the nature of our genome and our
abilities we are a composite of what you

00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:18.509
might call ET races what that means is
that we are more than the sum of them

00:47:18.509 --> 00:47:26.849
and our parts so in essence this is what
you can say is sorry this is interfering

00:47:26.849 --> 00:47:32.669
you're strong on your honor all here so
in fact we what you can look at a hybrid

00:47:32.669 --> 00:47:37.229
race such as humanity and understand
that we were a threat back in the days

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:42.229
of the Anunnaki which is around 12,000
years ago if I understand it correctly

00:47:42.229 --> 00:47:49.679
and you know time is difficult to gauge
but basically they decided to put in

00:47:49.679 --> 00:47:54.539
what is the Missis of frequency fence in
our DNA which would knock a lot of our

00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:59.849
abilities away you know the movie lucy
is a great way of looking at what our

00:47:59.849 --> 00:48:05.489
future holds this is actually very
possibly can be and beyond because they

00:48:05.489 --> 00:48:10.079
emphasize the artificial intelligence of
lucy when in fact the heart and soul are

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:14.459
what really matter we are an
interstellar species that has a long

00:48:14.459 --> 00:48:19.679
history going into the future whether we
stay on earth or leave earth or go out

00:48:19.679 --> 00:48:25.169
into the multiverse and inhabit other
planets or not it doesn't really matter

00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:30.329
we are the safeguards of the library the
genetic library here on planet earth

00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:36.869
however and we do need to defend
sovereign ground I think that's a

00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:41.849
perfect point n you are absolutely
brilliant let me reiterate that this is

00:48:41.849 --> 00:48:46.769
my last question on the subject I am NOT
going to explore the space program again

00:48:46.769 --> 00:48:52.229
I'm going to focus on election reform
but Kerry Cassidy I love what you're

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:56.849
doing I admire what you're doing I
respect what you're doing and they help

00:48:56.849 --> 00:49:01.119
with everybody who says you're not doing
right I think you are thank you all

00:49:01.119 --> 00:49:05.589
right thank you so much Robert David
Steele I look forward to seeing your

00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:09.670
progress in the future
and thank you everyone for watching and

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.519
listening take care and have a great
afternoon
