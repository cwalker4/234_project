00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.067
An international race is picking up speed,
to see our universe for what it really is

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:11.400
and how it came to be.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:24.180
According to the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
standard theory that describes the origins
of the universe, its early moments were marked

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:44.600
by the explosive contact between subatomic
particles of opposite charge.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.030
Scientists are now focusing their most powerful
technologies on an effort to figure out exactly

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.620
what happened.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.070
Our understanding of cosmic history hangs
on the question: how did matter as we know

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:14.689
it survive? And what happened to its birth
twin, its opposite, a mysterious substance

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:25.259
known as antimatter?

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:39.570
A crew of astronauts is making its way to
a launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:50.749
Florida. They'll enter the space shuttle Endeavor
for the 134th, and second to the last, flight

00:01:50.749 --> 00:02:14.230
of the space shuttle.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.599
Little noticed in the publicity surrounding
the close of this storied program is the cargo

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:34.540
bolted into Endeavor's hold.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.890
It's a science instrument that some hope will
become one of the most important scientific

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.090
contributions of human space flight.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.200
It's a kind of telescope, though it will not
return dazzling images of cosmic realms long

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.349
hidden from view, the distant corners of the
universe, or the hidden structure of black

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.659
holes and exploding stars.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.870
Unlike the great observatories that were launched
aboard the shuttle, it was not named for a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:18.969
famous astronomer, like Hubble, or the Chandra
X-ray observatory.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:27.049
The instrument, called the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer, or AMS, is the brainchild of

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:36.530
this man, Samuel Ting, from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.700
At the heart of the AMS is a large superconducting
magnet designed to operate in the pristine

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.310
environment of space.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.739
With its intensive power requirements, the
final version was attached to the international

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.859
space station.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.799
The promise surrounding this device is that
it will enable scientists to look at the universe

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:13.510
in a completely new way.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.090
Most telescopes are designed to capture photons,
so-called neutral particles reflected or emitted

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.720
by objects such as stars or galaxies.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.640
AMS will capture something different: exotic
particles and atoms that are endowed with

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:42.060
an electrical charge. Among these are a theoretical
dark matter particle called a neutralino.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.941
Then there are the strangelets, a type of
quark that could amount to a whole new form

00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:49.941
of matter.

00:04:49.941 --> 00:05:02.070
The instrument is tuned to capture "cosmic
rays" at high energy hurled out by supernova

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:10.470
explosions or the turbulent regions surrounding
black holes.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.820
And there are high hopes that it will capture
particles of antimatter from a very early

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.080
time that remains shrouded in mystery.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.880
The chain of events that gave rise to the
universe is described by what's known as the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:35.340
Standard model. It's a theory in the scientific
sense, in that it combines a body of observations,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.910
experimental evidence, and mathematical models
into a consistent overall picture. But this

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:51.920
picture is not necessarily complete.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.490
The universe began hot. After about a billionth
of a second, it had cooled down enough for

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:09.470
fundamental particles to emerge in pairs of
opposite charge, known as quarks and antiquarks.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:16.300
After that came leptons and antileptons, such
as electrons and positrons.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.700
These pairs began annihilating each other.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.960
Most quark pairs were gone by the time the
universe was a second old, with most leptons

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.690
gone a few seconds later.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.440
When the dust settled, so to speak, a tiny
amount of matter, about one particle in a

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:44.860
billion, managed to survive the mass annihilation.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:53.810
That tiny amount went on to form the universe
we can know - all the light emitting gas,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:01.800
dust, stars, galaxies, and planets.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:12.180
To be sure, antimatter does exist in our universe
today. The Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.080
spotted a giant plume of antimatter extending
out from the center of our galaxy, most likely

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.330
created by the acceleration of particles around
a supermassive black hole.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.590
The same telescope picked up signs of antimatter
created by lightning strikes in giant thunderstorms

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.570
in Earth's atmosphere.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:44.300
A European cosmic ray satellite called Pamela
detected a huge store of antiprotons in orbit

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:51.180
around the earth created by high-energy particles
striking the upper atmosphere, then held there

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:57.740
by magnetic fields that ring the planet.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:03.690
Scientists have long known how to create antimatter
artificially in physics labs - in the superhot

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.120
environments created by crashing atoms together
at nearly the speed of light.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:21.280
Here is one of the biggest and most enduring
mysteries in science: why do we live in a

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:29.290
matter-dominated universe? What process caused
matter to survive and antimatter to all but

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.079
disappear?

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:39.210
One possibility: that large amounts of antimatter
have survived down the eons alongside matter.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:47.890
That was the view of the German-born physicist
Arthur Schuster, who appears to have coined

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:53.510
the term "antimatter" in 1898. He imagined
that its opposite charge would allow it to

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:59.440
act as a counter to gravity:

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.970
"Large tracts of space," he wrote, "might
thus be filled unknown to us with a substance

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:12.680
in which gravity is practically non-existent,
until by some accidental cause, such as a

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.810
meteorite flying through it, unstable equilibrium
is established, the matter collecting on one

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:29.250
side, the antimatter on the other until two
worlds are formed separating from each other,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:38.180
never to unite again."

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:45.520
The issue gathered dust until 1928, when a
young physicist, Paul Dirac, wrote equations

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.720
that predicted the existence of antimatter.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.970
Dirac showed that every type of particle has
a twin, exactly identical but of opposite

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.830
charge.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:05.670
So for every proton, there's an antiproton.
For every electron, there's a positron. For

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:17.460
every neutron, an antineutron. Within them,
are quarks and their twins, the antiquarks.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:23.880
As Dirac saw it, the electron and the positron
are mirror images of each other. With all

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.880
the same properties, they would behave in
exactly the same way whether in realms of

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.250
matter or antimatter.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:44.510
In his Nobel Prize lecture in 1933, Dirac
pondered a larger reality for antimatter.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:50.490
"If we accept," he said, "the view of complete
symmetry between positive and negative electric

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.710
charge so far as concerns the fundamental
laws of Nature, we must regard it rather as

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:03.360
an accident that the Earth (and presumably
the whole solar system), contains a preponderance

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.730
of negative electrons and positive protons.
It is quite possible that for some of the

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:15.720
stars it is the other way about, these stars
being built up mainly of positrons and negative

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.279
protons."

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:26.260
Just the year before, the physicist Carl Anderson
had confirmed the existence of antimatter

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.770
by shooting gamma rays at atoms, creating
electron-positron pairs.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:43.291
It became clear, though, that ours is a matter
universe. The Apollo astronauts went to the

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:49.870
moon and back, never once getting annihilated.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.860
Solar cosmic rays proved to be matter, not
antimatter.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:12:01.180
Traveling to every corner of the solar system,
our probes have not encountered any objects

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.930
made of antimatter.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:11.440
Cosmic rays from the Milky Way are overwhelmingly
matter.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.070
If there any large concentrations in nearby
galaxies or galaxy clusters, we should see

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:24.120
gamma rays produced when particles and antiparticles
found each other.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.029
It stands to reason, too, that when the universe
was more tightly packed, that it would have

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:34.589
experienced an "annihilation catastrophe"
that cleared the universe of large chunks

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:37.779
of the stuff.

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:43.070
Unless antimatter somehow became separated
from its twin at birth and exists beyond our

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:54.960
field of view, scientists are left to wonder:
why do we live in a matter-dominated universe?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.000
Dirac's "symmetrical" view of matter and antimatter,
which saw them as equivalent, collapsed three

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.790
decades later in 1964. The American physicists
James Cronin and Val Fitch examined the decay

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.180
of a particle called a kaon to its antiparticle
twin.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:22.550
They found that the transformation back to
normal matter did not occur with the same

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:28.900
probability. That would suggest there must
be small differences in the physical laws

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.810
that govern matter and antimatter.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:40.290
To find out exactly what makes them different,
or asymmetrical, would be a big step toward

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:46.490
understanding how our universe took the shape
that it did.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:57.590
That's why physicists are hot on the trail
of antimatter with new technologies designed

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:05.279
to give them a closer look at this strange
substance in nature and in the lab.

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:16.120
What if there is some antimatter out there,
escapees from the mass annihilation of the

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:27.080
big bang still fleeing through the emptiness
of space?

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.780
The crew of Endeavour placed the AMS instrument
on its perch on the international space station

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:40.170
in May 2011. Since then, scientists have been
combing the data for the signatures of antimatter

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.930
particles striking its detector.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:49.190
If they manage to detect heavier elements
such as antihelium or anticarbon, that would

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:55.500
point to concentrations of antimatter in space
large enough to have formed stars, where those

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:07.620
elements are created, and suggest that symmetry
may not have been broken after all.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:14.839
Such heavier antiatoms can exist. At Brookhaven
National Lab in New York, scientists recently

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:21.100
smashed gold atoms together at nearly the
speed of light. From about a billion individual

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:29.810
collisions, its detectors recorded the presence
of 18 antihelium atoms - atoms with two antiprotons

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.730
and two antineutrons.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:44.399
The explosive potential of antimatter in this
universe has long animated the voyages of

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:50.490
science fiction. It's the fuel of choice for
getting beyond our solar system, and out to

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:55.670
the stars.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:01.060
Just to get into orbit, the space shuttle
had to be loaded up with some 15 times its

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:07.730
weight in conventional rocket fuel. The energy
contained in antimatter is orders of magnitude

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:17.030
greater. In fact, it would take just a coin-sized
portion to propel the shuttle into orbit.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:22.790
Because antimatter is so volatile in our matter-filled
universe, the challenge for scientists is

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:35.050
first to create it, then to hold it for enough
time to study it, before it simply vanishes.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.810
Even as the shuttle Endeavour glided onto
land for the last time, AMS scientists were

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:46.170
beginning to filter through the rush of charged
particles in space.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:51.640
Meanwhile, scientists on the ground were beginning
their own intensive efforts to corral antimatter

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.850
in their labs.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.540
To really find out what happened in that early
epoch of annihilation, scientists will have

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.339
to understand more about the properties and
behavior of antimatter.

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:07.189
They are trying to do this at the giant European
physics lab, CERN. In a little known corner,

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:13.379
the AntiProton Deceleration Lab, a group of
scientists is showing that you can actually

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:17.299
trap and hold antimatter long enough to study
it.

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:23.689
The antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator,
that's the machine we need here at Cern, come

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:30.279
down this pipe right here. And they come into
our apparatus, which is inside this large

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:48.259
magnet. This is a very strong magnetic field
to help to confine the charged that make antihydrogen.

00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:54.059
Inside the Alpha chamber, the magnetic field
holds the particles in place and isolates

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.059
them from one another.

00:17:55.059 --> 00:18:04.020
An electric field separates the electrons
and positrons. They are then carefully brought

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:13.700
into contact. When two positrons collide,
one falls into orbit around an antiproton,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.669
forming antihydrogen.

00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:22.980
Then, the molecule is trapped by magnetic
fields, like a marble rolling around in a

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:31.710
bathtub. Now remove the bathtub, the magnetic
fields. The antimolecule smacks up against

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.460
the wall of the detector and annihilates,
emitting a shower of particles.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:42.850
So what we do is hold onto them for a thousand
seconds, then release them to make sure they

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.149
are there. That's how you do this measurement.

00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:53.379
That one thousand seconds, almost 17 minutes,
is a major accomplishment.

00:18:53.379 --> 00:19:00.380
On the atomic life scale, a thousand seconds
is forever. Things on the atomic life scale

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:07.450
are measured in nanoseconds or smaller perhaps.
So this is forever for an atom to be trapped.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:17.840
The next step is to hold onto it, see how
long can we keep it around so that we can

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.960
study it. After all, that's what we want to
do. We want to study the antimatter, compare

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.629
it to matter and see if they're the same.

00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:32.639
And by study, we mean interact with lasers
or with microwave radiation to see what their

00:19:32.639 --> 00:19:40.619
structure is inside. How do they behave? Do
they behave exactly like hydrogen?

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:46.690
Within the same Lab, the effort to pinpoint
differences is already underway. Scientists

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:55.980
working with the ASACUSA detector are trying
to measure the precise weight of an antiproton.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:03.429
These oddball molecules contain one antiproton,
which would normally inhabit the atomic nucleus.

00:20:03.429 --> 00:20:10.200
Instead, it orbits the nucleus in place of
an electron. It survives microseconds in the

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:16.970
detector, but that's enough for the scientists
to hit it with a pair of lasers. The molecule

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:23.129
blows apart on impact, and that enables them
to calculate the weight of its components.

00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:31.669
We have measured to a precision of nine digits.
And we found that the antimatter, that the

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:39.009
antiproton mass is exactly the same as the
proton mass to nine digits of precision.

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:46.600
If they find there is a difference, it's bound
to be subtle. Will it be enough to shed light

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:54.100
on why matter survived and antimatter did
not? The differences may lie much deeper in

00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:04.700
the structure of matter than we've so far
been able to go.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:10.369
Scientists are now preparing to throw a new
generation of powerful technologies at the

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:18.070
problem. At the Large Hadron Collider at CERN,
they can send atoms whipping around a 27-kilometer

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.779
tunnel and into ultra-high energy collisions.

00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:29.350
Looking at the zoo of particles that splatter
onto the walls of the detectors, they are

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:37.889
hoping to find differences between quarks
and their antiquark counterparts.

00:21:37.889 --> 00:21:43.169
One recent computer calculation performed
at Columbia University unveiled differences

00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:48.210
between quarks and antiquarks when it was
assumed that these particles interact with

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:56.440
dimensions beyond the four that define the
universe we experience. Still, its authors

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:05.049
wondered whether the differences are enough
to account for our matter-filled universe.

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:09.989
Understanding the asymmetry between matter
and antimatter is one of the most important

00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:19.269
quests in modern cosmology, because it would
help expand, or perhaps even challenge, aspects

00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:24.039
of the Standard Model.

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:30.450
The clash of these opposite forms in the early
universe harks back to William Blake's poem:

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:40.070
"What immortal hand or eye could frame thy
fearful symmetry?"

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:48.830
We now ask: what, in the chaotic birth of
time and space, could break nature's symmetry

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.710
and set our universe in motion?

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.770
