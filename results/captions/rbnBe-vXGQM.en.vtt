00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:20.917
I read a recent survey, and the title was,
"Survey on American Fears,"

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:26.297
and what Americans fear most
is public speaking and dying.

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:28.287
In other words, my TEDx talk.

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:29.817
(Laughter)

00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:33.517
If that weren't tough enough,
tonight's topic is illumination,

00:00:33.518 --> 00:00:37.637
and the question is really:
can dying be illuminating?

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:42.457
What we know of dying is based on
what we have observed as witnesses.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:46.457
We have all seen grim,
physiological decline and suffering,

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:49.307
and we've all felt profound loss.

00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:52.247
So, if there is light
within the darkness of dying,

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:55.457
it's in the experience
not in the observing.

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:57.347
So tonight, I'm going to share with you

00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:00.177
the words and experience
of dying patients.

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:03.677
And my hope is that you hear
what I have heard:

00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:06.667
the dying often describing
their end of life

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:08.877
in ways that are actually life-affirming,

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:13.227
and rich with meaning,
love, and even grace.

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:16.047
Before I go any further, I need
to give a few disclaimers.

00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:19.787
If it looks like I cannot stand still
and I'm pacing, it's because it's true.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:20.857
(Laughter)

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:25.167
The second is that, aside from my mother,

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.807
nobody has ever described me

00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:29.538
as particularly spiritual
or for that matter, enlightened.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.078
And trust me, this talk has nothing
to do with the paranormal.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.018
A much harder truth for me
is that I have a deep aversion

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:41.051
to the non-physical,
spiritual aspects of dying

00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:43.511
that goes back to my childhood.

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:48.061
On August 6, 1974, I was 12 years old,

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:52.672
and I was standing over the bed
of my dying father, who was 42.

00:01:53.852 --> 00:01:55.281
As he lay in there,

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.551
he reached out and started
playing with my buttons on my shirt,

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.051
and he said we had to hurry;
we had to catch a plane.

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:04.251
We were going to go up north
and fish like we had before.

00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:07.221
And that was the last time I saw him.

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:11.001
My point here is
I didn't choose this topic of dying;

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.111
I feel it has chosen or followed me
throughout my life,

00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:16.642
personally and professionally.

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:20.481
Like my father, I became a doctor.

00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:23.451
This may sound strange,
but if you have an aversion to dying,

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:26.211
medical schools are
a pretty safe place to be.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:30.721
They never mention dying,
let alone the experiencing of it.

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:33.981
Medical training is learning
how to defy death,

00:02:33.982 --> 00:02:38.571
and when you can't defy it,
you deny it, in whole or in part.

00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:40.711
This approach to medicine worked for me

00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:44.011
when I was doing things
like working in emergency rooms.

00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:46.805
But in 1999, through a series
of unusual events,

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:49.445
I ended up at this place called hospice.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.975
At hospice, the curative science

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:55.685
has not only failed the patient
but has abandoned the doctor

00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:58.775
who is, eventually,
compelled to be present.

00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:01.585
And when I was present
at the bedside of the dying,

00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:03.705
I was confronted by what I had seen

00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:06.735
and tried so hard
to forget from my childhood.

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:09.705
I saw dying patients
reaching and calling out

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.435
to mothers, and to fathers,
and to children,

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:15.735
many of whom hadn't been seen
for many years.

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:20.096
But what was remarkable was
that so many of them looked at peace.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.255
In April of 1999,

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:26.495
I was in the room of a patient
I was particularly fond of.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:28.505
Her name was Mary.

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:32.645
She was nearing the end of her life,
and her four children were also present.

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:37.265
One day, Mary starts cradling
a baby that nobody can see.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:41.395
She refers to him as Danny
- a reference nobody understands.

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:44.605
The next day, Mary's sister
arrives from out of town,

00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:49.766
and explains that Danny was, actually,
Mary's first child, who was stillborn.

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:51.575
The loss was so deep

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:54.835
that Mary was unable
to speak of it during her life.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:58.725
Yet, while dying,
this indescribable loss returns to her

00:03:58.726 --> 00:04:02.836
in some manner of tangible warmth
and tangible love.

00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:05.946
Mary, like so many dying patients,

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:08.696
had physical wounds
that could not be cured,

00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:11.637
yet her spiritual wounds
were [being] tended to.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:15.722
A few weeks later, I went and saw
a young man named Tom.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:19.562
I came out to the nurse's station,
and I said, "I think Tom has more time

00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:22.372
if we just give him some IV antibiotics
and some IV fluids."

00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:23.862
Without so much as looking up,

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:26.603
a nurse named Nancy
says, "Nope, he's dying."

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:27.883
I say, "Why?"

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:30.323
She says, "Because he's seeing
his deceased mother."

00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:33.153
I say, "I don't remember
that class from medical school!"

00:04:33.154 --> 00:04:36.494
She says, "Son,
you missed a lot of classes!"

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:38.053
Anyways...

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:39.623
(Laughter)

00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:41.483
Tom ends up dying.

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:43.803
What Nancy knew that I did not know

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.544
was that Tom's end-of-life
experiences had meaning.

00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:48.664
They were significant,
and not just to him,

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:51.524
but to those of us
entrusted with his care.

00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:53.734
So, if I were to have any worth,

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:56.604
I needed to understand, I needed to learn.

00:04:56.605 --> 00:05:00.534
I learned that end-of-life experiences are
the subjective experiences of the dying

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:04.065
and often refer to
pre-death dreams and visions.

00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:08.775
Such experiences have been reported
throughout history and across cultures.

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:13.534
They are mentioned in the Bible,
Plato's "Republic", Shakespeare.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:16.584
In our culture, the richest
and most thoughtful discussions

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.854
have always come from the humanities
and never medicine

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:22.775
but from poets, playwrights,
and philosophers.

00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:24.890
These observers have commented

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.990
that end-of-life experiences
are so frequent

00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:30.920
they are essentially intrinsic
to the process of dying.

00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:35.660
They're characterized
as real, intense, meaningful;

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:41.641
provide comfort, insight, and in so doing,
help alleviate the fear of dying.

00:05:42.784 --> 00:05:45.023
So why does medicine has so little to say

00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:48.633
about something that's so meaningful,
and actually, potentially therapeutic,

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:52.253
not just for the patient
but for the patient's loved ones?

00:05:52.254 --> 00:05:53.234
In part,

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:57.683
it's because end-of-life experiences
can easily be dismissed as confusion.

00:05:57.684 --> 00:05:58.873
And it's true;

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:03.004
many dying patients experience confusion
as they go through the process.

00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:04.493
However,

00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:09.664
in contrast to patients' experience
with end-of-life dreams and visions,

00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:12.657
confused patients are detached.

00:06:12.658 --> 00:06:14.266
They have disorganized thinking.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:16.536
They're unable to figure out
their surroundings,

00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:20.516
and they are more often than not
terribly agitated and anxious.

00:06:20.517 --> 00:06:24.757
The distinction is best [understood]
by listening to a patient.

00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:28.866
The patient you are about to see
in this video - her name is Jeanne -

00:06:28.867 --> 00:06:32.505
was nearing the end of her life;
and she has since passed.

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:33.935
(Video starts)

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:36.225
Jeanne: I was lying in bed,

00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:40.796
and people were walking,
very slowly, by me.

00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:45.871
The right hand side, I didn't know,
but they were all very friendly,

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:51.662
and they touched my arm
or my hand when they went by.

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:54.691
But the other side,

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:55.991
were people that I knew.

00:06:55.992 --> 00:07:00.352
My mom and dad were there, my uncle;

00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:05.621
Everybody I knew
that was dead was there.

00:07:05.622 --> 00:07:08.281
And they passed and did the same thing.

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:09.931
I thought it was a good dream,

00:07:09.932 --> 00:07:15.271
but boy, I remember seeing
every piece of their face.

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:19.621
I mean, I know that was my mom and dad,
and uncle, and my brother-in-law.

00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:24.002
I have seen my mother, recently, more.

00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:28.691
Interviewer: How do you feel
when you see her?

00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:31.362
Jeanne: Oh...! Wonderful!

00:07:32.302 --> 00:07:37.002
I can't say that my mother and I
got along all those years,

00:07:37.262 --> 00:07:40.096
but we made up for it, at the end.

00:07:40.097 --> 00:07:41.587
(Video ends)

00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:45.296
Christopher Kerr: Jeanne isn't confused,

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:48.176
and it would be dehumanizing her
to label her as such.

00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:50.832
But she shows us so much more.

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.982
She shows us that dying is this paradox:

00:07:52.983 --> 00:07:54.532
she is physically declining,

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:56.282
yet, emotionally and spiritually,

00:07:56.283 --> 00:07:59.282
she's vivid; she's alive,
and she's present.

00:07:59.283 --> 00:08:03.282
End-of-life experiences are not only
tied to our personal meanings

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:05.602
but they are tied
to some of our greatest needs:

00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:09.713
the need to love, to be loved,
nurtured, forgiven.

00:08:10.643 --> 00:08:14.612
End-of-life experiences
also represent a rich inter-connectivity

00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:16.512
between body and soul,

00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:19.802
between the realities we know,
and those we don't,

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:22.652
between our past and our present.

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:24.792
But most importantly,

00:08:24.793 --> 00:08:28.012
end-of-life experiences
represent continuity

00:08:28.013 --> 00:08:32.373
between and across lives,
both living and dead,

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:37.322
so that mothers like Mary
can hold their long-deceased children,

00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:38.772
and children like Jeanne

00:08:38.773 --> 00:08:43.043
can be reunited and comforted
by their long-deceased mothers.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.632
So, again, the question:

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:49.652
why are the words of the dying
not worthier of our consideration?

00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:51.752
I don't have all of the answer,

00:08:51.753 --> 00:08:55.142
but it's true we live in a time
where seeing is believing,

00:08:55.143 --> 00:09:00.033
and where data and evidence are requisites
for both understanding and acceptance.

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:04.422
Unfortunately, when it comes
to end-of-life experiences,

00:09:04.423 --> 00:09:07.482
most of the reports were based
on anecdotal reporting.

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:10.682
In other words, nobody
had asked patients directly

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:13.152
or attempted to quantify or measure.

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:14.403
So that's what we've done,

00:09:14.404 --> 00:09:18.254
and to date, we have
over 1,400 interviews with dying patients.

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:19.827
In our first study,

00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:23.510
we spoke with 66 patients
every day, until their death,

00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:26.110
and gathered 450 interviews.

00:09:26.111 --> 00:09:28.590
What we found was
a vast majority, over 80%,

00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:31.400
reported at least
one pre-death dream and vision,

00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:36.660
described as more real than real,
and distinct from normal dreaming.

00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.760
The next question is:
what were they dreaming of?

00:09:39.761 --> 00:09:45.070
We found out that 72%
dreamed of the deceased:

00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:47.620
family, relatives, or pets,

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:50.950
59% of this theme of going
or preparing to go [somewhere],

00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:56.111
29% of the living, and 28%
of past meaningful experiences.

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.561
So the next question was this:

00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.820
did different dream content provide
different levels of comfort?

00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:07.900
Here's comfort on a zero to five scale,
with five being the highest.

00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:09.520
And of all the dream types,

00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:14.011
seeing the deceased was associated
with the greatest degree of comfort.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.171
The next question was:

00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:18.850
were there changes over time

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:23.200
in either the content or frequency
of dreaming as patients approached death?

00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:24.890
Essentially, the Nancy question;

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:29.320
could you almost predict death
based on changes of these variables?

00:10:29.321 --> 00:10:31.460
Of course, again, Nancy's right.

00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:35.740
Frequency is on the y-axis,
weeks before death are on the x-axis.

00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:37.640
As patients approach death,

00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:40.590
they've a dramatic increase
in the frequency of their dreaming.

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.606
They are dreaming,
specifically, of the deceased,

00:10:43.607 --> 00:10:46.767
which is associated with
the greatest comfort.

00:10:47.077 --> 00:10:50.366
So, the next question we wanted
to ask in our next study

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:53.787
was what did these mean to the dreamer?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.116
Were there common themes?
Were there common meanings?

00:10:57.117 --> 00:11:00.526
The most common theme
was that of a comforting presence.

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:04.496
Seeing the dead or seeing the living
was overwhelmingly positive

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:09.206
provided a sense of reunion,
and the feeling that one was not alone.

00:11:09.207 --> 00:11:11.956
Maggie, for example, was in her 80s.

00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:16.176
She had been harmed greatly
by a childhood friend, later in life.

00:11:16.177 --> 00:11:17.556
And before she dies,

00:11:17.557 --> 00:11:20.886
she dreams of this friend,
who comes back to her and says,

00:11:20.887 --> 00:11:25.937
"Sorry, you are a good person.
If you need help, just call my name."

00:11:26.898 --> 00:11:29.068
Kenny was 88 years old.

00:11:29.748 --> 00:11:31.757
He lost his mother as a child.

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:34.497
And before he dies,
he dreams he's a child again.

00:11:34.498 --> 00:11:39.618
He is in his mother's kitchen,
and he says, "I smell her perfume,"

00:11:39.848 --> 00:11:42.858
and hears her soothing
voice say, "I love you!"

00:11:43.678 --> 00:11:46.877
Sandy was raised by her sister Emily.

00:11:46.878 --> 00:11:51.507
And before she passes, Emily returns
to her in a dream and says,

00:11:51.508 --> 00:11:54.038
"Remember what I taught you."

00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:57.377
Many patients reported
seeing the presence of others,

00:11:57.378 --> 00:12:00.247
and they're described
as simply being there, watching.

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:03.217
Little is said, but much is understood.

00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:05.537
This next video is Paul.

00:12:05.538 --> 00:12:07.477
Paul has a terminal illness.

00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:09.777
In fact, he dies three weeks
after this video.

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:12.097
But he's talking about his deceased wife.

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.242
(Video starts)

00:12:13.243 --> 00:12:15.402
Paul: I dream in color, most times.

00:12:15.403 --> 00:12:18.972
And she always wears
a beautiful light blue.

00:12:18.973 --> 00:12:22.732
It could be a suit.
It could be a gown. It could be a dress.

00:12:22.733 --> 00:12:24.602
But it's always light blue.

00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:28.702
A couple of times, she's giving me
the little beauty pageant wave.

00:12:28.703 --> 00:12:31.932
And a couple of times, she, sort of,
greets... always with a smile.

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:35.460
Only once or twice
have I ever heard her voice.

00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:37.840
She always lets me know that she's fine.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.242
I get that feeling
after a dream like that.

00:12:40.243 --> 00:12:42.092
(Video ends)

00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:46.152
CK: As I said, 60% dreamed
of this theme of travel.

00:12:46.153 --> 00:12:49.162
Jimmy sees many deceased
friends and relatives and says,

00:12:49.163 --> 00:12:51.622
"I haven't seen
some of these people in years.

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:54.523
I know we are going somewhere,
but I don't know where."

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:59.066
Others dreamed of the deceased
just there, waiting for them.

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:03.356
Sarah says, "There were six dead
family members in my room waiting for me.

00:13:03.357 --> 00:13:05.297
It's good to see them."

00:13:05.747 --> 00:13:08.276
Less frequently, people
had distressing dreams.

00:13:08.277 --> 00:13:11.926
These are often relived, past,
traumatic events, such as war.

00:13:11.927 --> 00:13:13.456
And here again is Paul.

00:13:13.457 --> 00:13:14.496
(Video starts)

00:13:14.497 --> 00:13:18.576
Paul: Another thing I've dreamed of
quite often, not lately,

00:13:18.577 --> 00:13:21.050
is I'm back in the service.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.920
I'm at Fort Devens up in Massachusetts,

00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:28.891
where they were forming this company
we were going to oversee; a new company.

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:34.071
The guys are all young. They're like...
I remember them! And I am old.

00:13:34.072 --> 00:13:35.531
And I'm trying to tell them,

00:13:35.532 --> 00:13:39.981
"Guys! I've been here. I've done this.
I'm not going to do it again!"

00:13:39.982 --> 00:13:41.881
And they're arguing with me!

00:13:41.882 --> 00:13:43.062
(Video ends)

00:13:43.063 --> 00:13:44.163
(Laughter)

00:13:45.063 --> 00:13:49.412
CK: I have the deep privilege
of hearing many people's life stories

00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:52.992
which tend to emerge
or come to surface at the end of life.

00:13:52.993 --> 00:13:57.502
Sometimes, I'm saddened by the amount
of trauma and tragedy people have endured.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.402
But more often, I'm inspired

00:13:59.403 --> 00:14:01.642
by the strength of the human spirit,

00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:05.602
and its endless quest to heal
what is harmed, and what is broken.

00:14:05.603 --> 00:14:08.263
And this brings me to the story of Mack.

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.956
I met Mack in 2011.

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:16.755
When I walked into his room and started
to talk to ask him what was wrong,

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:21.096
he gave me three words, and he said,
"A war problem."

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:26.125
His family explained that Mack never spoke
about the war, but in the last few weeks,

00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:29.605
he was unable to close his eyes
without reliving the horror.

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:33.815
He couldn't sleep that's why
he was coming into our facility.

00:14:33.816 --> 00:14:36.815
Mac went on to explain
that he was a World War II vet.

00:14:36.816 --> 00:14:41.605
He was very proud to be from Texas
and serve on the USS Texas.

00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:46.796
At the age of 17, he was involved in
the invasion of Normandy, in June, 1944.

00:14:47.622 --> 00:14:51.891
He was a gunner on a landing craft
that went from the ship to the shore.

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:55.521
But his nightmares were about
the return from the shore to the ship.

00:14:55.522 --> 00:14:59.781
Because that's when he was
transporting the dead and the dying.

00:14:59.782 --> 00:15:03.761
He called these nightmares
terrifying and realistic.

00:15:03.762 --> 00:15:08.262
He says, "There is nothing but death...
dead soldiers all around me."

00:15:09.285 --> 00:15:11.224
A few days later,

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:13.674
Mack was completely transformed.

00:15:13.675 --> 00:15:17.114
He looked comfortable
and at peace. He could sleep.

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:22.744
He said the horrifying dream had quieted,
and in its place were two types of dreams.

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:25.644
There were comforting dreams
and neutral dreams.

00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:28.394
In the comforting dreams,
he gets to relive the day

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:31.755
he got his discharge papers
from the military.

00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:37.564
In the neutral dream, a dead soldier
comes up to him on a beach.

00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:40.794
He doesn't know who he is, and he says,

00:15:40.795 --> 00:15:45.585
"Soon, they, your fellow soldiers,
are going to come and get you."

00:15:46.295 --> 00:15:50.874
Mack was rescued by the dead soldiers
he had tried so hard to save.

00:15:50.875 --> 00:15:53.984
He had closure. He could close
his eyes. He could rest.

00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:57.555
He died peacefully,
and he died with his dignity.

00:15:58.306 --> 00:16:00.005
But just think about it.

00:16:00.006 --> 00:16:05.915
The human spirit and that courageous
17-year-old boy fought for 67 years

00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:08.385
to be free, to be released

00:16:08.386 --> 00:16:11.565
from that enormous obligation,
from that pain,

00:16:11.566 --> 00:16:14.155
from that horrible injustice.

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:19.445
His end-of-life experiences didn't deny
his reality, didn't deny him his war,

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:21.905
but it recast it in such a way

00:16:21.906 --> 00:16:24.876
that he was finally granted
his hard-earned peace.

00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:27.385
I want to end where I began:

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:30.825
my hope was that you'd hear
what I have heard from the dying.

00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:32.895
Their words are compelling and relevant.

00:16:32.896 --> 00:16:35.105
And I hope they leave open the possibility

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:38.675
that there is light
within the darkness of dying.

00:16:38.676 --> 00:16:40.756
Look back on your own life.

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:43.555
Think of your greatest loss,

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:46.846
your greatest comfort,
and your greatest wonder

00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:49.567
- loss of someone you loved,

00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:54.078
the familiar, warm hug of a grandparent,
the birth of a child.

00:16:54.738 --> 00:16:58.207
What if, at the end of your life,
at some appointed hour,

00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:00.077
the lost return,

00:17:00.078 --> 00:17:04.008
distant feelings become familiar,
and meaning is restored?

00:17:04.238 --> 00:17:07.309
If any of that is true,
then dying is illuminating.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.519
Thank you.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.700
(Applause)
