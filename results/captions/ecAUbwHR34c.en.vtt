(gentle music)

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.570
- Hi, I'm Dr. Christiane Northrup,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990
an Ob/Gyn physician and authority

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.970
on everything that can
go right with your body.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.590
And I'm here to tell you
how to transform your health

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.440
and truly flourish while
making your life easy.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.910
Insulin resistance has
become a huge problem

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.610
in our culture, and it
can lead to many of the

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.600
chronic health problems we see everyday

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.360
including obesity, type 2
diabetes, heart disease,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.170
and polycystic ovary syndrome.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.890
It's also linked to high blood pressure,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.890
high cholesterol, thyroid
problems, muscle loss, fat gain,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.610
fatty liver, and also breast,
endometrial, and other cancers

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.130
and insulin resistance
has even been implicated

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.680
in Alzheimer's disease
which is sometimes called

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.350
type 3 diabetes.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.960
In addition, did you know
that insulin resistance

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.500
can also cause many of the
symptoms that most women

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.630
attribute to menopause.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.180
In this video, I'm going to share with you

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.130
how you can reverse insulin resistance.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.850
First, what is insulin resistance?

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.790
You need to understand what insulin is

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.600
to know what insulin resistance is.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020
Insulin is a hormone
made by your pancreas,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.490
it's a storage hormone,
it stores sugar as fat.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.260
We always have low circulating
levels in our bodies.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
But when insulin is out of
balance and you have too much,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.200
it has a cascading effect
on all of your hormones.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.700
The result is abnormal blood sugar.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.560
High insulin levels can
make you feel tired,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.090
bloated, and cause sugar cravings.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.050
The more insulin you have
circulating in your body

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.030
the harder it becomes to
lose weight and burn fat,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.400
it kind of locks it into place.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.350
Insulin resistance occurs when

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.690
insulin is released by the pancreas

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.640
but your body doesn't know
how to use it properly.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.210
It causes blood sugar levels to stay high

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.500
instead of going down
into the normal range.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.550
This can occur if you
consistently eat too many

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.010
of the wrong kind of carbohydrates

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.780
or if you're under a lot of stress.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.520
Now, these are the risk factors

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.000
for developing insulin resistance.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.060
Some include a family history of diabetes,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.530
gestational diabetes,
an apple shape that's

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.340
more weight around your upper,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.200
your shoulders and your middle,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.910
polycystic ovarian syndrome,
a diet high in refined

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.090
carbohydrates, a sedentary lifestyle,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.860
a body mass index greater than 29,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.860
the use of antidepressants,
especially the SSRIs like Prozac

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.230
or the use of steroid
medications like Prednisone.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.550
Also, holding onto fear
and anger will produce

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.240
some of those hormonal changes

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.650
and when held on too
long, these things create,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.340
these emotions create chemical reactions

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.480
that do not support your health.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.190
So how to tell if you're
insulin resistant?

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.890
First, this is easy, find
your waist-hip ratio.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.130
Measure your hips at the widest part

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.770
and then your natural waist.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.090
Divide the waist measurement
by the hip measurement.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.463
For women the ratio should
be no more than 0.8,

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:29.275
the greater it is,

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.140
the greater the risk
for insulin resistance.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.140
For men, the ratio is 1.0.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.770
Also get your fasting blood glucose done

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.010
and a fasting insulin test,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.790
your doctor can order these.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.620
You should fast for 12 hours
then get the blood drawn.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.800
Then eat a meal, and get
the second blood drawn.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.500
This is called the glucose tolerance test.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.100
Your fasting blood glucose

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.480
of 100 to a 125 milligrams per deciliter

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.030
is considered, even though it's normal,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.000
it's in the pre-diabetes range.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.530
And you're heading toward
insulin resistance.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.750
Your fasting insulin should be under

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.380
five micro units per milliliter.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.680
Also get your cholesterol checked.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.680
Low HDL indicates the beginning
of insulin resistance.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.720
Also do a skin check.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.750
Those darkened patches,
those little skin tags,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.090
those indicate insulin resistance.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.930
You can look for this on your neck,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.840
elbows, knees and armpits

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.160
and the skin tags can also
be associated, as I said,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.460
with insulin resistance,
because it's a growth hormone.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.920
Now, how to reverse insulin resistance,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.010
'cause that's what you wanna do.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.980
There are so many things
you can do to reverse it,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.860
it's not a sentence.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.180
You can lose weight, easier said than done

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.427
but we'll get into that,

00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:53.210
you body can better respond to insulin

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.230
when you decrease your total body fat.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.150
See if a low carbohydrate,
moderate protein,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.770
moderate fat diet works for you.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.270
Jason Fung, F-U-N-G has
done great research on this,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.790
he's an expert on intermittent fasting,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.340
now let me tell you how to do that.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.740
Intermittent fasting just
means going 12 hours every day

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.090
without eating.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.720
You know how easy that is?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.860
So, that's a fast.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.500
As you get good at it, you
can stop eating at night

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.650
after your last meal and then not eat

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.470
until noon the next day.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.800
That will lower insulin,
'cause if 12 hour,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.310
it takes 12 hours to bring
your insulin level to zero

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.350
and when your insulin level is zero,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.330
you starting burn fat as fuel,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.820
and that's what you wanna do.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.700
Another tip is eat only until full,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.630
usually takes 20 minutes for your satiety

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.500
to register in your brain.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.310
So eat more slowly.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.530
Many people don't know how it
feels and eat past satiety,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.053
particularly if they're under stress.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.330
This is a big one and
I want you to try it,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.370
'cause it can be very easy.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.210
Don't eat between meals.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.380
Begin to notice how often you snack,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.720
because, again, you've got to bring your

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.730
insulin level down and you do that by

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.820
just not eating between meals.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.240
You'll get good at that
but I want you to notice

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.160
how many times you reach for a snack,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.670
it's usually just to respond to stress

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.510
or the food is around.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.440
Then, release unwanted emotions.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.280
This can do wonders for
losing unwanted pounds.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.270
I've seen women lose ten
pounds after a good cry.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.810
I'm not kidding.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.260
The other thing is, move your body.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.150
Being sedentary is a risk factor
for so many health problems

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.130
and regularly exercise adds
seven years to your life.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.970
So just start by walking.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.340
And then you can do cardio, you know,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.800
on an elliptical trainer,
resistance training,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.300
stretching, basic
prescription is 30 minutes

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.450
three to five times per week.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.520
That could mean running
in place and dancing

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.070
while you're watching TV.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.210
But don't over-exercise.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.870
I see so many women at the gym
that are not losing weight,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.560
and they're over-exercising,
and it's increasing

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.520
their cortisol and their stress,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.460
which increases insulin, and then

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.160
it locks the fat into place.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.240
So that doesn't work either.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.360
You also need to get enough sleep.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.240
When you lose sleep, your levels
of the appetite-stimulating

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.470
hormone, ghrelin, increase.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.440
And that can stimulate cortisol production

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.330
and decrease your ability to burn

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.660
your blood sugar as fuel.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.330
Even one night of sleep deprivation

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.040
can increase insulin
resistance by up to 33%,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.820
which is why shift workers

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.290
often have problems losing weight.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.708
So you need to reduce
stress, which you can do

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:52.370
just with breathing through your nose,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.320
doing a little meditation,
taking a daily nap,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.320
because remember, consistently
elevated levels of cortisol

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.500
from stress can lead to high blood sugar,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.230
weight gain, and
diabetes, even when you're

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.260
not eating too much.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.890
So you may wanna get a cortisol test,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.370
it's called a Dutch
test, and that measures

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.453
your cortisol throughout the day.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.350
Try walking in nature.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.350
Do meditation, yoga, or read a great book.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.190
And say goodbye to bad habits,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.760
that would be alcohol and smoking,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.260
and by the way, I know
that those bad habits

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.060
are helping you to deal with emotions

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.650
but I want you to deal with them directly.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.040
