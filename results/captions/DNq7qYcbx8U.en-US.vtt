5 Real Kids With Superpowers
Hi guys! When you re a kid you always sort

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.710
of want to have some super awesome superpower
like invisibility or immortality or maybe

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.019
you wanna be capable of throwing flames. Whatever
your favorite superpower may be there are

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.290
real kids out there and they have some truly
unbelievable abilities. And while scientists

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.200
are trying to figure out how come these kids
are so different let’s take a look at five

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:36.640
real kids with superpowers!
1. Liam Hoekstra

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.460
As you know physical abilities of little babies
are very limited. All they do is crying and

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.720
making those jerking movements. But not so
long ago a very unusual baby was born in US.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.190
You might say he s a real little Hercules.
After doctors run a few tests, it appeared

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.820
that this little guy has an unusual genetic
disorder. It turned out it has to do with

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.000
the lack of myostatin function, which results
in the excessive growth of skeletal muscle.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.580
But what s also weird is that with this disorder
you almost don’t get any fatter. You just

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.150
stay fit naturally.
When Liam was 5 month he already had an incredible

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.810
physic of a real gymnast. At 8 month he did
pull-ups. When he was 3 years old 40 percent

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.160
of his body was muscles without any signs
of fat, which is pretty incredible for a boy

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.909
of his age. If you think about it Liam is
a very lucky guy because he can eat whatever

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.530
he likes. No matter how much fat food contains,
our boy Liam can eat as much as he likes and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.450
he won’t get any fatter!
If this guy wanted to sit on the couch all

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.310
day and eating chips and burgers he could
do that without worrying about staying lean

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.100
in the middle! That’s impressive! Would
you guys like to be the same as Liam?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.439
2. Ivan Stolkovich – Croatian magnet-boy
that’s what they called him after he managed

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.060
to magnetize the 20 kilos dumbbell. He looks
like an ordinary boy. He likes agricultural

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.040
machinery and helping parents but his body
creates a very strong magnetic field. Ivan

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.290
can magnetize almost any metal object: spoons,
phones, frying pans, anything. All these objects

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.139
are moving around Ivan in a way that is most
peculiar. It almost feels like Ivan can be

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.739
in a total control of the cutlery if he pleases.
So I guess you don’t want to be near when

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.750
he s in a kitchen and he s angry. His parents
say that he also has powerful senses of healing

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.050
and what’s more is that he cures and understands
animals. Of course, all parents want to feel

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.659
like their children are special but that s
a bit over the top. Did you guys ever tried

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.180
to magnetize anything? I think I made a spoon
move a little one time! Press the like button

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.019
guys, pause the video and try doing the same,
who knows, maybe you re the one who s got

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.299
superpowers!
3. Deepak Jangra

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.620
I bet y`all remember Marvel's Electro. The
character was electric and could pass through

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.159
insane amounts of electricity. We live in
a very diverse world guys and there is a real

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.840
guy, his name`s Deepak Jangra and this dude
can withstand the voltage that exceeds the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.510
lethal rate 22 times! He became aware of his
powers accidentally. One day Deepak`s mom

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.099
asked him to fix the socket and while fixing
it Deepak accidently created a short circuit

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.419
but somehow nothing at all happened to Deepack,
he was right as rain, he didn’t feel none

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.450
of it! Till this day Deepack continues to
experiment with his incredible abilities and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.030
already reached 11 000 volt! And for your
information that s enough to supply a couple

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.879
of city blocks! And Deepak seems fine and
he s planning to continue experimenting with

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:04.430
his unusual powers. Lets pray for our man
Deepak one time. I hope he ll be alright.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.439
4. Megamind Elise Tan-Roberts
Albert Einstein is the greatest physicist

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.669
that ever was I think we all agree. After
all he s the man who managed to overcome the

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:22.600
stagnation point in physics and he s the guy
with the heist IQ – 160 points. Now check

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.060
this out: Elise Tan-Roberts was only 2 years
old when she got pretty close to Einstein

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.440
with 156 IQ points. This super girl started
talking when she was only 5 month. When she

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.370
was 1.5 year old she already knew all the
capitals. At the age of 2 she joined Mensa

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.000
International - the largest and oldest high
IQ society in the world. Elise is 10 now and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.970
she lives an ordinary life pretty much like
all teenagers she likes dancing a lot and

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.950
she s still interested in science. Her parents
do everything they can to help their gifted

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.680
child develop her talents to the fullest capacity.
5. Nong Youhui is a Chinese boy. But he s

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.970
not just any boy, unlike other Chinese people
Nong Youhui`s eyes are not black but blue.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.910
But that’s not all, whats really weird is
that this boy`s eyes are glowing in the dark,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.490
just like cat`s eyes. His parents were very
confused and bothered by this fact and they

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.010
decided to check up with doctors. It turned
out that Nong can see in the dark. He can

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.470
read books in almost total darkness! And during
the day he sees things just like all ordinary

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.930
people. Doctors say that this is because the
boy has a thin layer of cells immediately

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.750
behind the retina called tapetum lucidum.
So basically the boy is extra sensitive to

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.720
light. Doctors said that sooner or later the
boy`s eyes will become normal but it seems

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.180
like it didn’t happened just yet.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.830
Tell me guys which one of these superpowers
would you like to have? Mabe there are other

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.390
superpowers you fancy? Anyway that s all for
now folks! If you like this video, share it

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.750
with your friends and subscribe if you haven’t
