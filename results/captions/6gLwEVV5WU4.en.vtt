00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.800
- Do you think you can
become a millionaire?

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.500
Well, I think you can.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.308
So keep watching and find out how.

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:09.891
(upbeat music)

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.663
- Well, hey you guys.

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:24.430
I am so excited about today's show.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.830
We are going to talk
all about millionaires.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.767
That's right, millionaires.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:30.680
It's a pretty fun topic.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.400
So we're gonna have my friend,
Chris Hogan, to come on,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.930
and he is a financial expert,
and he is now an expert

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.430
in this space.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.270
He has some really fun stuff going on

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.293
and I can't wait for you
to hear all about it.

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:45.000
We're actually gonna
bring on a guest as well

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.130
and talk to her and hear her story

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.147
about how she is building wealth.

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.650
So, you hear "wealth."

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.453
Like I'm saying that word
a lot, and you're probably,

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.290
in your minds, thinking stereotypically,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.690
what "wealth" or what a
"millionaire" looks like.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.260
And probably what I think
of sometimes, right?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.850
You see a millionaire.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.280
We'll say exhibit A.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.120
This is Lauren.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.580
I'm gonna just call her Lauren.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.265
I have no idea who she
is, but she looks awesome.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:10.110
And you probably have seen a Lauren

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.100
maybe on Instagram, or maybe in your life,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.806
you have a Lauren. And
Lauren and her husband

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:18.350
do really well. They drive awesome cars.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.000
They go snow-skiing every summer.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.910
They go to the beach twice
a year with their family.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.300
You know, they're making
together like $250,000 a year.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.420
They just bought a house
that was worth like $2 million.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.300
I mean, just, she's rich.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.800
You would look at Lauren and be like,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.125
"Yeah, y'all are doing really well.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:38.581
You're rich, yeah."

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:41.033
Then, you see Jane.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:42.709
I'm calling her Jane.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.432
I saw her picture earlier
and I was like she's a Jane.

00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:47.500
Super sweet. Like Jane's great, right?

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.680
But like, you know, her
clothes are pretty average.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.610
They drive used cars. They
live in a pretty modest home,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.770
her and her husband.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.300
Together, they make $90,000
a year, so pretty well,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.063
but nothing like extravagant.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.540
What if I were to tell
you that actually Jane

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.100
is richer than Lauren?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.320
Here's the reality, you guys.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.550
It's called your net worth.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.670
Your net worth is what
you own minus what you owe

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.110
equals your net worth.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.810
What we don't know here about Lauren,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.660
sweet Lauren, yeah, she's
looking good on the outside,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.130
terrible on the inside.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.090
Everything is on credit cards.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.370
They have car loans.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.260
They have a mortgage.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.860
They actually put nothing down on that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.470
brand new home they
bought and you think that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.400
they probably paid cash for it.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.679
They didn't.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:35.800
They put nothing down
'cause they had nothing.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.590
They live paycheck to paycheck.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.463
They have no investment.

00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:40.296
They have no savings.

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:41.730
They are stressed out.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220
That is Lauren.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.660
Jane, Jane well, get outta here Lauren,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.088
Jane is actually amazing because

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:51.270
they have a paid for house.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.790
They just paid off their house.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.380
They have no car payments.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.160
They save for retirement.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.370
So technically, Jane's net
worth is more than Lauren's.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.797
You guys, this is like, not
what we think of, is it?

00:03:03.797 --> 00:03:06.280
Again, I keep thinking
over and over again,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.432
like we always see a picture
of someone and we automatically

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:11.445
think, "Oh, I bet they're really wealthy."

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:14.630
But the people that are actually
wealthy in America today,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.010
you don't even know who they are

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.730
because they're not on
TV and it's not all this

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.910
glitz and glam.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.368
So for you guys, not only
do I want you to get a

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:25.980
positive net worth, but I want
you to start building wealth

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.877
so that you can change your family

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:29.790
and you can change other people's lives

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150
'cause we say to live like no one else

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.520
so later, you can live
and give like no one else.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.340
I don't want you to miss this point,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.430
that debt makes you
look a whole lot better

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.844
than you actually are.

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:44.936
I learned this first in high school.

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:47.436
(light piano music)

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.112
I remember being in high
school and there was

00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:56.577
a girl I went to church with

00:03:56.577 --> 00:03:57.850
and she had a brand new car.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.200
Like when we turned 16,
it was a nice, luxury car.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.730
Brand new car. And she was
the friend that always

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.995
just had all her outfits put together.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.040
I remember we'd go out to the movies

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.470
and we all wanted to go to her house

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.770
to wear her clothes 'cause
she had the best clothes.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.600
She had amazing purses.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.240
Her house was gorgeous.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.920
It's like she had everything all the time.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.048
She was just that friend
I had in high school.

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:19.527
I remember thinking all the time,

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:20.987
"Oh my gosh, she's so rich.

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:22.478
"They have to be so rich,
they have to be so rich."

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:26.040
Well one day, we were talking
and there was a concert

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.610
coming up and so there were
a group of us at church

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.310
that wanted to go to this concert.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.170
The tickets were like a hundred bucks.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.760
So not a free concert, it was 100 bucks.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.690
So I get it, it's kind
of an expensive ticket

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.940
for a high schooler.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.140
But, that's what it was.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.973
So we all talked.

00:04:39.973 --> 00:04:41.030
"Okay, we'll go ask our parents."

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.630
The next day, we were all talking

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.217
and she said the words,

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:47.012
"Oh, my mom said we can't
afford it this month."

00:04:47.012 --> 00:04:49.420
I was like, "What?"

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.867
In my head, I was thinking like,

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:51.907
"You can't afford it?

00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:54.147
You're driving a brand new car.

00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:57.670
Your Gucci bag cost
thousands of dollars."

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.070
In my head I was like, "What do you
mean you can't afford it?"

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.700
I went home and I was
telling my parents about it

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.087
at dinner. I was
like, "Yeah, she can't go

00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:05.390
because her mom said
they couldn't afford it."

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.250
And my mom said something I'll never forget.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.097
She said, "Rachel, this
may or may not be her case,

00:05:10.097 --> 00:05:13.717
but remember. Debt makes
people look a whole lot better

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.440
than they actually are."

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.959
So you guys, that's the reality
of the world we're living in.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:20.330
Whether it's the Instagram
life you're looking at

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.980
or the fashion blogger
or the friends you have.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.970
Sometimes, the appearance
that they put on,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.570
it's not the reality.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.280
What's in their bank account is not true.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.520
What's in their investments
may not be shown

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.430
because they may not have
any 'cause they spend

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.680
everything they make.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.130
So again, building wealth,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.450
I'm gonna tell you over and over again,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.790
it's going to be boring.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.572
It may not be flashy, but in the end,

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:43.680
you're actually going to
be able to live and give

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.820
like no one else.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.030
So, that is why I'm so
excited that coming up

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.510
is Chris Hogan and we are gonna talk

00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:52.780
all about this topic of
millionaires and building wealth

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.810
because he is the expert
and he's brilliant.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.291
So, check it out.

00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.874
(upbeat music)

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.120
Alright, the time is here.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.820
The man, the myth, the legend,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.451
fellow Ramsey personality
and financial expert,

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:08.720
Chris Hogan is here.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.120
Chris, welcome.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.953
- Well, thank you.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:12.337
- So glad you're here!

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.090
- I have been waiting on my invitation.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.875
I keep hearing about The Rachel Cruze Show

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.240
and I thought maybe my
invitation got lost in the mail.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.502
- I don't believe it.

00:06:19.502 --> 00:06:20.335
If I heard that voice be like,

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:21.653
"Take me on your show," I'd
be like, "Yes, God, yes!"

00:06:21.653 --> 00:06:23.104
- Oh, listen to you. Listen to you.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.460
But no, it's fantastic.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.830
It's a beautiful set and I'm
excited to be here with you.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.200
- Well, I'm glad you're here.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.850
Chris and I have worked
together for many years now,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.683
which is awesome.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.400
Actually our desks are
right next to each other.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.110
So, I feel like I know you so well

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.910
and I know all the work you've
been doing all these years

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.980
but the work you're
doing right this minute

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.280
is really exciting and
I'm really pumped for it,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.540
and I want everyone out
there to know what's going on

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.680
because not only do you
have a new book coming out,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.070
but you did this whole research survey

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.639
all about millionaires.
And this whole episode,

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.406
we're talking about how to build wealth

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:54.993
and what does it look
like to be a millionaire,

00:06:54.993 --> 00:06:55.826
and you're the expert now.

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:56.700
You know it all!

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.080
- Well listen, we really dug in, you know?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.913
It's not just me.

00:06:59.913 --> 00:07:00.750
This is the team.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.080
So, we commissioned the
largest study that's

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.740
ever been done on millionaires.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.770
Rachel...
- Love it.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.300
- We studied over 10,000.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.460
- So, a lot of millionaires.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.328
So this is not like you
went and grabbed four people

00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:12.712
that have more wealth and you're like,

00:07:12.712 --> 00:07:13.545
"What did you do?"

00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:14.378
This is legit huge.

00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:15.380
- We didn't do a focus group

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.393
where you find 10 people.
- That's right.

00:07:16.393 --> 00:07:19.860
- No, we did a study so much
so we commissioned a company,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.400
a research firm, to help us

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.470
because we didn't just
wanna get people that know

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.970
who Dave is, who Rachel is, and Chris is.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.529
- Right, right.

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.960
We wanted to get out there
and find out the reality.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.887
Every day people.

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:30.960
What is it?
- Yes.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.720
- So, studied over 10,000 of em.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.380
I have to tell you, the
findings of the research,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.930
the stats that we have, the stories,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.360
and even the myths that we end up busting,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.980
it proves that the American dream

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.507
is still alive and well, Rachel.

00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:44.390
And it's available.
- It is!

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.810
It totally is, I love it!

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.330
So that's the thing is,
there's so many myths

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.550
around this part of our lives, right?

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.002
Because you hear "millionaire"
and you have all these

00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:53.651
thoughts of what a millionaire is.

00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:55.100
It's not always true!

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.560
Most of the time, it's not.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.840
So, we actually sent our
very own George Kamel.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.940
If you watch the Dave
Ramsey show on YouTube,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.788
George, he's a great one isn't he?

00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:03.621
- He's hilarious.

00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:04.510
- You just put him in your back pocket.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.970
I mean, he's just--

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.217
- He could fit too.

00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:08.672
- He's the greatest thing ever.

00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:10.130
George went out on the street to ask

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.260
every day people their
opinion on millionaires.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.350
So here's what they found.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.700
- Hey guys, George Kamel here.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.780
I'm in downtown Nashville to figure out

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.420
what the average person thinks

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.070
about what it takes to
become a millionaire.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.020
Let's do this.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.000
What do you think the normal careers are

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.240
of the average millionaire?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.390
- Doctors, lawyers.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.690
- Singer or movie star.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.160
- Business and investing.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.630
- Tech industry, I would assume.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.550
- Finance.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.383
- TV.

00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:37.210
- How do you think most
millionaires got their money?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.620
- Partially inheritance.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.678
- A good salary per year to invest.

00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:44.260
You can't become a
millionaire unless you have

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.220
the money to do it.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.654
- Inherited it.

00:08:46.654 --> 00:08:47.760
- I think a lot of it has to be luck.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.690
- There's one way to become a millionaire.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.540
What percentage of millionaires

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.980
do you think inherited their money

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.300
or got some kind of trust fund?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.629
- 30%.

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:56.462
- OK.

00:08:56.462 --> 00:08:57.295
- I'd say 80.

00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:58.900
- 50%, at least.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.200
- 70%?

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.660
- What would you guess
is the average income

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.580
of a millionaire.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.250
- Oh, I couldn't even guess.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.050
I know Kylie Jenner makes a lot of money.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.790
- Kylie Jenner, that's who I think of.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.757
- $200,000.

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:11.251
- 300 grand a year.

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.288
- At least $250,000.

00:09:12.288 --> 00:09:13.170
- $150,000.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.530
- Do you think you could
become a millionaire

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.363
in your lifetime?

00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:16.320
- Probably not.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.060
- It would be nice, but
that's not gonna happen.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.893
- No.

00:09:18.893 --> 00:09:20.401
- Unfortunately not, no.

00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:22.949
- Okay, that is like classic though, right?

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:25.060
Those responses, that is!

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.120
That's the stereotypical
response of what you think

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.960
millionaires are all about!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.270
- It really is, Rachel,
and no matter where you go,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.710
you can go across the country.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.320
If you grab every day people off the street

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.360
and you ask them, those
are the kinds of answers

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.525
you're gonna get because that's what

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:39.580
people truly believe as reality.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.700
- Yeah, so one of the myths on there that

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.810
I would totally believe if
I wasn't in my line of work

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.920
and knew the reality

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.587
is, "Oh, people just inherit their wealth."

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.900
You know, you think of
the Kardashians or like,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.470
Paris Hilton, the Hiltons, right?

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.030
You think of all these famous families

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.229
and that's who the rich, that's who the millionaires are.

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.690
But that's not true!

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.400
- No, it is not the truth.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.502
The inheritance is actually
a very small percentage.

00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:02.510
And yeah, some of the people you named,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.894
you're gonna hear about
that and it happens,

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:06.240
but for every day people,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.920
there are a very small
percentage of people

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.970
that get and kind of inheritance at all

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.313
and even if they do, Rachel,
what I found in the study,

00:10:12.313 --> 00:10:14.640
is that even if they
did get an inheritance,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.040
it was so small, it didn't cause people to

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.440
become a millionaire.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.700
So it's this mindset.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.650
- They're self-made millionaires.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.220
- That's self made.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.440
That's the exact term that I use.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.180
So I want people to know this because now,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.027
what you have to do as an
individual is make a decision

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:29.712
and begin to work a plan
that puts you on that path.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.090
It doesn't matter what
Mom and Dad left you

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.080
or if Grandma and Granddad
left you something or not.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.290
You still have an opportunity.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.087
- Yeah, your destiny
really is in your hands.

00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:40.490
The other thing that
would make sense to me,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.220
again if I didn't know,
the answers of all this,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.053
is that you need a
high paying salary, right?

00:10:45.053 --> 00:10:46.470
Me, I'm like, "Oh, it's math.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.470
Yeah you make a lot of money,
you invest a lot of money

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.880
and you're gonna be wealthy."

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.950
But a lot of these
millionaires did not have

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.367
high paying jobs necessarily.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:55.351
- Rachel, they really didn't
and people believe that.

00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:57.848
That you need a high, six-figure income.

00:10:57.848 --> 00:10:59.390
And so, if that's the case,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.380
people that are making the average income

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.668
or less than that, then they
think it's not possible.

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:06.197
Again, in the study,
we found out the truth.

00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:07.964
It doesn't take a high income.

00:11:07.964 --> 00:11:10.502
What it takes is someone
that is committed and focused

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:12.449
and they tell their money what to do.

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:15.050
- The last myth that I've heard people say

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.190
and people have told me this, you know,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.137
someone said, "Oh yeah, well
you can only become rich

00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:21.390
"if you just do what rich
people do in secret."

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.933
Like there's all these secret
things that millionaires

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.020
know about and they do
em but they don't share

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.330
with the rest of the world.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.670
Someone was having a conversation
about that with me

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.240
and I remember thinking, "What? No."

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.290
Because that's not the truth!

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.124
They don't, it's not luck
and it's not all these risky,

00:11:33.124 --> 00:11:35.714
crazy secret investments, right?

00:11:35.714 --> 00:11:37.340
- Yes, well people believe that.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.221
They think they need to
create something, right?

00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:41.810
Or take some kind of high super risk

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.110
with the cryptocurrency
'cause you know we've heard

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.100
about those things.
- Right, right, yes.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.740
- And you have to be
able to do that in order

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.030
to become a millionaire.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.580
Again, not true.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.790
It's a myth.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.330
The problem is, Rachel, with some of these

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.120
that we've covered, if you
tell a myth loud enough,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.410
long enough, people start to believe it.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.312
So I want people to hear
the truth and understand

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:01.857
what's available so they
can decide for themselves

00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:02.690
and their legacy.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.290
- I love it because not
the risky investments,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.710
as we always say, ya know, what we teach

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.030
when we teach people to
invest into retirement,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.590
we say all the time, it's boring.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.035
It's not exciting stuff
but it's the diligent,

00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:14.590
when you do it over and
over and over and over.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.159
That's the cause.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.550
- You know, we tell people to what?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.530
Don't invest in anything
you don't understand.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.500
So you need to be able to explain it

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.130
to a 10 or 11-year-old.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.555
That's the basics because we don't wanna

00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:26.574
take too crazy risks.

00:12:26.574 --> 00:12:28.770
We worked hard to make this money.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.933
Now I want people to make
their money work for them.

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:32.819
- I love it. Okay, there's
some viewer questions

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.211
and I usually grab viewer
questions from my Facebook group.

00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:39.267
Sarah asked, "If someone
can spare $100 a month

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:41.747
or whatever amount, and
they're just getting started,

00:12:41.747 --> 00:12:43.190
where should they put the money?"

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.990
- We know Baby Step number
one is to save $1,000, right?

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.580
Because when you have
that money tucked away,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.540
now you don't have to use
that and you don't have to

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.110
go see a bank or you don't have
to get a credit card, right?

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.010
So let's say now that she's
already got that in place.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.900
Now what?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.800
I want her to use it
to attack debt, right?

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.230
Baby Step number two.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.370
Then Baby Step three is to
build up a three to six month

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.440
emergency fund.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.650
Get that in place and
now you're ready to go

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.920
with what I call the
wealth building steps.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.480
You wanna start to put that money aside,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.120
to be able to allow that money to grow

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.230
for your dreams later.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.590
- I love it, so good.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.770
Okay, and for all this
investing stuff, you guys,

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.370
go to our SmartVester Pro.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.390
If you go to RachelCruze.com,
look at that,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.510
because these are people
that can really help you

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.343
with your money.

00:13:23.343 --> 00:13:24.176
They have the heart of a teacher,

00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:25.468
not the heart of a salesman,
and they are awesome.

00:13:25.468 --> 00:13:27.050
Because again, the investing world,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:28.480
like what we're talking
about all this episode,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.049
it's intimidating!

00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:31.003
- It is.

00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:31.836
- I remember, even Winston
and I, when we first sat down

00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:33.600
with our SmartVestor Pro,
when we first got married

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.640
and like, combined our money,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.815
he was talking to us, a
few times, I was like,

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:37.810
"Can you explain that again?

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.270
Can you explain that again?"

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.200
Even as Dave Ramsey's daughter,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.950
there were things that I didn't understand

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.684
and I made him keep explaining
it until I grasped it.

00:13:43.684 --> 00:13:45.730
So don't feel stupid.
- No.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.780
- Ask questions.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.250
- I appreciate you
bringing that up because

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.313
SmartVestors, they do
have a heart of a teacher.

00:13:50.313 --> 00:13:52.040
That means they wanna help you.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.600
They're not trying to sell you stuff.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.350
So, if you have questions, ask them.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.300
I promise you, they're not judging you.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.133
They're there to help you.

00:13:58.133 --> 00:13:59.887
- Absolutely, alright, Julia said,

00:13:59.887 --> 00:14:02.417
"How often should I check my investments?

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:03.752
Once a year or more often?"

00:14:03.752 --> 00:14:06.760
- Well, I think any time you're
looking at your situation,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.280
you wanna check investments every time

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.790
that statement comes in the mail.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.830
You should be getting
something from your 401k

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.530
or 403b each and every month.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.698
Take a look at it but Rachel,
I want people to hear me,

00:14:15.698 --> 00:14:17.277
don't freak out.

00:14:17.277 --> 00:14:19.311
Investing is like riding
a rollercoaster, right?

00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:20.940
Do you ride rollercoasters?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.030
- I love rollercoasters.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.649
- Do you sit up front?

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:24.482
- I went to Disney World
recently, Chris Hogan.

00:14:24.482 --> 00:14:25.390
I love it.
- Did you sit up front?

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.784
- I did in Space Mountain!

00:14:26.784 --> 00:14:27.790
Legitimately, they put me in the very front!

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.120
- I'm not sittin' up front.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.953
I sit in the back.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.436
I need some time.
- Oh no.

00:14:31.436 --> 00:14:32.594
- Yeah, I need some cushion.

00:14:32.594 --> 00:14:33.588
- I've gotta get right up there,

00:14:33.588 --> 00:14:34.421
gotta get right in the game.

00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:35.830
- But listen, investing is
like riding a rollercoaster.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.430
There are gonna be some ups and downs.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.263
But here's the deal.

00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:39.370
When you're riding a rollercoaster,

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.870
as long as you have your seatbelt on,

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.167
you know everything's gonna be okay.

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:45.050
So, my reality is
investing is a lot like that.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.510
When you have SmartVestor Pro in your corner

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.860
and you're investing in
things that you understand,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.320
you can relax, right,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.153
and take a deep breath.

00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:53.770
So look at it each and every month.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.800
But I want you to meet with
your investment professional

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.060
at least quarterly.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.120
If you're married, you and
your spouse need to go in

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.953
for that meeting.

00:14:59.953 --> 00:15:02.170
So we're talking about it,
getting on the same page,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.240
and any questions that
need to be answered,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.790
get answered in front of both of you.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.623
- I love it.

00:15:06.623 --> 00:15:08.737
Corey asks, "How do I even start?

00:15:08.737 --> 00:15:10.915
I'm a few months away from
completing Baby Step three

00:15:10.915 --> 00:15:13.636
and don't have a clue
where to start or even

00:15:13.636 --> 00:15:15.349
how much to start with."

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:16.370
- This is fantastic.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.680
So this is somebody that
has paid off debt, right?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.567
So congratulations to you.

00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:22.178
I'm very proud of you.
- Yay!

00:15:22.178 --> 00:15:23.011
Corey, good job.

00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:23.844
- Seriously, it's a big deal.

00:15:23.844 --> 00:15:24.769
- It is!

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:25.602
A huge deal.

00:15:25.602 --> 00:15:26.435
- People need to be encouraged about it.

00:15:26.435 --> 00:15:27.610
I love that you do that on your show.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.700
You've done a great job.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.310
What I want you to do is take steps now

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.950
to start to prepare for your future.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.930
So that could mean, if you're working,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.350
you could start to put that money aside

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.720
in your 401k.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.070
If their employer has a match,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.450
which means they will
match how much you put away

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.115
up to a certain percentage, right?

00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:44.382
If there is no match, then
let's put that money in

00:15:44.382 --> 00:15:46.867
and then as you start to grow
and you gain more income,

00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:48.832
you have an opportunity to use the 401k

00:15:48.832 --> 00:15:51.330
but also don't forget about Roth.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.069
Rachel, Roth is my friend.
- Yes, Roth IRA.

00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.902
Me too!

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:55.370
- I may name my dog Roth.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.608
You know why?

00:15:56.608 --> 00:15:57.108
Because you're talking
about tax-free money.

00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:58.130
- Tax-free money.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.900
Right, you've already
paid the taxes on it.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.860
This money is gonna
grow and the government

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.830
can't touch it anymore.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.663
- That's right.

00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:04.827
Alright, Danielle asked, "How should I do

00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:06.957
retirement investing
as a stay-at-home mom?

00:16:06.957 --> 00:16:10.477
15% of zero is still zero, smiley face.

00:16:10.477 --> 00:16:12.727
So is it 15% of my husband's paycheck?

00:16:12.727 --> 00:16:15.037
Should my husband and I
put a higher percentage

00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:17.045
of our money into his 401k at his job?

00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:19.899
Is there a better option than a 401k?"

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:21.946
- Well, first and foremost,
your job being at home

00:16:21.946 --> 00:16:24.844
is a very, very important job.

00:16:24.844 --> 00:16:27.610
You allow your husband to be able to work

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.897
and do what he needs to do.

00:16:28.897 --> 00:16:29.730
- Yep.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.740
- So Rachel, the first
thing I'd want her to do

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.880
is to start to use a better pronoun.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.930
"We," right?

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.450
She's saying "his" and "my."

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.627
No, it's "we," together.

00:16:36.627 --> 00:16:38.520
So, sitting down to look at that.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.367
- I quote you all the time.

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:41.120
I say, "My friend Chris Hogan
says we need to be more French. We, we."

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.158
- That's exactly right.
- We, we.

00:16:42.158 --> 00:16:43.694
- Speak we, not me.
- I love it.

00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:45.185
- That's right.

00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:46.470
- That's right, I'm
proud you give me credit.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.303
- I do quote you.
- You didn't steal it.

00:16:47.303 --> 00:16:48.697
I figured you'd steal it.

00:16:48.697 --> 00:16:50.033
- I'm a giver, not a taker.

00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:51.030
- But listen.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.871
It's so important to
be able to really know

00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:54.610
that you're working a plan together.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.443
- Yes.

00:16:55.443 --> 00:16:57.830
- So, the 401k and them going to sit down

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.330
with the SmartVestor Pro,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.907
they both need to go, husband and wife.

00:17:00.907 --> 00:17:03.990
Right, because this is their
money, this is their thing.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.810
But here's another thing that can happen.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.080
Because they are, he's
working and there's income

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.640
and they're filing taxes together,

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.680
they could also sign up
for a spousal Roth IRA.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.510
She could have this account in her name

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.330
and that might make her feel better

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.090
even though it's all for the family.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.580
People wanna know what they're doing.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.220
Here's another beautiful thing.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.150
If she's doing a side job or
she's doing anything else,

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.490
she could also direct
that money to a Roth IRA

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.470
to allow her to save.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.510
So, the biggest thing for this is,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.560
if they're saving in a 401k together,

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.266
this is their money,
this is the family money.

00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:35.269
- That's right.

00:17:35.269 --> 00:17:36.102
- So they both need to be involved

00:17:36.102 --> 00:17:37.520
in the meeting with the SmartVestor,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.930
and any tweaks moving forward.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.032
- Okay and something else I
see stay-at-home moms skip

00:17:41.032 --> 00:17:42.980
is life insurance!

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.220
Moms out there, even
dads, but especially you

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.761
stay-at-home moms, make sure
you have life insurance.

00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:49.530
I always like to tell stay-at-home moms,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.210
at least half a million dollars on you

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.740
because if something happens to you,

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.710
your family has to be taken care of.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.150
Make sure you go to
zander.com, check it out.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.620
Winston and I use Zander, but again,

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.750
I see a lot of stay-at-home moms

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.100
and they're like, "Oh no, I
don't need life insurance."

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.270
I'm like no, the work you do at home.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.820
Like you said, it's so important!

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.320
And your husband has to fund that

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.340
if something happens to you,
so make sure you get it.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.173
Do y'all use Zander?

00:18:09.173 --> 00:18:10.006
- Absolutely.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.358
Listen, your job as a
stay-at-home parent has value.

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:13.780
That's stay-at-home moms

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.850
and stay-at-home dads.
- Amen.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.659
- If they're out there.

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:17.492
So you definitely wanna have that in place

00:18:17.492 --> 00:18:18.919
because guess what?

00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:19.752
Life's gonna have to go on.

00:18:19.752 --> 00:18:20.820
You're gonna have bills,
you're gonna have things

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.776
you're gonna need to pay for.

00:18:22.776 --> 00:18:24.390
Let's make sure you've
got some money put aside,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.330
term life insurance with Zander.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.780
They'll help you out and
they'll walk you through

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.190
any questions you have.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.023
- That's exactly right.

00:18:30.023 --> 00:18:30.975
Okay, last question.

00:18:30.975 --> 00:18:32.327
Sarah said, "Where is the best place to

00:18:32.327 --> 00:18:34.277
start learning about investing?

00:18:34.277 --> 00:18:35.647
Any good books to start with?

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.977
I have a horrible financial background

00:18:37.977 --> 00:18:39.667
and know nothing about investing.

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:41.404
We're in Baby Step
two and I am a planner.

00:18:41.404 --> 00:18:43.882
I wanna start doing research now."

00:18:43.882 --> 00:18:46.616
- Well, I love that you wanna learn.

00:18:46.616 --> 00:18:48.700
I'd say you could start off with the book,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.163
The Total Money Makeover.

00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:52.180
That is the book, that Dave's book,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.910
it's the number one bestseller.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.267
It really starts to break
down kinda the principles.

00:18:56.267 --> 00:18:58.020
Then there's another
book out there, Rachel,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.853
I've heard about and it's called--

00:18:58.853 --> 00:19:00.176
- Oh, Love Your Life Not Theirs?

00:19:00.176 --> 00:19:01.009
What is it?

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:02.300
- It's called Retire Inspired.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.870
It is a book that helps people

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.320
chase down their dreams.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.960
And go after things they're going for.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.442
- It is good, though.

00:19:08.442 --> 00:19:09.603
- But no, seriously.

00:19:09.603 --> 00:19:10.436
- Retire Inspire is all about all of this

00:19:10.436 --> 00:19:11.575
investing stuff too.

00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:12.408
- And I have a show.

00:19:12.408 --> 00:19:13.680
Chris Hogan show.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.513
- Okay, go ahead.

00:19:14.513 --> 00:19:15.780
- Where people are allowed to call in.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.660
I take callers because I love people

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.045
and I want them to be
able to ask me questions.

00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:21.395
- I go into Facebook communities.

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:22.440
- And I wanna be able to talk with em

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.649
but no, listen, it's an
opportunity to grow in knowledge.

00:19:25.649 --> 00:19:26.657
- That's right.

00:19:26.657 --> 00:19:27.560
- I think it's really important for us

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.360
when we don't understand
something, we tend to

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.038
stay to ourselves and that's dangerous.

00:19:32.038 --> 00:19:32.880
- It is, yep.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.530
- So, reach out and listen,
our team has all kinds

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.970
of resources, your show, my show,

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.552
there's opportunity out there to learn.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.940
So I just encourage you, get plugged in,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.960
talk to people, have a conversation,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.989
and don't even feel like
your question is dumb

00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:46.489
because there is no such thing.

00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:48.130
- That's right.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.170
- People need answers and that's what we do.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.003
We help them.

00:19:51.003 --> 00:19:52.210
- Again, we're honing on this, you guys,

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.900
but it is so critical
because investing again,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.390
it can be an intimidating
topic just like she asked.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.760
So, find someone that does
this day in and day out.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.040
Those are our SmartVestor Pros.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.250
Check 'em out and start
on the road to investing

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.520
so you can become...

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.353
- A millionaire.

00:20:05.353 --> 00:20:06.694
- Oh, we didn't even plan that.

00:20:06.694 --> 00:20:07.527
That's pretty good.

00:20:07.527 --> 00:20:08.360
- I know, that's pretty good.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.540
- Coming up next, we have Elle.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.860
She is here to share her story and to gain

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.774
a little bit of knowledge from this man

00:20:13.774 --> 00:20:16.310
on more of how she can invest wisely

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.516
and become a millionaire.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:20.099
(upbeat music)

00:20:23.324 --> 00:20:26.364
(phone buzzing)

00:20:26.364 --> 00:20:29.180
Planning and cooking meals for
the family can be stressful.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.740
Knowing what I'm going to cook,

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.450
having all the ingredients,

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.450
and making something everyone will love

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.740
is a balancing act.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.810
That's why I use Home Chef.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.156

your door and get this,

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.570

(upbeat music)

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.270
- I was very stressed out by the number

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.660
when I graduated college.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.740
You know, it was more than what I knew my

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.733
starting salary was
gonna be at my first job.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.600
So, my dad, he's a farmer out in Kansas.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.933
In the summer times, I would
help drive combine and tractor,

00:21:35.933 --> 00:21:39.240
and all you really have
to do out in the field

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.270
is listen to the radio.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.750
I was probably around
you  know, 13 years old.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.767
I would listen to FM radio and then,

00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:49.240
I'd get really sick of
hearing the same songs

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.280
over and over again.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.340
So I learned to switch over to AM

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.220
and listen to The Dave Ramsey Show

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.290
halfway through the day.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.520
Unfortunately, I didn't
follow the Baby Steps

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.790
when I went to college.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.710
I wish I had.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.150
So I was very stressed out by the number

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.790
when I graduated college.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.080
Now I get out my laptop and I go through

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.583
the exit counseling and I see this total.

00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:11.840
Ya know, it was more than what I knew my

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.070
starting salary was
gonna be at my first job.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.960
I knew I needed to do something

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.880
and ya know, I remembered listening to

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.770
The Dave Ramsey show and
I knew that it had worked

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.517
for other people, so I
just turned towards that.

00:22:25.517 --> 00:22:27.489
I told everyone, I have this plan.

00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:30.192
I'm gonna pay them off in
you know, a couple of years.

00:22:30.192 --> 00:22:32.881
They're just like, "Sure, sure.

00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:35.441
I'm sure you are, good luck."

00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:39.090
And yeah, it is possible.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.590
(light music)

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.950
- So one of my favorite
parts of the show is

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.304
being able to bring
people on who are winning,

00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:51.900
like every day people who are doing this.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.132
So, tada, Elle, that is why you are here!

00:22:55.132 --> 00:22:56.810
Thank you for being on.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:57.860
- Yeah, thank you.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.550
- So Elle has an amazing story.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.160
She just came to Ramsey
Solutions to do her

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.420
debt free scream on The Dave Ramsey Show.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.380
You are completely debt free.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.969
- I am, it feels amazing.

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:10.307
- So great, so how much
debt did you pay off?

00:23:10.307 --> 00:23:11.625
- $60,000.

00:23:11.625 --> 00:23:12.720
- And what did that consist of?

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.000
- It was all student loans.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.980
- All student loans.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.230
So no car loans, no credit cards.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.385
- Nope.

00:23:17.385 --> 00:23:18.218
- Sallie Mae.
- Yes.

00:23:18.218 --> 00:23:19.513
- You have gone through this
journey to get to this point,

00:23:19.513 --> 00:23:22.650
to be debt free and you're
28 years old, you guys.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.250
In your late 20s.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.950
So, tell me about this journey.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.225
What caused you to get
started on all this?

00:23:28.225 --> 00:23:31.630
- Well really, what got me started is just

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.263
the fear of seeing how
much student loans I had

00:23:34.263 --> 00:23:36.510
because I'm kind of ashamed to say but,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.460
when I graduated college
and they have you do

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.730
your exit counseling, I didn't really know

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.930
what that final number was going to be.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.828
So, when I went through
that process and saw what

00:23:46.828 --> 00:23:49.480
my total was and then I saw what the

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.400
monthly payment was and all
the different payment options,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.310
I was just terrified.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.500
So I was kind of like scared into it.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.410
I was just like, "Oh my gosh,
I have to do something.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.640
I'll do anything."

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.380
So I knew about the Dave Ramsey plan

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.960
and I just decided to go full speed ahead.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.330
- It's amazing.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.905
So, she's a rare bird, right?

00:24:05.905 --> 00:24:07.102
- You really are.

00:24:07.102 --> 00:24:08.247
- We like to call you a unicorn, Elle.

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:09.262
- You are like a unicorn.

00:24:09.262 --> 00:24:10.262
- You are a unicorn.

00:24:10.262 --> 00:24:11.470
- Do you remember, how
much was the total in that

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.343
exit interview when you were there?

00:24:13.343 --> 00:24:15.295
- It would've been high
50s, like high 50,000.

00:24:15.295 --> 00:24:17.080
- And you remember the monthly payment?

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.178
- Oh my gosh, it was like
$500, $600 a month,

00:24:20.178 --> 00:24:21.490
something like that, yeah.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.024
- I mean, I can't imagine
being in your shoes.

00:24:23.024 --> 00:24:26.320
You're not working yet and
here you see this thing

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.380
that's gonna be following
you for many years

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.923
but you made a decision.

00:24:29.923 --> 00:24:31.310
Yes, so how did you do it?

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.908
What did you sacrifice to
be able to attack this debt?

00:24:33.908 --> 00:24:35.524
- I sacrificed a lot.

00:24:35.524 --> 00:24:38.114
You have to learn to say
no to a lot of things.

00:24:38.114 --> 00:24:41.020
I mean, in college, now looking back,

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.434
I do feel like I was
living way above my means.

00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:46.770
So, when I graduated,
usually that's the time

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.420
when you can start to do
everything and you know,

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.940
buy a new car and all this stuff.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.902
- Like everyone's getting their first job.

00:24:52.902 --> 00:24:54.480
All going out all the time

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.590
and it's so great, yep.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.320
- Exactly but I had to really ya know,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.250
I don't know, scale back everything.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.830
So that was really challenging

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.160
but I'm so thankful that I did.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.993
- Was it worth it?

00:25:06.993 --> 00:25:08.180
- Yes, so worth it.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.470
To not have to worry about that payment

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.135
and you know, you just have
your basic living expenses

00:25:13.135 --> 00:25:15.470
and you can worry about your future

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.750
rather than worrying about
paying for your past.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.673
- I like that. That's so true.

00:25:19.673 --> 00:25:21.711
You just freed up a lot of money, right?

00:25:21.711 --> 00:25:23.340
Almost $600 a month.
- Right.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.817
You would've been paying.
- Oh yeah.

00:25:24.817 --> 00:25:26.990
- And you said no, I'm gonna sacrifice.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.430
So I'm sure friends were buying cars.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.280
I'm sure friends were taking trips.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.890
How did you stay focused on this?

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.866
- Well actually, I got rid of
my social media for a while.

00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:39.714
- Oh! Girl after my own heart!

00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:40.910
Elle is so smart.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.340
- I did and I mean, it was great.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.979
I could just worry about myself.

00:25:44.979 --> 00:25:48.507
You know, it's just like what
you teach about contentment

00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:51.190
and everything, that is so important

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.810
and yeah, that was just so helpful to me.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.807
It's just like, worry about yourself,
worry about what you have.

00:25:56.807 --> 00:25:59.666
I kind of started to practice more of a

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:03.273
minimalistic lifestyle too
and like, that was beneficial.

00:26:03.273 --> 00:26:07.860
Yeah, it's just really being
intentional with your living

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.700
really was helpful.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.370
- Love it, so this whole episode

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.250
is about wealth and being a millionaire

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.500
and all this stuff, so
what you're doing is,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.333
you're out of debt.

00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:17.780
You've actually done Baby Step three

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.850
which is saving three to
six months of expenses.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.350
So now you're onto investing
which is the main way

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.560
a lot of people build wealth

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.390
is over time, and you're doing
this at 28 years old.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.630
So, my question to you is,

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.370
in this moment, do you feel good about

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.300
where you are financially?

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.630
Do you feel like you're
putting enough away?

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.082
Are you able to see the future at all?

00:26:36.082 --> 00:26:38.210
- Yes, I do.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.300
I mean, I think I'm in a good spot

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.060
but I kinda do feel a little behind

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.890
because it would've
been so nice to just go

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.896
straight out of college and be
able to just start investing

00:26:46.896 --> 00:26:51.246
right away but you know, I
think I've done your RIQ before

00:26:51.246 --> 00:26:52.610
and yeah.
- Good.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.640
Are you investing 15% right now?

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.510
- I am, yes.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.760
I am investing 15% but only in my 401k,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.230
but I want to invest in a Roth 'cause

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.620
I'm gonna just go up
to my employer's match

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.770
and then start investing in a Roth.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.305
- You should take our jobs.

00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:10.552
- You're on the ball!

00:27:10.552 --> 00:27:11.780
Seriously and you know what?

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.357
A lot of people can feel like
they're a little bit behind,

00:27:14.357 --> 00:27:15.190
but listen to me.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.023
You're 28 years old.

00:27:16.023 --> 00:27:17.200
You've got yourself debt free.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.410
You've got an emergency fund.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.960
You're ahead of the game.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.880
So, investing 15% in your 401k

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.090
is exactly what you should be doing.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.127
Now, you look at it and you go,

00:27:25.127 --> 00:27:27.920
"Maybe with some extra,
I wanna do a Roth IRA."

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.210
That's something you can do as well.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.500
So I want you to take comfort in knowing

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.540
you have worked hard
and you've sacrificed.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.610
You're on the path to becoming
an every day millionaire.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.880
- I know girl, like you are it.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.160
You're textbook, exactly it.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.160
So I don't wanna pass too
quickly across the $60,000

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.210
paid off in debt 'cause
a lot of you out there,

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.990
you're in Baby Step two,

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.823
you're working to pay off debt,

00:27:47.823 --> 00:27:49.490
you're in the middle of sacrificing,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.630
so Elle, I want you to... What
would you tell someone

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.010
when they're like, "Okay, I may be 38."

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.710
Right, let's say they're
38 and they have $60,000

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.990
still left in debt.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.823
What would you tell them?

00:27:59.823 --> 00:28:01.140
That they can do it?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.900
Like what's your message
to someone like that?

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.760
- I mean, it's definitely possible.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.010
You'd really just have to get intentional

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.650
with what you're doing
and what you're spending.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.691
People always talk about
the budget is the secret.

00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:13.830
I mean, it's really not a secret.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.610
You just have to have a budget

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.241
and know where your money's going.

00:28:17.241 --> 00:28:19.410
I mean, that's half the battle

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.680
is just knowing where your money's going.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.480
- Do your friends know what you've done?

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.313
- Yes.

00:28:24.313 --> 00:28:25.698
- What do they say?

00:28:25.698 --> 00:28:26.760
What do they say?
(laughing)

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.020
- They're proud of me, I think.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.870
I don't think a lot of them understood

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.040
why it was so important to me at first,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.750
but I think now that I've
finally paid everything off

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.390
and I think they can see that like,

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.570
oh, that's really cool that she did that

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.688
at such a young age.

00:28:39.688 --> 00:28:42.340
So, yeah, I think they're proud of me.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.740
- Well thanks so much for coming on.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.090
Seriously, like you
are the perfect example

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.250
of what to do 'cause
people are in the middle

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.240
of fighting this battle
and they're sacrificing

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.410
and you're giving them hope.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.269
You really are through your story,

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:54.300
so thank you so much for coming out.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.310
You are a perfect candidate
for the every day millionaire

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.143
like we talked about.

00:28:58.143 --> 00:28:59.100
So I'm actually gonna be a giver.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.000
I'm gonna give away one of your books.

00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:03.213
- I think that's fantastic.

00:29:03.213 --> 00:29:04.443
- Everyday Millionaires.
- Yes, yes.

00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:06.366
- I'll get him to sign it for you

00:29:06.366 --> 00:29:07.512
when it actually comes out.

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:08.870
We actually get a copy
that's not pre-order

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.132
to give to you, Elle.

00:29:10.132 --> 00:29:10.965
Hope you enjoy it.
- Oh my gosh.

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:11.798
Thank you so much.

00:29:11.798 --> 00:29:12.631
I'm excited!
- Very proud of you.

00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:13.873
Very proud of you.
- Awesome, thanks.

00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:17.538
(upbeat music)

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.020
- Guys, let's be real.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.143
Being a parent is hard work.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.890
Now that I have two daughters of my own,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.599
it feels like the to-do list never ends.

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:36.330
As every parent knows,
your priorities change

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.040
and you have to make important decisions

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.350
for your child's future.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.000
That's why term life insurance is a must

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.540
for every parent.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.971
It's so easy to get and it's affordable.

00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:48.480
What you're looking for is 10 to 12 times

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.540
your annual income to make sure everyone

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.160
in your family's taken care of.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.210
Winston and I use Zander Insurance.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.620

of our family.

(upbeat music)

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.544
Alright, my favorite part of the show.

00:30:14.544 --> 00:30:18.492
She works hard saving
money. Special edition

00:30:18.492 --> 00:30:19.370
with Chris Hogan!

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.534
This is so fun!

00:30:20.534 --> 00:30:21.367
- Do I get to be involved?

00:30:21.367 --> 00:30:22.280
- Yes, okay! So you read the first one, go.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.107
- Fantastic.

00:30:23.107 --> 00:30:24.629
Alright, here we go.

00:30:24.629 --> 00:30:26.227
So, Kelly said, "I sold my Mustang GT,

00:30:26.227 --> 00:30:33.387
my baby of 14 years, to buy a
used electric/hybrid vehicle, mainly because my husband commutes a minimum

00:30:33.387 --> 00:30:35.497
of 45 to 50 miles a day.

00:30:35.497 --> 00:30:38.937
Although a lot of tears
were shed saying goodbye to the Mustang,

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:41.677
it's been a huge blessing
with fuel savings.

00:30:41.677 --> 00:30:44.887
He can make his hour
commute all on one charge

00:30:44.887 --> 00:30:46.677
and typically charges it at work

00:30:46.677 --> 00:30:49.757
so he can ride home
without using a drop of gas.

00:30:49.757 --> 00:30:51.857
We've saved hundreds of dollars a month

00:30:51.857 --> 00:30:53.577
not having to pay much for gas,

00:30:53.577 --> 00:30:56.817
and when he has local travel,
we throw his mileage checks

00:30:56.817 --> 00:30:58.037
toward the mortgage.

00:30:58.037 --> 00:31:00.951
Doing this, we've been able
to up his 401k contributions

00:31:00.951 --> 00:31:03.440
and max out his HSA."

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.110
- Amazing.
- That's fantastic.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.635
- Alright, Mary said,

00:31:06.635 --> 00:31:08.037
"I've been riding public transportation

00:31:08.037 --> 00:31:09.647
for almost 30 years.

00:31:09.647 --> 00:31:12.417
That helps save on gas,
parking fees, insurance,

00:31:12.417 --> 00:31:14.997
car maintenance, and
vehicle replacement costs.

00:31:14.997 --> 00:31:17.587
And my company subsidized over

00:31:17.587 --> 00:31:20.107
half of the cost of my bus pass.

00:31:20.107 --> 00:31:24.677
I calculated that it
saved us over $100,000

00:31:24.677 --> 00:31:26.357
in the past 30 years.

00:31:26.357 --> 00:31:29.187
And as an added bonus, I was able to read

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.980
educational books on the bus,

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.947
like Financial Peace University."

00:31:32.947 --> 00:31:33.780
Love it.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.613
- Well, Crystal said,

00:31:34.613 --> 00:31:36.540
"In a year and a half, we have paid off

00:31:37.746 --> 00:31:40.627
$65,000 of debt, student
loans, credit cards,

00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:41.897
and even a car."

00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:45.107
They sold their house and
they bought an upgraded home.

00:31:45.107 --> 00:31:48.547
"We have also bought a new
used car for the first time,

00:31:48.547 --> 00:31:52.327
paying in cash for $14,000.

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:54.587
Two years before, I never though I'd go

00:31:54.587 --> 00:31:55.857
without a car loan.

00:31:55.857 --> 00:31:58.307
We now have a six month emergency fund

00:31:58.307 --> 00:32:01.347
and are working on saving for
flooring for our new house.

00:32:01.347 --> 00:32:04.597
We're also working on moving
on to Baby Step number four

00:32:04.597 --> 00:32:06.367
within the next month.

00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:09.176
I hope to be on Baby
Step six by the new year."

00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:10.220
- I love it!

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.053
- It's awesome.

00:32:11.053 --> 00:32:11.940
It's possible.
- People winning all

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.940
over the place.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.773
So great.

00:32:13.773 --> 00:32:14.770
Well Hogan, thanks for being on

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.760
