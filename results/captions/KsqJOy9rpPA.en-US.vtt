00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:34.570
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE 19th CENTURY

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.606
TWO BROTHERS,
ORSON AND LORENZO FOWLER

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:40.209
MADE AND SOLD BUSTS
LIKE THIS ONE.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.113
SUPPOSEDLY BY READING
THIS MAP OF THE HEAD AND FACE

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.281
YOU COULD EVALUATE
SOMEONE'S CHARACTER

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.583
AND PERSONALITY

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:49.318
EVEN PREDICT HIS BEHAVIOR.

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:51.053
HERE IS WHERE YOU WOULD LOOK

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:53.222
TO SEE IF HE HAD
SELFISH SENTIMENTS.

00:02:53.222 --> 00:02:55.391
OVER HERE IS
DOMESTIC PROPENSITIES.

00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:57.993
THIS ONE, OF COURSE,
IS FOR INTUITIVE REASONING

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:00.162
AND REFLECTIVE FACULTIES

00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:02.765
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.500
SELF-ESTEEM, POWER OF WILL.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.669
THE SYSTEM IS CALLED PHRENOLOGY

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.271
AND IT WAS ONE OF
THE MORE POPULAR THEORIES

00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:11.440
ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AT THE TIME.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.476
TOO BAD IT WASN'T BASED
ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.946
ACTUALLY, IT'S ONLY TOWARDS
THE END OF THE 19th CENTURY

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:20.983
THAT SCIENTISTS TURN THEIR GAZE
ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR--

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:25.320
TRADITIONALLY THE PROVINCE
OF PHILOSOPHERS, POETS

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.658
THESE SCIENTISTS TRIED TO MAKE
THE SEEMINGLY IRRATIONAL
RATIONAL.

00:03:29.658 --> 00:03:31.827
THEY TRIED TO SORT OUT
WHAT IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR

00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.562
IS FIXED AT BIRTH

00:03:33.562 --> 00:03:36.165
AND WHAT IS LEARNED
THROUGH EXPERIENCE.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:40.069
IT IS A JOURNEY THAT TWISTS
AND TURNS THROUGHOUT THE CENTURY

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.671
AS THEY AND WE GO
"IN SEARCH OF OURSELVES."

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:50.045
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:53.082
DOCTE
MYSTERIES OF THE HUMAN MIND

00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:59.154
ARE DRAWN TO THIS VENERABLE
HOSPITAL IN PARIS: SALPETRIERE.

00:04:01.323 --> 00:04:03.926
BUILT AS AN ARSENAL
IN THE 16th CENTURY

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:10.432
SALPETRIERE IS ANYTHING
BUT AN ORDINARY HOSPITAL.

00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:12.167
BY THE LATE 19th CENTURY

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:14.770
IT HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED
INTO THE LEADING CENTER

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.806
FOR THE STUDY OF A STRANGE
AND PERPLEXING MALADY--

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.975
HYSTERIA.

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:23.790
A MALADY WHICH BECOMES
THE PASSION

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.349
OF ITS IRON-WILLED DIRECTOR,
JEAN MARTIN CHARCOT.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.253
CHARCOT, BY ALL ACCOUNTS
OF CONTEMPORARIES

00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:36.458
WAS A COLDAUTHORITARIAN FIG
URE

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:38.193
AND THIS IS WHAT CAUSED HIM

00:04:38.193 --> 00:04:41.230
TO BE CALLED THE NAPOLEON
OF THE NEUROSES.

00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:46.001
Woman:
IN THE SALPETRIERE

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.974
THERE WAS A HUGE POPULATION
OF PATIENTS WHO SUFFER

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.941
ONE OF THE MURKIEST DISORDERS
STILL AROUND.

00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:54.243
THAT WAS HYSTERIA.

00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:55.978
AND IT WAS A NEW OPPORTUNITY.

00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:57.713
IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR CHARCOT

00:04:57.713 --> 00:05:00.315
TO BRING ALL THE SKILLS
HE HAD AS A NEUROLOGIST

00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:02.050
TO FINALLY UNPACK THE SECRETS

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.219
OF ONE OF THE MOST
FRUSTRATING DISORDERS

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.521
FOR CLINICIANS OF THE TIME.

00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:12.027
Osgood:
CHARCOT OBSERVES PATIENTS
WITH A DIZZYING ARRAY

00:05:12.027 --> 00:05:14.630
OF-

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.799
SPASMS...

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:18.967
PARALYSIS...

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:22.437
BLINDNESS...

00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:25.908
AMNESIA...

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:31.547
EVERY PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL
ABNORMALITY IMAGINABLE

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:35.017
ALL WITHOUT A TRACEABLE CAUSE.

00:05:38.053 --> 00:05:40.656
AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS CAREER

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.560
CHARCOT TURNS HIS FULL ATTENTION
TO HYSTERIA

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.728
CERTAIN HE CAN FIND ITS CAUSE.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.199
HE IS NOT THE FIRST TO TRY.

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:54.102
Woman:
THE GREEKS BELIEVED

00:05:54.102 --> 00:05:56.271
SED
Woman:
THEBY THE UTERUSVEDWAS CAU

00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.874
BY THE UTERUS

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:00.609
AS AN UNATTACHED ORGAN

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:03.212
KIND OF LIKE A BEACH BALL
INSIDE THE BODY

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:04.947
AND SHIFTING AROUND.

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:07.549
SO THAT MONDAY
IT MIGHT BE IN YOUR NECK

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:09.718
AND TUESDAY
IT MIGHT BE IN YOUR WRIST

00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:11.887
AND WEDNESDAY
IT MIGHT BE IN YOUR STOMACH.

00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:14.056
AND WHEREVER THIS UTERUS
HAPPENED TO END UP

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:15.791
IT CREATED SYMPTOMS--

00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:17.960
"THE WANDERING WOMB,"
AS THEY USED TO CALL IT.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:27.502
HYSTERIA IS STILL TIED
TO FEMALE SEXUALITY.

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:34.443
MAKES HER ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE
IS WIDELY HELD.

00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:40.082
"AFTER ALL," REMARKS ONE
OF CHARCOT?? COLLEAGUES

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:42.251
"HOW COULD MEN HAVE HYSTERIA?

00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:44.419
THEY HAVE NO UTERUS."

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:47.890
Micale:
MANY DOCTORS OF THE TIME,
IN FACT

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.360
BELIEVED THAT HYSTERIA WASN'T
A REAL DISEASE AT ALL.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.528
HYSTERIA THEY DISMISSED

00:06:53.528 --> 00:06:58.300
AS ARTIFICIAL
OR SIMULATING BEHAVIOR

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.336
OR PERHAPS, WHENT APPEARED
IN FEMALE PATIENTS

00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:03.939
AS A FORM OF SEXUAL PROMISCUITY

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:07.843
THAT WAS THEREFORE CONTEMPTIBLE
ON MORAL GROUNDS.

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:11.313
CHARCOT, HOWEVER, ARGUED

00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:13.916
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE
OF HIS CAREER

00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:16.084
THAT HYSTERIA, IN FACT

00:07:16.084 --> 00:07:19.121
WAS A SUBJECT
OF LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC STUDY.

00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:24.760
Osgood:
HYSTERIA CANNOT BE
A WOMAN'S DISEASE

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:27.362
BECAUSE MEN SUFFER, TOO.

00:07:27.362 --> 00:07:29.097
CHARCOT BELIEVES INSTEAD

00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:33.001
THAT A BRAIN DISEASE
CAUSES HYSTERIA

00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:37.773
AND THAT ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE
SUCCUMB TO IT--

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:39.942
THOSE FROM TAINTED STOCK.

00:07:46.882 --> 00:07:50.352
IT IS PASSED DOWN
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:56.858
YET CHARCOT IS NOT BOTHERED
WHEN HE CANNOT FIND HYSTERIA

00:07:56.858 --> 00:07:59.895
IN THE EXTENDED FAMILIES
OF HIS PATIENTS.

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:05.968
Micale:
CHARCOT COULD ARGUE
THAT HYSTERIA COULD TRANSMUTE

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:11.086
INTO OTHER TOTALLY DIFFERENT
PATHOLOGICAL FORMS

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:14.209
SUCH AS EPILEPSY
OR PARKINSON'S DISEASE

00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:16.378
OR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.

00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:19.414
WITH THE HINDSIGHT
OF A HUNDRED YEARS, OF COURSE

00:08:19.414 --> 00:08:21.149
THIS SEEMS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:24.186
THESE ARE TOTALLY SEPARATE
PATHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES

00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:26.788
WITH DIFFERENT CAUSES
AND DIFFERENT COURSES

00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:28.523
AND DIFFERENT THERAPEUTICS.

00:08:28.523 --> 00:08:29.825
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, HOWEVER

00:08:30.258 --> 00:08:32.861
THEY WERE VERY INDISCRIMINATELY
LUMPED TOGETHER.

00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:35.030
CHARCOT WAS GOING TO TAKE

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.500
THIS VAST AMORPHOUS WASTEBASKET
CATEGORY OF SYMPTOMS

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.669
THAT WAS CALLED HYSTERIA

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.705
ATION
OF EVERY CLINICIAN USTR

00:08:43.705 --> 00:08:46.742
IN EVERY MAJOR HOSPITAL
FOR CENTURIES, EFFECTIVELY

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:49.344
AND HE WAS GOING TO REPLACE IT

00:08:49.344 --> 00:08:52.814
WITH AN ELEGANT
NEUROPHYSIOLOGICALLY BASED MODEL

00:08:52.814 --> 00:08:54.549
OF ITS ETIOLOGY AND COURSE.

00:08:54.549 --> 00:08:57.586
HE WAS BASICALLY GOING
TO MAKE HYSTERIA LIE DOWN

00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.694
AND REVEAL ITS LAWS.

00:09:02.357 --> 00:09:05.394
Osgood:
NOW, C
OF HYSTERIA'S CAUSE

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:08.430
CHARCOT TURNS TO CATEGORIZING
ITS SYMPTOMS.

00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:16.671
HE SKETCHES EVERY MOVEMENT
OF HIS PATIENTS

00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:19.274
IN VIVID DETAIL.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.890
WHEN THE NEW ART OF
SCIENTIFIC PHOTOGRAPHY APPEARS

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.492
CHARCOT FINDS
AN EVEN BETTER METHOD

00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:39.661
TO CAPTURE THE NUANCES
OF BEHAVIOR.

00:09:42.697 --> 00:09:44.433
HE HIRES A PHOTOGRAPHER

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:47.035
TO WORK FULL TIE
AT SALPETRIERE.

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:52.240
CHARCOT WAS AVISUEL.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.409
HE LOVED TO SEE THINGS
WITH HIS EYE

00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:55.710
AND SEE THEM IN SUCH A WAY

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.879
THAT HE COULD
THEN STUDY THEM EXACTLY.

00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:00.482
AND PHOTOGRAPHY ENABLED YOU
TO STOP TIME.

00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:02.651
THAT IS, IT ENABLED YOU
TO TAKE A SYMPTOM

00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:07.856
STOP IT, ISOLATE IT AND THEN
TO LOOK AT IT IN DETAIL.

00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:10.892
Osgood:
CHARCOT DECLARES,
"THE CAMERA DOES NOT LIE."

00:10:14.362 --> 00:10:17.399
IT WOULD BECOME AS CRUCIAL
TO HIS STUDY OF HYSTERIA

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:20.869
AS THE MICROSCOPE IS
FOR BIOLOGISTS.

00:10:23.905 --> 00:10:27.375
AUGUSTINE WAS ONE
OF CHARCOT'S FAVORITE PATIENTS.

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:29.544
SHE WAS HIS SUPERMODEL.

00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:32.147
AUGUSTINE WAS YOUNG,
SHE WAS PRETTY

00:10:32.147 --> 00:10:34.316
SHE WAS VERY WELL DEVELOPED.

00:10:34.316 --> 00:10:36.918
HE POINTS ALL OF THIS OUT
IN HIS BOOKS.

00:10:37.352 --> 00:10:39.087
AND SHE RESPONDED WELL
TO THE CAMERA.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:54.703
Osgood:
CHARCOT WILL TAKE SOME 10,000
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS PATIENTS...

00:11:02.944 --> 00:11:06.848
SEARCHING FOR A PATTERN
IN THE PANOPLY OF SYMPTOMS.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.090
CURIOUSLY, THESE SYMPTOMS
SEEM TO REFLECT

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.692
THE CULTURE OF THE TIME.

00:11:17.692 --> 00:11:22.464
HE WAS PRODUCING PHOTOGRAPHS
OF BEAUTIFUL, SOMETIMES, WOMEN

00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:25.934
IN VERY ODD, BUT ALSO IN SOME
WAYS VERY FAMILIAR POSITIONS.

00:11:25.934 --> 00:11:27.669
IF YOU STUDY THE PHOTOGRAPHS

00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:29.838
OF THE HYSTERICS
IN THE SALPETRIERE

00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:31.573
YOU WILL SEE
THEY RESEMBLE VERY MUCH

00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:34.176
THE WOMEN IN PAINTINGS
OF THE RENAISSANCE.

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:35.911
THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:40.248
CHARCOT WAS A GREAT ADMIRER
OF PAINTING.

00:11:40.248 --> 00:11:41.983
HE SAW HIMSELF AS A MAN

00:11:41.983 --> 00:11:45.020
WHO WAS CULTIVATED,
ARTISTIC, LEARNED

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.755
AND HE WANTED HIS OWN WORK

00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:49.357
TO INTERSECT
WITH FRENCH CULTURE GENERALLY

00:11:49.357 --> 00:11:51.092
AND IT DID.

00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:55.864
Osgood:
INTELLECTUALS AND THE PUBLIC
ALIKE TAKE GREAT INTEREST

00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:58.466
IN CHARCOT'S
SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOR.

00:11:58.466 --> 00:12:00.635
HE BECOMES A CELEBRITY HIMSELF

00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:02.804
ON THE STREETS OF PARIS
AND BEYOND.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.708
RENOWNED FOR
HIS THEATRICAL FLAIR

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:09.744
HE ATTRACTS A WIDE AUDIENCE
EVERY TUESDAY

00:12:09.744 --> 00:12:12.347
WHEN HE OFFERS
A LECTURE DEMONSTRATION

00:12:12.347 --> 00:12:14.950
FOR DOCTORS WHO COME
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

00:12:15.383 --> 00:12:17.986
TO SEE THE PROCLAIMED
"PRINCE OF SCIENCE."

00:12:22.757 --> 00:12:25.794
SOMETIMES PATIENTS
HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE

00:12:25.794 --> 00:12:27.529
AND HE WOULD DIAGNOSE THEM.

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:31.433
AND SOMETIMES PATIENTS CAME IN
HEHADTREATED BEFORE

00:12:31.433 --> 00:12:33.168
AND THEY WOULD BE HYPNOTIZED

00:12:33.602 --> 00:12:37.505
AND CHARCOT WOULD INSTRUCT THEM
TO HAVE HYSTERICAL SEIZURES.

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:40.976
AND HE WOULD EXPLAIN WHAT WAS
GOING ON TO THE AUDIENCE.

00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:43.144
SO IT BECAME THE HOTTEST TICKET
IN PARIS.

00:12:43.144 --> 00:12:45.313
EVERYBODY WENT.

00:12:45.313 --> 00:12:49.217
EVERYBODY WHO WAS
IN THE MEDICAL WORLD HAD TO GO.

00:12:49.217 --> 00:12:53.555
BUT NOVELISTS WENT,
JOURNALISTS WENT, PAINTERS WENT.

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:58.326
EVERYONE WHO WAS ANYONE
IN LATE-19th-CENTURY PARIS

00:12:58.326 --> 00:13:00.061
HAD TO GO.

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:05.700
Osgood:
ONE MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE
CAPTIVATED BY CHARCOT

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.790
IS A YOUNG DOCTOR FROM VIENNA

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.773
WHO IS JUST EMBARKING
ON HIS OWN CLINICAL CAREER--

00:13:11.773 --> 00:13:13.942
SIGMUND FREUD.

00:13:16.544 --> 00:13:18.713
FREUD HAS BEEN TRAINED
IN NEUROLOGY

00:13:18.713 --> 00:13:20.882
ATORIES
FREUD HAS BEEN TRAINED
IN NEUROLOGYPEAN LABOR

00:13:20.882 --> 00:13:26.955
STUDYING THE BRAINS OF EELS,
FISH AND EVENTUALLY HUMANS.

00:13:28.256 --> 00:13:32.594
BUT IN TIME, FREUD TURNS
AWAY FROM HIS MICROSCOPE.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.763
Man:
HE DID ALL
THE TRADITIONAL THINGS

00:13:34.763 --> 00:13:38.233
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING
TO GO INTO BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE

00:13:38.233 --> 00:13:39.534
WOULD DO AT THAT TIME

00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:43.004
AND HE WAS TRYING TO APPLY
THE THINKING THAT HE WAS DOING

00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:45.607
TO ISSUES OF
BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES--

00:13:45.607 --> 00:13:46.908
DISTURBANCES THAT HE SAW

00:13:47.342 --> 00:13:49.511
IN PEOPLE THAT
HE WAS WORKING WITH--

00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:50.812
AND HE WAS VERY FRUSTRATED

00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:53.415
THAT ALTHOUGH
HE COULD STUDY THE BRAIN

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:56.885
AND TRY TO LOOK AT ITS ANATOMY,
HE JUST NY WAY

00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:59.487
THAT THAT WORK COULD
BE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE

00:13:59.487 --> 00:14:02.957
TO THE CLINICAL PROBLEMS
THAT HE WAS CONCERNED WITH.

00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:05.994
Osgood:
WHILE STUDYING WITH CHARCOT
IN PARIS

00:14:05.994 --> 00:14:09.898
FREUD BECOMES FASCINATED
BY THE PATIENTS AT SALPETRIERE.

00:14:09.898 --> 00:14:12.934
BUT THE BRAIN-LESION THEORY
OF HIS FRENCH MENTOR

00:14:12.934 --> 00:14:15.537
DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:22.043
PATIENTS WITH PARALYZED HANDS
CAN STILL MOVE THEIR ARMS.

00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:27.682
THOSE WITH PARALYZED FEET
CAN STILL MOVE THEIR LEGS--

00:14:27.682 --> 00:14:30.719
MOVEMENTS THAT WOULD BE
COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:37.659
IF THEIR PARALYSIS WERE TRULY
CAUSED BY A BRAIN DISORDER.

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:41.454
Harrington:
THE SYMPTOMS OF HYSTERIA
DIDN'T FOLLOW BIOLOGICAL LOGIC.

00:14:43.732 --> 00:14:46.334
IT FOLLOWED A KIND
OF A LAYMAN'S SENSE

00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:48.937
OF HOW PARALYSIS
PROBABLY SHOULD HAPPEN.

00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:52.407
Osgood:
FREUD'S DOUBTS INCREASE

00:14:52.407 --> 00:14:55.443
WHEN AUTOPSY AFTER AUTOPSY
OF HYSTERICAL PATIENTS

00:14:55.443 --> 00:14:57.612
YIELD NOTHING.

00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:03.251
THE HOPED-FOR BRAIN LESION
NEVER MATERIALIZES.

00:15:07.155 --> 00:15:09.758
BUT PERHAPS WHAT IS
MOST TROUBLING TO FREUD

00:15:09.758 --> 00:15:12.794
IS SOMETHING
MUCH CLOSER TO HOME.

00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:14.529
MANY EUROPEANS--

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:17.565
FROM THE MAN ON THE STREET
TO THE MEDICAL ELITE--

00:15:17.565 --> 00:15:21.035
SHARE CHARCOT'S BELIEF
THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF PEOPLE

00:15:21.035 --> 00:15:24.939
ARE MORE PRONE TO DEGENERATE
INTO MADNESS...

00:15:26.674 --> 00:15:30.578
PEOPLE WHO COME
FROM WEAKENED STOCK

00:15:30.578 --> 00:15:32.747
BAD BLOOD.

00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:39.254
JEWS, AS A GROUP,
ARE SINGLED OUT.

00:15:39.254 --> 00:15:41.423
AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY
IN VIENNA

00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:44.893
OF WHICH FREUD IS A MEMBER,
IS NO EXCEPTION.

00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:48.363
Micale:
ACCORDING TO
DEGENERATIONIST THEORY

00:15:48.363 --> 00:15:53.134
JEWS WERE MORE PRONE TO NERVOUS
AND NEUROTIC BREAKDOWN.

00:15:53.134 --> 00:15:57.472
THEY WERE INCLUDED
IN A CATEGORY OF CHARACTER TYPES

00:15:57.472 --> 00:15:59.641
THAT WERE PARTICULARLY
SUSCEPTIBLE

00:15:59.641 --> 00:16:01.376
TO NERVOUS DEGENERATION.

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:05.713
UNDERSTANDABLY, FREUD IS
NOT SYMPATHETIC TO THIS IDEA.

00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:09.184
HE SENSES AN ANTI-SEMITIC
CONTENT IN IT

00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:11.352
AND I'M ALMOST CERTAIN

00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:20.462
THAT THIS IS A PERSONAL FACTOR
THAT ALLOWS HIM

00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:22.630
Osgood:
WITH THIS, FREUD CONCLUDES

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.534
HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE FAILED
TO EXPLAIN MENTAL DISORDERS.

00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:29.571
THEY HAVE FOCUSED
ONLY ON THE PHYSICAL BODY

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.607
IGNORING THE COMPLEXITY
OF THE MIND.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.246
FINDING HYSTERIA'S TRUE CAUSE,
HE BELIEVES

00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:40.415
REQUIRES A RADICALLY
NEW APPROACH

00:16:40.415 --> 00:16:44.319
WHICH FREUD WILL UNDERTAKE IN
HIS PRIVATE PRACTICE IN VIENNA.

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:49.090
IN THE PROCESS, HE WILL SEEK
NOT ONLY TO EXPLAIN HYSTERIA

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.825
BUT ALSO PRESENT

00:16:50.825 --> 00:16:54.729
THIS CENTURY'S FIRST
DISTINCTLY PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY

00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:56.898
OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

00:16:56.898 --> 00:17:01.236
HIS FIRST CLUE COMES FROM
FELLOW NEUROLOGIST JOSEF BREUER

00:17:01.236 --> 00:17:03.838
AND BREUER'S PATIENT,
BERTHA PAPPENHEIM

00:17:03.838 --> 00:17:07.182
REFERRED TO AS "ANNA O."

00:17:07.182 --> 00:17:10.345
Micale:
PAPPENHEIM IS
A VERY YOUNG WOMAN;

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:14.682
HAD SEARCHED OUT JOSEF BREUER
AND PRESENTED TO BREUER

00:17:14.682 --> 00:17:19.020
AN EXTRAORDINARY IDIOSYNCRATIC
SERIES OF SYMPTOMS.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.755
SHE WAS HAVING
DIFFICULTY SLEEPING.

00:17:20.755 --> 00:17:23.791
SHE WAS SUFFERING
FROM NIGHTMARES.

00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:27.262
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HER TO DRINK WATER

00:17:27.262 --> 00:17:31.165
AND IN THE MORE SEVERE STAGES
OF HER DISORDER

00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:35.937
SHE HAD LOST THE ABILITY
TO SPEAK HER NATIVE GERMAN.

00:17:41.576 --> 00:17:45.046
AND LATER TELLS

00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:46.781
TO A YOUNG SIGMUND FREUD.

00:17:49.817 --> 00:17:52.854
Osgood:
THROUGH HYPNOSIS,
BREUER COAXED ANNA O.

00:17:52.854 --> 00:17:56.758
TO REMEMBER WHEN
HER SYMPTOMS FIRST APPEARED...

00:17:57.191 --> 00:18:00.228
TO A TIME WHEN HER FATHER
BECAME GRAVELY ILL.

00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:03.264
ONCE SHE REMEMBERED
THIS TRAUMATIC EPISODE

00:18:03.264 --> 00:18:07.168
AND TALKED OPENLY ABOUT IT,
HER SYMPTOMS VANISHED.

00:18:07.168 --> 00:18:12.373
THIS BECOMES KNOWN AS
THE "TALKING CURE."

00:18:12.373 --> 00:18:15.410
FREUD NEVER ACTUALLY
MEETS ANNA O.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.579
BUT WHAT IMPRESSES HIM MOST

00:18:18.012 --> 00:18:20.615
IS THE PARTICULARITY
OF HER SYMPTOMS

00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:24.085
AND THEIR LINK
TO A PERSONAL TRAUMA.

00:18:24.085 --> 00:18:27.989
Harrington:
TO FREUD, THE SYMPTOMS
OF HYSTERIA REVEAL

00:18:27.989 --> 00:18:31.459
NOT WHAT'S WRONG
WITH A PATIENT'S BRAIN

00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:34.929
BUT, IN A SENSE, WHAT HAD GONE
WRONG IN THE PATIENT'S LIFE.

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:38.833
THEY BECOME SYMPTOMS
OF TRAUMATIC EVENTS

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:44.038
EMOTIONALLY INTOLERABLE EVENTS
THAT A PATIENT HAD REPRESSED

00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:48.376
AND THEREFORE, THAT RATHER
THAN FINDING EXPRESSION

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:52.280
IN APPROPRIATEEMOTIONAL
AFF... UH, EXPRESSION

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.882
FOUND EXPRESSION
IN BODILY SYMPTOMS.

00:18:57.051 --> 00:18:59.654
Osgood:
AFTER SEEING PATIENT
AFTER PATIENT

00:18:59.654 --> 00:19:02.606
FREUD BELIEVES THAT SYMPTOMS
ARE INVARIABLY BORN

00:19:02.606 --> 00:19:06.160
OUT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.631
THEEANINGFUL
IN AND OF THEMSELVES

00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:11.799
BUT ACT AS A ROAD MAP

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:15.703
TO A SUBMERGED INNER LIFE
THAT IS TROUBLED.

00:19:16.137 --> 00:19:20.041
Roth:
FREUD SAYS THAT HYSTERICS SUFFER
MAINLY FROM REMINISCENCES;

00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:22.210
THAT IS, WHAT CAUSES A SYMPTOM

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.812
IS SOMETHING
IN THE PAST OF THE PATIENT

00:19:24.812 --> 00:19:29.584
THAT HE OR SHE CANNOT GET OVER,
CANNOT FACE, CANNOT THINK ABOUT

00:19:29.584 --> 00:19:32.620
AND THAT IT TAKES
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.657
TO STAY AWAY FROM
THAT PART OF THEIR PAST.

00:19:38.259 --> 00:19:41.729
Osgood:
SO TOXIC IS THIS MEMORY,
IT IS BANISHED

00:19:41.729 --> 00:19:49.103
TO A PART OF THE MIND WHICH
FREUD CALLS "THE UNCONSCIOUS."

00:19:49.103 --> 00:19:54.742
WHERE DREAMS AND SLIPS
OF THE TONGUE TAKE SHAPE...

00:19:54.742 --> 00:19:57.345
THE HOME OF FANTASIES
AND FEARS...

00:19:57.345 --> 00:20:01.249
OF UNCENSORED THOUGHTS
AND SEXUAL DESIRES...

00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:10.358
THE BIRTHPLACE, FREUD BELIEVES,
OF ALL EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.

00:20:12.527 --> 00:20:15.129
FROM HIS IDEA OF THE UNCONSCIOUS

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:19.467
FREUD DEVELOPS PSYCHOANALYSIS,
A NEW THEORY OF THE MIND

00:20:19.467 --> 00:20:23.805
AND A TECHNIQUE
TO GAIN ACCESS TO IT--

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:27.275
A THEORY THAT MANY
T.

00:20:29.877 --> 00:20:31.612
Micale:
FREUD IS ATTACKED
IN HIS OWN TIME

00:20:31.612 --> 00:20:33.781
ON A GREAT MANY
DIFFERENT GROUNDS.

00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:35.516
CERTAINLY THE MOST IMMEDIATE

00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:37.685
AND THE BEST KNOWN
OF THE GROUNDS

00:20:37.685 --> 00:20:41.155
WAS THAT HIS IDEAS
WERE PORNOGRAPHIC.

00:20:41.155 --> 00:20:45.059
BECAUSE HE DISCUSSES SEXUALITY
SO EXTENSIVELY

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:48.963
AND IN SUCH A COLD,
NEUTRAL, ANALYTIC TONE

00:20:48.963 --> 00:20:53.301
THEY SEE THIS
AS MORALLY IMPERMISSIBLE.

00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:01.542
Osgood:
FREUD IS ALSO ATTACKED
FOR OTHER REASONS.

00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:08.049
THE UNCONSCIOUS CANNOT
BE SEEN OR TESTED.

00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:14.989
YOU CANNOT STUDY IT UNDER
A MICROSCOPE, OR DISSECT FOR IT.

00:21:14.989 --> 00:21:21.929
THERE IS NO MATERIAL PROOF
OF ITS EXISTENCE.

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:24.532
TO SOME, FREUD'S
PSYCHOANALYSIS SEEMS

00:21:24.532 --> 00:21:32.340
TOO THEORETICAL, TOO
PHILOSOPHICAL, TOO UNSCIENTIFIC.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.244
Roth:
HE WAS NOT A SUCCESSFUL
THEORETICIAN IN THE EARLY YEARS.

00:21:36.244 --> 00:21:38.846
HIS WORK DID, HOWEVER, ATTRACT

00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:42.316
THE INTEREST OF
A FAITHFUL BAND OF ADHERENTS

00:21:42.316 --> 00:21:46.220
AND FREUD USED THEIR COMMITMENT
TO HIM AND TO PSYCHOANALYSIS

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.690
AS THE BASIS FOR DEVELOPING
A PSYCHOANALYTIC MOVEMENT

00:21:50.124 --> 00:21:53.161
THAT RESEMBLES UNFORTUNATELY,
IN MY VIEW, IN MANY WAYS

00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:54.896
A CHURCH IN ITS EARLY YEARS--

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:57.498
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO BE COMMITTED

00:21:57.498 --> 00:22:00.968
TO THE CARDINAL CONCEPTS
OF PSYCHOANALYSIS

00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:04.438
IN ORDER TO BE TREATED
AS FAITHFUL ADHERENTS.

00:22:04.438 --> 00:22:08.342
Harrington:
FREUD WAS ABLE TO CREATE

00:22:08.342 --> 00:22:13.114
A KIND OF RELIGIOUS ZEAL
IN INTELLECTUALS

00:22:13.114 --> 00:22:15.716
MANY OF WHOM WERE JEWISH

00:22:15.716 --> 00:22:20.054
OR FELT, IN THE CONTEXT
OF VIENNESE SOCIETY

00:22:20.054 --> 00:22:22.223
SOMEWHAT MARGINALIZED.

00:22:22.223 --> 00:22:25.693
HERE THEY COULD BE AT THE CENTER
OF SOMETHING VERY EXCITING

00:22:25.693 --> 00:22:27.862
THAT WAS POTENTIALLY
GOING TO TRANSFORM

00:22:27.862 --> 00:22:30.031
THE WAY IN WHICH
WE THINK THE MIND WORKS.

00:22:31.766 --> 00:22:36.537
Osgood:
BY 1914, FREUD'S FOLLOWING
IS STILL RELATIVELY SMALL

00:22:36.537 --> 00:22:40.007
BUT THAT WILL ALL CHANGE SOON.

00:22:40.007 --> 00:22:43.911
POLITICAL EVENTS WILL THRUST
FREUD'S PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES

00:22:43.911 --> 00:22:45.646
ONTO A WORLD STAGE

00:22:45.646 --> 00:22:49.116
PROVIDING A BRUTAL
LIVING LABORATORY

00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:51.719
FOR THE EFFICACY
OF FREUD'S IDEAS.

00:22:55.189 --> 00:22:57.792
WORLD WAR I.

00:22:57.792 --> 00:23:01.696
GERMANY IS PITTED AGAINST
MOST OF EUROPE, RUSSIA

00:23:01.696 --> 00:23:05.600
AND LATER, THE UNITED STATES.

00:23:07.768 --> 00:23:10.805
Roth:
THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS

00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:19.480
EUROPE'S ENCOUNTER WITH MASS
DESTRUCTION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.950
YOU DIDN'T KILL SOMEONE
CLOSE UP.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.420
YOU WERE OFTEN
JUST LYING IN A DITCH

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:32.493
AND SUDDENLY
SOMEONE NEXT TO YOU WOULD DIE

00:23:32.493 --> 00:23:36.831
BECAUSE AN EXPLOSION WOULD SEND
SHRAPNEL AND KILL THAT PERSON.

00:23:39.867 --> 00:23:44.205
OR YOU WOULD BE IN A DITCH
FOR DAYS, AND THEN SUDDENLY

00:23:44.205 --> 00:23:49.410
YOU WERE TOLD, "GET UP
AND WALK ACROSS THAT FIELD."

00:23:52.013 --> 00:23:55.917
Osgood:
THE WAR LASTS LONGER
THAN ANYONE HAD ANTICIPATED.

00:23:58.953 --> 00:24:03.724
DAYS BECOME MONTHS,
AND MONTHS STRETCH IN

00:24:07.628 --> 00:24:10.231
THE HUMAN TOLL IS ENORMOUS.

00:24:10.231 --> 00:24:15.002
SOLDIERS WRITE HOME:
"THE SIGHTS WERE AWFUL--

00:24:15.002 --> 00:24:19.340
"DEAD MEN ALL OVER THE PLACE,
SOME HALF-BURIED BY SHELLS.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.244
"IT WAS SIMPLY A CASE
OF LOOKING DEATH IN THE FACE

00:24:23.244 --> 00:24:26.714
AND WAITING TO BE HIT."

00:24:30.184 --> 00:24:31.052
EARLY IN THE WAR

00:24:31.485 --> 00:24:34.088
AN ENGLISH PSYCHOLOGIST
NAMED CHARLES MEYERS--

00:24:34.088 --> 00:24:35.823
BASED AT THE FRONT--

00:24:35.823 --> 00:24:38.859
REPORTS SEEING SOLDIERS
COME OUT OF THEIR TRENCHES

00:24:38.859 --> 00:24:41.462
WITH MYSTERIOUS SYMPTOMS.

00:24:41.462 --> 00:24:45.800
HE THINKS THE CAUSE MAY BE
A POISON GAS OR CHEMICALS--

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.137
ALL OF WHICH ARE TESTED FOR
TO NO AVAIL.

00:24:50.137 --> 00:24:54.475
DOCTORS SEE SOLDIERS
WITH UNEXPLAINED TREMORS;

00:24:54.475 --> 00:24:57.511
SOME WHO HAVE GONE
BLIND OR DEAF OVERNIGHT;

00:24:57.511 --> 00:25:00.548
OTHERS MUTE, PARALYZED, CRYING.

00:25:00.548 --> 00:25:04.018
MEYERS SPECULATES THAT THESE
BEHAVIORS ARE SOMEHOW RELATED

00:25:04.018 --> 00:25:07.054
TO EXPLODING SHELLS ON THE FRONT

00:25:07.054 --> 00:25:09.223
SO HE CALLS IT "SHELL SHOCK."

00:25:11.392 --> 00:25:13.561
BUT THEN, SOLDIERS WHO
HAVE YET TO SEE COMBAT

00:25:13.561 --> 00:25:17.465
APPEAR WITH SIMILAR SYMPTOMS.

00:25:17.465 --> 00:25:19.633
Roth:
SHELL SHOCK, IN MANY WAYS

00:25:20.067 --> 00:25:22.670
RESEMBLED
THE SYMPTOMS OF HYSTERIA.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.839
THAT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING.

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:27.441
HYSTERIA WAS SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED TO WOMEN.

00:25:27.441 --> 00:25:31.345
EVEN THOUGH THE 19th CENTURY
SAW THEORIES THAT SHOWED

00:25:31.345 --> 00:25:33.948
THAT MEN COULD
BE HYSTERICS, TOO

00:25:33.948 --> 00:25:35.683
THE CRUMBLING OF THE PSYCHE

00:25:36.117 --> 00:25:40.021
WAS THOUGHT TO BE SOMETHING
THAT WOMEN WERE PRONE TO.

00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:44.792
THIS WAS SEXIST,
EVEN MISOGYNISTIC SCIENCE.

00:25:49.563 --> 00:25:52.166
DOCTORS TRIED TO FIND
ANOTHER NAME FOR IT

00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.769
SO AS TO SPARE THEIR SOLDIERS

00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:57.805
THE SHAME OF BEING
CALLED HYSTERICS.

00:25:57.805 --> 00:26:01.709
Showalter:
THEY ABSOLUTELY COULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT MEN COULD BE HYSTERICAL

00:26:01.709 --> 00:26:04.311
AND WHEN THEY BEGAN
TO SEE THE SYMPTOMS IN MEN

00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:06.914
ALL THE DOCTORS SAID,
"THIS LOOKS LIKE HYSTERIA."

00:26:06.914 --> 00:26:08.215
BUT AT SOME LEVEL

00:26:08.215 --> 00:26:11.252
THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE IT.

00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:17.324
Osgood:
"WAR NEUROSIS"

00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:19.493
"BURIED-ALIVE NEUROSIS"

00:26:19.493 --> 00:26:21.228
"SOLDIER'S HEART"--

00:26:21.228 --> 00:26:24.698
ALL NAMES TO DESCRIBE
MALE HYSTERIA.

00:26:24.698 --> 00:26:27.301
SOME 80,000 SOLDIERS
WOULD SUCCUMB

00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:29.470
DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR.

00:26:31.639 --> 00:26:33.808
MILITARY DOCTORS LOOK
LONG AND HARD

00:26:33.808 --> 00:26:36.410
FOR A PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
FOR THE SYMPTOMS;

00:26:36.844 --> 00:26:39.880
DENCE OF DAMAGE
FOR A PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM;E EVI

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.784
FOR EVIDENCE OF
TAINTED HEREDITY.

00:26:43.784 --> 00:26:47.688
THEY WERE SO PERSUADED THAT
THERE HAD TO BE AN ORGANIC CAUSE

00:26:48.122 --> 00:26:52.026
AND IN SOME WAYS, SO PREJUDICED
AGAINST A PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSE

00:26:52.026 --> 00:26:53.327
THAT AS THEY ELIMINATED

00:26:53.327 --> 00:26:56.363
AND ELIMINATED AND ELIMINATED
POSSIBLE SOURCES

00:26:56.363 --> 00:26:58.532
THEY JUST CONTINUED TO LOOK.

00:27:02.436 --> 00:27:06.340
THE ONLY EXPLANATION LEFT
IS COWARDICE.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.244
TO MANY OFFICERS,
THESE SOLDIERS ARE MALINGERERS

00:27:10.244 --> 00:27:15.449
WHO SHOULD BE TRIED,
COURT-MARTIALED AND EXECUTED.

00:27:15.449 --> 00:27:18.486
AND IN FACT, SOME ARE.

00:27:21.088 --> 00:27:24.125
BUT AMONG DOCTORS,
THERE ARE A PIONEERING FEW

00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:26.293
FAMILIAR WITH FREUD'S THEORIES

00:27:26.293 --> 00:27:28.896
WHO BELIEVE THAT SHELL SHOCK
IS PSYCHOLOGICAL.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.800
FOR THEM, THE WAR OFFERS
AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.270
Showalter:
FREUD HAD WORKED WITH A VERY
SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.439
AND WITH WOMEN PATIENTS WHO CAME

00:27:38.439 --> 00:27:41.475
FROM QUITE A LIMITED
SEGMENT OF VIENNESE SOCIETY--

00:27:41.475 --> 00:27:44.512
UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS WOMEN FROM
JEWISH FAMILIES BASICALLY

00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:47.548
WHO WERE LEADING LIVES
OF BOREDOM AND LEISURE.

00:27:47.548 --> 00:27:50.151
AND SUDDENLY
HERE YOU HAVE THE WAR--

00:27:50.151 --> 00:27:53.621
80,000 SHELL-SHOCK CASES
IN THE EUROPEAN ARMIES.

00:27:53.621 --> 00:27:56.223
SO THEY PROVIDED
AN EXTRAORDINARY WEALTH

00:27:56.223 --> 00:27:58.826
OF EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL,
SO TO SPEAK

00:27:58.826 --> 00:28:01.862
AND DOCTORS, AT THE SAME TIME
THAT THEY WERE APPALLED

00:28:01.862 --> 00:28:03.597
WERE FASCINATED.

00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:06.574
THEY RECOGNIZED THE OPPORTUNITY
THEY HAD BEFORE THEM

00:28:06.574 --> 00:28:07.935
TO STUDY PRECISELY

00:28:07.935 --> 00:28:12.273
THE KINDS OF CONFLICTS
THAT FREUD HAD WRITTEN ABOUT

00:28:12.273 --> 00:28:16.177
IN THIS VERY, VERY LARGE
SAMPLE OF THE POPULATION.

00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:25.719
Harrington:
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND

00:28:25.719 --> 00:28:27.454
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
PSYCHOLOGICALLY

00:28:27.454 --> 00:28:29.190
TO THESE YOUNG MEN
IN THE TRENCHES

00:28:29.623 --> 00:28:32.226
THAT WERE CAUSING THEM
TO DEVELOP THESE SYMPTOMS.

00:28:32.226 --> 00:28:33.961
EVERYTHING IN YOUR BODY
IS SAYING

00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:35.696
"GET OUT OF THERE;
SAVE YOURSELF"

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.299
AND EVERYTHING
IN YOUR TRAINING IS SAYING

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:40.467
"YOU'VE GOT TO STAY
IN THE TRENCHES

00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:43.938
AND DEFEND YOUR COUNTRY," AND
THE CONFLICT IS SO UNBEARABLE

00:28:43.938 --> 00:28:46.540
THAT AS THE PSYCHOANALYSTS
WOULD ULTIMATELY SAY

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.010
THE ORGANISM TAKES
A FLIGHT INTO ILLNESS.

00:28:56.951 --> 00:29:00.421
Showalter:
SHELL SHOCK IS THE BODY LANGUAGE
OF POWERLESSNESS

00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:06.493
AND POWERLESSNESS CAN COME IN
A LOT OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.

00:29:06.493 --> 00:29:09.006
YOU CAN HAVE POWER IN THE WORLD

00:29:12.132 --> 00:29:15.603
WHERE YOU ARE POWERLESS,
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

00:29:15.603 --> 00:29:17.771
TO SPEAK YOUR REAL FEELINGS

00:29:17.771 --> 00:29:21.675
THE BODY WILL CONVERT
THOSE FEELINGS INTO SYMPTOMS.

00:29:21.675 --> 00:29:26.447
THESE SOLDIERS,
WHO WERE BRAVE, WHO WERE FIT

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.086
WHO WERE PATRIOTIC,
FOUND THEMSELVES DEALING WITH

00:29:32.086 --> 00:29:37.725
FEAR, ANXIETY, GRIEF,
LONELINESS, DISORIENTATION

00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:41.195
AND ALL THESE KINDS OF FEELINGS
WHICH WERE NEW TO THEM

00:29:41.195 --> 00:29:44.665
AND WHICH WERE NOT
PART OF THE SOCIETY'S DEFINITION

00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:46.400
OF WHAT IT MEANT TO BE A MAN.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.003
THEY COULDN'T ARTICULATE
THOSE FEELINGS.

00:29:57.678 --> 00:29:59.847
Osgood:
DOCTORS TRY ANY METHOD--

00:29:59.847 --> 00:30:03.317
FROM CRUDE FORMS OF ELECTRIC
SHOCK TO TALKING THERAPY--

00:30:03.317 --> 00:30:05.919
TO RESTORE THE SOLDIER
TO FIGHTING SHAPE

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:08.088
AND BACK TO THE FRONT.

00:30:12.426 --> 00:30:15.462
FOR THOUSANDS
OF SOLDIERS LIKE THESE

00:30:15.462 --> 00:30:20.668
IT IS THE TALKING CURE THAT
WORKS WHEN NOTHING ELSE DOES.

00:30:20.668 --> 00:30:23.704
SIMPLY TALKING CAN SAVE THEM.

00:30:25.439 --> 00:30:29.777
MANY SOLDIERS FROZEN IN FEAR
CAN NOW BE HEALED.

00:30:38.018 --> 00:30:42.356
SOLDIERS IMMOBILIZED
BY MEMORIES CAN NOW MOVE ON.

00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:54.501
THE LABORATORY OF WAR

00:30:54.501 --> 00:30:56.622
DEMONSTRATES THAT MANY
OF FREUD'S IDEAS

00:30:56.622 --> 00:30:59.273
ARE MORE THAN ABSTRACT THEORIES;

00:30:59.273 --> 00:31:04.398
THEY CAN OFFER
A PRACTICAL BASIS FOR TREATMENT.

00:31:07.948 --> 00:31:10.984
ABOUT THE HIDDEN SOURCES
OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR

00:31:10.984 --> 00:31:14.021
FOR DECADES TO COME.

00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:16.190
I THINK IT SHOWED UP
TO PEOPLE ON A MASSIVE SCALE

00:31:16.623 --> 00:31:22.262
THAT EMOTIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
FACTORS WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:31:22.262 --> 00:31:26.600
IN DETERMINING OUR MENTAL LIVES.

00:31:28.335 --> 00:31:31.372
IT'S AS AN EXPERIENCE OF THE WAR

00:31:31.805 --> 00:31:34.842
THAT PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY

00:31:34.842 --> 00:31:38.746
NOW CEASE BEING
SIMPLY MEDICAL SPECIALTIES

00:31:38.746 --> 00:31:41.782
APPLIED TO A VERY
TINY NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:31:41.782 --> 00:31:45.686
BUT A WAY TO UNDERSTAND,
IN GENERAL

00:31:45.686 --> 00:31:49.156
OURSELVES, OUR MINDS
AND OUR WORLD.

00:32:05.205 --> 00:32:07.374
WHEN WORLD WAR I
COMES TO A CLOSE

00:32:07.374 --> 00:32:09.543
A BATTLE OF
A DIFFERENT SORT BEGINS

00:32:09.543 --> 00:32:12.146
ONLY THIS TIME
THE WEAPONS ARE WORDS

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:14.314
AND THE SOLDIERS ARE SCIENTISTS.

00:32:14.314 --> 00:32:16.049
THIS NEW BATTLE WILL RAGE

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:19.953
BETWEEN TWO DIAMETRICALLY
OPPOSED VIEWS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

00:32:19.953 --> 00:32:22.990
ON ONE SIDE ARE THE SCIENTISTS
WHO SEE OUR PERSONALITIES

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.327
AS UNCHANGING, FIXED AT BIRTH,
BIOLOGICALLY DETERMINED.

00:32:27.327 --> 00:32:30.364
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE
THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE CAN CHANGE

00:32:30.364 --> 00:32:32.966
THAT WE ARE INFLUENCED
BY OUR EXPERIENCES

00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:35.569
AND WHAT WE LEARN ALONG THE WAY.

00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:38.172
WHEN THE DEBATE HEATS UP
IN THE UNITED STATES

00:32:38.172 --> 00:32:40.774
LIFE IS CHANGING RAPIDLY
AND DRAMATICALLY.

00:32:40.774 --> 00:32:43.377
IT'S AN UNSETTLING TIME
FOR MOST PEOPLE.

00:32:43.377 --> 00:32:46.413
WE YEARN FOR STABILITY
AND NORMALCY AND CERTAINTY.

00:32:46.413 --> 00:32:49.450
WHAT SCIENTISTS HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR--

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.052
WHETHER IT'S FIXED AT BIRTH
AND PREDICTABLE

00:32:52.052 --> 00:32:55.088
OR SHAPED BY THE ENVIRONMENT
AND CHANGEABLE--

00:32:55.088 --> 00:32:58.559
WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT
ON HOW PEOPLE VIEW THE FUTURE

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:02.463
HOW THEY SEE EACH OTHER, AND
EVEN HOW THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES.

00:33:05.499 --> 00:33:09.837
Osgood:
IN 1918, THE WAR TO END ALL WARS
IS FINALLY OVER.

00:33:12.005 --> 00:33:15.476
AMERICAN SOLDIERS RETURN TO A
COUNTRY EAGER TO TAKE ITS PLACE

00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:18.078
AS A LEADER
IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD.

00:33:20.247 --> 00:33:24.585
BUT AMERICA'S OPTIMISTIC HOPES
FOR THE FUTURE ARE SOON UNDERCUT

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:27.187
BY SOME UNEXPECTED
AND DISTURBING NEWS.

00:33:27.187 --> 00:33:30.657
THE ARMY PUBLISHES
THE RESULTS OF TESTS

00:33:30.657 --> 00:33:32.826
IT CONDUCTED DURING WARTIME

00:33:32.826 --> 00:33:36.730
ASSESSING THE MENTAL CAPACITY
OF ITS RECRUITS.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.899
USION:
ASSESSING THE MENTAL CAPACITY
OF ITS RECRUITS.NG CONCL

00:33:38.899 --> 00:33:43.237
NEARLY HALF OF ALL AMERICAN
SOLDIERS ARE FEEBLEMINDED.

00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:46.273
ARMY PSYCHOLOGISTS
HAVE FIRED THE FIRST SHOT

00:33:46.273 --> 00:33:51.044
ENTIFIC WAR THAT
ARMY PSYCHOLOGISTS
WILL LE.IRED THE FIRST SHOT SCI

00:33:51.044 --> 00:33:56.683
WHEN THE ARMY TESTS RESULTS WERE
PUBLISHED, AND IT WAS STATED

00:33:56.683 --> 00:34:01.455
THAT A GOODLY PORTION OF
INDUCTEES INTO THE U.S. ARMY

00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:04.057
HAD A MENTAL AGE OF UNDER 12--

00:34:04.057 --> 00:34:09.263
ERGO, MORON BY POPULAR
DEFINITION OF PSYCHOLOGISTS--

00:34:09.696 --> 00:34:11.865
THERE WAS A SENSE OF SHOCK.

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:15.769
HOW COULD IT BE
THAT SO MANY AMERICAN BOYS

00:34:15.769 --> 00:34:17.938
HAD SUCH LOW INTELLIGENCE?

00:34:17.938 --> 00:34:23.577
THEY LED PEOPLE TO BELIEVE
THAT WE HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM

00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:26.613
NAMELY, WE HAD TOO MANY MORONS;

00:34:26.613 --> 00:34:30.083
THE COUNTRY WAS FILLED
WITH MORONS.

00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:33.120
THE THEORY THAT
THE ARMY TESTS HAVE PROVEN

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.457
THAT THE COUNTRY IS REALLY
A LOT DUMBER THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT

00:34:37.457 --> 00:34:40.060
IS GOING TO FEED INTO
A LOT OF FEARS

00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:44.831
Osgood:
THE FEARS MU

00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:47.434
THE FEAR THAT
AMERICA'S GENE POOL

00:34:47.434 --> 00:34:50.904
IS BEING WEAKENED BY AN UNENDING
INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS;

00:34:50.904 --> 00:34:54.808
THE HAT AMERICANS WILL
LACK THE MENTAL FACULTIES

00:34:54.808 --> 00:34:57.844
TO PERFORM THE COMPLEX TASKS
OF MODERN LIFE.

00:35:00.447 --> 00:35:03.483
WHEN THE ARMY COMMISSIONED
THE TESTS DURING THE WAR

00:35:03.483 --> 00:35:06.520
THE GENERALS FACED
A STAGGERING LOGISTICAL TASK.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.122
DELUGED WITH SOME
TWO MILLION RECRUITS

00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:11.725
THEY TRIED TO MATCH
EACH MAN TO THE JOB

00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:16.063
CHOOSING POTENTIAL OFFICERS AND
WEEDING OUT POTENTIAL MISFITS.

00:35:18.231 --> 00:35:22.030
IN DESPERATION, THE ARMY TURNED
TO A GROUP OF PSYCHOLOGISTS

00:35:24.738 --> 00:35:30.377
TO GET THE JOB DONE: A
STANDARDIZED INTELLIGENCE TEST.

00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:35.148
HENRY GODDARD, FATHER OF THE
FIRST AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE TEST

00:35:35.148 --> 00:35:38.185
IS PART OF A NEW WAVE
OF PSYCHOLOGISTS

00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:41.221
EAGER TO BE OF SERVICE
TO THEIR COUNTRY.

00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:45.993
Zenderland:
THEY HAD ONE CLEAR, PRACTICAL
GOAL FOR THEIR SCIENCE--

00:35:45.993 --> 00:35:49.029
TO SORT THE ENTIRE ARMY,
QUICKLY, IN AN HOUR.

00:35:49.029 --> 00:35:52.933
THEY HAD TO FIND A TEST
THAT COULD BE DONE FAST

00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:55.535
AND THAT COULD
IMMEDIATELY DISTINGUISH

00:35:55.535 --> 00:35:58.138
DIFFERENT LEVELS
OF MENTAL SKILL.

00:35:58.138 --> 00:36:00.741
Osgood:
THEY SPRING INTO ACTION.

00:36:00.741 --> 00:36:04.645
THEY TEST GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
WITH QUESTIONS LIKE:

00:36:04.645 --> 00:36:06.813
"WHAT IS CRISCO?"

00:36:06.813 --> 00:36:09.850
"WHAT IS THE PRODUCT
ADVERTISED BY VELVET JOE?"

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.019
OR "WHAT IS A DIBBLE?"

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:14.187
Zenderland:
THE ARMY TESTS REQUIRED

00:36:14.187 --> 00:36:16.790
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT
OF CULTURAL INFORMATION.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.959
ONE HAD TO KNOW AMERICAN SPORTS

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:21.561
ONE HAD TO KNOW
AMERICAN ADVERTISING

00:36:21.561 --> 00:36:23.730
ONE HAD TO KNOW THAT VELVET JOE

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.333
WAS A CHARACTER
WHO ADVERTISED TOBACCO.

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:31.972
Osgood:
IN ADDITION, THEY ALSO ASK
QUESTIONS OF PRACTICAL JUDGMENT:

00:36:32.406 --> 00:36:35.008
"IS BLACK THE SAME AS WHITE?"

00:36:35.008 --> 00:36:38.912
AND "WHY IS BEEF
BETTER FOOD THAN CABBAGE?"

00:36:38.912 --> 00:36:42.816
THE INHERENT FALLACY, CERTAINLY
OF THE TESTS OF THOSE DAYS

00:36:42.816 --> 00:36:44.551
WAS THE FACT THEY WERE FILLED

00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:49.756
WITH THE CULTURE OF
A PARTICULAR CLASS AND LOCATION

00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:53.226
AND WERE TREATED AS THOUGH
THEY WERE UNIVERSAL AND FAIR.

00:36:53.226 --> 00:36:56.697
AND PEOPLE WHO WERE
NOT FROM THOSE CLASSES OR GROUPS

00:36:56.697 --> 00:36:57.564
DID NOT DO WELL.

00:37:02.769 --> 00:37:07.107
NATIVE, INBORN INTELLIGENCE,
NOT ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE...

00:37:08.842 --> 00:37:14.047
AND THIS INTELLIGENCE SHOULD BE
AS MEASURABLE AS A BAR OF STEEL.

00:37:14.047 --> 00:37:16.216
Man:
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS

00:37:16.216 --> 00:37:18.385
AN ENTITY CALLED INTELLIGENCE

00:37:18.385 --> 00:37:20.554
AND THAT TESTS WERE MEASURING IT

00:37:20.554 --> 00:37:23.590
IN THE SAME WAY THAT THERE'S
AN ENTITY CALLED POTATOES--

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.759
WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON A SCALE

00:37:26.193 --> 00:37:28.361
THERE'S A SCALE
THAT'S MEASURING THEM.

00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:32.699
Narrator:
THE SCALE FOR INTELLIGENCE
IS DEVELOPED BY HENRY GODDARD

00:37:32.699 --> 00:37:36.603
AT THE TRAINING SCHOOL FOR
FEEBLEMINDED BOYS AND GIRLS

00:37:36.603 --> 00:37:38.772
IN VINELAND, NEW JERSEY.

00:37:41.374 --> 00:37:43.977
THROUGH HIS OBSERVATIONS,
HE COMES TO BELIEVE

00:37:43.977 --> 00:37:47.447
THAT INTELLIGENCE-- AND ITS
OPPOSITE, FEEBLEMINDEDNESS--

00:37:47.447 --> 00:37:50.917
IS INHERITED.

00:37:50.917 --> 00:37:53.954
BUT AS A SCIENTIST,
GODDARD WANTS PROOF.

00:37:53.954 --> 00:37:56.990
HE CONFESSES TO HIS FRIEND,
CHARLES DAVENPORT:

00:37:57.424 --> 00:38:00.894
"WHEN IT COMES TO
THE GENETICS OF INTELLIGENCE

00:38:00.894 --> 00:38:03.930
I HAVE MUCH MORE ZEAL
THAN KNOWLEDGE."

00:38:06.533 --> 00:38:09.136
CHARLES DAVENPORT IS A PIONEER

00:38:09.569 --> 00:38:11.738
FIELD
CHARLES DOF GENETICS.A PIONEERG

00:38:11.738 --> 00:38:14.775
HE, TOO, BELIKE INTELLIGENC
E

00:38:14.775 --> 00:38:21.715
CAN BE PASSED DOWN
FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.

00:38:21.715 --> 00:38:24.751
IF, AS THE EXPERIMENTS
OF GREGOR MENDEL HAVE SHOWN

00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:28.655
E GENE FOR WRINKLED
IF, AS THE EXPERIMENTS
PEAS AND ANOTHER FOR SMOOTH ON

00:38:28.655 --> 00:38:31.258
ONE GENE FOR BLUE EYES
AND ANOTHER FOR BROWN

00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:34.728
THEN PERHAPS THERE ARE
ALSO GENES FOR OTHER TRAITS

00:38:34.728 --> 00:38:37.330
LIKE INTELLIGENCE.

00:38:40.367 --> 00:38:46.006
A RESPECTED BIOLOGIST FRF CHI
CAGO

00:38:46.006 --> 00:38:51.645
THE HEREDITY TRAITS OF ANIMALS--
CHICKENS, CANARIES AND RABBITS.

00:38:54.247 --> 00:38:57.284
THROUGH HIS RESEARCH,
DAVENPORT BECOMES CONVINCED

00:38:57.284 --> 00:38:59.886
THAT MENDELIAN GENETICS
WILL EXPLAIN

00:38:59.886 --> 00:39:02.923
N
IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS

00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:06.393
BUT ALSO IN HUMAN BEINGS.

00:39:06.393 --> 00:39:08.995
Man:
THEY TRIED TO FIND
BIOLOGICAL BASES

00:39:08.995 --> 00:39:10.730
OF THINGS
THAT THEY CALLED NOMADISM--

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.899
THE TENDENCY OF PEOPLE
TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE.

00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:15.936
AND AT LEAST ONE GENETICIST
FOUND A GENETIC BASIS

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:19.840
FOR WHAT HE CALLED
THALASSOPHILIA, LOVE OF THE SEA

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.575
THAT WAS EXPRESSED
IN NAVAL OFFICERS

00:39:22.008 --> 00:39:24.177
AND WHICH HE CONTENDED
MUST BE A SEX-LINKED TRAIT--

00:39:24.177 --> 00:39:25.478
THAT IS, TO MALES--

00:39:25.478 --> 00:39:28.515
BECAUSE ONLY MALES
BECAME OFFICERS IN THE NAVY.

00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:33.720
Narrator:
AND DAVENPORT BELIEVES THAT
OTHER TRAITS ARE LINKED, TOO.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.323
HE BELIEVES
THAT LOW INTELLIGENCE

00:39:36.323 --> 00:39:39.793
CAUSES POVERTY, CRIMINALITY
AND PROSTITUTION

00:39:39.793 --> 00:39:42.395
AND IF INTELLIGENCE
IS FIXED AT BIRTH

00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:47.167
THEN THESE BEHAVIORS MUST BE
GENETIC IN ORIGIN AS WELL.

00:39:50.637 --> 00:39:53.673
THE TRAITS WERE BELIEVED
TO BE UNCHANGEABLE.

00:39:53.673 --> 00:39:56.276
WE HAD, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THE PHRASE:

00:39:56.276 --> 00:39:59.312
"THE LEOPARD CANNOT
CHANGE HIS SPOTS."

00:39:59.312 --> 00:40:01.481
THEREFORE,
PEOPLE CANNOT CHANGE

00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:03.650
WHAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM
BY NATURE.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.253
THERE WAS A BELIEF
WE WERE PRODUCTS OF NATURE

00:40:06.253 --> 00:40:08.855
PREDESTINED TO BE
WHAT WE WERE BORN

00:40:08.855 --> 00:40:12.759
AND THAT ENVIRONMENT
HAD NO EFFECT ON IT.

00:40:16.229 --> 00:40:19.699
Osgood:
DAVENPORT'S IDEAS CATCH FIRE
AMONG THOSE

00:40:19.699 --> 00:40:22.736
LOOKING FOR SCIENTIFIC WAYS
TO IMPROVE SOCIETY.

00:40:24.905 --> 00:40:27.941
HE RECRUITS GRADUATES
OF VASSAR AND HARVARD

00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:32.279
EAGER TO JOIN HIM ON THE
VARESEARCH.

00:40:32.279 --> 00:40:36.616
HE PERSUADES THE CARNEGIE
INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON

00:40:36.616 --> 00:40:41.821
TO FUND A NEW RESEARCH STATION
IN COLD SPRING HARBOR, NEW YORK.

00:40:43.556 --> 00:40:45.725
ALL FOR THE PROMOTION
OF EUGENICS

00:40:45.725 --> 00:40:49.629
A MOVEMENT TO IMPROVE
THE QUALITY OF THE HUMAN RACE

00:40:49.629 --> 00:40:52.232
BY SELECTIVE BREEDING.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:01.341
BUT NOT EVERYONE BELIEVES
THAT BIOLOGY IS DESTINY.

00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:06.112
FOR MANY SCIENTISTS, IT'S YOUR
EXPERIENCES IN LIFE THAT COUNT--

00:41:06.112 --> 00:41:10.016
YOUR UPBRINGING, YOUR EDUCATION,
UR ENVIRONMENT.

00:41:10.016 --> 00:41:14.354
CHIEF AMONG THESE SCIENTISTS
IS PSYCHOLOGIST JOHN WATSON

00:41:14.354 --> 00:41:19.125
WHO OFFERS A THEORY THAT IS
THE MIRROR OPPOSITE OF EUGENICS.

00:41:19.125 --> 00:41:23.463
THIS WAS THE HEYDAY OF
HEREDITARIANS AND GENETICISTS

00:41:23.463 --> 00:41:25.632
WHO SAID THAT HUMAN BEINGS

00:41:25.632 --> 00:41:30.837
WERE CONSTRAINED BY THEIR
GENETIC INHERITANCE.

00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:33.440
AND WATSON WAS SAYING
THAT THIS IS BALONEY;

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:39.079
THAT HUMAN BEINGS WERE SHAPED
SOLELY BY THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:41:41.247 --> 00:41:44.718
Osgood:
OVER THE YEARS, WATSON STUDIES
THE BEHAVIOR OF BABIES--

00:41:44.718 --> 00:41:46.886
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:52.959
TO WATSON, WE ARRIVE
IN THE WORLD A BLANK SLATE--

00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:55.128
TABULA RASA.

00:41:55.128 --> 00:41:56.863
NEARLY EVERYTHING IS LEARNED

00:41:57.297 --> 00:42:01.201
EVEN THINGS WE THINK
ARE INSTINCTUAL, LIKE FEAR.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.273
TO PROVE THAT ENVIRONMENT
IS MORE POWERFUL THA

00:42:07.273 --> 00:42:09.442
WATSON DESIGNS AN EXPERIMENT

00:42:09.442 --> 00:42:12.479
FOR AN INFANT KNOWN AS
LITTLE ALBERT.

00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:15.949
HE'S SO CONFIDENT,
HE FILMS IT FOR POSTERITY.

00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:20.720
AT FIRST,
ALBERT SHOWS LITTLE FEAR

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.757
EVEN WHEN WATSON PLACES
A BURNING NEWSPAPER

00:42:23.757 --> 00:42:25.925
IN FRONT OF HIM.

00:42:28.094 --> 00:42:31.998
ALBERT IS ALSO UNAFRAID
WHEN HE ENCOUNTERS A WHITE RAT

00:42:32.432 --> 00:42:34.601
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE.

00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:37.203
BUT THEN WATSON
SHOWS ALBERT THE RAT

00:42:37.203 --> 00:42:39.806
ACCOMPANIED
BY A LOUD CLANGING NOISE--

00:42:39.806 --> 00:42:42.842
ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT
UPSETS LITTLE ALBERT.

00:42:42.842 --> 00:42:45.879
(cries)

00:42:45.879 --> 00:42:47.614
AND HE DOES IT AGAIN...

00:42:47.614 --> 00:42:49.349
(cries)

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:50.650
N.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.819
(loud clanging)

00:42:52.819 --> 00:42:56.723
EVENTUALLY, ALBERT LEARNS
TO FEAR NOT JUST THE RAT

00:42:56.723 --> 00:43:00.627
BUT ALL FURRY THINGS,
EVEN WITHOUT THE LOUD NOISE.

00:43:00.627 --> 00:43:05.832
IN WATSON'S MIND, THE LITTLE
ALBERT EXPERIMENT IS A SUCCESS

00:43:05.832 --> 00:43:10.603
BECAUSE IT PROVES THAT FEARS
ARE LEARNED, NOT INHERITED.

00:43:10.603 --> 00:43:13.206
WATSON CALLS
HIS THEORY "BEHAVIORISM"

00:43:13.206 --> 00:43:14.941
AND BEGINS TO POPULARIZE IT.

00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:17.977
HE URGES PARENTS
TO TAKE ACTIVE CONTROL

00:43:17.977 --> 00:43:20.580
OF THEIR CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.484
BY SHAPING THEIR ENVIRONMENT...

00:43:24.484 --> 00:43:28.388
TO THINK OF THE HOME
AS A SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY.

00:43:31.424 --> 00:43:33.593
ATSON'S
TO THINK OF THE HOME
AS INTEREST IN CHILDHOODRY.T W

00:43:33.593 --> 00:43:35.328
IS PURELY PROFESSIONAL.

00:43:35.762 --> 00:43:37.497
Maher:
HE DIDN'T LIKE CHILDREN MUCH.

00:43:37.931 --> 00:43:40.533
HE REFERRED TO THEM,
IN ONE OF HIS MANY STATEMENTS

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:43.136
AS ALWAYS SQUALLING
AND SHOUTING AND DIRTY

00:43:43.136 --> 00:43:46.172
AND WANTING TO BE FED
AND SORT OF A NUISANCE.

00:43:46.172 --> 00:43:47.907
IT WAS CLEAR HE DIDN'T
PARTICULARLY LIKE THEM

00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:49.642
IN HIS OWN ENVIRONMENT

00:43:49.642 --> 00:43:52.245
BUT HE FELT
THAT THE GOOD OF SOCIETY

00:43:52.245 --> 00:43:57.884
REQUIRED SHAPING INDIVIDUALS
RIGHT FROM DAY ONE

00:43:57.884 --> 00:43:59.185
YOU HAD TO START
WITH THE BABIES.

00:43:59.185 --> 00:44:01.788
Narrator:
EBULLIENT AND SELF-PROMOTING

00:44:01.788 --> 00:44:05.258
WATSON GATHERS A WIDE
AND APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE

00:44:05.258 --> 00:44:07.427
WHICH HOLDS IN HIGH ESTEEM

00:44:07.427 --> 00:44:11.331
ANY SCIENTIFIC THINKING
ON THE SUBJECT OF CHILD REARING.

00:44:15.668 --> 00:44:18.705
SCIENCE WAS
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT

00:44:18.705 --> 00:44:20.874
IN THE POPULAR MIND-SET.

00:44:20.874 --> 00:44:25.645
IF SCIENCE SAID SOMETHING,
IF SCIENTISTS TESTED

00:44:25.645 --> 00:44:29.983
IF SCIENTISTS EXPERIMENTED,
WELL, THEN, IT MUST BE SO.

00:44:29.983 --> 00:44:33.019
Osgood:
BUT THE APPEAL OF BEHAVIORISM
RUNS DEEPER.

00:44:33.019 --> 00:44:36.489
ITS EGALITARIAN PHILOSOPHY
AND OUTLOOK

00:44:36.489 --> 00:44:40.393
SEEMS TO REFLECT
THE VERY SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY.

00:44:40.393 --> 00:44:44.297
Maher:
WATSON WAS THE VOICE
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM

00:44:44.297 --> 00:44:45.598
THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS

00:44:45.598 --> 00:44:47.767
THAT THIS IS THE LAND
OF OPPORTUNITY.

00:44:47.767 --> 00:44:50.370
YOU CAN BECOME
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.539
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT THERE YET.

00:44:52.539 --> 00:44:56.442
AND AT LEAST IF YOU DON'T DO IT
IN YOUME

00:44:56.442 --> 00:44:59.479
THIS IS  IN WHICH
YOUR CHILDREN CAN DO IT.

00:45:02.081 --> 00:45:04.684
Osgood:
THE AMERICAN DREAM
OF OPPORTUNITY

00:45:04.684 --> 00:45:06.853
DRAWS MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS.

00:45:06.853 --> 00:45:09.455
THEY COME BY THE SHIPLOAD
TO FILL THE JOBS

00:45:09.455 --> 00:45:12.926
OF A RAPIDLY
EXPANDING ECONOMY...

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:15.962
TO SEEK A BETTER LIFE.

00:45:15.962 --> 00:45:18.565
BUT THE ARRIVAL
OF NEW IMMIGRANTS

00:45:18.565 --> 00:45:20.733
INCREASES ALL KINDS OF FEARS.

00:45:20.733 --> 00:45:23.336
SOME ARE ECONOMIC--
THAT THE IORKER

00:45:23.336 --> 00:45:25.939
WILL LOWER THE WAGES
OF AMERICAN WORKERS

00:45:25.939 --> 00:45:28.541
OR TAKE THEIR JOBS ALTOGETHER

00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:33.746
ALL THE WHILE CROWDING
THEIR CITIES AND THEIR SCHOOLS.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.084
AND THERE ARE ALSO
BIOLOGICAL FEARS.

00:45:38.084 --> 00:45:41.120
CHARLES DAVENPORT AND OTHERS
IN THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT WORRY

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.157
THAT THE NEW IMMIGRANTS
FROM SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE

00:45:44.157 --> 00:45:47.193
ARE BRINGING DEFECTIVE GENES
WITH THEM.

00:45:49.796 --> 00:45:53.700
THEY HAVE NO FAITH THAT AMERICA
WILL TRANSFORM THE IMMIGRANTS.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.435
IF ANYTHING, THEY FEAR

00:45:55.435 --> 00:45:58.037
THE IMMIGRANTS
WILL TRANSFORM AMERICA.

00:45:59.772 --> 00:46:01.507
FOR THE EUGENICISTS

00:46:01.507 --> 00:46:04.978
THE IMMIGRANTS' DREAM
IS THEIR NIGHTMARE.

00:46:10.183 --> 00:46:13.219
Kraut:
IF THESE NEWCOMERS
WHO CAME OFF THE SHIPS--

00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:15.388
WHO SEEMED SO SHORT,
SO MISSHAPEN

00:46:15.388 --> 00:46:18.424
COMPARED TO RUGGED
AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS--

00:46:18.424 --> 00:46:21.894
INTERMARRIED AND BRED IN
THIS COUNTRY, THERE WAS A FEAR

00:46:21.894 --> 00:46:25.798
THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY WEAKEN
"THE RACE," AS IT WAS CALLED.

00:46:25.798 --> 00:46:28.401
INDEED, SOME SPOKE
OF "RACE SUICIDE"

00:46:28.401 --> 00:46:32.739
THAT IMMIGRATION COULD LEAD TO
AMERICANS ACTUALLY ANNIHILATING

00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:37.076
THEIR OWN RUGGED, ROBUST,
PIONEERING BREED.

00:46:39.245 --> 00:46:42.282
Woman:
AND THE IDEA WAS THAT
MANY OF THEM WERE DEFECTIVE

00:46:42.282 --> 00:46:44.017
AND THAT THE AMERICAN POPULATION

00:46:44.017 --> 00:46:47.053
WAS QUICKLY FILLING UP
WITH DEFECTIVES.

00:46:47.053 --> 00:46:50.089
THE NOTION WAS THAT AMERICA HAD
BECOME THE ASYLUM OF THE WORLD.

00:46:51.824 --> 00:46:54.861
Osgood:
THERE IS A GROUNDSWELL
OF NATIONAL SUPPORT

00:46:54.861 --> 00:46:57.030
TO SET STRICT
IMMIGRATION QUOTAS.

00:46:58.765 --> 00:47:01.801
FROM LABOR UNIONS
TO THE KU KLUX KLAN

00:47:01.801 --> 00:47:04.404
THEY JOIN TOGETHER
TO PRESSURE PRESIDENT COOLIDGE

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:05.705
TO PROTECT THE NATION

00:47:05.705 --> 00:47:09.609
BY SIGNING THE 1924
IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT.

00:47:13.513 --> 00:47:16.115
IT'S A LAW THAT, IN THE WORDS
OF ONE CONGRESSMAN

00:47:16.115 --> 00:47:20.019
"IS A NECESSITY FOR KEEPING PURE
THE BLOOD OF AMERICA."

00:47:30.863 --> 00:47:32.165
FOR THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT

00:47:32.165 --> 00:47:34.767
THE IMMIGRATION ACT
IS A GREAT VICTORY.

00:47:34.767 --> 00:47:38.671
A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN IS UNDER WAY
TO SPREAD THE EUGENIC VISION

00:47:38.671 --> 00:47:40.406
TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:47:42.141 --> 00:47:49.082
STATE FAIRS ARE A FAVORITE PLACE
TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC.

00:47:49.515 --> 00:47:51.684
THAN AT A LIVESTOCK COMPETITION?

00:47:52.985 --> 00:47:54.721
IF YOU COULD CONTROL BREEDING

00:47:54.721 --> 00:47:58.191
YOU COULD CONTROL THE EVOLUTION
AND THE FATE OF A SOCIETY.

00:47:58.191 --> 00:48:00.793
YOU COULD BREED
FOR INTELLIGENCE.

00:48:00.793 --> 00:48:02.962
YOU COULD BREED FOR JUSTICE.

00:48:02.962 --> 00:48:06.432
YOU COULD BREED
FOR GOOD MORAL SENSE.

00:48:06.432 --> 00:48:09.902
YOU COULD BREED
FOR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

00:48:11.204 --> 00:48:13.806
Zenderland:
IT HAD A WIDE APPEAL TO PEOPLE

00:48:13.806 --> 00:48:16.409
ACROSS A BROAD
POLITICAL SPECTRUM.

00:48:22.048 --> 00:48:27.687
THAT MAN MIGHT CONTROL
THE PROCESS OF BIRTH

00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:31.591
THAT MAN MIGHT ELIMINATE
BIRTH DEFECTS...

00:48:31.591 --> 00:48:35.061
THAT MAN MIGHT ACTUALLY
BREED A BETTER HUMAN BEING.

00:48:36.796 --> 00:48:38.965
Osgood:
ALONG WITH THE USUAL
COMPETITIONS--

00:48:38.965 --> 00:48:41.567
BEST LIVESTOCK...

00:48:43.302 --> 00:48:45.905
BEST CROPS...

00:48:46.773 --> 00:48:48.508
AND BEST HOMEMADE GOODS...

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:55.014
THERE'S ALSO THE BEST
HUMAN STOCK COMPETITION.

00:49:09.328 --> 00:49:14.534
BABIES WERE EXAMINED
AND WEIGHED AND MEASURED

00:49:14.534 --> 00:49:17.136
TO DETERMINE
WHO WAS THE MOST ROBUST.

00:49:20.173 --> 00:49:23.209
Osgood:
THERE ARE EVEN "FITTER FAMILIES"
COMPETITIONS.

00:49:24.944 --> 00:49:28.848
ANY HEALTHY AMERICAN FAMILY
CAN ENTER.

00:49:28.848 --> 00:49:31.017
ALL YOU NEED IS
TO TAKE A MEDICAL EXAM

00:49:31.017 --> 00:49:35.354
AN INTELLIGENCE TEST AND SUPPLY
A COMPLETE EUGENIC HISTORY.

00:49:37.957 --> 00:49:39.258
BUT INVARIABLY

00:49:39.258 --> 00:49:42.295
THE WINNERS ARE WHITE,
OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN STOCK.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.066
THIS IS THE PINNACLE
OF THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT

00:49:47.066 --> 00:49:48.367
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:52.271
THERE ARE NEW IMMIGRATION LAWS.

00:49:52.271 --> 00:49:57.477
THERE ARE NEW MARRIAGE LAWS
FORBIDDING MIXED-RACE MARRIAGES.

00:49:57.477 --> 00:50:00.513
THERE ARE EVEN
NEW STERILIZATION LAWS

00:50:00.513 --> 00:50:05.718
PREVENTING CRIMINALS, EPILEPTICS
AND THE INSANE FROM REPRODUCING.

00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:13.092
LAWS ALL DESIGNED
TO PROTECT THE GENE POOL...

00:50:15.695 --> 00:50:18.731
ALL WIDELY ACCLAIMED
BY EUGENICISTS

00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:21.767
ALL WIDELY ACCLAIMED
BIOLOGICAL WISDOM.NSIDER

00:50:28.274 --> 00:50:32.612
THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT
BEGINS TO LOSE ITS CREDIBILITY

00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:37.383
AT LEAST AS SCIENCE, WHEN
A NEW GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS

00:50:37.383 --> 00:50:39.552
BEGIN TO STUDY GENETICS

00:50:39.552 --> 00:50:42.154
WHEN THEY BEGIN TO DISCOVER,
FOR INSTANCE

00:50:42.154 --> 00:50:44.757
THAT EVEN UNDERSTANDING
AN ORGANISM

00:50:44.757 --> 00:50:48.227
AS SIMPLE AS A FRUIT FLY
IS FAR MORE COMPLEX A PROCESS

00:50:48.227 --> 00:50:49.962
THAN WE EVER DREAMED POSSIBLE.

00:50:51.697 --> 00:50:55.167
Osgood:
IN LABORATORIES, LIKE THIS ONE
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS

00:50:55.167 --> 00:50:56.469
SCIENTISTS ARE STUDYING

00:50:56.469 --> 00:50:59.071
THE INHERITANCE PATTERNS
OF FRUIT FLIES.

00:51:00.806 --> 00:51:02.542
BECAUSE FRUIT FLIES
BREED QUICKLY

00:51:02.542 --> 00:51:05.144
IT MAKES THEM IDEAL SUBJECTS
FOR EXPERIMENTS

00:51:05.144 --> 00:51:08.180
TO SEE HOW THEY CHANGE.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.217
BY THE LATE 1920s,
RESEARCH MAKES CLEAR

00:51:11.217 --> 00:51:13.819
THAT GENETICS
WILL NOT BE EXPLAINED

00:51:13.819 --> 00:51:16.856
AS SIMPLY AS
"ONE GENE, ONE TRAIT."

00:51:16.856 --> 00:51:18.591
THE WORK SHOWS THAT MANY TRAITS

00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:20.760
ARE NOT THE PRODUCT
OF SINGLE GENES

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:25.531
BUT ARE POLYGENIC,
THE PRODUCT OF SEVERAL GENES.

00:51:28.568 --> 00:51:31.604
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE
AS EYE COLOR, FOR EXAMPLE

00:51:31.604 --> 00:51:32.905
CAN BE AFFECTED

00:51:32.905 --> 00:51:36.375
BY AS MANY AS SEVEN
DIFFERENT GENETIC VARIABLES.

00:51:36.375 --> 00:51:38.978
AND IF A FRUIT FLY
IS THIS COMPLEX

00:51:38.978 --> 00:51:42.882
WHAT, SCIENTISTS WONDER, DOES
THAT IMPLY FOR HUMAN GENETICS?

00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:48.521
BUT IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND,
THE SCIENCE OF GENETICS

00:51:48.521 --> 00:51:54.160
THE PSEUDOSCIENCE OF EUGENICS

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.762
TO EXPLAIN HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

00:51:58.931 --> 00:52:01.968
ON A SHEER PRACTICAL LEVEL,
BEHAVIORISM, FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:07.607
HAS BECOME FAR MORE PERVASIVE
THAN HARDLY ANYONE REALIZES.

00:52:07.607 --> 00:52:10.643
STILL LEADING THE PACK
IS JOHN WATSON HIMSELF

00:52:10.643 --> 00:52:11.944
WHO HAS LEFT ACADEMIA

00:52:11.944 --> 00:52:15.848
FOR THE FAR MORE LUCRATIVE FIELD
OF ADVERTISING.

00:52:15.848 --> 00:52:18.451
IT'S THE PERFECT HOME
FOR HIS BELIEF

00:52:18.451 --> 00:52:22.788
THAT BEHAVIOR ISN'T FIXED AT ALL
BUT IS SHAPED BY OUTSIDE FORCES.

00:52:27.126 --> 00:52:31.030
Buckley:
WATSON BELIEVED
THAT THE CONSUMER

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:33.199
IS TO THE MANUFACTURER

00:52:33.199 --> 00:52:37.880
WHAT THE GG IS TO
THE EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGIST.

00:52:38.004 --> 00:52:40.173
WHAT WATSON BELIEVED IS

00:52:40.173 --> 00:52:43.643
THAT HE HAD THE TECHNIQUES
AT HIS DISPOSAL

00:52:43.643 --> 00:52:46.680
TO SHAPE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.451
WATSON WENT INTO ADVERTISING
ARMED WITH THE INFORMATION

00:52:51.451 --> 00:52:55.355
AND THE VIEWS HE HAD SHOWN
IN THE CASE OF LITTLE ALBERT

00:52:55.789 --> 00:53:00.126
NAMELY, THAT IF YOU PAIR
TWO SEPARATE THINGS TOGETHER

00:53:00.126 --> 00:53:03.596
YOU CAN GET THE RESPONSES
NORMALLY MADE TO ONE

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.199
ATTACHED TO THE OTHER--

00:53:06.199 --> 00:53:09.669
RESPONSE TO THE LOUD NOISE
BECAME ATTACHED

00:53:09.669 --> 00:53:12.272
TO THE SIGHT
OF THE FURRY ANIMAL.

00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:16.609
IN ADVERTISING, HE WAS
THE PERSON WHO DID THINGS

00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:21.815
LIKE GET CIGARETTES SHOWN
IN THE CONTEXT OF HANDSOME MEN

00:53:21.815 --> 00:53:26.586
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, BIG CARS,
MANSIONS.

00:53:26.586 --> 00:53:30.490
AND WHAT THAT SAID, SO TO SPEAK,
WAS, YOU SMOKE THE CIGARETTE

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:33.526
THAT'S THE ASSOCIATION
THAT YOU WILL HAVE.

00:53:42.635 --> 00:53:45.238
Osgood:
JOHN WATSON
AND THE FIELD OF ADVERTISING

00:53:45.238 --> 00:53:48.708
IS THE PERFECT MARRIAGE
OF THEORY AND PRACTICE.

00:53:50.443 --> 00:53:52.612
IT'S BEHAVIORISM AT WORK--

00:53:52.612 --> 00:53:54.347
CONDITIONING THE MINDS
OF CONSUMERS

00:53:54.347 --> 00:53:56.516
THAT THEY TRULY NEED
THE PRODUCTS

00:53:56.516 --> 00:53:59.552
THAT AMERICAN BUSINESS
WANTS TO SELL.

00:53:59.552 --> 00:54:03.022
THE CONDITIONING
THAT WORKED SO WELL IN THE LAB

00:54:03.022 --> 00:54:05.191
WORKS EQUALLY WELL IN THE FIELD.

00:54:12.132 --> 00:54:16.903
Maher:
THE BEHAVIORISTS' ASSERTION
THAT WITH APPROPRIATE CONTROL

00:54:16.903 --> 00:54:21.674
ONE COULD SHAPE AN INDIVIDUAL
TO DO ANYTHING, TO BE ANYTHING

00:54:21.674 --> 00:54:26.880
ALSO, OF COURSE, MEANT
THAT A PERSON COULD BE SHAPED

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.217
TO EVIL PURPOSES
AS WELL AS BENEVOLENT ONES.

00:54:31.217 --> 00:54:36.422
(trumpet blaring,
drums beating)

00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:41.194
Osgood:
ONE PERSON WHO TRULY UNDERSTANDS

00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:43.363
THE MANIPULATION
OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR

00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:47.267
AND ITS TERRIFYING POTENTIAL IS
A RISING POLITICIAN IN GERMANY.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.472
ADOLF HITLER AND HIS NAZI PARTY
COME TO POWER IN THE EARLY '30s

00:54:52.472 --> 00:54:55.942
BY USING EVERY TECHNIQUE
PROPAGANDA HAS TO OFFER

00:54:55.942 --> 00:54:58.111
TO INFLUENCE THE GERMAN PEOPLE.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.485
IN FILMS LIKE THIS ONE

00:55:05.485 --> 00:55:08.087
HE PROMOTES THE CREDO
OF THE NAZI PARTY:

00:55:08.087 --> 00:55:13.293
BEAUTY, STRENGTH, HEALTH--

00:55:13.293 --> 00:55:16.329
THE EUGENIC IDEAL.

00:55:19.365 --> 00:55:21.968
IT IS IN HITLER'S CAMPAIGN
FOR POWER

00:55:21.968 --> 00:55:25.872
THAT THE CENTURY'S TWO OPPOSING
VIEWS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR--

00:55:26.306 --> 00:55:30.643
WHETHER BEHAVIOR IS FIXED
OR MALLEABLE-- COME TOGETHER

00:55:30.643 --> 00:55:34.113
WITH NO APPARENT CONTRADICTION
TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE.

00:55:38.885 --> 00:55:43.656
THE IRONY IS
THAT HITLER HIMSELF

00:55:43.656 --> 00:55:46.259
BELIEVING IN RACIAL SUPERIORITY

00:55:46.259 --> 00:55:50.163
USED SOCIAL MANIPULATION
CONSTANTLY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE

00:55:50.163 --> 00:55:54.067
TO DO WHAT HE WANTED IN THE
SERVICE OF RACIAL SUPERIORITY.

00:55:54.067 --> 00:55:56.669
SO HIS PROPAGANDA...
HE MOLDED PEOPLE

00:55:56.669 --> 00:56:02.742
IN THE DIRECTION THAT HE SAW
THEM, THAT HE WANTED THEM TO GO

00:56:02.742 --> 00:56:04.911
HE MOLDED THEM THROUGH
DEMONSTRATIONS, THROUGH RALLIES

00:56:04.911 --> 00:56:10.116
THROUGH PROPAGANDISTIC MESSAGES,
THROUGH THE FILM AND ART.

00:56:10.116 --> 00:56:11.417
HE MOLDED PEOPLE...

00:56:11.417 --> 00:56:13.586
THAT AT THE SAME TIME
HE WAS TELLING THEM:

00:56:13.586 --> 00:56:15.755
"YOU ARE BIOLOGICALLY
DETERMINED.

00:56:15.755 --> 00:56:18.791
YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE,
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE."

00:56:22.262 --> 00:56:26.599
Osgood:
PROPAGANDA IS JUST THE BEGINNING
OF THE NAZI AGENDA.

00:56:31.371 --> 00:56:35.275
FIRST, THEY OFFER "FITTER"
FAMILIES FINANCIAL REWARDS

00:56:35.275 --> 00:56:37.877
FOR HAVING LOTS
OF BETTER BABIES.

00:56:42.215 --> 00:56:45.251
NEXT, THEY START TO RID GERMANY
OF PEOPLE

00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:47.854
THEY FEEL WILL POISON THE RACE.

00:56:51.758 --> 00:56:56.963
BY MID-1EXTREME STERILIZATION L
AWS

00:56:56.963 --> 00:57:00.433
PARTLY MODELED ON
AMERICAN EUGENIC POLICIES.

00:57:03.903 --> 00:57:06.506
EUGENICISTS THOUGHT
THAT STERILIZATION

00:57:06.506 --> 00:57:10.410
WOULD STOP THE PROLIFERATION

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:15.181
OF UNDESIRABLE ASPECTS
OF THE POPULATION

00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:18.217
BY PREVENTING THE BIRTH--
IN BLUNT TERMS--

00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:22.989
OF FOLKS THEY FIND
AS UNDESIRABLE

00:57:22.989 --> 00:57:24.724
WOULD BE THE NEATEST SOLUTION.

00:57:24.724 --> 00:57:27.760
AND THEY WOULD SAY THAT
YOU DO THE SOCIETY A FAVOR

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.495
BY NOT REPRODUCING.

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.399
Osgood:
BY THE EARLY 1940s

00:57:33.399 --> 00:57:37.737
HITLER'S PLAN TO PURIFY
GERMANIC CULTURE ESCALATES.

00:57:39.906 --> 00:57:41.641
NO LONGER IS IT ONLY

00:57:41.641 --> 00:57:45.979
A MATTER OF STERILIZING
"TAINTED" INDIVIDUALS.

00:57:45.979 --> 00:57:49.015
NOW THOSE GROUPS CONSIDERED
A MENACE TO THE RACE--

00:57:49.015 --> 00:57:52.051
LIKE JEWS, HOMOSEXUALS
AND GYPSIES--

00:57:52.051 --> 00:57:56.389
MUST BE SEGREGATED, THEN SENT
TO DEATH CAMPS TO BE KILLED.

00:57:58.992 --> 00:58:03.329
BY 1945, MILLIONS HAVE DIED
IN THE NAME OF EUGENICS.

00:58:09.836 --> 00:58:12.438
BUT IN THE END,
THE STORY OF EUGENICS

00:58:12.438 --> 00:58:15.041
WOULD PROVE THE OPPOSITE
OF ITS CORE BELIEF:

00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:18.077
THAT HUMAN BEHAVIOR
IS BIOLOGICALLY DETERMINED

00:58:18.077 --> 00:58:21.114
FIXED AND UNCHANGING.

00:58:21.114 --> 00:58:25.018
INSTEAD IT SHOWS
THAT PEOPLE CAN BE SO MALLEABLE

00:58:25.018 --> 00:58:28.488
THEY CAN LEARN TO DO
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING

00:58:28.488 --> 00:58:30.223
NO MATTER HOW OUS.

00:58:33.693 --> 00:58:36.295
Harrington:
THE EXCESSES OF
HITLER'S GERMANY--

00:58:36.295 --> 00:58:41.008
THE FACT THAT MASS MURDER,
THAT GENOCIDE HAD BEEN COMMITTED

00:58:41.008 --> 00:58:43.236
IN THE NAME OF RACIAL PURITY

00:58:43.236 --> 00:58:48.007
IN THE NAME OF A EUGENICALLY
INSPIRED RACIAL CLEANSING--

00:58:48.007 --> 00:58:49.742
WAS VERY FRIGHTENING TO PEOPLE

00:58:49.742 --> 00:58:53.212
EVEN TO PEOPLE THAT PREVIOUSLY
MAY HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED

00:58:53.212 --> 00:58:54.514
TO A KIND OF IDEALISM

00:58:54.514 --> 00:58:57.116
THAT WAS ALSO PART
OF THE IDEA OF EUGENICS.

00:58:57.116 --> 00:58:59.719
AND SO YOU SEE IN THE YEARS
AFTER WORLD WAR II

00:59:00.153 --> 00:59:04.490
A REAL PULLING BACK FROM
EXPLANATIONS OF MENTAL ILLNESS

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.527
OF INTELLIGENCE,
OF ALL SORTS OF BEHAVIORS

00:59:07.527 --> 00:59:09.695
ROOTED IN GENETIC UNDERSTANDINGS

00:59:09.695 --> 00:59:14.033
AND A TURN INSTEAD TOWARDS
ENVIRONMENTAL UNDERSTANDINGS.

00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:21.476
IN THE 1950s

00:59:21.476 --> 00:59:24.513
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
SCANNED THE DAILY PAPERS

00:59:24.513 --> 00:59:28.417
FOR THE LATEST ADVICE
FROM "DEAR ABBY" OR ANN LANDERS.

00:59:28.417 --> 00:59:30.152
THESE TWIN SISTERS
FROM SIOUX CITY, IOWA

00:59:30.585 --> 00:59:33.188
ARE THE MOST POPULAR ADVICE
COLUMNISTS IN THE COUNTRY.

00:59:33.188 --> 00:59:35.357
AMERICANS LOVE ADVICE.

00:59:35.357 --> 00:59:38.393
THEY'RE HELL-BENT
ON SELF-IMPROVEMENT

00:59:38.393 --> 00:59:40.562
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS

00:59:40.562 --> 00:59:43.165
AND GUIDED BY
A NEAR-RELIGIOUS BELIEF

00:59:43.165 --> 00:59:46.201
THAT THEY CAN ALWAYS CHANGE
FOR THE BETTER.

00:59:46.201 --> 00:59:50.105
THE OPPOSITE VIEW--
THAT BEHAVIOR IS FIXED AT BIRTH

00:59:50.105 --> 00:59:51.840
AND CAN'T BE CHANGED--

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.443
IS STILL ASSOCIATED
WITH NAZI GERMANY

00:59:54.876 --> 00:59:57.913
WHERE EUGENICS WAS USED
TO JUSTIFY GENOCIDE.

00:59:57.913 --> 01:00:01.383
SO AMERICANS EMBRACE SCIENTISTS
WHO BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE--

01:00:01.383 --> 01:00:05.720
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO IRONMENT T
HAT COUNTS

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.889
AND VIRTUALLY ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE.

01:00:10.492 --> 01:00:14.396
THESE ARE OPTIMISTIC TIMES
IN 1945.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:18.300
THE SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT AGAINST
TOTALITARIANISM OVERSEAS

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.770
ARE RETURNING HOME TO THE MOST
POWERFUL NATION IN THE WORLD.

01:00:24.806 --> 01:00:27.843
RETURNING TO LIVES
INTERRUPTED...

01:00:27.843 --> 01:00:30.011
TO GIRLFRIENDS...

01:00:30.011 --> 01:00:32.614
TO FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND.

01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:36.952
WITH THE WAR FINALLY OVER
AND VICTORY WON

01:00:36.952 --> 01:00:40.422
ANYTHING, AND EVERYTHING,
SEEMS POSSIBLE.

01:00:40.422 --> 01:00:45.627
Maher:
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT AFTER
THE STUNNING ACHIEVEMENTS

01:00:45.627 --> 01:00:48.663
OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
IN THE VICTORY OF WORLD WAR II

01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:52.567
THAT THERE WAS, IN PRINCIPLE,
NO LIMIT TO WHAT IT COULD DO

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:56.037
NOW IN THE INTEREST
OF THE GOOD LIFE AFTER THE WAR.

01:00:56.037 --> 01:00:58.206
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD ALLOWED
US TO WIN THE WAR

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.243
TO DEFEAT HITLER,
TO DEFEAT THE NAZIS

01:01:01.243 --> 01:01:02.544
THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD NOW

01:01:02.544 --> 01:01:05.580
BE PUT INTO THE SERVICE
OF LIBERATING INDIVIDUALS

01:01:06.014 --> 01:01:07.749
OF HELPING THEM
DEVELOP THEMSELVES.

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:09.484
SO IT WAS A TRANSLATION, I THINK

01:01:09.484 --> 01:01:14.256
OF TECHNOLOGY FROM
AN EMPHASIS ON WEAPONRY

01:01:14.256 --> 01:01:16.858
TO A TECHNOLOGY ON AN EMPHASIS
ON THE HUMAN SPIRIT

01:01:17.292 --> 01:01:19.027
AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF HUMAN NATURE.

01:01:19.027 --> 01:01:21.196
AND WE COULD TRANSLATE
THAT EXPERTISE

01:01:21.196 --> 01:01:22.931
FROM ONE DOMAIN TO THE OTHER.

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:28.570
THIS SETUP MAKES
ANY DAY WASH DAY FOR ME.

01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:34.209
AND I CAN DO MY DRYING
IN ANY KIND OF WEATHER.

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.245
Osgood:
BY THE 1950s

01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:39.848
MANY AMERICANS DEVELOP
A NEARLY INSATIABLE APPETITE

01:01:40.282 --> 01:01:42.017
FOR ALL THE NEW THINGS

01:01:42.017 --> 01:01:46.354
THAT CAN BE MANUFACTURED,
BOUGHT, SOLD AND CONSUMED.

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:49.391
Singer:
WE SEE THE IDEA THAT WE COULD
ENGINEER THE HOUSEHOLD.

01:01:49.391 --> 01:01:51.126
WE COULD ENGINEER THE FAMILY.

01:01:51.126 --> 01:01:53.728
WE COULD ENGINEER ALLOCIETY
.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.404
Osgood:
WHILE SOME SCIENTISTS ENGINEER
SHINY NEW CONSUMER GOODS

01:02:02.404 --> 01:02:04.139
FOR AN EAGER PUBLIC

01:02:04.139 --> 01:02:07.175
HARVARD PSYCHOLOGIST
B.F. SKINNER SEEKS NOTHING LESS

01:02:07.175 --> 01:02:09.344
THAN THE ENGINEERING
OF HUMAN NATURE.

01:02:12.814 --> 01:02:16.284
IN EXPERIMENTS WITH SUBJECTS
AS SIMPLE AS PIGEONS

01:02:16.284 --> 01:02:20.188
SKINNER DECLARES THAT WITH
THE RIGHT SOCIAL ENGINEERING

01:02:20.188 --> 01:02:23.224
WE CAN CREATE A NEW BREED
OF HUMAN BEING.

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:28.863
SKINNER IS FIRMLY IN
THE BEHAVIORIST TRADITION

01:02:28.863 --> 01:02:31.466
PIONEERED BY JOHN WATSON
IN THE 1920s.

01:02:31.466 --> 01:02:36.237
LIKE WATSON, SKINNER CONTENDS
THAT WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS

01:02:36.237 --> 01:02:39.274
WE CAN PREDICT
AND CONTROL BEHAVIOR.

01:02:39.274 --> 01:02:41.876
SKINNER REALLY INHERITED
THE MANTLE FROM WATSON

01:02:41.876 --> 01:02:43.564
OF BEHAVIORISM IN THIS COUNTRY

01:02:43.564 --> 01:02:46.214
BUT IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
TO THINK ABOUT

01:02:46.214 --> 01:02:49.684
HOW THERE'S A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE
IN THE WAY THEY WENT ABOUT IT.

01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:50.986
WATSON, AS WE KNOW

01:02:50.986 --> 01:02:54.022
ENDED UP BECOMING
AN ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE

01:02:54.022 --> 01:02:58.360
ENDED UP EMBRACING THE AMERICAN
VALUE SYSTEM AS IT EXISTED.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.661
SKINNER WAS DIFFERENT.

01:02:59.661 --> 01:03:00.962
SKINNER WAS A VISIONARY.

01:03:00.962 --> 01:03:03.565
SKINNER FELT THAT
THROUGH BEHAVIORISM

01:03:03.565 --> 01:03:07.035
HE COULD INFLUENCE THE WORLD
TOWARDS A GREATER HUMANITY--

01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:10.939
NOT MEET HUMANITY WHERE IT WAS,
BUT TAKE HUMANITY TO A NEW PLACE

01:03:10.939 --> 01:03:13.108
THROUGH THE PRINCIPLES
OF BEHAVIORISM.

01:03:13.108 --> 01:03:15.710
Osgood:
PICKING UP WHERE
WATSON LEFT OFF

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.879
SKINNER WANTS TO DO
THE RIGOROUS SCIENCE

01:03:17.879 --> 01:03:20.482
TO PROVE THAT ENVIRONMENT
IS EVERYTHING.

01:03:20.482 --> 01:03:22.651
CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT,
HE ARGUES

01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:24.819
AND YOU CAN CHANGE
THE INDIVIDUAL...

01:03:26.121 --> 01:03:28.289
OR, IN SKINNER'S CASE,
THE PIGEON.

01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:31.326
Maher:
SKINNER HIMSELF

01:03:31.326 --> 01:03:33.495
WAS A BORN GADGETEER.

01:03:33.495 --> 01:03:36.097
HE HAD IN HIS OWN EARLY YEARS...

01:03:36.097 --> 01:03:39.134
AS A BOY, FOR EXAMPLE,
HE DEV WAYS

01:03:39.134 --> 01:03:43.038
-
AS A BOY, FOR EXAMPLE,
I THINK IT WAS CRANBERRIES--E-

01:03:43.038 --> 01:03:44.773
FROM UNRIPE CRANBERRIES.

01:03:44.773 --> 01:03:47.375
HE INVENTED A CANNON
THAT WOULD SHOOT THINGS

01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:49.544
OVER HIS NEIGHBOR'S FENCE.

01:03:49.544 --> 01:03:52.147
THIS WAS
THE KIND OF MAN HE WAS.

01:03:52.147 --> 01:03:55.617
HE WAS DEVELOPING NEW WAYS
TO DO EVERYDAY THINGS

01:03:55.617 --> 01:03:59.521
IN WAYS THAT WERE MORE
COMFORTABLE, MORE EFFICIENT.

01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:01.690
Osgood:
DURING WORLD WAR II

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.726
SKINNER HAD DEVELOPED
A PIGEON GUIDANCE DEVICE

01:04:04.726 --> 01:04:06.895
FOR THE U.S. MILITARY.

01:04:06.895 --> 01:04:09.931
WHILE THE RUSSIANS
HAD DOGS CARRYING BOMBS

01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:13.401
AND THE SWEDES HAD SEALS
TO BLOW UP MINES

01:04:13.401 --> 01:04:15.570
SKINNER HAD A PLAN OF HIS OWN:

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:20.341
TEACHING PIGEONS TO GUIDE
MISSILES TO AN ENEMY TARGET.

01:04:21.643 --> 01:04:23.378
AT THE TIME, HOWEVER

01:04:23.378 --> 01:04:25.113
THE AD
NO MISSILES TO GUIDE.

01:04:27.282 --> 01:04:30.752
BUT SKINNER'S PIGEON RESEARCH
DID NOT GO TO WASTE.

01:04:32.053 --> 01:04:35.523
HE DEVELOPS A SYSTEM
CALLED "OPERANT CONDITIONING"

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.825
TO PROVE THAT A BEHAVIOR

01:04:36.825 --> 01:04:40.295
WILL BE REPEATED BY A SUBJECT
WHEN REWARDED.

01:04:40.295 --> 01:04:43.331
REPETITION LEADS
TO REINFORCEMENT...

01:04:43.331 --> 01:04:46.801
REINFORCEMENT
TO CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR.

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:49.404
Announcer:
THIS HUNGRY PIGEON
IS MOVING ABOUT

01:04:49.404 --> 01:04:51.573
MORE OR LESS AT RANDOM.

01:04:51.573 --> 01:04:55.910
SOMETIMES IT TURNS ITS HEAD
TO THE LEFT.

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:58.079
WHEN IT DOES, WE REINFORCE
THAT MOVEMENT

01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:01.116
BY GIVING THE PIGEON ACCESS
TO A DISH OF GRAIN.

01:05:03.718 --> 01:05:07.188
Osgood:
SKINNER THEN WAITS FOR IT
TO TURN FURTHER.

01:05:08.923 --> 01:05:10.225
AGAIN, MORE FOOD.

01:05:12.827 --> 01:05:15.864
ULTIMATELY THE PIGEON WILL TURN
IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE

01:05:15.864 --> 01:05:19.768
HAVING LEARNED THAT ONLY WHEN
HE TURNS WILL HE BE REWARDED.

01:05:24.105 --> 01:05:26.708
Singer:
WHAT SKINNER WAS ABLE TO DO

01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:30.612
IN VERY CAREFULLY CONTROLLED
STUDIES WITH ANIMAL MODELS

01:05:30.612 --> 01:05:34.082
WAS TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT WHOLE CHAINS OF BEHAVIORS

01:05:34.082 --> 01:05:36.251
COULD BE BUILT STEP-BY-STEP

01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:39.287
SO THAT LITERALLY YOU COULD
TEACH A PIGEON

01:05:39.287 --> 01:05:41.022
TO DO COMPLICATED BEHAVIORS

01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:43.625
THAT NO ONE WOULD
HAVE PREDICTED POSSIBLE.

01:05:47.095 --> 01:05:48.396
Osgood:
AND SKINNER BELIEVES

01:05:48.396 --> 01:05:50.999
THAT IF IT WORKS FOR PIGEONS,
WHY NOT PEOPLE?

01:05:52.734 --> 01:05:54.903
IN SKINNER'S MIND,
BEHAVIOR IS BEHAVIOR

01:05:55.336 --> 01:05:58.373
UP AND DOWN
THE EVOLUTIONARY SCALE

01:05:58.373 --> 01:05:59.674
AND IT IS ALL LEARNED.

01:06:03.578 --> 01:06:06.181
ONE OF THE GREAT SUCCESSES
IS IN EDUCATION.

01:06:06.181 --> 01:06:09.217
PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT
TO DO MORE COMPLICATED TASKS

01:06:09.217 --> 01:06:11.820
THAN ANYONE
HAD THOUGHT POSSIBLE

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:18.326
BY BREAKING DOWN BEHAVIOR
INTO SMALL STEPS

01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:26.134
THE ESSENCE
OF SKINNER'S WORK WAS

01:06:26.134 --> 01:06:28.736
THAT WE COULD MANIPULATE
THE ENVIRONMENT

01:06:28.736 --> 01:06:31.339
IN WAYS THAT WOULD
PERMIT US TO PRODUCE

01:06:31.339 --> 01:06:33.942
ANY KIND OF BEHAVIOR
THAT WE WISHED

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:36.544
AND WE COULD DEVELOP INDIVIDUALS
IN WAYS

01:06:36.544 --> 01:06:40.448
THAT MADE EVERY POSSIBLE FUTURE
OPEN TO THEM.

01:06:40.882 --> 01:06:43.918
Osgood:
THE IDEA THAT ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE

01:06:43.918 --> 01:06:46.955
HAS ENORMOUS APPEAL
IN THE '50s--

01:06:46.955 --> 01:06:49.557
A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY
IS CHANGING

01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:51.292
AT A MIND-BOGGLING PACE.

01:06:51.292 --> 01:06:53.420
IT'S THE BABY-BOOM ERA.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:56.497
MOTHERS WHO WORKED
DURING THE WAR

01:06:56.497 --> 01:06:59.100
ARE STAYING AT HOME
TO RAISE KIDS.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.136
WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND UNPRECEDENTED MOBILITY

01:07:02.136 --> 01:07:04.739
YOUNG COUPLES ARE MOVING
AROUND THE COUNTRY

01:07:04.739 --> 01:07:08.643
LIVING FAR FROM THEIR PARENTS
AND EXTENDED FAMILIES.

01:07:08.643 --> 01:07:12.547
MOTHERS WANTING CHILD-REARING
ADVICE IN THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD

01:07:12.547 --> 01:07:18.620
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TURN
TO THEIR OWN MOTHERS.

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.788
AND HIS POPULAR BOOK.

01:07:20.788 --> 01:07:22.957
DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK
OFFERS ADVICE

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.126
TO MILLIONS
OF WORRIED YOUNG PARENTS

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:29.464
ABOUT HOW TO RAISE THEIR KIDS
IN THE PROPER ENVIRONMENT.

01:07:29.464 --> 01:07:32.500
HE COVERS EVERYTHING
FROM DIAPERS TO DISCIPLINE

01:07:32.934 --> 01:07:36.404
BORROWING IDEAS MORE FROM FREUD
THAN FROM SKINNER.

01:07:36.404 --> 01:07:39.874
HIS PARENTING MANUAL
SELLS MORE COPIES

01:07:39.874 --> 01:07:44.212
THAN ANY BOOK IN HISTORY
SAVE ONE-- THE BIBLE.

01:07:44.212 --> 01:07:47.248
Woman:
DR. SPOCK APPEALED TO THE NOTION

01:07:47.248 --> 01:07:50.285
THAT PARENTS AND EXPERTS

01:07:50.285 --> 01:07:53.755
WERE KIND OF IN THE
CHILD-NURTURE BUSINESS TOGETHER

01:07:53.755 --> 01:07:55.924
THAT THEY WERE COOPERATING

01:07:55.924 --> 01:08:01.562
TO PRODUCE HEALTHY CHILDREN,
DEMOCRATIC PERSONALITIES

01:08:01.562 --> 01:08:08.069
AND THAT CHILD-REARING MANUALS
LIKEBABY AND CHILD CARE

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:14.575
COULD BE A USEFUL AID TO THOSE
KIND OF HOME-FRONT SCIENTISTS.

01:08:14.575 --> 01:08:18.913
Osgood:
HOME-FRONT SCIENTISTS
HUNGRY FOR EXPERT ADVICE.

01:08:19.347 --> 01:08:22.383
AND POPULAR TELEVISION
SATISFIES THEM

01:08:22.383 --> 01:08:25.420
BY BRINGING THE LATEST
IN LAB SCIENCE

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.155
RIGHT INTO THEIR LIVING ROOMS.

01:08:27.155 --> 01:08:31.926
Announcer:
Conquest--the search
for new knowledge

01:08:31.926 --> 01:08:36.698
about our universe,
our world and ourselves.

01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:41.469
This monkey is an orphan

01:08:41.469 --> 01:08:44.505
separated from his mother
since the day of his birth.

01:08:44.505 --> 01:08:48.409
Literally his life
hangs by a thread--

01:08:48.409 --> 01:08:51.446
a soft cheesecloth pad

01:08:51.446 --> 01:08:54.916
that is his only companion,
his only comfort.

01:08:54.916 --> 01:08:58.386
Once a day, the pad
is removed for cleaning.

01:08:58.386 --> 01:09:01.856
Osgood:
THIS IS THE LABORATORY
OF PSYCHOLOGIST HARRY HARLOW.

01:09:01.856 --> 01:09:04.892
Announcer:
...is troubled, distressed.

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:09.664
Osgood:
HE IS STUDYING MONKEYS TO BETTER
UNDERSTAND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS.

01:09:09.664 --> 01:09:12.266
Announcer:
He may die for want of love.

01:09:12.266 --> 01:09:16.170
Osgood:
HARLOW BELIEVES HE CAN USE
SCIENCE TO STUDY LOVE.

01:09:17.905 --> 01:09:20.074
WITH A SERIES
OF PIONEERING EXPERIMENTS

01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:23.544
HE EXPLORES TERRITORY WHERE
FEW SCIENTISTS HAVE VENTURED.

01:09:23.544 --> 01:09:25.279
Herman:
HARLOW SAID

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:30.051
THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS
A SCIENCE OF LOVE, FOR EXAMPLE--

01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:32.220
THAT LOVE, THE KIND OF INTIMACY

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.256
THAT CHARACTERIZED RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN MOTHERS AND INFANTS--

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:40.461
ALTHOUGH IN HIS CASE
HE STUDIED MONKEYS--

01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:43.931
THAT YOU LITERALLY COULD
MOVE LOVE INTO A LABORATORY

01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:45.233
PUT IT UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:48.703
Osgood:
HARLOW IS STUDYING LOVE

01:09:48.703 --> 01:09:51.305
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IT MAKES
AN INDELIBLE IMPACT

01:09:51.305 --> 01:09:52.607
ON A YOUNG LIFE.

01:09:54.342 --> 01:09:57.378
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
A MOTHER AND HER CHILD--

01:09:57.378 --> 01:10:00.415
WHAT HARLOW CALLS OUR
EARLIEST SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT--

01:10:00.848 --> 01:10:04.318
COULD HOLD THE KEY TO EXPLAINING
BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT LIFE.

01:10:04.318 --> 01:10:08.656
HARLOW DESIGNS A SET
OF INGENIOUS EXPERIMENTS:

01:10:08.656 --> 01:10:10.825
HE RAISES A BABY MONKEY

01:10:10.825 --> 01:10:17.331
ALLOWING IT TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN TWO SURROGATE MOTHERS:

01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:20.802
AND A CLOTH MOTHER
THAT DOESN'T--

01:10:20.802 --> 01:10:22.537
A CLOTH MOTHER
THAT HARLOW THINKS

01:10:22.537 --> 01:10:26.874
MIGHT PROVIDE SOMETHING ELSE:
COMFORT AND LOVE.

01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:31.646
Announcer:
Here's Baby 106

01:10:31.646 --> 01:10:34.682
weaned on a wire mother.

01:10:38.152 --> 01:10:41.189
He's going
to the wire mother.

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.526
Osgood:
BUT THIS INFANT QUICKLY RUNS
TO THE CLOTH MOTHER

01:10:45.526 --> 01:10:48.996
WHERE HE WILL STAY FOR
THE NEXT 18 HOURS, CUDDLING...

01:10:55.937 --> 01:10:59.841
IN HARLOW'S MIND, CHOOSING
NURTURING OVER SUSTENANCE.

01:11:01.576 --> 01:11:05.480
IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT, HARLOW
CREATES A FEARFUL SITUATION.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.648
WHOM DOES THE INFANT
TURN TO NOW?

01:11:07.648 --> 01:11:12.420
Announcer:
Let's find out what his
reactions to his mother are

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.022
when we frighten him.

01:11:18.059 --> 01:11:20.588
He's scared, all right

01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:24.565
and he does what any child
will do in a similar situation:

01:11:24.565 --> 01:11:27.602
he was runningtohis mother
to touch her

01:11:27.602 --> 01:11:29.770
to drive away his fear.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:35.843
(screeching)

01:11:35.843 --> 01:11:39.747
Osgood:
TO HARLOW, THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF COMFORT

01:11:39.747 --> 01:11:42.350
AND LOVE-- EVEN MORE THAN FOOD--

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:44.952
THAT SEEMS CRUCIAL
TO ALL THESE MONKEYS.

01:11:46.687 --> 01:11:50.158
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE INFANT IS RAISED ALONE

01:11:50.158 --> 01:11:52.760
WITHOUT ANY MOTHER AT ALL,
WIRE OR CLOTH?

01:11:55.363 --> 01:11:57.965
IN THIS SITUATION,
THE ORPHAN MONKEY STAYS ALONE.

01:11:57.965 --> 01:12:01.002
HE WON'T EVEN GO TO
THE CLOTH MOTHER WHEN FRIGHTENED

01:12:01.002 --> 01:12:04.038
BUT RETREATS INTO HIS OWN WORLD.

01:12:04.472 --> 01:12:07.508
HARLOW BELIEVES HE HAS SHOWN
HOW WANT OF LOVE

01:12:07.508 --> 01:12:09.677
CAN DAMAGE AN INFANT FOR LIFE

01:12:09.677 --> 01:12:14.015
AND HE WORRIES THE SAME IS TRUE
FOR PEOPLE.

01:12:17.051 --> 01:12:18.352
IN HARRY HARLOW'S EXPERIMENT

01:12:18.352 --> 01:12:22.256
WAS THAT EARLY EXPERIENCE
AND THE ENVIRONMENT WERE CRUCIAL

01:12:22.256 --> 01:12:25.293
TO THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT
OF THE INFANT CHILD

01:12:25.293 --> 01:12:27.461
AND THAT IN A SENSE,
IF YOU MESSED UP

01:12:27.461 --> 01:12:30.064
IF THE RIGHT KIND OF
MATERNAL PRESENCE WAS NOT THERE

01:12:30.498 --> 01:12:33.534
DURING THE CRITICAL YEARS,
THEN THAT INFANT MIGHT GROW UP

01:12:33.534 --> 01:12:37.004
TO BE AN ADULT INCAPABLE OF
FORMING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS

01:12:37.004 --> 01:12:38.739
WITH OTHER KINDS OF PEOPLE.

01:12:40.474 --> 01:12:43.945
Osgood:
WHILE HARLOW FEELS THAT
A BAD ENVIRONMENT CAN DAMAGE YOU

01:12:43.945 --> 01:12:45.680
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO BELIEVE

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.451
THAT A THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT
COULD PROVIDE THE CURE.

01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:53.921
CHIEF AMONG THEM
ARE PSYCHOANALYSTS.

01:12:53.921 --> 01:12:59.126
BY THE 1950s, PSYCHOANALYSIS
HAS TAKEN AMERICA BY STORM

01:12:59.126 --> 01:13:03.898
EVEN THOUGH FREUD HIMSELF
HAD DIED OVER A DECADE EARLIER.

01:13:03.898 --> 01:13:07.368
Woman:
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL OPTIMISM
IN AMERICAN SOCIETY

01:13:07.368 --> 01:13:12.139
THAT SAYS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE
TO FIX ALMOST ANY PROBLEM.

01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:14.742
AND THE ATTITUDE
OF PSYCHOANALYSIS

01:13:14.742 --> 01:13:19.080
THAT ULTIMATELY EVERY DIFFICULTY
COULD BE UNDERSTOOD

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.550
SEEN AS MEANINGFUL AND
POTENTIALLY, AT LEAST, CHANGED

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:25.586
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS
VERY APPEALING TO AMERICANS.

01:13:25.586 --> 01:13:29.056
Osgood:
FREUD ORIGINALLY DESIGNED
PSYCHOANALYSIS

01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:31.225
TO HELP NEUROTIC INDIVIDUALS--

01:13:31.225 --> 01:13:38.165
ESSENTIALLY NORMAL PEOPLE
DISABLED BY INNER CONFLICTS.

01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:41.996
BUT HIS AMERICAN DISCIPLES
HERWISE.

01:13:44.672 --> 01:13:46.841
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
OF THE 1950s

01:13:46.841 --> 01:13:49.443
WAS HOW POWERFUL WOULD
PSYCHOANALYSIS BE

01:13:49.443 --> 01:13:51.612
AS AN INTERVENTION,
AS A THERAPY?

01:13:51.612 --> 01:13:55.082
WAS IT ONLY GOING TO BE
A THERAPY FOR THE WORRIED-WELL

01:13:55.082 --> 01:13:57.685
FOR THE MILDLY NEUROTIC,
FOR THE ANXIOUS?

01:13:57.685 --> 01:14:00.721
OR COULD IT REALLY PACK
A SUFFICIENT THERAPEUTIC PUNCH

01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:03.758
TO HELP THE MOST BRUTALLY
MENTALLY ILL OF OUR SOCIETY

01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:05.059
THE SCHIZOPHRENICS?

01:14:07.662 --> 01:14:10.698
Osgood:
ONE OF THE PSYCHOANALYSTS
WHO BELIEVES IT CAN

01:14:10.698 --> 01:14:13.301
IS FRIEDA FROMM-REICHMANN.

01:14:13.734 --> 01:14:15.903
TRAINED FIRST IN GERMANY
AS A NEUROLOGIST

01:14:15.903 --> 01:14:19.373
SHE BELIEVES DEEPLY
THAT INSIDE EVERY PATIENT

01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:21.542
NO MATTER
HOW SERIOUSLY DISTURBED

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.049
IF THE TREATMENT IS RIGHT.

01:14:28.049 --> 01:14:31.519
Hornstein:
SHE DEVELOPED THIS ATTITUDE
PARTLY HAVING WORKED

01:14:31.519 --> 01:14:34.555
WITH BRAIN-INJURED PATIENTS
IN WORLD WAR I

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:36.724
WHERE EVEN THOSE PATIENTS

01:14:36.724 --> 01:14:39.327
WHO HAD BEEN HIT
BY SHELLS AND GASSED

01:14:39.327 --> 01:14:43.230
WERE PEOPLE WHO COULD RECOVER
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:45.399
AND HER WHOLE APPROACH TO THEM

01:14:45.399 --> 01:14:48.436
WAS BASED ON THEIR POTENTIAL
FOR RECOVERY

01:14:48.436 --> 01:14:53.207
NOT FOR WHAT WAS DAMAGED.

01:14:53.207 --> 01:14:55.376
SHE APPLIED
THIS SAME ORIENTATION

01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:58.412
AND ALWAYS SEARCHED
FOR THE PART OF THE PATIENT

01:14:58.412 --> 01:15:00.581
THAT WAS STILL INTACT.

01:15:01.882 --> 01:15:05.228
Osgood:
WHEN FROMM-REICHMANN EMIGRATES
TO THE UNITED STATES

01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:11.859
BUILT AS A RESORT IN THE 1890s

01:15:11.859 --> 01:15:14.462
ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF WASHINGTON, D.C.

01:15:14.462 --> 01:15:17.498
IT IS LATER CONVERTED
INTO A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

01:15:19.233 --> 01:15:22.269
BY THE 1950s, CHESTNUT LODGE
IS ONE OF A HANDFUL

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:25.306
OF PRIVATE PSYCHLS
IN THE COUNTRY

01:15:25.306 --> 01:15:29.210
WHICH OFFERS PSYCHOTHERAPY
AS ITS PRIMARY TREATMENT.

01:15:31.812 --> 01:15:35.282
ONLY THE WELL-HEELED
CAN AFFORD TO COME HERE

01:15:35.282 --> 01:15:37.885
AND THE WAITING LIST IS LONG.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:44.392
HERE PSYCHOTHERAPY
AIS USED TO TREAT PSYCHOTICS. W

01:15:44.392 --> 01:15:46.127
THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CAMP
WILL FACE

01:15:46.127 --> 01:15:47.862
ITS GREATEST CHALLENGE.

01:15:49.597 --> 01:15:53.836
Man:
CHESTNUT LODGE
WAS A STRANGE PLACE

01:15:53.836 --> 01:15:56.537
ALMOST A MYTHICAL ONE

01:15:56.537 --> 01:15:58.706
BECAUSE WE HAD
FAIRLY GOOD EVIDENCE

01:15:58.706 --> 01:16:00.875
THAT THEY REALLY COULD MAKE

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:03.911
A THERAPEUTIC IMPACT
THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT

01:16:03.911 --> 01:16:08.249
ON SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS
SIMPLY BY PSYCHOTHERAPY ALONE.

01:16:10.418 --> 01:16:12.153
Osgood:
SCHIZOPHRENIA--

01:16:12.153 --> 01:16:15.623
AN ILLNESS MARKED BY A LOSS
OF CONTACT WITH REALITY

01:16:15.623 --> 01:16:20.828
BY HALLUCINATIONS, VOICES,
PARANOIA.

01:16:20.828 --> 01:16:23.431
IT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD
IN THE 1950s

01:16:23.431 --> 01:16:28.556
WHEN A YOUNG GIRL FROM BROOKLYN
ARRIVES, SEEKING HELP.

01:16:28.556 --> 01:16:33.841
JOANNE GREENBERG WAITED
THREE YEARS

01:16:33.841 --> 01:16:37.745
SHE FINALLY ENTERS TWO DAYS
AFTER HER 16th BIRTHDAY.

01:16:39.914 --> 01:16:43.384
SHE WOULD LATER WRITE
ABOUT HER ILLNESS AND TREATMENT

01:16:43.384 --> 01:16:47.721
IN A BEST-SELLING BOOK,I NEVER
PROMISED YOU A ROSE GARDEN.

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:53.794
Greenberg:
I HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT
WAS GOING ON ON THE OUTSIDE

01:16:53.794 --> 01:16:56.397
BUT I WAS TRYING
WITH EVERYTHING I HAD

01:16:56.397 --> 01:17:00.734
AND I HAD BEEN
SINCE THE AGE OF SIX

01:17:00.734 --> 01:17:04.638
TO TRY AND MAKE IT RIGHT,
TO TRY AND FIX IT.

01:17:08.108 --> 01:17:11.579
I THINK THE WORST FEAR SOMEHOW
IS NOT TO BE ALL RIGHT

01:17:11.579 --> 01:17:13.747
AND IT'S ONLY LATER
WHEN YOU FINALLY SAY

01:17:13.747 --> 01:17:16.350
A) YOU ARE NEVER
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:19.386
IT IS NEVER GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.724
THAT YOU SAY, "WELL, OKAY,
LET IT, LET IT ALL GO."

01:17:25.459 --> 01:17:28.929
"TELL THEM ABOUT THE BLOOD
COMING OUT OF THE FAUCETS."

01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:35.002
I'D SEE PEOPLE WALKING ALONG
WHO WERE JUST MASSES OF MAGGOTS.

01:17:35.002 --> 01:17:38.906
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
TELL THEM ABOUT IT.

01:17:38.906 --> 01:17:40.641
WELL, I DID.

01:17:44.979 --> 01:17:48.015
Osgood:
FROMM-REICHMANN MEETS
WITH JOANNE DAILY.

01:17:48.015 --> 01:17:53.654
SHE TREATS HER WITH A VARIATION
OF THE SO-CALLED "TALKING CURE."

01:17:53.654 --> 01:17:56.257
SITTING WITH HER PATIENTS--
LISTENING, TALKING--

01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:58.859
EVEN WHILE THEY WERE
HALLUCINATING

01:17:58.859 --> 01:18:01.896
WITHDRAWN, RECALCITRANT.

01:18:04.498 --> 01:18:08.836
Man:
IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE IDEA--
TALK TO PATIENTS.

01:18:08.836 --> 01:18:10.571
LET THEM TALK TO YOU.

01:18:10.571 --> 01:18:14.475
TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY,
TREAT THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS.

01:18:14.909 --> 01:18:20.548
PEOPLE WERE NOT JUST STRUGGLING
WITH PSYCHOSIS, WITH INSANITY.

01:18:20.548 --> 01:18:25.753
THEY ALSO HAD NONPSYCHOTIC
ASPECTS TO THEIR MINDS

01:18:25.753 --> 01:18:27.054
TO THEIR PERSON

01:18:27.054 --> 01:18:31.392
AND THAT IF YOU COULD
HOLD ONTO THAT ASPECT

01:18:31.392 --> 01:18:33.561
YOU COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:18:37.464 --> 01:18:40.935
Greenberg:
I HAD THERAPY
FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

01:18:40.935 --> 01:18:43.971
BUT FOR THOSE YEARS
THAT I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL

01:18:43.971 --> 01:18:46.574
THAT'S ALL I DID,
AND THAT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD.

01:18:47.007 --> 01:18:51.345
IT'S A VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT PROCESS.

01:18:53.514 --> 01:18:55.683
MY ALLY HAD A FIRST-RATE MIND

01:18:55.683 --> 01:18:59.587
AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME
TO GET AWAY WITH MUCH.

01:18:59.587 --> 01:19:08.696
SHE WAS TRYING TO ELICIT FROM ME
THINGS ABOUT MY LIFE

01:19:08.696 --> 01:19:16.070
THAT COUNTED IN THE WAY
I SAW REALITY.

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:19.974
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH--
YOU TELL THE DOCTOR THINGS

01:19:19.974 --> 01:19:24.311
AND THE DOCTOR HEARS
AND LISTENS

01:19:24.311 --> 01:19:27.781
BUT I THINK IT REROUTES
YOUR BRAIN.

01:19:27.781 --> 01:19:31.251
I THINK IT REROUTES
YOUR SENSE OF REALITY.

01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:37.758
I THINK IT REWIRES YOU...
(laughs) SOMEHOW

01:19:37.758 --> 01:19:43.397
UH... BECAUSE
WHEN THAT CHANGE HAPPENS...

01:19:46.433 --> 01:19:49.470
IT'S A PROFOUND CHANGE.

01:19:52.506 --> 01:19:55.109
Osgood:
JOANNE GREENBERG
LEAVES CHESTNUT LODGE

01:19:55.109 --> 01:19:56.844
THREE YEARS AFTER SHE ARRIVED.

01:19:56.844 --> 01:20:00.748
TWICE SHE RETURNS
FOR SHORT STAYS.

01:20:01.181 --> 01:20:02.483
BUT ULTIMATELY

01:20:02.483 --> 01:20:09.423
JOANNE GOES TO COLLEGE, MARRIES,
RAISES HER CHILDREN AND WRITES.

01:20:09.423 --> 01:20:10.724
FOR JOANNE GREENBERG

01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:14.194
FROMM-REICHMANN'S TALKING CURE
WAS ENOUGH.

01:20:15.929 --> 01:20:18.532
BUT THIS TURNS OUT
TO BE UNUSUAL.

01:20:18.532 --> 01:20:22.436
MOST PSYCHOTICS TREATED SOLELY
BY TALKING THERAPY

01:20:22.436 --> 01:20:24.171
EVENTUALLY RELAPSE.

01:20:24.171 --> 01:20:26.340
SO, EVEN UNDER
THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.075
WITH THE MOST COMMITTED
CLINICIANS

01:20:28.075 --> 01:20:31.979
HO BELIEVE
WITH THE MOST COMMITTED
THE ENVIRONMENT CAN CURERS W

01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:35.015
ONLY ACHIEVE OCCASIONAL SUCCESS.

01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:41.088
AND IN THE UNITED STATES
IN THE 1950s

01:20:41.088 --> 01:20:43.691
MOST OF THE SEVERELY
MENTALLY ILL

01:20:43.691 --> 01:20:48.028
ARE NOT IN THE BEST HOSPITALS
UNDER THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:20:48.028 --> 01:20:51.932
THEY END UP IN STATE
MENTAL INSTITUTIONS.

01:20:51.932 --> 01:20:55.402
HERE THERE IS A DIFFERENT
THEORETICAL ORIENTATION

01:20:55.402 --> 01:21:01.041
ONE ROOTED IN BIOLOGY,
BUT AGAIN WITH LITTLE SUCCESS.

01:21:01.041 --> 01:21:04.511
McGlashan:
THEY BELIEVED THAT
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS

01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:07.981
WERE BASICALLY ORGANIC
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS;

01:21:07.981 --> 01:21:12.319
ESSENTIALLY IRREVERSIBLE,
LIKE MOST NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS

01:21:12.319 --> 01:21:16.223
AND THAT THE VICTIMS,
THE PATIENTS

01:21:16.657 --> 01:21:19.693
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF

01:21:19.693 --> 01:21:24.031
AND OFTEN TAKEN CARE OF
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

01:21:25.332 --> 01:21:28.802
Lehmann:
THE PATIENTS WERE
DOING THEIR OWN THING.

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:31.405
HER
Lehmann:
THE PATIENTS WERE
DSITTING ON THE FLOOR.E EIT

01:21:31.405 --> 01:21:34.441
STARING AT THE CEILING,
LISTENING TO VOICES.

01:21:36.176 --> 01:21:43.117
I REMEMBER IN ONE BIG WARD WHERE
ABOUT 150 PEOPLE WERE SITTING

01:21:43.117 --> 01:21:48.322
THE ATTENDANT EVERY 20 MINUTES
OR HALF AN HOUR

01:21:48.322 --> 01:21:51.792
HE WOULD CLAP HIS HANDS
AND THEN EVERYBODY WOULD GET UP

01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:55.262
AROUND THE WARD,
HEWHICH WAS QUITE BIG,S
AND THEN ONCE OR TWICELD GET UP

01:21:55.696 --> 01:21:59.166
AND THEN HE CLAPPED AGAIN
AND THEY WOULD SIT DOWN.

01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:01.335
THAT'S TO GIVE THEM
SOME EXERCISE.

01:22:01.335 --> 01:22:04.371
NOT OUTSIDE BECAUSE
ALL THE WARDS WERE LOCKED

01:22:04.371 --> 01:22:05.672
COMPLETELY LOCKED.

01:22:07.407 --> 01:22:09.143
Osgood:
DOCTORS OFFER WHAT THEY CAN:

01:22:09.143 --> 01:22:14.348
THEY DOUCHE, SPRAY,
SHOCK, OPERATE.

01:22:14.348 --> 01:22:16.950
PATIENTS SIT
IN CARBON DIOXIDE CHAMBERS;

01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:20.854
IN REFRIGERATED ROOMS;
THEIR TEETH ARE PULLED;

01:22:20.854 --> 01:22:26.059
THEIR BLOOD IS LET;
THEIR BRAINS ARE SLICED.

01:22:26.059 --> 01:22:29.096
BUT THE PROBLEM OF TREATING
THE DESPERATELY ILL

01:22:29.096 --> 01:22:31.265
DOES NOT ABATE.

01:22:31.265 --> 01:22:33.433
NEITHER SIDE
IN THE ONGOING BATTLE--

01:22:33.433 --> 01:22:36.904
AT CHESTNUT LODGE OR
IN THE STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL--

01:22:36.904 --> 01:22:38.205
SEEMS TO HAVE THE ANSWER.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.976
THE GREAT CHALLENGE
IN THE HISTORY OF PSYCHIATRY

01:22:42.976 --> 01:22:47.314
IS THAT A GIVEN TREATMENT HAS
ALWAYS WORKED FOR SOME PATIENTS

01:22:47.314 --> 01:22:49.049
AND NOT FOR OTHERS.
IS THAT A GIVEN TREATMENT HAS
ALWAYS WORKED FOR SOME PATIENTS

01:22:49.049 --> 01:22:51.218
EVERY TREATMENT
THAT YOU CAN DISCUSS

01:22:51.218 --> 01:22:54.254
HOWEVER CRAZY IT NOW SOUNDS
TO US OR HOWEVER THOUGHTFUL

01:22:54.254 --> 01:22:56.857
WORKED FOR SOME PEOPLE
AND NOT FOR OTHERS.

01:22:56.857 --> 01:23:00.327
DOCTORS WOULD TRY WHATEVER
SEEMED MOST SUCCESSFUL TO THEM.

01:23:00.761 --> 01:23:03.363
I REMEMBER A STUDENT GROUP
WENT THROUGH THE HOSPITAL

01:23:03.363 --> 01:23:05.532
ON A SIGHT-SEEING TOUR--
MEDICAL STUDENTS--

01:23:05.532 --> 01:23:09.436
AND THEY SAW PATIENTS
GESTICULATING TO THE CEILING

01:23:09.436 --> 01:23:12.906
AND TALKING TO THEIR VOICES,
AND THEY TURNED TO ME, ONE

01:23:12.906 --> 01:23:15.509
AND ASKED, "WILL THERE EVER
BE KIND OF A PILL

01:23:15.509 --> 01:23:17.244
"THAT WE'D GIVE THESE PEOPLE

01:23:17.244 --> 01:23:19.847
THAT WOULD STOP THIS
TERRIBLE TORTURE THEY HAVE?"

01:23:19.847 --> 01:23:23.750
AND I PATRONIZINGLY SMILED,
AND I SAID

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:27.221
"WELL, IT WON'T BE A PILL, BUT
SOMEHOW WE'LL PROBABLY LEARN

01:23:27.221 --> 01:23:29.389
HOW TO DO BETTER
THAN WE DO NOW."

01:23:29.389 --> 01:23:31.558
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT SEEMED TO BE RIDICULOUS.

01:23:33.293 --> 01:23:35.896
Osgood:
BUT IN 1952, IN FRANCE

01:23:35.896 --> 01:23:39.800
THE SEEMINGLY RIDICULOUS
IS PURSUED ANYWAY.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.704
HERE IN PARIS,
AT A GENERAL-PRACTICE HOSPITAL

01:23:43.704 --> 01:23:45.005
AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY

01:23:45.005 --> 01:23:48.041
LEADS TO RESEARCH
ON A RADICALLY NEW TREATMENT

01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:51.511
A TREATMENT THAT MIGHT NOT ONLY
GIVE NEW HOPE TO PATIENTS

01:23:51.511 --> 01:23:53.247
BUT ALSO REVOLUTIONIZE

01:23:53.247 --> 01:23:55.849
THE WAY PSYCHIATRY LOOKS
AT MENTAL ILLNESS.

01:23:55.849 --> 01:23:58.886
IT BEGINS WITH A SURGEON
NAMED HENRI LABORIT

01:23:59.319 --> 01:24:01.054
IN SEARCH OF A MEDICATION

01:24:01.054 --> 01:24:04.091
THAT WILL CALM HIS PATIENTS
BEFORE SURGERY.

01:24:04.524 --> 01:24:09.296
HE ADAPTS AN EXISTING COMPOUND
BY ADDING AN ANTIHISTAMINE.

01:24:10.597 --> 01:24:14.501
HE FINDS THAT THE NEW DRUG,
CALLED CHLORPROMAZINE

01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.405
OR LARGACTIL,
DOES QUIET HIS PATIENTS.

01:24:18.405 --> 01:24:23.176
AND SO HE PROPOSED TO SOME
PSYCHIATRIST FRIENDS OF HIS

01:24:23.176 --> 01:24:26.213
THAT HEY, MAYBE THIS DRUG
MIGHT BE USEFUL

01:24:26.213 --> 01:24:28.815
FOR YOUR TERRIBLY CRAZY PATIENTS

01:24:28.815 --> 01:24:32.286
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO HAVE
THIS FAVORABLE EFFECT.

01:24:32.286 --> 01:24:37.491
AND IT WAS ON THAT BASIS
THAT THIS DRUG WAS FIRST TRIED

01:24:37.491 --> 01:24:40.093
WITH PEOPLE WITH.

01:24:41.828 --> 01:24:47.467
Osgood:
THE FIRST TEST IS TRIED HERE

01:24:47.467 --> 01:24:48.769
AS IN THE REST OF EUROPE

01:24:48.769 --> 01:24:51.805
SCHIZOPHRENIA IS CONSIDERED
A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER--

01:24:51.805 --> 01:24:55.709
ONE THAT NO AMOUNT
OF TALKING CAN CURE.

01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:58.745
PSYCHIATRISTS JEAN DELAY
AND PIERRE DENIKER

01:24:58.745 --> 01:25:00.914
HEAD UP THE FIRST TRIAL.

01:25:00.914 --> 01:25:04.384
PIERRE PICHOT IS
PART OF THEIR TEAM.

01:25:04.384 --> 01:25:07.308
Pichot:
IN PSYCHIATRY, WE DIDN'T KNOW

01:25:07.308 --> 01:25:09.156
ABOUT THE MECHANISM--

01:25:09.156 --> 01:25:12.192
BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM
OF THE MENTAL DISORDERS.

01:25:12.192 --> 01:25:16.096
SO, UH, EVERYTHING WAS TRIED

01:25:16.096 --> 01:25:20.000
JUST BY, AS YOU SAY,
SERENDIPITY.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.470
MAYBE IF SOMETHING
HAS A SEDATIVE EFFECT

01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:26.940
IT COULD SEDATE
AND MAYBE DO SOMETHING ELSE.

01:25:28.675 --> 01:25:31.712
Osgood:
DELAY AND DENIKER REALIZE
QUITE RAPIDLY

01:25:32.145 --> 01:25:34.748
THAT THEY ARE ONTO
SOMETHING MOMENTOUS.

01:25:36.483 --> 01:25:39.953
THEY REPORT A TRANSFORMATION
OF THEIR SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS

01:25:40.387 --> 01:25:44.291
AND THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE OF
THEIR HALLUCINATIONS AND VOICES.

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:49.496
CHLORPROMAZINE
AND ITS PIONEERING DOCTORS

01:25:49.496 --> 01:25:52.099
RECEIVE WIDE NOTICE IN FRANCEOP
E

01:25:52.099 --> 01:25:55.135
AND ACROSS THE ATLANTIC
IN NORTH AMERICA

01:25:55.135 --> 01:25:58.605
WHERE PSYCHIATRIST HEINZ LEHMANN
FIRST HEARS ABOUT IT.

01:25:58.605 --> 01:26:00.340
Lehmann:
I HEARD ABOUT IT

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.377
THROUGH AN ARROGANT...
WHAT I THOUGHT THEN TO BE

01:26:03.377 --> 01:26:05.979
AN ARROGANT AND UTTERLY
UNFOUNDED STATEMENT

01:26:05.979 --> 01:26:09.016
FROM THE DETAIL MAN
OF A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY.

01:26:09.016 --> 01:26:12.052
USUALLY I THREW
THIS LITERATURE AWAY

01:26:12.052 --> 01:26:17.257
BUT THOSE I TOOK UP THE NEXT
TIME I HAD TIME FOR READING

01:26:17.257 --> 01:26:21.161
AND THAT WAS ON A SUNDAY MORNING
IN THE BATHTUB.

01:26:24.197 --> 01:26:26.800
ON NURSES
AT HIS HOSPITAL IN CANADA.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.535
THIS IS COMMON PRACTICE

01:26:28.535 --> 01:26:31.571
IN THIS PRE-SPUTNIK ERA
OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

01:26:31.571 --> 01:26:35.475
AFTER THAT,
HIS PSYCHOTIC PATIENTS.

01:26:35.475 --> 01:26:37.210
Lehmann:
AFTER TWO WEEKS

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.813
TWO OF THE PATIENTS
WENT INTO REMISSION--

01:26:39.813 --> 01:26:41.982
WERE COMPLETELY FREE
OF SYMPTOMS.

01:26:41.982 --> 01:26:43.717
NOW, THAT I'D NEVER SEEN.

01:26:43.717 --> 01:26:45.886
IT ISN'T
IN THE TEXTBOOKS EITHER

01:26:46.319 --> 01:26:48.922
AND IT WAS WHAT
THE FRENCH HAD DESCRIBED.

01:26:48.922 --> 01:26:50.657
UM... I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

01:26:50.657 --> 01:26:52.392
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLUKE.

01:26:54.127 --> 01:26:56.296
BUT THEN, AFTER
THREE OR FOUR WEEKS

01:26:56.296 --> 01:27:00.200
QUITE A FEW MORE PATIENTS
WERE SYMPTOM-FREE.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.971
WE HAD SOMETHING THAT WOULD
TURN IT OFF LIKE A WATER TAP.

01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:07.140
SYMPTOMS WOULD DISAPPEAR

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.309
WHETHER YOU
UNDERSTOOD THEM OR NOT

01:27:09.309 --> 01:27:11.912
NO MATTER WHAT THE DYNAMICS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

01:27:16.249 --> 01:27:18.418
IT WAS LIKE TAKING AN ASPIRIN
FOR A TOOTHACHE--

01:27:18.852 --> 01:27:21.021
IT JUST CUT IT OFF.

01:27:21.021 --> 01:27:23.623
IT DIDN'T CURE THE TOOTHACHE
OR THE BAD TOOTH

01:27:23.623 --> 01:27:25.792
BUT THE SYMPTOMS
DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY.

01:27:25.792 --> 01:27:31.431
Osgood:
IT IS A NEW KIND OF TREATMENT:
A MEDICATION FOR THE MIND.

01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:34.034
BEFORE, THEY HAD
ONLY BARBITURATES

01:27:34.034 --> 01:27:36.636
WHICH WOULD KNOCK PATIENTS OUT.

01:27:36.636 --> 01:27:40.107
NOW THEY HAVE A DRUG
THAT REDUCES PSYCHOSIS

01:27:40.107 --> 01:27:43.577
WITHOUT REDUCING THE LEVEL
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

01:27:43.577 --> 01:27:45.745
IT IS A WHOLE NEW KIND
OF PHARMACY--

01:27:45.745 --> 01:27:49.216
ONE THAT SEEMS TO TARGET
JUST THE DISEASE.

01:27:51.818 --> 01:27:53.553
IN A SENSE, THE DRUG
TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA

01:27:53.553 --> 01:27:56.156
HAPPENED LIKE ALL OF THE
TREATMENTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA--

01:27:56.590 --> 01:28:00.494
THAT YOU ARE WORKING
FROM DESPERATION

01:28:00.494 --> 01:28:05.265
AND IF SOMETHING LOOKS
LIKE IT MIGHT MAKE AN EFFECT

01:28:05.265 --> 01:28:07.000
YOU TRY IT

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.169
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING TO LOSE.

01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:14.374
AND SO THEY TRIED IT,
AND THIS TIME IT... IT WORKED.

01:28:16.543 --> 01:28:20.881
Osgood:
AND CHLORPROMAZINE
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

01:28:20.881 --> 01:28:23.917
FROM PILLS FOR THE SEVERELY
MENTALLY ILL

01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:26.953
TO TRANQUILIZERS
FOR THE MILDLY ANXIOUS.

01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:32.940
FROM LITHIUM AND RESERPINE
IN THE 1950s

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:36.062
TO MILTOWN AND VALIUM
BY THE 1960s.

01:28:37.364 --> 01:28:42.135
MEDICATIONS FOR THE MIND BECOME
A NEW PART OF AMERICAN LIFE.

01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:47.774
HOW ANY OF THESE DRUGS WORK,
NO ONE KNOWS AT FIRST.

01:28:47.774 --> 01:28:49.075
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT

01:28:49.509 --> 01:28:53.847
THAT SOMEHOW THE DRUGS CHANGE
BEHAVIOR BY ALTERING THE BRAIN.

01:28:53.847 --> 01:28:56.883
THE BRAIN IS THE KEY.

01:28:56.883 --> 01:28:58.185
THE PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS

01:28:58.185 --> 01:29:00.353
HAD EFFECTIVELY BEEN
DISCOVERED EMPIRICALLY.

01:29:00.353 --> 01:29:03.823
NO ONE KNEW WHY THEY WORKED,
BUT THEY DID WORK.

01:29:03.823 --> 01:29:06.426
SO THE NEXT QUESTION WAS:
WHY DID THEY WORK?

01:29:07.727 --> 01:29:09.896
Osgood:
IN LABORATORIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD

01:29:09.896 --> 01:29:11.631
FROM SWEDEN TO THE UNITED STATES

01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:16.403
SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING
TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

01:29:16.403 --> 01:29:19.439
SOLOMON SNYDER IS ONE OF THEM.

01:29:19.873 --> 01:29:23.343
IN 1975,
SNYDER AND HIS COLLEAGUES EMBARK

01:29:23.343 --> 01:29:25.512
ON A SERIES
OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS

01:29:25.512 --> 01:29:29.416
AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
TO SEE HOW CHLORPROMAZINE WORKS.

01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:40.694
HE INJECTS RATS WITH THE DRUG
TO SEE HOW IT AFFECTS THE BRAIN.

01:29:45.465 --> 01:29:48.935
WHAT HE DISCOVERS IS
A CHANGE IN BRAIN CHEMISTRY.

01:29:53.273 --> 01:29:56.743
CHLORPROMAZINE SEEMS TO AFFECT
ONE CHEMICAL IN PARTICULAR

01:29:56.743 --> 01:29:58.478
CALLED DOPAMINE.

01:30:04.117 --> 01:30:06.720
THE BRAIN--
OF A RAT OR A HUMAN--

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.322
IS MADE UP OF THESE
KINDS OF CHEMICALS

01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:11.057
CALLED NEUROTRANSMITTERS.

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:15.395
NEUROTRANSMITTERS
ALLOW BRAIN CELLS

01:30:15.395 --> 01:30:19.299
TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER,
MAKING UP AN INTRICATE NETWORK.

01:30:22.769 --> 01:30:25.372
ULTIMATELY,
WHAT SNYDER'S EXPERIMENTS

01:30:25.372 --> 01:30:27.107
AND OTHERS LIKE HIS SHOW

01:30:27.107 --> 01:30:29.276
IS THAT THERE IS
AN INTIMATE CONNECTION

01:30:29.276 --> 01:30:32.312
BETWEEN NEUROTRANSMITTERS
AND BEHAVIOR.

01:30:34.047 --> 01:30:37.083
BETDOPAMINE IS LINKEDTERS
WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:44.024
OTHER EXPERIMENTS LINK
THE NEUROTRANSMITTER SEROTONIN

01:30:44.024 --> 01:30:45.325
WITH DEPRESSION...

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.663
ACETYLCHOLINE WITH MEMORY.

01:30:51.398 --> 01:30:53.566
IN FACT, THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.470
AND THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS
THEY PRODUCE IN THE BRAIN

01:30:57.470 --> 01:31:00.940
ARE WHAT CAUSE BEHAVIOR,
NORMAL AND ABNORMAL.

01:31:02.242 --> 01:31:06.579
THE REALIZATION
THAT THE BRAIN WORKS

01:31:06.579 --> 01:31:10.483
ON THE BASIS OF CHEMICAL SIGNALS

01:31:10.483 --> 01:31:12.218
WHICH ARE DYNAMIC

01:31:12.218 --> 01:31:16.122
AND WHICH ARE
CHANGING ALL THE TIME

01:31:16.122 --> 01:31:20.460
REPRESENTED A MAJOR REVOLUTION
IN BIOLOGY

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.195
REPRESENTED A MAJOR REVOLUTION
IN BIOLOGYS ANALOGOUS

01:31:22.195 --> 01:31:27.400
TO THE REVOLUTION THAT GALILEO
USHERED IN CENTURIES AGO.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.738
NO LONGER COULD
WE REGARD THE BRAIN

01:31:31.738 --> 01:31:37.811
AS AN UNCHANGING,
IMMUTABLE SWITCHBOARD

01:31:37.811 --> 01:31:41.715
WITH WHICH WE WERE
BLESSED OR CURSED FOREVER.

01:31:41.715 --> 01:31:47.787
THE CHEMICAL HYPOTHESIS OF BRAIN
FUNCTION AND BRAIN MESSAGES

01:31:47.787 --> 01:31:51.691
MEANT THAT WE COULD
UNDERSTAND BEHAVIOR

01:31:51.691 --> 01:31:56.029
AND THAT WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

01:31:56.029 --> 01:32:00.800
THE DISCOVERY THAT
WE ARE PEOPLE WITH BRAINS

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.704
AND THAT BRAINS ARE REGULATED
BY VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES

01:32:04.704 --> 01:32:09.042
HAS CERTAINLY SHAKEN
THE OLDER VIEW

01:32:09.042 --> 01:32:12.078
THAT WE REALLY
ARE SPIRITUAL BEINGS

01:32:12.078 --> 01:32:14.247
AND THAT BRAINS BE DAMNED.

01:32:14.247 --> 01:32:15.982
THEY'RE JUST KIND
OF THE HARDWARE--

01:32:15.982 --> 01:32:18.151
LIKE OUR MUSCLES
AND OUR HEART, ETC.--

01:32:18.151 --> 01:32:20.754
THAT WE NEED
TO BE SPIRITUAL BEINGS.

01:32:20.754 --> 01:32:24.224
THE FACT THAT WE KNOW
THAT WE HAVE BRAINS

01:32:24.224 --> 01:32:28.128
AND THAT WE CAN RADICALLY
INFLUENCE THE WAY WE THINK

01:32:28.128 --> 01:32:30.730
BY INGESTION
OF CERTAIN CHEMICALS--

01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:34.634
CERTAIN PURE CHEMICALS
THAT WE KNOW THE IDENTITY OF--

01:32:34.634 --> 01:32:38.104
HAS REALLY CHANGED
OUR CONCEPTION OF OURSELVES

01:32:38.104 --> 01:32:40.273
AND THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

01:32:42.876 --> 01:32:47.647
MUCH AS SOME MIGHT WISH IT,
THERE IS NO GOING BACK AT ALL.

01:32:47.647 --> 01:32:49.816
THE CHEMICAL REVOLUTION
OF THE 1970s

01:32:49.816 --> 01:32:52.852
BEGETS A WHOLE NEW
BIOLOGY OF BEHAVIOR--

01:32:52.852 --> 01:32:57.190
A BIOLOGY OF THOUGHT,
A BIOLOGY OF EMOTION.

01:32:57.624 --> 01:32:59.793
SOME SCIENTISTS
BEGIN TO ASK THIS:

01:32:59.793 --> 01:33:05.432
IF THE BRAIN CAN BE PHYSICALLY
CHANGED BY PILLS LIKE THESE

01:33:05.432 --> 01:33:09.769
CAN IT ALSO BE CHANGED
JUST BY EXPERIENCE?

01:33:09.769 --> 01:33:11.070
ONE ANSWER COMES

01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:15.408
FROM THIS UNASSUMING
CREATURE, A SEA SLUG.

01:33:15.408 --> 01:33:18.011
ITS ANATOMY IS
A WORLD APART FROM OURS

01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:20.613
BUT ITS BIOCHEMISTRY
IS SIMILAR ENOUGH

01:33:20.613 --> 01:33:22.348
TO RUN A CRUCIAL EXPERIMENT.

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:24.083
BEGINNING IN THE 1970s

01:33:24.083 --> 01:33:27.120
WORK WITH SLUGS DEMONSTRATES
THAT IT IS POSSIBLE

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.722
TO PHYSICALLY CHANGE
THE BRAIN'S BIOCHEMISTRY

01:33:29.722 --> 01:33:31.458
JUST THROUGH LEARNING;

01:33:31.458 --> 01:33:34.494
THAT THE BRAIN DOES, IN FACT,
RESPOND TO EXPERIENCE

01:33:34.494 --> 01:33:37.530
AND IS ACTUALLY CHANGED BY IT.

01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:41.868
OF COURSE, A SLUG IS...
WELL, JUST A SLUG, NOT A PERSON

01:33:41.868 --> 01:33:43.169
BUT IT DOES PROVE

01:33:43.169 --> 01:33:46.206
THAT EXPERIENCE CAN NEVER
AGAIN BE SO EASILY DIVORCED

01:33:46.206 --> 01:33:47.941
FROM BIOLOGY.

01:33:47.941 --> 01:33:50.543
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF A NEW, REVOLUTIONARY WAY

01:33:50.543 --> 01:33:52.278
OF THINKING ABOUT BEHAVIOR--

01:33:52.278 --> 01:33:55.748
A NEW SYNTHESIS, PUTTING
TO REST THE OLD DICHOTOMY

01:33:55.748 --> 01:33:58.351
BETWEEN NATURE AND NURTURE--

01:33:58.351 --> 01:34:01.821
A SYNTHESIS THAT WOULD
EVEN INCLUDE GENETICS.

01:34:04.858 --> 01:34:07.460
(choir singing
Handel's "Messiah")

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.063
Osgood:
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.

01:34:10.063 --> 01:34:11.798
HOME TO THE MORMON CHURCH

01:34:11.798 --> 01:34:15.702
WHICH HAS ATTRACTED SETTLERS
FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.

01:34:20.473 --> 01:34:21.774
A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY

01:34:21.774 --> 01:34:25.678
THE MORMONS PROVIDE A NATURAL
LABORATORY FOR GENETICISTS

01:34:25.678 --> 01:34:27.413
LOOKING TO SEE
HOW TRAITS ARE PASSED

01:34:27.413 --> 01:34:30.016
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.

01:34:32.619 --> 01:34:36.956
IN THE 1970s, THE CHURCH DECIDED
TO OPEN ITS DOORS TO SCIENTISTS

01:34:36.956 --> 01:34:41.294
SHARING ITS VAST
GENEALOGICAL RECORDS.

01:34:41.294 --> 01:34:43.463
MORMON LEADERS DID TWO THINGS

01:34:43.463 --> 01:34:46.499
FOR WHICH GENETICISTS
WILL FOREVER BE THANKFUL.

01:34:46.499 --> 01:34:50.403
NCOURAGED THEIR FOLLOWERS
FOR WHICH GENETICISTS
TO BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYY E

01:34:50.403 --> 01:34:52.138
AND, AS PART OF CHURCH PRACTICE

01:34:52.138 --> 01:34:54.741
THEY URGED THEM TO KEEP
FASTIDIOUS RECORDS

01:34:54.741 --> 01:34:56.910
OF THEIR FAMILY HISTORIES.

01:34:56.910 --> 01:35:00.813
SOME GO BACK
AS FAR AS 150 YEARS.

01:35:02.115 --> 01:35:04.284
THIS IS HOW HUMAN GENETICS
HAS BEEN STUDIED

01:35:04.284 --> 01:35:06.019
THROUGHOUT THE CENTURY--

01:35:06.019 --> 01:35:08.621
MAKING INFERENCES ABOUT
PATTERNS OF INHERITANCE

01:35:09.055 --> 01:35:11.658
BY STUDYING THE ANCESTRY
OF LARGE FAMILIES.

01:35:11.658 --> 01:35:14.260
THIS IS HOW THE INHERITANCE
OF DISEASES

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:17.297
LIKE A FATAL BLOOD DISORDER
FOUND AMONG MORMONS

01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:19.032
IS TRACKED.

01:35:19.032 --> 01:35:20.767
OR THE INHERITANCE
OF BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS

01:35:20.767 --> 01:35:26.406
LIKE MANIC DEPRESSION, SEEN
AMONG THE AMISH IN PENNSYLVANIA.

01:35:26.406 --> 01:35:29.876
ALL THIS WOULD CHANGE
BY THE 1980s.

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:33.780
SCIENTISTS NO LONGER HAVE TO
RELY SOLELY ON FAMILY RECORDS

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.515
TO UNDERSTAND GENETICS.

01:35:35.515 --> 01:35:38.985
THEY HAVE DISCOVERED WAYS TO
WORK WITH THE GENES THEMSELVES.

01:35:38.985 --> 01:35:43.323
THEY CAN WORK WITH DNA-- THE
MATERIAL THAT MAKES UP GENES

01:35:43.323 --> 01:35:47.226
THAT CARRIES THE BLUEPRINT
FOR HOW EACH OF US DEVELOPS

01:35:47.226 --> 01:35:49.829
THAT PROVIDES
THE GENETIC INSTRUCTIONS

01:35:50.263 --> 01:35:52.432
DIRECTING OUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY.

01:35:52.432 --> 01:35:55.902
SCIENTISTS,
LIKE WALTER GILBERT AT HARVARD

01:35:55.902 --> 01:35:58.504
AND DAVID BOTSTEIN AT M.I.T.

01:35:58.504 --> 01:36:00.239
DEVELOPED METHODS TO DECIPHER

01:36:00.239 --> 01:36:03.710
THE 100,000 GENES
IN EACH ONE OF US.

01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:07.614
THIS ENABLES GENETICISTS
TO DETECT PATTERNS--

01:36:07.614 --> 01:36:11.517
THE DNA SEQUENCES THAT
MAKE INDIVIDUALS DIFFERENT.

01:36:11.517 --> 01:36:16.723
SCIENTISTS CAN NOW PICK OUT
AN ANOMALOUS GENE, A MUTATION.

01:36:16.723 --> 01:36:19.759
THEY CAN SEARCH FOR GENES
THAT CAUSE DISEASES

01:36:19.759 --> 01:36:22.795
LIKE CYSTIC FIBROSIS;

01:36:22.795 --> 01:36:25.398
OR ONES THAT CONTRIBUTE
TO BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS

01:36:25.398 --> 01:36:28.434
LIKE DEPRESSION
OR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

01:36:30.603 --> 01:36:32.338
Man:
HAVING THE TECHNOLOGY

01:36:32.338 --> 01:36:35.375
LED TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL
OF EXCITEMENT

01:36:35.375 --> 01:36:40.580
AMONG THE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD
WHO WERE COLLECTING FAMILIES

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:44.050
AND STUDYING THE PATTERNS
OF INHERITANCE

01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:46.219
BECAUSE NOW THEY WERE ABLE

01:36:46.219 --> 01:36:49.255
TO TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION
THAT THEY HAD

01:36:49.255 --> 01:36:53.159
PUT IT TOGETHER WITH
THE MODERN GENETIC TECHNOLOGY

01:36:53.159 --> 01:36:55.328
AND ACTUALLY FIND A NE.

01:36:57.497 --> 01:37:00.099
Osgood:
THE POWER OF THIS NEW
DNA TECHNOLOGY

01:37:00.099 --> 01:37:03.136
IS FELT IN UTAH, IN PENNSYLVANIA

01:37:03.569 --> 01:37:04.437
EVEN AS FAR AWAY

01:37:04.437 --> 01:37:08.775
AS THE MOUNTAINS
OF COLOMBIA IN SOUTH AMERICA

01:37:09.208 --> 01:37:10.510
WHERE IN 1984

01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:13.546
A CHANCE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN
NEUROLOGIST FRANCISCO LOPERA

01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.715
AND A CONFUSED
YOUNG COLOMBIAN PATIENT

01:37:15.715 --> 01:37:19.619
LEADS TO A SEARCH FOR A GENE
FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

01:37:19.619 --> 01:37:22.221
Man:
SI, EN MIL NOVECIENTOS
OCHENTA Y CUATRO...

01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:26.559
Translator:
IN 1984, A PATIENT
FROM VELMIRA CAME HERE

01:37:26.559 --> 01:37:32.198
WITH SYMPTOMS OF PROGRESSIVE
MENTAL DISORDER AND DEMENTIA.

01:37:32.198 --> 01:37:35.668
IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
THAT HE WAS SO YOUNG

01:37:35.668 --> 01:37:38.705
IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
AND WERE ABLE TO PIECE TOGETHERE
WENT TO VELMIRA

01:37:38.705 --> 01:37:43.042
NINE OTHER CASES
OF SICK PEOPLE IN THAT FAMILY.

01:37:48.247 --> 01:37:52.151
Osgood:
IN TOWN AFTER TOWN,
DR. LOPERA HEARS STORIES

01:37:52.151 --> 01:37:56.055
OF OTHERS WITH ALZHEIMER'S,
INCLUDING LEONARDO PIEDRAHITA

01:37:56.055 --> 01:38:00.300
WHHE MARKET
WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND GRANDSON.

01:38:02.128 --> 01:38:05.598
LEONARDO WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH ALZHEIMER'S AT AGE 42--

01:38:05.598 --> 01:38:07.767
IN THE PRIME OF LIFE.

01:38:07.767 --> 01:38:09.936
GETTING ALZHEIMER'S
THIS YOUNG IS RARE.

01:38:10.369 --> 01:38:14.273
95% OF THE TIME,
THE DISEASE STRIKES MUCH LATER

01:38:14.707 --> 01:38:18.177
SOMETIMES AS MUCH
AS 20 TO 30 YEARS LATER.

01:38:19.479 --> 01:38:22.515
THIS DISEASE EMERGES
SOMETIMES AS MUCH
AS 2SO EARLY IN LIFETER.WHY

01:38:22.515 --> 01:38:24.684
IS A MYSTERY TO THE TOWNSPEOPLE.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.323
SOME VERY INTERESTING IDEAS
ABOUT THIS D

01:38:30.323 --> 01:38:33.359
WHY ONE PERSON WOULD GET THE
DISEASE AND ANOTHER WOULD NOT.

01:38:33.359 --> 01:38:37.263
AND ONE OF THE IDEAS WHICH
ACTUALLY WAS QUITE INTERESTING

01:38:37.263 --> 01:38:40.299
WAS THAT SOME FAMILIES BELIEVED

01:38:40.299 --> 01:38:42.902
THAT IF THEY TOUCHED
A CERTAIN TREE IN A VILLAGE

01:38:42.902 --> 01:38:44.637
THEY WOULD GET THE DISEASE

01:38:44.637 --> 01:38:47.240
BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TREE.

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.975
NO ERA UNA CREENCIA
DE TODAS LAS PERSONAS

01:38:48.975 --> 01:38:51.577
PERO SI HABIA ALGUNAS PERSONAS
QUE TENIAN ESA IDEA.

01:38:51.577 --> 01:38:55.047
Translator:
NOT EVERYONE BELIEVED THAT,
BUT SOME DID.

01:38:55.047 --> 01:38:58.518
BUT OTHERS THOUGHT IT WAS
A PUNISHMENT FROM GOD

01:38:58.518 --> 01:39:00.686
AND A FEW THOUGHT
IT WAS HEREDITARY

01:39:00.686 --> 01:39:02.421
BECAUSE THEY HAD OBSERVED

01:39:02.421 --> 01:39:08.928
THAT A GOOD NUMBER
OF FAMILY MEMBERS GOT SICK.

01:39:08.928 --> 01:39:11.097
THEY CALLED IT
"THE IDIOCY OF OUR FAMILY."

01:39:11.531 --> 01:39:12.398
...DE NUESTRA FAMILIA.

01:39:15.001 --> 01:39:17.170
EL TRES CON EL CUATRO.

01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:18.471
SIGUE.

01:39:22.809 --> 01:39:24.977
Osgood:
ALZHEIMER'S IS DEVASTATING

01:39:24.977 --> 01:39:26.712
REGARDLESS
OF WHO GETS IT OR WHY.

01:39:26.712 --> 01:39:29.315
LEONARDO'S DISEASE
IS SO ADVANCED

01:39:29.315 --> 01:39:33.219
HE CANNOT EVEN PERFORM
THE SIMPLEST OF MENTAL TASKS.

01:39:35.822 --> 01:39:37.557
PERO ES QUE NO VEO... OJALA.

01:39:37.557 --> 01:39:38.858
NO, NO, NO.

01:39:38.858 --> 01:39:40.593
Lopera:
PEGUE EL DOS
CON EL TRES.

01:39:40.593 --> 01:39:41.894
EL DOS CON EL TRES.

01:39:41.894 --> 01:39:44.063
SI, SI.

01:39:44.063 --> 01:39:47.967
Osgood:
THIS DISEASE OF THE BRAIN ROBS
PEOPLE OF THEIR MEMORIES

01:39:47.967 --> 01:39:51.003
THEIR MINDS AND ULTIMATELY
THEIR PERSONALITIES.

01:39:51.003 --> 01:39:52.305
CON UNA LINEA.

01:39:52.305 --> 01:39:53.606
PERO EN ANGOSTURA TAMBIEN

01:39:53.606 --> 01:39:54.907
TENEMOS UNA FAMILIA

01:39:54.907 --> 01:39:56.642
QUE LES EMPIEZA
A LOS 61 ANOS.

01:39:56.642 --> 01:39:58.811
Osgood:
KEN KOSIK IS A NEUROBIOLOGIST

01:39:58.811 --> 01:40:01.848
WHO HAS COME FROM BOSTON
TO COLLABORATE WITH LOPERA

01:40:01.848 --> 01:40:04.884
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE
POPULATION IN COLUMBIA.

01:40:05.318 --> 01:40:08.788
THEIR FOCUS IS AN ISOLATED
REGION CALLED ANTIOQUIA

01:40:08.788 --> 01:40:11.390
WHERE THERE'S
AN EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION

01:40:11.824 --> 01:40:15.294
OF PATIENTS LIKE LEONARDO
WITH EARLY-ONSET ALZHEIMER'S

01:40:15.294 --> 01:40:17.463
WHICH MAKES IT
A NATURAL LABORATORY

01:40:17.463 --> 01:40:19.632
TO STUDY THE GENETICS
OF THE DISEASE.

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.801
Woman:

01:40:23.102 --> 01:40:27.006
Osgood:
LOPERA'S TEAM MEETS
WITH THE PIEDRAHITAS

01:40:27.006 --> 01:40:29.175
TO MAP THEIR GENEALOGY.

01:40:30.476 --> 01:40:32.211
EH... NO.

01:40:32.211 --> 01:40:36.115
AH, PERO, OSEA NO, SIN CONTAR
LOS QUE HAY MUERTOS YA?

01:40:36.115 --> 01:40:38.284
Osgood:
LEONARDO'S CHILDREN REPORT

01:40:38.718 --> 01:40:41.320
THAT THEIR GRANDFATHER
ALSO HAD ALZHEIMER'S

01:40:41.754 --> 01:40:45.224
AS DID THREE OF THEIR UNCLES,
ALL BEFORE THE AGE OF 50.

01:40:45.224 --> 01:40:48.261
THEIRS IS ONLY
ONE OF 12 EXTENDED FAMILIES

01:40:48.261 --> 01:40:49.996
IN THIS REGION--

01:40:49.996 --> 01:40:52.164
4,000 PEOPLE IN ALL--

01:40:52.164 --> 01:40:53.466
TOUCHED BY THE ILLNESS.

01:40:56.502 --> 01:41:00.840
LOPERA'S TEAM TRACES THEIR
LINEAGE BACK SIX GENERATIONS

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.876
TO SPAIN IN THE 1780s.

01:41:03.876 --> 01:41:05.611
IN THE PROCESS,
THE TEAM DISCOVERS SOMETHING

01:41:05.611 --> 01:41:09.081
EVEN THE FAMILIES THEMSELVES
DID NOT KNOW:

01:41:09.081 --> 01:41:12.551
THESE FAMILIES ARE ALL RELATED.

01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:15.154
THEY ALL SHARE
THE SAME GENETIC INHERITANCE

01:41:15.154 --> 01:41:16.889
WHICH THE SCIENTISTS SURMISE

01:41:16.889 --> 01:41:19.926
MUST ALSO INCLUDE
A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION

01:41:19.926 --> 01:41:22.528
FOR THIS RARE FORM
OF ALZHEIMER'S.

01:41:25.131 --> 01:41:28.601
WHEN WE BEGAN
THIS SEARCH FOR A GENE

01:41:28.601 --> 01:41:31.203
WE KNEW THERE WAS
A GENE CAUSING THIS PROBLEM

01:41:31.203 --> 01:41:32.505
AND IT WAS VERY, VERY CLEAR.

01:41:32.505 --> 01:41:34.674
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR
100 YEARS AGO

01:41:34.674 --> 01:41:37.276
BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS

01:41:37.276 --> 01:41:41.614
THAT THE GENE WAS INHERITED
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION

01:41:41.614 --> 01:41:45.952
AND IT WAS EQUALLY PREVALENT
IN MEN AND WOMEN

01:41:45.952 --> 01:41:48.460
AND IT WAS ALSO THE CASE

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:54.193
THAT ABOUT 50% OF THE OFFSPRING
WOULD GET THE ILLNESS;

01:41:54.193 --> 01:41:58.097
ARE TEXTBOOK FEATURES
THAT ABOUT 50% OF THE OFFSPRING
OF A GENETIC ILLNESS.;THOSE

01:41:58.097 --> 01:41:59.832
SO WE KNEW
THERE WAS A GENE HERE.

01:41:59.832 --> 01:42:01.133
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.

01:42:01.133 --> 01:42:02.868
THE PROBLEM WAS
TO FIND THAT GENE.

01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:04.170
¿DE QUE?

01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:05.471
DUELE UN POQUITO.

01:42:07.206 --> 01:42:10.676
Osgood:
FIRST, RESEARCHER
LUCIA MADRIGAL GATHERS

01:42:10.676 --> 01:42:11.978
BLOOD SAMPLES FROM LEONARDO

01:42:11.978 --> 01:42:16.315
AND ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS
OF THIS GREAT EXTENDED FAMILY.

01:42:19.352 --> 01:42:21.520
THEN, USING
MODERN DNA TECHNIQUES

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:24.123
THEY SEARCH
FOR THE CULPRIT GENE.

01:42:24.123 --> 01:42:28.461
WHILE LOPERA'S TEAM SEARCHES,
SO DO OTHER SCIENTISTS

01:42:28.461 --> 01:42:31.497
STUDYING FAMILY GROUPS
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

01:42:33.666 --> 01:42:37.570
IN 1995, A GROUP
OF CANADIAN SCIENTISTS

01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:39.739
IS THE FIRST TO SUCCEED.

01:42:40.172 --> 01:42:44.076
THEY FIND AND ISOLATE THE GENE

01:42:44.076 --> 01:42:47.113
RESPONSIBLE
FOR INHERITED ALZHEIMER'S.

01:42:47.113 --> 01:42:49.281
Kosik:
THIS MADE OUR WORK MUCH EASIER

01:42:49.281 --> 01:42:53.619
WERE ABLE
Kosik:
THIS MADTO HONE IN ONCH EASIER

01:42:53.619 --> 01:42:56.222
EXACTLY WHERE THIS MUTATION WAS

01:42:56.222 --> 01:42:58.824
AND WE WERE ABLE
TO VERY RAPIDLY NOW FIND

01:42:58.824 --> 01:43:02.728
WHICH PATIENTS IN MEDELLIN
CARRIED THE MUTATION

01:43:02.728 --> 01:43:04.030
AND WHICH DID NOT.

01:43:06.632 --> 01:43:09.668
Osgood:
FOR THOSE PATIENTS
WITH THE DEFECTIVE GENE

01:43:10.102 --> 01:43:13.572
THE RESEARCHERS CAN CHART
THE COURSE OF ALZHEIMER'S

01:43:13.572 --> 01:43:15.307
AS IT RAVAGES THE BRAIN--

01:43:15.307 --> 01:43:18.668
SOMETIMES EVEN BEFORE
SYMPTOMS BECOME APPARENT

01:43:18.668 --> 01:43:19.645
IN A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR.

01:43:19.645 --> 01:43:21.814
EN TODOS ESTAN VEMOS
EL CEREBRO, VE?

01:43:21.814 --> 01:43:23.115
EL CEREBRO,
EL CEREBRO...

01:43:23.115 --> 01:43:23.983
SI.

01:43:23.983 --> 01:43:26.152
ESOS VAN DE DERECHA
A IZQUIERDA...

01:43:26.152 --> 01:43:28.320
Osgood:
ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.923
BECAUSE OF ADVANCES
OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS

01:43:30.923 --> 01:43:33.092
IN BRAIN-SCANNING TECHNOLOGY

01:43:33.092 --> 01:43:36.996
ANOTHER MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
IN THE STUDY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR

01:43:36.996 --> 01:43:40.466
PERMITTING SCIENTISTS
TO PEER INSIDE THE LIVING BRAIN

01:43:40.466 --> 01:43:42.201
AND SEE THE MIND AT WORK...

01:43:43.936 --> 01:43:46.105
THE BRAIN IN ACTION.

01:43:52.178 --> 01:43:56.082
THE GENE FOR EARLY-ONSET
ALZHEIMER'S HAS BEEN FOUND

01:43:56.082 --> 01:43:58.684
WITHIN LEONARDO
PIEDRAHITA'S LIFETIME.

01:43:58.684 --> 01:43:59.985
ESTA BIEN BONITA.

01:43:59.985 --> 01:44:02.588
Osgood:
THERE IS EVEN A TEST

01:44:02.588 --> 01:44:05.624
TO SEE WHICH OF HIS CHILDREN
HAS INHERITED THE GENE.

01:44:05.624 --> 01:44:08.661
THERE ARE MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE
AND IN THE WORKS

01:44:08.661 --> 01:44:11.263
TO TREAT
THIS DEVASTATING ILLNESS.

01:44:11.263 --> 01:44:14.300
THIS IS A GIANT SCIENTIFIC LEAP
IN A SHORT TIME.

01:44:20.372 --> 01:44:22.975
Osgood:
BUT HAVING THE GENE IS ONE THING

01:44:22.975 --> 01:44:26.011
THE EMERGENCE
OF THE DISEASE ITSELF, ANOTHER.

01:44:28.614 --> 01:44:30.349
SCIENTISTS ARE A LONG WAY OFF

01:44:30.349 --> 01:44:32.952
FROM UNDERSTANDING
THE CASCADE OF EVENTS

01:44:32.952 --> 01:44:36.856
THAT LEAD FROM A MISTAKE IN
THE GENE THAT YOU WERE BORN WITH

01:44:36.856 --> 01:44:39.458
SE THAT EMERGES
THAT LEAD FROM A MISTAKE IN
THE GENE40 YEARS LATER.BORN WITH

01:44:40.759 --> 01:44:43.796
A DISEASE THAT ATTACKS
THE QUALITIES IN US

01:44:43.796 --> 01:44:45.097
THAT ARE MOST HUMAN.

01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:55.074
Harrington:
THE POWER OF LOOKING AT
ALZHEIMER'S AS A CASE STUDY HERE

01:44:55.074 --> 01:44:57.676
IS THAT IT REALLY GIVES
YOU AN OPPORTUNITY

01:44:57.676 --> 01:45:01.580
TO SEE HOW YOU CAN STUDY HUMAN
BEHAVIOR FROM SOUP TO NUTS--

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:04.617
FROM THE GENETIC LEVEL
THROUGH THE BRAIN LEVEL

01:45:04.617 --> 01:45:07.219
TO THE BEHAVIOL,
TO THE EXPERIENTIAL LEVEL

01:45:07.219 --> 01:45:09.388
AND BACK DOWN
THE OTHER DIRECTION--

01:45:09.388 --> 01:45:13.292
AND TO DO IT AROUND A...
AN AREA OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE

01:45:13.292 --> 01:45:15.461
TICAL
TO OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:45:15.461 --> 01:45:18.931
OF WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT:
OUR CAPACITY TO REMEMBER

01:45:18.931 --> 01:45:21.967
TO REMEMBER
THE STORY OF OUR LIVES.

01:45:23.702 --> 01:45:25.871
Osgood:
GENETICISTS WON A GREAT VICTORY

01:45:25.871 --> 01:45:31.076
WHEN THEY DISCOVERED ONE GENE
FOR RARE FAMILIAL ALZHEIMER'S

01:45:31.076 --> 01:45:34.547
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORE
COMMON OLD-AGE VARIETY

01:45:34.547 --> 01:45:36.282
IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

01:45:36.282 --> 01:45:39.318
SCIENTISTS ARE IDENTIFYING
MULTIPLE GENES--

01:45:39.318 --> 01:45:42.788
GENES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY
LEAD TO THE DISEASE

01:45:42.788 --> 01:45:45.824
BUT PUT PEOPLE AT RISK
FOR DEVELOPING IT.

01:45:45.824 --> 01:45:50.596
THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR OTHER
MENTAL OR BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS

01:45:50.596 --> 01:45:52.765
SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA--

01:45:52.765 --> 01:45:56.235
AS COMMON TODAY
AS IT WAS IN THE 1950s.

01:45:57.970 --> 01:46:01.874
HERE, TOO, MULTIPLE RISK GENES
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE.

01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:07.513
AND LIFE EXPERIENCE MAY
ALSO PLAY A ROLE.

01:46:07.513 --> 01:46:10.983
FOR EXAMPLE, BEING
SEVERELY MALNOURISHED

01:46:10.983 --> 01:46:13.152
DURING PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT

01:46:13.152 --> 01:46:15.754
MAY TRIGGER
SCHIZOPHRENIA YEARS LATER.

01:46:15.754 --> 01:46:22.695
IDEAS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF HUMAN
BEHAVIOR CONTINUE TO BE REFINED

01:46:22.695 --> 01:46:25.297
AS IN THE CASE
OF SHELL SHOCK, FOR EXAMPLE...

01:46:26.599 --> 01:46:30.936
TODAY CALLED
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:33.105
WHY DO SOME SOLDIERS BREAK DOWN

01:46:33.105 --> 01:46:36.575
WHILE OTHERS CAN WITHSTAND
THE HORRORS AROUND THEM?

01:46:36.575 --> 01:46:40.045
SCIENTISTS NOW SPECULATE
THAT SOME ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE

01:46:40.045 --> 01:46:42.214
PERHAPS GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED

01:46:42.214 --> 01:46:44.817
TO SUCCUMB
TO THE TRAUMAS OF WAR.

01:46:44.817 --> 01:46:49.154
AND YET THESE SOLDIERS STILL
NEED THE TRIGGER OF COMBAT

01:46:49.154 --> 01:46:51.323
TO CAUSE THEIR BREAKDOWN--

01:46:51.323 --> 01:46:53.926
BIOLOGYANDEXPERIENCE.

01:46:56.962 --> 01:47:00.866
MOST SITUATIONS, HOWEVER,
ARE NOT AS RADICAL AS WAR

01:47:00.866 --> 01:47:03.902
AND MOST BEHAVIORS ARE
NOT AS EXTREME

01:47:03.902 --> 01:47:06.071
AS SHELL SHOCK
OR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

01:47:06.071 --> 01:47:10.409
IT IS IN THE MORE ROUTINE
ENCOUNTERS OF EVERYDAY LIFE

01:47:10.409 --> 01:47:13.012
THAT SCIENTISTS
OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR WILL FIND

01:47:13.012 --> 01:47:15.180
THEIR GREATEST CHALLENGE.

01:47:16.482 --> 01:47:21.253
THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT
OUR BIOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

01:47:21.253 --> 01:47:23.422
THE MORE WE REALIZE

01:47:23.422 --> 01:47:26.892
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR INTERPLAY.

01:47:29.495 --> 01:47:32.965
Kosik:
SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE ENORMOUS
PROGRESS IN THE PAST CENTURY.

01:47:32.965 --> 01:47:35.567
WE KNOW NEARLY ALL OF OUR GENES.

01:47:35.567 --> 01:47:38.604
WE KNOW A LOT
ABOUT THE MOLECULES IN THE BRAIN

01:47:38.604 --> 01:47:42.074
AND HOW THEY WORK
AND HOW THEY BUILD A BRAIN.

01:47:42.074 --> 01:47:45.978
WE KNOW A BIT ABOUT
HOW THE ENVIRONMENT INTERFACES

01:47:45.978 --> 01:47:48.147
WITH THESE GENES
AND THE MOLECULES

01:47:48.147 --> 01:47:51.617
TO ACTUALLY AFFECT
THEIR EXPRESSION.

01:47:51.617 --> 01:47:54.653
WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS
FOR SCIENTISTS NOW

01:47:54.653 --> 01:47:58.557
IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL
OF THESE MOLECULES AND GENES

01:47:58.557 --> 01:48:00.726
AND ENVIRONMENT WORK TOGETHER

01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:05.931
TO BUILD SOMETHING
AS COMPLEX AS HUMAN BEHAVIOR

01:48:05.931 --> 01:48:09.401
WHICH IS CLEARLY MORE
THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS.

01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:12.438
THAT'S REALLY THE CHALLENGE
OF THE 21st CENTURY.
