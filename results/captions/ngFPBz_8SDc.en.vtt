00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.366
- Okay. All right.

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:07.133
She'll raise...

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.433
whatever that is.
I don't know what it is,

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.766
but get ready
to lose your shirt

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:14.266
and your stuff
and your vest.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.300
Oh, hi.
Hello.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.366
We were just doing
a meeting--a work meeting.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.833
So, off, go.
Scram.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:27.200
I love your pants,
by the way.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400
Today--it's just that easy.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.900
Today, we're gonna do something
a little bit different.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.100
I'm gonna sit here. You're gonna
sit wherever you are,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.200
and we're going to look back
at all the funny ladies

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.300
that I've had on my show
this past season,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.733
besides me, you guys.

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.066
Anyway, one of the funniest
women I talked to

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.666
this year was Amy Schumer.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.366
Actually, I barely had
to talk,

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.166
she just talked
and I sat back and I laughed

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.033
and laughed and laughed
and laughed

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.366
and I let her talk.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.633
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.200
- How's the poster doing
that we gave you?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.600
- Well, I realized
when I got home

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.233
that it was a hostile,
hostile gift.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:03.633
- What?
- Yes.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:04.966
- You love the Hemsworth
brothers.

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.433
- I love
the Hemsworth brothers,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.166
and I got the opportunity
to meet them

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.466
at the Vanity Fair party
last year,

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.666
but my sister took
a horribly blurred photo

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.900
and so I've never
forgiven her.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.666
- Um, we're no longer in touch.
- No.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.133
- No, I'm just kidding.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.700
But then, so you got me
that portrait.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.133
I live in Manhattan,

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.066
so my apartment is
the size of this chair.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.333
So it takes up my whole
apartment.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.733
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.166
And people think I'm--
like, have a really weird pro--

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.666
like, they think I stalk them,

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.000
and they're just, like,
concerned for me,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.833
so that was a rude gift,

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.900
and you could have just gotten
me, like, a plant.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.366
- I am so sorry.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.200
Well, I will give you a plant
while you're here instead.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.066
- Thank you.
Thank you.

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.366
- Why don't you--
no, no.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.933
- No, that's mine. No.
- Oh. Okay.

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.500
- You just can't take
whatever you want.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.066
- Oh, okay.
- No.

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.333
- Why don't you move here, and
then you'd have a bigger place?

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.733
Do you like it here?

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.166
- But--[sighs]
I mean,

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:59.200
I don't fit in here--just,
like, straight up body type.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
Like, in L.A.,
my arms register as legs.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.300
They're just like--
[laughter]

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.900
[laughter]

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.133
They're like,
"Why is that octopus on Sunset?"

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.833
"Is that--"
[laughter]

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.833
It's not--
it's not for me out here.

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:11.833
- No?
- It's not, no.

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:12.933
But I--you know.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.266
- What do you do when
you're here?

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.100
- I cry.
I just sit in my room...

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.100
[laughter]
Bawling.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.466
No, I--

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:22.900
Well, last time I was here,
right from the show,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.266
I got courtside tickets
to a Laker game.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.333
- That's fun.
- Yeah, 'cause my--

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:29.166
my business agent thought
I was mad at him

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.800
for sexually harassing me.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.500
- Well--
- But no, I'm 33,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.500
so I'm just starting to really
appreciate that,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.633
- you know what I mean?
- I see, I see.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.233
- Well, it's true.
I can't speak for everyone.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.533
I'm not like
"Sexually harass--"

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.866
but, in your 20s,
I feel like you walk around--

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.533
like you'll walk past
a construction site,

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:46.900
and be kind of like,
"Oh, don't look--"

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.466
But then, in your 30s, you know,
I'm just like,

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:51.033
"What about this?"
[laughter]

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.633
"Like, how about--"
[laughter]

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.233
It's like my skirt's over
my head.

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:55.966
I'm like, "Aah."
[laughter]

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.233
They're like, "We're eating."

00:02:57.233 --> 00:02:58.300
But, uh--
[laughter]

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.500
[laughter]

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.466
It changes, it really does.

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:05.800
It changes, so--
So I got courtside seats,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.866
which--you've sat courtside
at a game, right?

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:08.900
- I have, yeah.
- I thought--I went--

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.666
I thought it would be
free booze.

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:11.933
Um...
[laughter]

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:13.933
It's not, it's not.
[laughter]

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:16.166
I guess you have to be on
the team to get free booze.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.533
So...
- [laughs]

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:21.600
- I go, I get randomly seated
next to Dianna Agron.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.533
You know, the actress.
She was on "Glee."

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.500
She played the cheerleader,
Quinn?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.866
I mean, that lets you know
how hot she is.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:29.833
Yeah--oh, there we go.
There's the picture.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.666
Thanks for--yes.
Isn't that great?

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:32.966
[laughter]
She's like--

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:35.466
the most gorgeous girl ever.

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:36.733
Her name was "Quinn"
on that show.

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.233
- To pull off that name?
- Yeah.

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:40.133
- Like if my name were "Quinn"
on a show,

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:43.833
they'd be like, "Oh, the jolly
Irish groundskeeper, that--"

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.200
[laughter]

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.800
"Does a jig time and again,"
you know.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.766
But so she's there.
Is she not like an angel?

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:53.033
So--and the whole night,
she's like,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.500
She's like this...

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.766
'cause she knows people are
taking pictures of her.

00:03:56.766 --> 00:03:58.333
I obviously don't.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:00.733
[laughter]

00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:03.433
I learned a lot.
I learned that my resting face,

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.400
is just a scowl, it's just--
[laughter]

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.800
[laughter]

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.133
And I learned--and you can see--

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:12.033
that I have what I'm now calling
an "at-risk chin."

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:15.966
[laughter]

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.700
This is not a good section!

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.666
[laughter]
If I--if I don't,

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:22.700
like keep it at sea level,
it just doubles itself, just--

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.966
[laughter]

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.100
I become the dinosaur in
the jeep in "Jurassic Park,"

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.533
just "Fff!"

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.866
[laughter]

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:32.900
So I'm like--no idea people are
taking pictures.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.966
I'm pounding red wine,
and I--

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:37.700
I thought it was free--
and I--

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.000
[laughter]

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.500
I get red wine teeth right out
the gate, you know?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.766
Like,
just first sniff of merlot,

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:46.333
just "True Blood" mouth.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.366
I look like I've been feeding,
and I'm eating popcorn,

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:51.800
the way I think we all
eat popcorn, which is--

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.466
you know, at first, don't you
always kind of start out

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:54.766
kind of like lying to yourself?

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:58.400
Like, "I don't know,
I'll have a little."

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.300
Ehm.
[laughter]

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.166
Like one piece at a time,
you know?

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:05.600
And then--and then, like,
you get a little more real.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.900
Right?
[laughter]

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.200
and then eventually,
you just--you get "real" real.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.566
And just "gah!"

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:12.000
[laughter]

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.533
Like, I've split my lip trying
to get one more kernel--

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:15.566
[laughter]

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:18.100
It's true.
In my dumb mouth.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.900
It is true.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.666
- [laughing hard]

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.600
- And so that's what happened.
If you Google me, it'll be--

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.800
And I--I look like her,
actually.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.566
I look like her if she were
stung by a million bees.

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:29.766
[laughter]

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.633
It's true!

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:33.700
I look like her if she were,
like, becoming the Hulk.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.700
That's--
[laughter]

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.333
And she--you know,
she wanted to be friends,

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.133
and I'm like, "I can't.
I can't.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.466
We don't have--
we're not the same thing."

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.533
Like she was telling me
hot people problems, you know.

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:46.000
She's like,
"He won't stop calling."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And I'm like,
"[whine], I hate that."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.633
[laughter]

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.100
Do you eat popcorn like that,
though?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.700
- Are you a popcorn lover?
- Yeah, I do.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.366
And I eat it exactly like that.
- Right?

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:57.466
- Yes.
- I mean, that's why--

00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:58.700
I'm so annoyed--
I'm single again,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.533
so I'm going to have to start
dating some guy,

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:02.600
and we'll go to the movies
and he'll be like,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.566
"Do you want to get popcorn?"
and I have to be like,

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:06.233
"Oh, I hadn't even thought
about it."

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.033
[laughter]

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.633
He's like, "What size?"
and I'm like,

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.466
"[giggles] A small.
Look at me."

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:13.500
[laughter]

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.033
Right, like a small popcorn?
That's like taking one Advil.

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:17.366
Like, "get outta here."

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:18.733
[laughter]

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:20.833
"Get--I want a trough.

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:23.700
And I want to dunk my head
in it."

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.700
And--and then, you know.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.400
I'll be pretending not
to think about the popcorn.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.100
- Hilarious.
So when you say

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.466
you're gonna start dating again,
that means that you're--

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:33.233
are you dating at all?

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:35.033
- No, I, um--

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.333
Well, I know everyone here
is like, "How do we date you?"

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:38.433
Thank you.

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:40.100
[laughter]

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.833
You can't, and not just 'cause
I'm not totally out of the woods

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:45.166
with this UTI I have right now,
but also--

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.333
[laughter]

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.900
but also--
Thank you.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.133
[laughter and applause]
Oh, my God.

00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:57.200
[laughter and applause]

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.100
No, but I'm not on any
dating websites.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.833
I don't--I'm on--I have one,
like, app on my phone

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.766
that's kind of--
it's called "Foodspotting."

00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:06.200
[laughter]

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.133
And it's like Tinder, but
for food, so, it lets me know--

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:10.866
- Is this real?
- This is totally real.

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:13.766
It lets--they let you know about
food in your area.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:17.600
So, like, this week in L.A.,
I was eyeing this one particular

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.033
scone.

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:20.300
And uh--
[laughter]

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.733
Under a mile away.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.100
Coincidence?
Probably not.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.900
[laughter]

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.166
So, I'm like, "Should I go?"
And my friends are like, "Go!

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:29.566
Like, check it out!"

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:33.166
So I went to the scone, and
I kind of just sidled up to it,

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:36.066
and I was like, "Oh, my God, you
look just like your picture."

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:38.800
[laughter]

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.133
So I'm kind of dating.
Kind of dating.

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:43.466
- It's different than that.
You should--

00:07:43.466 --> 00:07:45.100
[laughs]

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.133
Oh, my God.
- It's pretty much

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.233
the same exact thing.
- Hilarious.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.500
It's almost exactly the same.
- Yeah.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.100
- So, you're hosting
the awards.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.700
Now, is this something that
you think about?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.033
Do you get nervous about?
Have you hosted an awards show?

00:07:57.033 --> 00:08:00.566
- No, the only thing I've hosted
so far is HPV, so...

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:01.766
[laughter]
I feel--

00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:08.000
[laughter]

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.500
No, it's not detectable
in my system.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.333
I just went back
to annual Paps, but--

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.500
[laughter]

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.933
I'm really excited.
No, I didn't--

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:16.500
- It's so weird that
you're not dating.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500
I don't know why.
- I know.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.666
Where is it?
- What's wrong?

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.500
- Why?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.566
I didn't even know I was up
for the job.

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:26.300
And I got to do a show
at Carnegie Hall.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.700
You know,
a dream for a comic.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.900
- Yep.
- And I'm from New York,

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.066
so I--and that night,
I was just so excited.

00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.866
All my high school friends
were there.

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:36.033
And then, my publicist,
Carrie Byalick...Bialick,

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:37.533
something like that.
[laughter]

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:39.600
She's like my best friend,
and I'm just, like, nervous.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.633
But she--she was like,
"You got it!"

00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:43.666
And I was just like, "What?"
And it was--

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:44.766
She's like,
"You're hosting."

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:47.300
And my high school friends
went crazy.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.233
Now they finally think
I've made it.

00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:51.033
They're just like, "MTV!"

00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:53.266
I'm like, "How old--
we're in our 30s, relax."

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.000
But--
[laughter]

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.433
Yeah, I don't know.
My friends actually--

00:08:57.433 --> 00:08:59.400
There's an article--I was on the
cover of "Entertainment Weekly,"

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.033
which I'm so proud of.
- I know, look at this!

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:04.033
I mean, look at the cover of--
- Yay!

00:09:04.033 --> 00:09:08.100
[cheers and applause]
Me!

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.833
I was so excited about that.

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:12.500
- Yeah, mini--
little alcohol bottles.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.200
- Those are actually full size,
but I am a giant.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
- Oh, I see.
[laughter]

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.566
[laughter]

00:09:18.566 --> 00:09:21.266
- I'm on "Game of Thrones."
You like me?

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:23.066
But one of my best friends,
Chelsea Peretti,

00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:24.500
she had a quote--they asked
questions about me,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.666
and she said, "Amy doesn't care
what anyone thinks of her

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.366
to a clinical degree."

00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:30.166
And I was like,
"Kind of an insult,"

00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.533
but she's right.

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:33.333
So I'm just--I just want to have
a really good time,

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:34.533
and I want everybody to laugh.

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:35.866
- That's how everyone
should live,

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:37.533
is to not worry about what
anybody thinks.

00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:39.266
That's the best way to be
full of yourself.

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:40.566
- Yeah.
- So this movie,

00:09:40.566 --> 00:09:42.866
you are starring in it,
you wrote it.

00:09:42.866 --> 00:09:44.900
Judd Apatow is directing and
producing, right?

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.666
- I also did craft service
on it.

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.066
I, um...
[laughter]

00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:51.166
I drove the trailers.
Uh, yes, Judd directed it.

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:52.766
- But you wrote it.
I mean, that--

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:54.633
So it is called--

00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:55.766
- "Trainwreck."
- "Trainwreck."

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:57.866
- Now, is it about me?

00:09:57.866 --> 00:09:59.400
Yes.
Yes, it is.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.333
Yes, it is.
Of course, it's about me.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.866
Yeah, "Trainwreck."

00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:05.533
It's a story about a girl,

00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:07.300
who's, you know, in her 30s,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.166
and, like, her behavior isn't
really cute anymore,

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:13.500
all the drinking and spreading
herself a little too thin.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.766
And--
[laughter]

00:10:14.766 --> 00:10:16.300
Whoa, judgmental.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.900
And, uh--
[laughter]

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.900
Guys.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.800
I'm fine.
And then--

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.733
And, you know,
she falls in love, and--

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:26.100
- And when is this coming out?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.466
- It's actually not.
They decided not to release it.

00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:31.566
[laughter]

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:33.533
July 17th.
- July 17th.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:34.900
- Can I stay with you
till then?

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.266
Because I haven't gotten
my first check for the movie.

00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:38.833
Is that cool, or--

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:40.233
- Plenty of room.
- Okay, cool, thank you!

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:42.066
- Yeah.
We would love to have you.

00:10:42.066 --> 00:10:45.300
That'd be great.
Bring your Hemsworth brothers--

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.133
- I do--I travel with that.
Yes.

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:48.300
- You do have it
with you.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.800
And your show is coming back on
Comedy Central

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.966
for the third season.
- Yes!

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:53.033
- Starting up again,
congratulations.

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:54.400
- Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.733
[cheers and applause]
This season, I'm so proud.

00:10:56.733 --> 00:10:59.300
- Yeah?
- Yes, April 21st.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.233
Yeah, please watch it.
Don't just clap and then

00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:02.666
like, not watch it, okay?

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:03.533
[laughter]
Be cool.

00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:06.533
Be real.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.733
- Oh, my God.

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:10.533
You make me laugh so--
you're hilarious.
