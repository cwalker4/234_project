00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.870
One of the things I learned very early on
as a CEO and entrepreneur was the fact that

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.410
I cannot speak the same language to every
audience that I'm communicating with.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.619
For instance, I can't speak to my staff the
way I speak to my vendors, the way I speak

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:15.619
to the media.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.920
It's all different on how you communicate
with them.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.730
And I've made all the mistakes in the world,
and I'm probably going to be making many more

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
new mistakes, but I finally came out with
a philosophy on how to communicate with these

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.249
seven different audiences, these types of
languages you've got to speak.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.400
And once you learn how to be aligned with
the way you communicate with them, you become

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.400
more effective.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400
So let me get right into it.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.910
First of all, let me give it to you in ranking,
exactly on which platform is the most important

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.760
to communicate with, all the way to the highest
level, and I'll explain to you why.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
Now, you may or may not agree with this, but
this is a philosophy that works for me.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220
So this is what's worked for me and I'll share
it with you.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.680
So, seven platforms, seven audiences.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.060
#7: How you communicate with to the media.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.370
It's the least important but it's still important.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.990
#6: How you communicate with your vendors.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.570
#5: How you communicate with your investors

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.810
#4: How you communicate with your customers
and clients

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.520
Some people may say, "Why did Pat put a #4?"

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.749
I'll explain to you exactly why.

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:14.409
#3: How you communicate with your partners,
carriers

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.190
#2: How you communicate with your staff and
executives

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.929
#1: How you communicate with your sales, on
who touches the client the most, how you deal

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.500
with your sales force.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.289
So let me get right into it.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.549
#7: Media and Public

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.899
One of the challenges with media and public
is, I experienced it early on, when we had

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.939
somebody who endorsed me and all of a sudden
all of these different political media platforms

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.280
started reaching out to me saying, "You know,
this person's on the back end, investing into

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.399
the company" and we had no idea how to respond
because we were just a startup getting started.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.979
Even our competitors were loving this because
they're saying, "Oh, look at what they're

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.819
doing, look what's taking place with the company."

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.119
So we were kind of cornered.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.259
We had never gone through this before.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.119
And I had to learn how to identify that and
sit back instead of taking things personally

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.149
and trying to defend yourself.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.719
Learning how to respond to that issue that's
come up.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:16.310
So one, the most important advice I can give
you on how to deal with media and public is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.250
to have your message be aligned with your
identity.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.260
Have your message be aligned with your identity.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.819
Let me explain to you what I mean by that.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.670
So, the way that Donald Trump deals with media
works for him.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.420
But if you tried to deal with media the way
Donald Trump deals with media, and it's not

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.510
your identity, you're completely going to
flop.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.480
And you're going to make a fool out of yourself,
and your brand, and everybody that is also

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.790
representing the brand the way you're representing
the brand.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.090
It's important to be aligned.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.500
Let me get a little bit deeper so this makes
sense to you because you may say, "What's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.730
Pat talking about?"

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.909
Listen, think about it this way.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.610
Think about it if I date a girl.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.610
Okay?

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.780
And for the first six months I'm acting very
like a tough guy, I'm strong, I'm this, I'm

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.310
that and then we start dating and the girl
was attracted to the tough guy Pat.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.310
Right?

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.870
A year later, two years later, and she starts
saying, "You're too this, you're too this"

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.599
and I start losing my identity and I become
this little softie and then she loses her

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.519
attraction to me and we're wondering why,
but the reality is the initial identity she

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.250
was turned on by is no longer there.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.250
Does that kind of make sense?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.030
So you've got to make sure you stay the congruent
identity that you really are.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.030
Imagine Apple.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.219
When you and I think about Apple, Apple typically
launches their phone in September.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.780
They come out with a new phone, right?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.750
Like let's just say that the iPhone 7 is going
to come out in September.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.489
If they don't, the identity is changing.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.530
And the way they typically do launches, is
hush, hush, you don't announce anything and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920
then all of a sudden, the most incredible
phone is coming out.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.640
And then they contact the most biggest famous
bloggers that are technology bloggers and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.780
they give them a little bit of a hint, and
then they write and 17 million people go to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780
this technology blogger.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.060
It's going to look like this.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.271
It's going to look like that.

00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:12.109
And they confuse all of their competitors
and then they say, "Do you know the phone

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.640
that came out, the camera can actually read
your feelings and emotions.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.549
And we're like, "oh my gosh.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.709
This one's a terrible iPhone and we throw
this one and we go to the next one and give

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.150
this one away to our grandfather or parents
and then we go get the new one.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.150
That's their identity.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.560
It works for them.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.300
Stay true to your identity when dealing with
the media.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.130
And I hope I made sense in this part because
if you're small right now, you're saying,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.700
"I don't have to deal with this type of stuff."

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.919
Well, you kind of do when it happens on Yelp
or it happens on different.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.451
. . that's still media to you, so you've got
to know how to communicate with media and

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.650
the public.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.430
If you did something wrong, always take responsibility
for it.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.750
It's the first thing that just eliminates
all the other person's ready to come attack

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.860
you, "It was our fault.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.060
We take full responsibility for this, we're
going to get better."

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.860
Ooooookay.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.280
What do I say next?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280
Shoot.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.560
They took responsibility, move on.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.580
#6: Vendors

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.800
The way I communicate with vendors is a complete
different way than the way I communicate with

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.500
partners, and I'll explain to you what I mean
by vendors.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.280
Vendors to me are, I'm booking an event at
a hotel in Las Vegas and there's this girl

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.560
that represents us and she's a vendor and
she's going to make $25,000 on the deal.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:38.080
I am on her case 24/7 to represent me in such
a world class way.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.580
I probably put the most pressure on vendors
than anybody else.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.190
Highest pressure I put on vendors than anybody
else.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.270
Why?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.650
Because anybody that's become a vendor with
me for a long time, you're automatically going

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.990
to make a lot of money with me.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.990
Guaranteed.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.990
You're going to make a lot of money with me.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.880
It's just going to happen.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.250
And a vendor, in my mind, they work from home,
they're sitting there, they're with their

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.889
kids, they're doing all this other stuff as
vendors, and then [snap].

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.270
they land a client like ours and then they're
making automatically $40,000 per year, $30,000

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.430
per year, on one account.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.020
So if a vendor I notice gets a little too
comfortable with me, I'm moving on.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.160
I'm moving on.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.259
The types of vendors that I keep to myself
for a very, very long time are the types of

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.080
vendors that don't abuse my relationship.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.169
They don't automatically think that I'm a
lock because they already have me and can

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.990
use me and abuse me all the time, that is
not going to happen with vendors, at all,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.990
ever.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.360
It just won't happen on our case.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.110
And my staff knows it.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.510
My staff knows that when we have vendors,
we'll typically have multiple vendors that

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.470
are shopping for us to give us the best opportunity
because if you only have one vendor, vendors

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.680
will typically abuse you because they know
they're the only ones.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.120
I don't mean to be negative to vendors, I've
just done a lot of stuff with vendors and

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.840
I've had great vendors and I've had vendors
that I had to fire, and explain to them why

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.009
I fired them.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.449
There's a guy that I've been using in Vegas
for the longest time, Marshall.

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:09.230
He's absolutely phenomenal on what he does.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.409
He's a pro, he's a professional.

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:17.110
Every year he does my events, it doesn't matter
where I'm doing it, I trust this guy's feedback

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.740
because of the way he does certain things.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.840
I have a lot of value for him.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.340
Now if all of a sudden he tries to abuse the
relationship, obviously, we'll go elsewhere,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.330
but I trust his abilities, as a vendor and
what he does for us.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.789
I use him every single time we have an event,
we pick our dates based on his availability,

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:35.960
because he's a pro that we trust.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.920
So a vendor's relationship to me is pressure,
performance, expectations high.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.190
Just like attorneys, I want my attorneys to
do their best for me.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.761
I want my accountants to do their best for
me.

00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.419
I expect them to work very hard.

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:50.939
I expect the attorneys to do their part.

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:52.220
These are vendors to me.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:59.139
Now if a law firm eventually becomes my general
counsel and my legal counsel, now that becomes

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:00.139
a partner.

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:04.870
A vendor to me is someone I use every once
in a while, but not on a monthly basis.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.440
Maybe I use them once every three months or
something like that.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440
That's a vendor.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.840
Partners are a completely different story
and I'll explain exactly how I treat partners.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.479
#5: How you communicate with investors

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.369
Investors have one thing in mind.

00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:23.270
Unless the investor is your mom or dad or
it's an uncle, they also care about you, right?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.330
They kind of want to see you win.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.389
If the investor is a former mentor you worked
with for 10 or 15 years, then they invested

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:32.099
in your business, but they also want to see
you win, they want to see you happy.

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.400
That's a different story.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.940
Take those out, investors care about one thing,
and one thing only.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.089
How much money you're going to bring back
to them.

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:43.260
That's it.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.089
They care about your health, but it's not
even on their top 10 list.

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:48.700
The only reason they care about your health
is for you not to die so they can get their

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.110
money back.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.160
They care about your marriage, but the only
reason they care about your marriage is because

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.480
they don't want your marriage to flop because
it's going to disrupt the business.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.700
That's the investor.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.779
They care about whether you're happy or not,
not because they care about your joy, happiness

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.130
and all that other stuff, because if you're
happy you're going to perform and get better

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.279
results, right?

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.600
That's how they think.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.149
So when you speak to investors, it's all logic.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:12.149
How's the wife doing?

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:13.149
How's the family doing?

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:14.200
All that small talk, they don't care.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.230
They don't care.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.800
I mean, to them it's a complete different
language.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.610
And I like that language because to me it
is a very honest language.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.490
It's actually a very simple language.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.570
It's not a complicated language.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.209
It's purely a logical language you're having
with investors.

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:33.480
So the more you identify from that side, the
more you're able to communicate with them

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.680
effectively.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.279
#4: Next, customers.

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:44.810
You know the whole idea about customers are
always right?

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.950
It is pretty accurate on the customers being
always right, but there are sometimes that

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:54.650
customers will like to abuse and do whatever
they can and especially nowadays, to just

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.980
get out there and people have access to anything
where they can go out there and bash the world

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.980
about you.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.880
I heard a stat one time that said if you do
something good, people tell three people.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.829
But if you do something bad, people tell 11
people.

00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:09.170
And I understand and I agree with that as
well.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:15.200
So customers are always right, except for
the one in a hundred instances that they're

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.040
just completely disgruntled and they're negative
and no matter what you can't please them.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.291
And you still have to figure out a way to
work with them as well.

00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:26.930
We have to work with many, many customers
that, they're not having a good day.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.910
One of our agents didn't treat them well and
we have to get on the phone with them for

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.940
an hour.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.780
I got on the phone with one guy and we got
on the phone and he says, "You know why I

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.780
didn't like you?"

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.780
Listen to this!

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.899
This is a conversation I had with this guy
five and a half years ago.

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:39.899
He said, "I don't like you."

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:40.899
I said, "Why is that?"

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:42.690
He said, "Because you believe in capitalism."

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.899
I said, "Yes, I do."

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:47.769
He had heard me give a talk on capitalism.

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:49.410
I said, "I've lived in Iran.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.970
I've lived in the complete opposite end of
capitalism and I prefer capitalism.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.850
That's why I came to America as an immigrant."

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:02.220
And he was part of this organization that
was a communistic organization and he hated

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.220
me.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.279
And finally I got on the phone with him for
an hour and said, "What's the issue?

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.149
Tell me."

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:10.820
This was a very random, weird call.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.380
We had a 45 minute conversation about politics.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.180
Tell me what you think about this.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.470
Why do you believe this way?

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.470
Do you know this president.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.590
. . I said, "Listen, most of this stuff I'm
agreeing with you.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.250
The only thing I'm not agreeing with you is
the fact that you think that every business

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.820
owner's a crook and they're trying to do bad
things out there."

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.820
You work for PF Changs.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.820
They pay your salary.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.180
Imagine if there was no PF Changs.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.480
"I'd work for another company."

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.550
But regardless, you're going to work for a
capitalist.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.360
So we had this conversation and we laughed
and kidded and joked.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.450
We had a great conversation.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.450
And then we got off.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.450
He said, "I'm good."

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.450
Great.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.649
Three years later he sends me a message on
Facebook after my video goes viral and he

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:46.920
says, "Hey, I remember when you and I spoke,
it's amazing to see you doing very well.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.350
I am now a capitalist."

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.610
I mean, it was the most random thing, and
now we have a relationship together.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.610
So customers are right.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.529
You need to make sure you hear them out because
everyone's experience may be different.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:03.839
But to me, I can do a lot more to make the
customer's experience better if I take care

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.060
of my top three.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.570
And I'll explain to you why this is.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:14.430
#3: The audience to speak the language to
is partners.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.230
Partners to me are very important.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.500
I as an insurance company have a lot of carriers.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.250
So some of them may be carriers that we have
that we can sell, whether it's Nation Wide,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:32.850
whether it's National Life or all these other
companies and then I have partners.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:40.250
I have partners that I deal with that, whether
it AIG or whoever it is.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.300
I have partners, right?

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.600
There are carriers and then there are partners.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.160
Those who become partners, they are in it
with you.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.820
Now this doesn't mean that one day they can't
turn around because you know how partners

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.230
sometimes they bring a new regime and everything
changes and they're not?

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.920
They're not partnership secondary or third
and you've got to go find somebody that wants

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920
to be a partner.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.990
But for the most part, when there's a partnership,
things are in a place where both want each

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.050
other to win in a big way.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.380
And the way I handle my partners is this.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.250
Look, we both have a couple of things in common.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.150
We need to make sure our customers are happy.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.040
We need to make sure our reps are happy.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.639
If we can have our customers and our reps
happy, you and I are happy.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:24.639
Yes?

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:25.639
Yes.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.670
Okay, what can we do to make customers' experience
better?

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:34.290
For instance, if I'm Zappos and I'm selling
shoes and I have twenty contracts with shoe

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.191
companies, but I have partners and one of
ones -- I'm just throwing a name out there

00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:45.190
- is Cole Haan. Cole Haan and I have a very
strong relationship together because they're

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.779
my partner, I'm going to make sure as Zappos
that Cole Haan delivers good products to my

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:51.779
customers.

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:54.220
Because if they deliver good products to my
customers, they're happy.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.959
I need to make sure that how Cole Haan treats
the customer when the customer sends a shoe

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:01.100
back and it's missing a sole.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.490
Or it's missing whatever.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.490
It's broken.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.490
Something happened and it's torn.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:12.130
I need to make sure how they treat my customers
because if my customer, I'm representing them

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.130
as a partner.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.269
I need to make sure my customer is happy with
my partner.

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:19.829
So I spend more time making sure the partner
treats the customer right so the customer

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:21.769
doesn't call me for a complaint.

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:23.810
This is why the customer to me is #4.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.510
I put the other three at the top because customer
touch is them more than the customers going

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.510
to touch me.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.880
I need to make sure the customer is extremely
satisfied with the partner.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.209
That's why partner is #3.

00:14:39.209 --> 00:14:42.860
So the partner part, I literally explain to
the partner, "Listen, we are a team, we're

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.860
on the same page.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.170
We need to make this thing better.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.170
What do you need to do to get better?

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.170
What do we need to get better?"

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.440
The more transparency and honesty are with
me, the more we can improve, but I'm going

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.970
to hold you accountable as well for you to
improve.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.800
So let's have a monthly conference call.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.950
We know where you're at, we know what you're
doing.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.620
Boom, both of us are getting better.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.290
#2 is staff and executives.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.220
Staff and executives on how you communicate
with staff and executives.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.079
So remember, staff and executives generally
are on a salary base and then you have sales

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.220
that are not, they're on commission base.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:13.870
So staff and executives they have health,
all this other stuff that is taken care of

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.320
and they have a salary.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.870
And then they have an environment and their
hours are pretty predictable hours for the

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.470
most part.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.170
I expect a lot from my executives.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.220
A lot from my executives.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.730
A lot from my executives.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.040
If someone works closely with me and they're
an executive they will generally tell you,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.230
"Patrick is on our case until he trusts us.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.579
And that's literally the way it is.

00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:42.459
Once I trust your ability, that you have subscribed
to being a leader in life, I leave you alone,

00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:46.860
and I simply challenge you and mentor you
and then you give me direction and ideas.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.350
And I challenge you to improve and the next
project, what do we need to do.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.750
I need direction from you.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.170
We're going back and forth.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.170
Right?

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.709
But I need to know that I trust you as a leader.

00:15:54.709 --> 00:16:01.420
So I'm pushing you as an executive harder
than anybody else to make you become a leader.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.259
The moment you're a leader, my staff is going
to be led by you.

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:08.760
So I need to make sure you become a leader
so you're leading everybody else with the

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.459
example that you're setting to them.

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:11.459
So there's an expectation.

00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:15.569
I'm doing a video that should be launched
in the next couple of weeks and that video's

00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:20.000
going to be Six Things I Expect from My Executives
and I expect that video to come out as well

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.980
so you'll find out a little more about my
expectations of my executives.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:29.149
And with my staff, I'm touching all my staff
members, hey, encouraging them, "How you doing?"

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:30.149
"What's going on?"

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:32.100
Keep it going, you're playing an important
role.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.110
We need to keep developing.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.170
We need to keep getting better, what is your
project this week?

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.170
What are you doing?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.240
What's going on with this?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:42.009
We're working that language as well, but there's
a high expectations from the executives for

00:16:42.009 --> 00:16:43.410
them to deliver and to perform.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:50.130
And I'm constantly teaching the executives
and our staff members that no one's more important

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.520
without the sales force, without the customers.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.889
If we don't take care of those two, we don't
have a job and we don't exist.

00:16:56.889 --> 00:16:57.889
Make sense?

00:16:57.889 --> 00:17:02.050
If the sales force is being taken care of
and the customers are being taken care of,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.050
we have a job.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.360
How well of a job are we doing there?

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.360
We're doing good.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360
Excellent, let's get better.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.450
And the last one which is the most important
language you'll speak to an audience is your

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.450
sales force.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.180
And let me explain to you why sales force.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:21.020
I have meetings here with our staff and let's
just say that staff's going to say, "Man,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.970
you know I want to go home early and I want
to go out there and do this and I want to

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.970
go out there and do.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.130
. . " And I say, "Listen, you've been going
home early the last few weeks on Fridays.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.130
What do you think we are?

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.910
Do you think we're a $600 billion company,
we're corporate, going golfing from Friday,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:35.910
Saturday, Sunday?

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.060
No, we're trying to be a $600 billion company.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.620
We're not a $600 billion company.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.430
And you're acting like you've already made
it.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.650
And that's not a leader.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.060
That's an entitled person already.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.101
You want to golf?

00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:47.101
You go golf on Sunday.

00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:48.101
That's totally fine with me.

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:49.101
I don't care if you want to golf.

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.500
But we're building something special here.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:59.170
And so I will always remind our staff that
sales people are in the streets getting rejected,

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:04.030
they're selling, they're marketing, they're
knocking on doors, they're going to families'

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:09.310
house, and they're constantly hearing the
magical words, "N - O." No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.140
We have to be the biggest cheerleaders and
make everything be easier for them.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:20.050
They need to be tough because when it comes
down to sales, I'm not the one that's necessarily

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:27.950
- I'm a driver with my sales guys but I also
understand because I've been selling all my

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.530
life, so I know exactly what it is to go door
to door, I know what it is to work from 6:00

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.430
in the morning to midnight, six, seven days
a week.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.950
I know exactly what it is to work 100 hours
per week.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.260
We still do it today when we're working with
the company.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:46.160
So I love working with my sales guys because
if I make sure my sales guys are trained well,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.840
my customers are happy.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.640
If I teach my guys, my sales guys to have
high expectations and a bigger vision and

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.540
think big on what they can do and make more
money, that means we can expand the company

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.180
and hire more to give them more support.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.120
If we get our sales guys to work on becoming
leaders and becoming independently leading

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.510
their businesses, reading books, developing
themselves all around, they grow and everybody

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.020
else grows in the company.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.230
If we have a spirit of competition and we
stay competitive and edgy on the sales side,

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:20.420
we know exactly how to talk among other competitors,
when the competitors want to bash us and say

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.001
why they're better than us, etc. etc. which
is a part of the world we're in.

00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:27.170
As an entrepreneur in business you've got
to learn how to put your hands up sometimes

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.140
and just brawl with competitors.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.240
It is going to happen.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.960
Sometimes you've got to build bridges, but
sometimes they don't want to build bridges

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.020
and you've got to say, "Let's go toe to toe
and let's see what we can do and who can deliver

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.520
better for the clients."

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.520
But to me, at the top of my list, are sales
people because if customers are not happy

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.060
and I'm on the phone with them for one hour,
they're typically complaining about who?

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.300
Two people.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.330
They're typically complaining about the partner
that didn't give them the service with the

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.680
product that was sold to them by who?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.680
A sales person that didn't give them the type
of results that they want.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.910
And, if they were to call on our home office
to talk to our staff members and executives,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.790
they didn't get the customer service they
want, this is why customers to me is #4, because

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.800
I need to take care of my right partners and
pick them correctly.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.690
I need to make sure my sales reps are treating
my customers right, and I need make sure that

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:23.040
the staff and executives every time they touch
a customer, they're feeling better about themselves,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.690
not walking away saying, "I'm unhappy with
my experience that I had."

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.560
That's why I put sales reps all the way at
the top of my list.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.940
So when you are learning how to communicate
with these guys, and by the way, I can talk

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.251
on this subject, literally, I could do an
eight hour talk on this subject right now

00:20:39.251 --> 00:20:40.790
and just do Q&amp;As all day long.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.350
And I could go deeper in this subject.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.350
What about if they do this?

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.350
What about if say this?

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.350
What about if the partner does this?

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.790
What about if the vendor does this?

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.740
What about if the attorney and the lawyer
does this?

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.740
When do you.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.100
. . this is an eight-hour subject I'm putting
together in I don't know, Paul, how many minutes

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.100
is it already?

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.600
Is it like 20 minutes or 19 minutes?

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.650
22 minutes, whatever the timeline is, yeah,
20 minutes.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.460
We're going to get deeper into this on future
projects that we're going to have, but at

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.560
this point I just want to put this on the
back of your mind when you're thinking about

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.400
how to communicate with people.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400
Let some of these ideas.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.270
help you in communicating with these different
departments, whether it's the public, whether

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:22.260
it's a vendor, whether it's investors, whether
it's customers, partners, staff and executives,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.770
sales people -- learn how to communicate this
language and you'll do better with them.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.020
Paul, send me my pillow.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.250
Send me my pillow real quick, buddy.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.510
Hey, guys, we've got to get to 100,000 subscribers.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.740
I've been getting a lot of great messages
from some of you guys strategizing and helping

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.740
us out.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.700
We want to get this channel, which I believe
is the number one channel on YouTube for entrepreneurs.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.470
I really believe that.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.460
I've sized up my competition and Iook at exactly
what type of content they put together.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:52.960
I believe this is the number one channel on
YouTube for entrepreneurs that want to learn

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960
how-to principles.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960
Not just motivational.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.680
There are a lot of great sites on motivation,
and there are a lot of great YouTube channels

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.220
that create incredible content for motivation
they can go to.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.770
But when I want to know, "How do I do this?"
there's not a lot of how-to.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:11.230
We are the number one how-to channel on YouTube
for entrepreneurship, I believe more than

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.490
any other channel on YouTube.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.050
And we're just getting started.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.980
We need your help to get to 100,000 subs.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.241
I think right now we're at 44,000 and some
change on YouTube subs and we want to get

00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:22.340
to 100,000 by August 31.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.570
I am launching a big project in August that
we're going to launch.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.360
It's going to be an international project
that we're launching.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.090
We bought a domain name for $100,000 and we'll
be launching that here pretty soon, so we

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.790
need your help to help us get to 100,000 subs
by August 31.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.780
