00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:18.808
IN PALM BEACH, YOU CANNOT WORK

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.177

I AM 100% DEATH, AND I CAN ONLY

HEAR BY IRONICALLY WITH EASE.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:52.041
A QUICK -- THE HUMAN EAR HAS

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:53.576
35,000 HAIR CELLS EACH, THEY

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:54.777
DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE

WITH 35,000 HAIRSTYLES DO.

00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:10.593
AND IT IS A MIRACULOUS THING.

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:12.395
IF THIS HAD HAPPENED -- IF I

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:13.496
LOST MY HEARING 15 YEARS BEFORE

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:15.097
I DID IT, THE END OF MY CAREER,

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:17.433
THE TECH HAD NOT BEEN INVENTED.

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:18.801
IT IS REALLY FORTUNATE, AND I

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:21.771
LOOK AT IT AS SOMETHING TO BE

00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:23.306
EXTERNALLY GRATEFUL.

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:25.241
&gt;&gt; Sean: I REMEMBER IN THE

00:01:25.242 --> 00:01:26.242
INTERIM TIME -- NOT TO GET TOO

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:26.976
DISTRACTED, WE HAVE A LOT TO

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:28.978
TALK ABOUT.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.780
I DO RADIO, AS YOU DO.

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.616
I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT IS POSSIBL

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:33.983
POSSIBLE.

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:35.151
MOST PEOPLE IN RADIO, DJs,

00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:37.420
TALK SHOWS, I AM CRANKING THAT

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:38.988
THING UP.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:40.389
DRAMATIC HEARING LOSS AFTER 30

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.690

SURGERY DONE BECAUSE I HAD AN

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:47.163
INFECTION.

00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:48.764
SO YOU RELY ON HOW YOUR VOICE

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:49.365
FEELS.

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.601
AND YOU HAVE TO CONSCIOUSLY TELL

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:52.902
YOURSELF, DON'T -- WHEN YOU

00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.370
CAN'T HEAR, YOU SPEAK UP.

00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:55.771
AS YOU HAVE TO TELL YOURSELF --

00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:57.039
I ASKED OF THEM, ASK THE

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.843
DOCTORS, IF I DON'T DO THIS, CAN

00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:02.311
I SPEAK NORMALLY FOR THE REST OF

00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:03.179
MY LIFE?

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.980
THEY SAID NO.

00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.782
IF YOU CAN'T HEAR YOURSELF

00:02:06.783 --> 00:02:08.017
SPEAK, YOU WILL END UP SOUNDING

00:02:08.018 --> 00:02:09.785
LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT HEARD

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:10.519
BEFORE, SO THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.154
THE IMPLANTS.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:14.090

WAS A BIG DEAL.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.367

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:24.767
US.

00:02:24.768 --> 00:02:26.335
AND WE ALL OWE YOU A DEBT OF

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:26.769
GRATITUDE.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.903
THAT IS WHY, REALLY, I WANTED TO

00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:30.906
BE HERE.

00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:33.142
EXPLAIN THE TRUMP PHENOMENON.

00:02:33.143 --> 00:02:34.844
MAYBE WE HAVE A MORE UNIQUE

00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:37.380
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WE BOTH KNEW

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.848
HIM WAY BEFORE HE EVER THOUGHT

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:39.282
ABOUT RUNNING.

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:41.284
&gt;&gt; Rush: RIGHT.

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:42.952
I DON'T THINK IT IS HARD TO

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:43.686
UNDERSTAND THE TRUMP PHENOMENON

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:46.188
AT ALL.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.557
IF YOU ARE NOT POISON -- I USE

00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:49.425
THAT AS AN EXAGGERATION -- IF

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:52.361
YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED BY INSIDE

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:53.763
THE BELTWAY OR WASHINGTON

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:54.363
ESTABLISHMENT THINKING,

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:57.366
UNDERSTANDING TRUMP IS EASY.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:01.203
IT IS ELITE VERSUS REAL PEOPLE.

00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:03.172
IT IS SOMEBODY THAT IS FEARLESS

00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:05.041
AND WILLING TO FIGHT AGAINST THE

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:06.242
THINGS THAT NO REPUBLICAN HAS

00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:09.378
BEEN WILLING TO FIGHT AGAINST OR

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.346
DEFEND.

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:11.947
HE HAS AN ENGAGING PERSONALITY.

00:03:11.948 --> 00:03:15.151
HE DOESN'T OFFEND PEOPLE -- THE

00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:15.985
LEFT THINKS HE DOES BECAUSE THEY

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:17.486
ACT IF I DID, BUT TRUMP JUST

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:18.954
MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:20.756
THEY CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:21.290
THAT HE IS LIKABLE.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:22.692
BECAUSE THEY HATE IT.

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:25.528
THEY DESPISE IT.

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.731
ARE WE ALLOWED TO MENTION

00:03:28.732 --> 00:03:29.365
COMPETING CABLE NETWORKS?

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:33.469
BECAUSE YOU DOMINATE.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.375
THAT IS WHAT I CALL HIM.

00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:40.343
&gt;&gt; Rush: HE IS ACTUALLY BEEN

00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:42.211
SOMEWHAT NICE TO ME, THERE ARE

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:44.347
EXCEPTIONS TO IT.

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.114
BUT COMPLAINING THAT THE

00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:47.550
PRESIDENT IS TALKING TOO MUCH,

00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:48.417
THE PRESIDENT IS IN THE MEDIA

00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:53.923
TOO MUCH.

00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:56.826
DEMAND ACCESS -- BECAUSE HE IS

00:03:56.827 --> 00:03:58.194
POLLUTING THE AIR.

00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.596
HE IS LYING, DISTORTING, NOT

00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:01.530
GIVING US ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.166
UP WITH HIM AND TO CORRECT HIM.

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:05.000
JUST KEEP GOING,

00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:05.568
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.769
HE IS DOMINATING THESE PEOPLE.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.970
HE IS FRUSTRATING THEM.

00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:09.805
THEY HAVE LOST THEIR MONOPOLY.

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:12.541
THE ELIZABETH MOORE AND, THE

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:14.977
POCAHONTAS, PROVES THEY CANNOT

00:04:14.978 --> 00:04:16.645
SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION ANYMORE VIA

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:17.246
NARRATIVE, AND THEY ARE

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:18.981
FRUSTRATED AS THEY CAN BE ABOUT

00:04:18.982 --> 00:04:19.281
THAT.

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:20.816
&gt;&gt; Sean: HE DOESN'T NEED THAT.

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:21.584
&gt;&gt; Rush: KNOW.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:23.119
PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON HERE, I

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.755
BELIEVE, ALL OF THIS -- I DO

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:26.288
CALL IT ABNORMALITY.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.792
WE ARE UP AGAINST PSYCHOLOGICAL

00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:31.227
DISORDER, ABNORMALITY, THAT IS

00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:33.362
DISGUISED AS POLITICAL ISSUES.

00:04:33.363 --> 00:04:34.730
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:37.166
MEDIA -- IT HAS NEVER BEEN THIS

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:37.666
ABUSIVELY BIASED.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.535
&gt;&gt; Rush: IT IS NOT EVEN

00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:41.270
BIASED, WE ARE SO FAR BEYOND

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:41.604
BIASED.

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:43.305
THESE PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:43.639
AGENDA.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.541
I THINK THEY RUN IT.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.109
I THINK THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.646
ORCHESTRATED, RUN IT, EVEN GIVE

00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:51.380
MARCHING ORDERS TO EACH OTHER.

00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:55.951
THE POINT IS, TRUMP HAS THEM

00:04:55.952 --> 00:04:56.352
BAMBOOZLED.

00:04:56.353 --> 00:04:57.486
I THINK PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT

00:04:57.487 --> 00:04:58.554
THEY ARE DOING IS TRYING TO

00:04:58.555 --> 00:04:59.855
DEMONSTRATE TO THEMSELVES THEY

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:01.123
STILL HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:02.958
PUBLIC OPINION VIA NARRATIVE.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.560
IT IS CAUSING ALL OF THESE

00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:05.294
PEOPLE IN THE LEFT TO GET MORE

00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:07.530
AND MORE AND MORE EXTREME.

00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:09.965
I AM JUST RELYING ON THE FACT

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:10.966
THAT AVERAGE, ORDINARY

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:11.700
AMERICANS, LIKE YOU AND I ARE,

00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:15.971
ARE IS REPULSED AS YOU AND I ARE

00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:17.406
BY THIS BEHAVIOR THAT THEY ARE

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:19.542
ENGAGING IN, THE DEMANDS THEY

00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:22.378
ARE MAKING ON DECENT,

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:23.212
GOD-FEARING, AMERICA-LOVING

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:23.546
PEOPLE.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:25.714
WE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.

00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:27.683
AND YET WE ARE PORTRAYED AS THE

00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:28.150
PROBLEM.

00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:30.152
WHERE THE ENEMY TO THESE PEOPLE.

00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:31.220
IT IS REALLY SCARY.

00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:32.221
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LOSE, GO

00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:34.323
BACK AND LOOK -- IF WE LOSE

00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:36.592
2016, IF THEY GET THE HOUSE, I'M

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:38.360
JUST GOING TO TELL YOU, WHATEVER

00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:39.628
TRUMP WANTS TO DO IS GOING TO

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.995
STOP.

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:40.963
IT IS GOING TO BE PARALYZED.

00:05:40.964 --> 00:05:42.965
IT IS GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT IN

00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:46.969
EVERY HOUSE COMMITTEE THAT IS

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.404
RELEVANT, INSPECTIONS,

00:05:48.405 --> 00:05:49.038
INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS.

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.573
THEY ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND

00:05:50.574 --> 00:05:51.373
TRY TO GET KAVANAUGH THROWN OUT.

00:05:51.374 --> 00:05:53.742
IT IS GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT

00:05:53.743 --> 00:05:55.578
TWO YEARS TO GET EVEN WITH TRUMP

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:57.279
FOR HAVING THE AUDACITY TO WIN.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.848
AND THE BUSINESS OF THE NATION

00:05:58.849 --> 00:05:59.982
IS GOING TO BE BROUGHT TO A

00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:00.749
SCREECHING HALT.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.484
IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ARE GOING

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:03.786
TO TRY TO GET RID OF THE TAX

00:06:03.787 --> 00:06:04.186
CUTS.

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:05.421
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED AT

00:06:05.422 --> 00:06:06.222
ANY OF THIS BECAUSE THE SUN IT

00:06:06.223 --> 00:06:08.724
IS GOING TO BE IN THE HANDS OF

00:06:08.725 --> 00:06:09.992
MITCH McCONNELL, I ESPECIALLY

00:06:09.993 --> 00:06:12.495
HIM COLONEL.

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:14.997
HE MOVES SO SLOW, BUT HE IS

00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:16.499
SPEEDING UP.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.705
&gt;&gt; Sean: HAD A GOOD RUN.

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:24.807
&gt;&gt; Rush: I STILL THINK

00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:26.775
TRUMP -- THAT IS AND WHOM I HAVE

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:28.377
COME IN TERMS OF THE POLITICS OF

00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:30.546
THIS, I STILL HAVE HIT IMPLICIT

00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:30.946
TRUST.

00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:33.315
I THINK TRUMP KNOWS WHAT HE IS

00:06:33.316 --> 00:06:33.649
DOING.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.384
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE HAVE PUT ALL OF

00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.386
THE SUCCESS IN TWO YEARS.

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:38.153
OBAMA, ECONOMICALLY, THE FIRST

00:06:38.154 --> 00:06:41.524
PRESIDENT THAT NEVER MET 3% OF

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:42.358
GDP GROWTH IN HISTORY.

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:44.059
&gt;&gt; Rush: THIS IS THE KEY.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.495
AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:49.265
AMERICA IS SO OPPRESSIVE, SO

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:49.865
MEAN TO MINORITIES.

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:52.401
AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE SUPER

00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:52.835
POWER STATUS.

00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:53.836
THIS IS WHY I WANTED OBAMA TO

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:54.670
FAIL.

00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:58.307
IN HIS VIEW, IN THE AMERICAN

00:06:58.308 --> 00:07:00.342
LEFT'S VIEW, AMERICA IS THE

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:00.910
PROBLEM IN THE WORLD.

00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:06.315
AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE --

00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:09.151
&gt;&gt; Sean: APOLOGIES.

00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:11.420
13 MILLION FOOD STAMPS, AND

00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:11.754
POVERTY.

00:07:11.755 --> 00:07:13.856
&gt;&gt; Rush: MORE PEOPLE VOTING

00:07:13.857 --> 00:07:14.523
DEMOCRAT, MORE DEPENDING ON

00:07:14.524 --> 00:07:15.858
GOVERNMENT CARE THEY WANT THAT,

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:16.158
SEAN.

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:19.194
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE HAVE 14 STATES,

00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:19.962
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:22.464
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT SENSE '69,

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:23.799
1 MILLION MORE DON'T KNOW MY

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.935
JOBS THAN PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:26.969
PAIRED LOOK AT WHO IS

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.369
BENEFITING.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.337
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ON EMPLOYMENT,

00:07:28.338 --> 00:07:28.904
LOWEST EVER.

00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:31.607
HISPANIC ON APPOINTMENT, ASIAN

00:07:31.608 --> 00:07:32.575
UNEMPLOYMENT, WOMEN IN THE

00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:33.676
WORKPLACE UNEMPLOYMENT PAIRED

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:36.412
ALL OF THE SUCCESS, YOU ARE

00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:37.846
SAYING, STOPS IF THEY GET THE

00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:38.147
HOUSE.

00:07:38.148 --> 00:07:40.149
&gt;&gt; Rush: LET ME ASK YOU A

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.616
CIVIL QUESTION.

00:07:40.617 --> 00:07:40.883
WHY?

00:07:40.884 --> 00:07:42.718
YOU HEARD HIM GO THROUGH THESE

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:44.553
STATISTICS.

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:45.955
THE FACTS OF THE ECONOMIC

00:07:45.956 --> 00:07:46.355
ADVANCEMENT.

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:50.159
WE HAVE MORE JOBS THAN THERE ARE

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.859
JOB OPENINGS.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.963
A MILLION MORE JOBS THAN THERE

00:07:53.964 --> 00:07:54.964
ARE OPENINGS.

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:56.565
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE 2017.

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:58.534
WHO WAS PRESENT THEN?

00:07:58.535 --> 00:07:59.001
IT WASN'T OBAMA.

00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:02.972
THE THINGS YOU JUST HEARD,  SEAN

00:08:02.973 --> 00:08:03.772
GO THROUGH, THE DEMOCRATS ARE

00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:04.974
ANGRY AT ALL OF IT.

00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:05.941
WHY ARE THEY HAPPY?

00:08:05.942 --> 00:08:08.077
FOLKS, WE ARE IN A ROARING

00:08:08.078 --> 00:08:08.410
ECONOMY.

00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:09.445
MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER CAN GET

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:10.779
THE JOB THEY WANT TO, THEY ARE

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.781
GETTING READY AND SAYS.

00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:16.952
WE HAVE PEOPLE FREE TO START

00:08:16.953 --> 00:08:17.987
THEIR OWN BUSINESSES.

00:08:17.988 --> 00:08:18.821
EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF LIFE IN

00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:20.589
AMERICA IS ON THE UPSWING, AND A

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.191
POLITICAL PARTY AND ITS VOTERS

00:08:22.192 --> 00:08:23.726
ARE MAD ABOUT IT.

00:08:23.727 --> 00:08:24.159
WHY?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.260
WHY COULDN'T YOU BE HAPPY?

00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:26.528
THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:31.166
IF IT HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:32.301
INDIVIDUAL APTITUDE AND

00:08:32.302 --> 00:08:34.136
APPLICATION AND SET OF

00:08:34.137 --> 00:08:35.337
GOVERNMENT MAKING IT HAPPEN,

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:36.572
THEY ARE GOING TO OPPOSE IT.

00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:39.008
THIS THE GREATEST THREAT,

00:08:39.009 --> 00:08:41.777
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, ECONOMIC

00:08:41.778 --> 00:08:43.178
GROWTH, SELF-SUFFICIENCY,

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.880
SELF-RELIANCE, PEOPLE LEARNING

00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:46.482
THAT THE OLD RULES OF WORKING

00:08:46.483 --> 00:08:48.150
HARD AND APPLYING YOURSELF PAY

00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:49.718
OFF, BIGGEST THREAT TO THE

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:50.953
AMERICAN LEFT IN THE DEMOCRAT

00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:51.920
PARTY THAT THERE COULD BE.

00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:52.921
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:55.924
WHY ARE THEY HAPPY ABOUT THIS?

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:57.092
EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE --

00:08:57.093 --> 00:08:58.527
&gt;&gt; Sean: BECAUSE THEY LOSE

00:08:58.528 --> 00:08:58.927
THEIR POWER.

00:08:58.928 --> 00:09:00.129
&gt;&gt; Rush: OF COURSE.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.563
IT ANSWERS ITSELF.

00:09:01.564 --> 00:09:02.931
&gt;&gt; Sean: YOU HAVE BEEN A

00:09:02.932 --> 00:09:03.565
LEADER IN THE CONSERVATIVE

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:05.334
MOVEMENT IN AMERICA --

00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:06.368
&gt;&gt; Rush: I DON'T KNOW.

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:11.106
&gt;&gt; Sean: NUMBER ONE --

00:09:11.107 --> 00:09:13.642
AUDIENCE SUSTAINED AND BIGGER.

00:09:13.643 --> 00:09:15.377
&gt;&gt; Rush: THE CONSERVATIVE

00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:18.514
MOVEMENT IS LED BY

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:18.947
NEVER-TRUMPER.

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:21.550
&gt;&gt; Sean: IF THEY HAD THEIR

00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:22.785
WAY, WHERE WOULD WE BE?

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:25.554
&gt;&gt; Rush: NOT HERE.

00:09:25.555 --> 00:09:26.288
HILLARY WOULD BE PRESIDENT IF

00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:29.692
THEY HAD THEIR WAY.

00:09:29.693 --> 00:09:31.760
&gt;&gt; Sean: IF YOU BELIEVE

00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:34.563
GOLDWATER WAS A WAY OF, IF YOU

00:09:34.564 --> 00:09:35.397
BELIEVE REAGAN WAS A WAVE --

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:39.902
MEANING THE ADVANCEMENT OF

00:09:39.903 --> 00:09:40.369
CONSERVATIVISM.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.970
WHERE DOES DONALD TRUMP -- I

00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:44.206
LOOK AT HIS POLICIES.

00:09:44.207 --> 00:09:45.340
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A

00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:45.774
CONSERVATIVE.

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:47.543
NEVER CHANGE MY VIEWS.

00:09:47.544 --> 00:09:49.745
I SAY IT DIFFERENTLY, NEW

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:50.779
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT MY

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.747
FUNDAMENTAL, CORE BELIEFS HAVE

00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:52.181
NEVER CHANGED.

00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:54.550
NOR HAVE YOURS.

00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:55.551
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE SAID HE

00:09:55.552 --> 00:09:57.753
IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE.

00:09:57.754 --> 00:09:58.220
WHERE?

00:09:58.221 --> 00:09:59.755
BESIDES TRADE, AND I DON'T EVEN

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:01.457
THINK TRADE -- SHE NEVER PLANNED

00:10:01.458 --> 00:10:01.924
A TRADE WAR.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:03.559
&gt;&gt; Rush: HE IS IMPLEMENTING.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.127
I KNOW THESE PEOPLE, I GOT TO

00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:06.929
KNOW THEM IN 30 YEARS.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.596
&gt;&gt; Sean: BUCKLEY LOVES YOU.

00:10:07.597 --> 00:10:08.664
&gt;&gt; Rush: I WILL TELL YOU A

00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:09.665
STORY ABOUT HIM IN A MINUTE.

00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:11.066
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TO ASK ME

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:12.434
WHERE HE WOULD BE ON TRUMP.

00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:15.003
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS PRETTY

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:16.505
SIMPLE.

00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:22.111
BUT THEY DON'T LIKE US TRUMP --

00:10:22.112 --> 00:10:23.946
HE IS IMPLEMENTING ISSUES THAT

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:24.713
THESE PEOPLE HAVE DEVOTED LIVES

00:10:24.714 --> 00:10:27.916
TO BEING PASSED, AND THEY ARE

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:29.351
VOTING AWAY FROM IT.

00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:30.385
NEVER MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE

00:10:30.386 --> 00:10:30.719
ISSUES.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.856
IT MUST BE ABOUT THE PROPER

00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:35.724
MANNERS AND MAKING SURE WE DON'T

00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:36.525
OFFEND OUR LIBERAL FRIENDS IN

00:10:36.526 --> 00:10:38.627
WASHINGTON AND ALL OF THAT.

00:10:38.628 --> 00:10:39.928
TRUMP DOES ALL OF THAT.

00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:41.430
I CAN'T ABIDE THIS, THIS IS SO

00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:43.065
OFFENSIVE TO ME, I CAN'T DO

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:45.134
THIS.

00:10:45.135 --> 00:10:50.372
MEANWHILE, EVERYTHING THAT IS

00:10:50.373 --> 00:10:51.039
HAPPENING IS MAKING AMERICA

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.774
GREAT, EXACTLY AS CONSERVATIVES

00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:52.474
SAID IT WOULD, AND THEY DON'T

00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:54.743
WANT TO BE ON THE BUS.

00:10:54.744 --> 00:10:58.547
&gt;&gt; Sean: I SAY THIS TO PEOPLE

00:10:58.548 --> 00:11:00.315
AND -- HE GOVERNS AS STRONG A

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:01.850
CONSERVATIVE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN

00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:02.284
OUR LIFETIME.

00:11:02.285 --> 00:11:03.418
&gt;&gt; Rush: HE DOES.

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:05.521
I DON'T THINK THE DIVIDE IN

00:11:05.522 --> 00:11:07.489
AMERICA IS LEFT AND RIGHT SO

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.790
MUCH.

00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:08.357
&gt;&gt; Sean: CONSERVATIVE

00:11:08.358 --> 00:11:09.958
PRINCIPLES.

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:11.560
&gt;&gt; Rush: CONSERVATIVE

00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:11.994
PRINCIPLES --

00:11:11.995 --> 00:11:15.931
&gt;&gt; Sean: TAX CUTS, JUDGES,

00:11:15.932 --> 00:11:16.398
BORDER SECURITY.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.699
&gt;&gt; Rush: IT IS THE TRADITIONS

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.735
OF THE FOUNDING, ARE WE GOING TO

00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:20.636
GO MARXIST LEFTIST?

00:11:20.637 --> 00:11:21.737
THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:23.172
WE DON'T HAVE IN COMMON WITH

00:11:23.173 --> 00:11:25.908
THEM, SEAN.

00:11:25.909 --> 00:11:28.410
I STILL HEAR THESE PEOPLE SAY WE

00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.745
NEED TO CROSS THE AISLE TO

00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:32.047
COOPERATE -- WHAT DO WE HAVE IN

00:11:32.048 --> 00:11:32.381
COMMON?

00:11:32.382 --> 00:11:34.383
NAME SOMETHING WE HAVE IN COMMON

00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:36.218
WITH ANY OF THE PEOPLE ACTING TO

00:11:36.219 --> 00:11:38.120
DESTROY KAVANAUGH?

00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:39.721
WHERE IS THE MIDDLE GROUND TO

00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:40.355
COMPROMISE WITH THEM ON

00:11:40.356 --> 00:11:40.722
KAVANAUGH.

00:11:40.723 --> 00:11:43.525
THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DENY

00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:45.561
HIM -- ALLOW HIM TO PROCESS.

00:11:45.562 --> 00:11:47.129
&gt;&gt; Sean: ZERO.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.696
ENDO- CORROBORATION.

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:48.430
&gt;&gt; Rush: THEY WANT TO DESTROY

00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:50.866
HIS LIFE.

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:54.336
AND HIS FAMILY, HIS CAREER, HIS

00:11:54.337 --> 00:11:56.738
FUTURE, AND THEY TELL US, THEY

00:11:56.739 --> 00:11:57.539
ARE THE PARTY OF COMPASSION.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.775
&gt;&gt; Sean: WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE,

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:02.311
WE HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, CLARENCE

00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:02.644
THOMAS.

00:12:02.645 --> 00:12:04.446
&gt;&gt; Rush: YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY.

00:12:04.447 --> 00:12:06.915
HE WANTED EVERY ELECTION.
