00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.798
I love music.
I hate the industry.

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:11.345
It’s an entirely
shitty situation.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.225
I’m all over the fucking radio.
These motherfuckers love me.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.268
Why the fuck am I broke?

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.687
You know D, that’s how you felt,
like Goddamn.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.564
That’s the fee you pay
to get into the game.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.734
Wow. So this piece of paper
really holds this much power.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.444
They just spend these kids, man.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.238
People get fucked
over all the time.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.033
Where do you learn it?
There’s no school for hip hop.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:40.916
Well, Puff is like my idol.
You know what I mean?

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.752
He’s one of the reasons
why I wanted to be a part of Bad

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:46.880
Boy, why I wanted to be hit man.
So Puff was like,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.382
"I wanna sign you
to a publishing thing.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.259
I wanna do this,
I wanna manage you,"

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.928
and I was like, "This is, like,
Puff wants to do this for me?"

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.264
And I’m thinking, I’m like,
"Wait a minute ...

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.225
If I sign all this stuff,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.187
that means he gets paid
from everything I do.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.897
And even if I produce with him,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.649
it’s like he’s getting
paid twice."

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.359
And I was like,
"Get the fuck outta here."

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.152
I remember we were in the studio
and I screamed at him,

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.862
it was the first time
I screamed at Puff.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:12.698
I was like, "How am I
supposed to get any money?"

00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:14.324
And he was like,
"Alright then."

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.701
It wasn’t like
there was no beef,

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.452
but then it was like,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.121
alright so you about
to go to this party afterwards.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.248
So at that moment,
I realized is a difference

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.958
between friends and business.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.376
He never stopped being my friend

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.295
because I didn’t sign
those papers,

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:28.255
but like, shit, if you gonna
let me do it, I’m a try.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.634
I never told him,
I appreciate you for that

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.886
because that was one of the best
learning experiences

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.596
I ever had
in the music industry.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.766
We are about to sign
our recording contract.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.477
Over here, we got all
the Cristal we about to pop.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.647
They have fucking clauses in
these shitty contracts that say,

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.858
"We’re only gonna pay you 15%."

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.193
In that 15%,
the label’s charging you

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.237
for every fucking thing
that takes place.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.657
Yeah, you see we’re getting
D Dots joint down there now.

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.493
Proof.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.456
The artist has to pay everybody.
The producers, the songwriters.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.999
Every dime they spend,

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.126
they either gonna charge you
half or 100%.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.628
So most of us, including myself,

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.547
had no clue
what the fuck that meant.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.133
All these motherfuckers
with your shitty paperwork,

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.010
your money’s gotta
go through all them.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.928
Damn, we only getting
12 cents off a dollar?

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.472
And outta my 12,
I gotta pay you,

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.806
you, you, you and you?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.433
What the fuck?

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.977
Damn, can you at least
put some Vaseline on it?

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.605
Can we have some wine
and cheese before?

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.440
Goddamn, like,
what’s happening here?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.445
You have a lot of kids
coming from these inner cities

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.781
that never even seen
10,000 dollars cash before.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.824
So if you have a person
that’s coming to you like,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.827
"Here’s 20,000. Sign to me,
I’m a put your album out."

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.704
They’re not looking at
no legal team where like,

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.915
"Let me call my lawyer and make
sure that this deal is right."

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.626
You’re taking the 20,000, you’re
going to sign the contract

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.294
and you’re going
to figure it out later

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.962
on when the money is gone.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.465
It’s too much coming
at them too fast.

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:57.010
A lot of people just are
so thirsty for a platform

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.720
that they sell themselves short.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.055
You just see a big label,
and you’re like,

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.932
"They wouldn’t do me wrong."

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:03.850
Where do you learn that?
There’s no school for hip hop.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.897
You know, I definitely signed
some bad contracts in my time.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.819
Some still pending.
Now, I’ve got a piece of paper.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.238
It make you just think, like,
"Wow.

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.824
Do this piece of paper
really hold this much power?"

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.161
You dangled, like, this fucking
career in my face and,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.163
like, yeah, I want to do it.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.790
Of course I’m not reading
this shit, like,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.667
not to say that, like,

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.127
it’s the smart thing to do,
but you’re young.

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.045
But, at the same time,
you a grown man.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.588
You know how to read, too.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.340
You told not to read
that contract.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:40.053
So I don’t get when people say,
like, "Oh, don’t sign

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.888
with such and such, you know,
they be fuckin’ people."

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.390
You know, hell,
they aint fuck nobody.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.559
You had it,
you could have read it.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.602
You chose not to read it.
You look at the fact,

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.313
that they put this two bit stats
of a minor

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.775
over here next to the contract.
This is all you gonna ever get.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.652
You aint even look
at the contract.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.821
We have a frustrated artist
who wakes up one day

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.657
and realizes that,
"I’m all over the fucking radio.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.577
These mother fuckers love me.
Why the fuck am I broke?"

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.871
And then they explain to you,
like, "This is why.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.791
Paragraph 64 clause
B says you don’t get shit."

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.128
When you’re a artist,
you gotta make hot records.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.505
That’s what your job is to do.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.799
You’re not making hot records,
we have to move on.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.968
It’s nothing personal.
It’s business.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.971
Even as a executive, if I’m not
putting out hit records

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.515
or I’m not signing hot artists,
they’re gonna be like,

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.643
"I think we can find somebody
else to fill your position."

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.187
Everybody at the label
could get fired

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.147
just like the artist
could get dropped.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.399
You could go to war
with your label

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.277
and the label war is probably,

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.989
like, one of the major
contributions to failed careers.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.616
At the end of the day,

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.534
I’m trying
to take care of my family, too,

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.913
just like you are, so what makes
your life better than mine?

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:51.124
You start arguing with
these executives,

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.335
and they just fucking turn
the switch off on your ass.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.003
Don’t like you anymore.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.339
First thing you gonna say is,
"Well, let me go."

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.049
They don’t do that shit.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.468
Obviously, all the cash money
we single doin this.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.139
Tyga claims that Birdman owes
him like 12 million dollars.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.807
You know, hey, Birdman,
you robbed me,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.726
so I’m going to put on
a loud speakerphone

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.895
and tell everybody that you
robbed me and everybody else

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.939
that comes to you
is going to be very careful

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.358
about how you, you know,
they do those contacts.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.070
If anybody can take that stuff
personal and have stuff goin,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.322
they might not want
to choose this job.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.241
Literally everything
in the industry,

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.369
they will try to get over on you
if you let it slide.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.247
I’m the type, like,
I will pull up the complex,

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:31.706
you know what I’m saying?

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.833
Like,
"Hey, where’s the footage?"

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.085
You know, to be a boss,
sometimes,

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.795
you have to be a bitch.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:43.510
You don’t work a nine to five,
so you don’t get,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.013
like, you know, your insurance
and your income tax check.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.848
You don’t get none of that shit.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.560
Published shit is kind of like
your paycheck for writing.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.853
You get paid for when people
listen to your music

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.064
over and over again.
Those are checks that just come.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.899
You don’t want to give
that shit up.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.609
Sometimes, you might have to,
like, break a little piece

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.194
off of somebody,
you know what I’m saying?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.363
But make it worth it.
Don’t give it all up.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.864
Ever.
Ever.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.991
Yo, Kanye, you gonna play
something?

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:07.284
Yo, West!

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.785
Kanye!

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.161
Talk about Kanye
and the publishing.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.122
To manage him,
I had an opportunity

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.249
to own some of his publishing.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.501
I didn’t want to do that
to any producer I manage

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.462
because they were
my startup guys and Kanye

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.172
was a sample producer.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.966
He took a sample from Jay-Z.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.885
Sample from this music,
and then you put it together.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.929
I was gonna pretty much
let him know

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.347
that you’re not gonna make
no fuckin’ money in royalties

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.057
with all these samples
you’re doing.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.476
I rearranged the deal
for everybody

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.437
to where he got
his publishing back.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.024
The industry just wants
to rape and take.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.611
Labels should do what’s fair,
and that’s why the artists today

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.529
are saying,
"Fuck you, record company."

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.656
And they should.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.533
Everybody’s trying to figure out

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:52.120
how to get that money even
though the sales have dwindled.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:07:00.378
There was one time I met
these execs, like,

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.382
brought us to the house,
laid, everything is crazy

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.344
and gave us this whole
big pep talk, speech.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.305
And then, literally, like,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.015
I think it was
eight months later we went

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.059
and met the same guys,
but this time in the office,

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.771
and they came in and gave us
the whole same exact spiel.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.147
Like the same exact speech,

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.066
like the introduction,
everything.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.860
And that’s when I knew,
like, "Man."

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.862
Like they just
spin these kids, man.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.951
I’m 19. He’s 21, like,
we’re young,

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.703
so a lot of people
try to take advantage of us.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.330
Yeah.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.998
But the thing is,
they don’t realize

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:37.832
that we actually
already know what’s up.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.376
We already know.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.378
I’m so scared to sign
my name on shit.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.879
I’m scared to give you
a autograph,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.589
let alone sign a contract.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.175
It’s kind of like old school
verses new school.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:50.428
Most kids now feel I don’t need
to sign with a label.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.472
They have all this amazing music
and I’m like,

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.474
"I know some people,
you wanna ... ?"

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.851
And it’s like, "No. I just
want to put it out myself."

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.231
When we were coming up,
we didn’t foresee MP3’s,

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.817
but somebody did because
in contracts we were signing,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.443
they would say things like,

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.821
"You making records
for cassette cd’s

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:11.116
and any form in the future."
That line meant a lot.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.535
All of a sudden,
Itunes showed up and now,

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:15.537
we’re fighting our contracts

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:18.415
because we didn’t take time
to study what was in it.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.874
Somebody else did.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.876
Make sure,
before signing anything,

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.795
to have somebody look over it

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.714
just to make sure you just
don’t sign your life away.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:28.049
A lot of artists, from day one,

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.551
they walk into
a shitty situation.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.469
Shitty paperwork, shitty deal,

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.346
shitty people
around them sometimes.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.015
In my case,
we had the shitty paperwork.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:40.562
We went beyond that and we sold
a lot of fucking records.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.404
You seen MC Hammer lose, what,
20, 30 million dollars?

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.781
Like, it can happen.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.951
We didn’t know nothing
about anything.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.619
I’m doing this shit.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.621
That was my first hundred
thousand dollar check.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.123
At that point,
we just started ballin.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.083
And that’s what you do it for.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.294
They givin’ us money to do this
and we get to go shopping.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.796
I’m like, "Oh, shit.
This is real. And I’m broke."

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.383
You check your account,
it’s like, "Where did that go?"

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.720
Shit woke you up fast.
Really, really fast.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.644
The day we got our first check,
we ran out of gas, dog.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.108
That was, oh my God,
that’s hilarious!

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.610
Yeah. We got our first pay,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.403
so we ran out of gas
on the freeway.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.489
We got our first-

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.032
And we had to walk all the way
to the gas,

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.617
it was like, how many miles?

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.076
A lot of miles,
but, we had to walk.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.286
It was hilarious
and we were so happy.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.496
Yeah.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.414
I was driving, too.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.750
I was so happy, I went,
I didn’t even look at the gas.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.669
I didn’t even look
at the gas meter on the freeway.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.296
I’m like, "Hold on.
What’s wrong with the car?"

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:49.881
Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.299
Looked at the gas,
I’m like, "Ohhh."

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.053
Ohhh.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.555
It was 400, but it was 440

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.016
because maybe he gave us
like a tip, too.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.143
First pay stub ever was $440.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.812
Yeah.
