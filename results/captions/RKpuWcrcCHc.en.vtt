EATEN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

BULB-SHAPED STRUCTURE, DEPENDING
ON WHAT THE STAGE OF THE HAIR

AND THEREFORE, HE JUST DIDN'T

IN HER DIARY, BEVANS FOUND TWO
ITEMS OF INTEREST.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:14.553 align:start position:0%
THE FIRST WAS AN UNUSUAL
REFERENCE.

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:17.323

KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.133 line:0%
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A NAME I HAD
NEVER SEEN OR I NEVER HEARD OF,

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:31.570 align:start position:0% line:0%
AND SO MY QUESTION WAS, WHY DID
KATHLEEN WRITE IT DOWN?

00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:34.673 align:start position:0% line:0%
OBVIOUSLY IT MEANT SOMETHING TO
HER.

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:39.011

AIR FORCE WITH KATHLEEN'S
HUSBAND, BILL, AND THERE WERE

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:45.851 align:start position:0%
RUMORS THE TWO WERE HAVING A
SEXUAL AFFAIR.

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:48.654 align:start position:0%
BEVANS WENT TO VISIT
SHANNON GILBERT.

00:09:48.687 --> 00:09:50.689 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID, "IS THIS ABOUT
BILL LIPSCOMB?"

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:52.024
WE SAID, "YES, MA'AM, IT IS."

00:09:52.057 --> 00:09:54.693 align:start position:0%
SHE SAYS, "I WILL NEED AN
ATTORNEY," AND AT THAT POINT, I

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:58.263 align:start position:0%
KNEW I HAD SOMETHING.

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:02.701 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BEVANS FOUND
ANOTHER INTERESTING ENTRY IN

00:10:02.734 --> 00:10:04.269 align:start position:0%
KATHLEEN'S DIARY.

00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:09.141
IT SAID, "NUMEROUS CALLS AND
NIGHTS OUT, PASSING INFORMATION

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
ABOUT W.A.P.S. TESTING.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.380 align:start position:0%
BILL HAS ALL QUESTIONS FOR THE
TEST."

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:19.318 align:start position:0%
W.A.P.S. STANDS FOR WEIGHTED
AIRMAN PROMOTION TEST, WHICH ALL

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:23.922 align:start position:0%
MILITARY PERSONNEL MUST PASS IN
ORDER TO GAIN PROMOTION.

00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:29.061
KATHLEEN'S ENTRY SUGGESTED THAT
HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND, BILL, HAD

00:10:29.094 --> 00:10:30.262 align:start position:0%
CHEATED.

00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:34.867
BILL LIPSCOMB HAD BEEN PROMOTED
FASTER THAN ANY OTHER MASTER

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.336
SERGEANT IN AIR FORCE HISTORY.

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:40.372 align:start position:0%
THIS ENTRY POSSIBLY EXPLAINED
WHY.

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:44.043 align:start position:0%
SINCE THESE CHEATING ALLEGATIONS
INVOLVED THE AIR FORCE,

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:47.913
DR. CHARLES McDOWELL JOINED THE
INVESTIGATION AS PART OF THE

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:51.684 align:start position:0%
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE OFFICE
OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:55.187 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A RELATED
PERIPHERAL CRIME -- WHICH IN ITS

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.457 align:start position:0% line:0%
OWN RESPECT, I GUESS, WAS
SERIOUS ENOUGH BUT CERTAINLY

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.927 align:start position:0% line:0%
DOESN'T COMPARE TO A MURDER
CASE -- THAT GIVES YOU A VENUE

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.631 line:0%
OF ACCESS THAT MAKES IT EASIER
TO GET CLOSER TO YOUR SUBJECT.

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:10.536
&gt;&gt; Narrator: WHILE REVIEWING THE
CRIME-SCENE PHOTOS, DR. McDOWELL

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.738 size:88% position:44%
MADE AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.

00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:16.442
&gt;&gt; THE POSITIONING OF THE BODY
AND THE CONTEXT OF HOW IT WAS

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:20.179
FOUND SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THE
SCENE HAD BEEN STAGED IN ORDER

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:23.949 align:start position:0%
TO CONVEY AN IMPRESSION THAT
THIS WAS A RAPE/MURDER, AND THIS

00:11:23.982 --> 00:11:27.519
IS WHERE THE VICTIM WOUND UP,
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE A RING OF

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:28.887 align:start position:0%
AUTHENTICITY TO IT.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.725 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; WITHIN 30, 45 MINUTES OF
REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE, HE TOLD

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.159 align:start position:0% line:0%
US THAT BILL DID IT.

00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:38.263 line:0%
BILL WAS ACTUALLY THE MURDERER,
WHERE WE HAD ALL, AT THAT POINT,

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:40.999 align:start position:0% line:0%
THOUGHT HE JUST PAID SOMEONE TO
DO IT.

00:11:41.032 --> 00:11:45.137 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: FURTHERMORE,
McDOWELL BELIEVED KATHLEEN'S

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.441 align:start position:0%
CROSSED LEGS REVEALED THE BODY
HAD BEEN STORED IN A SMALL

00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:53.378 align:start position:0%
CRAMPED SPACE AFTER DEATH WHEN
RIGOR MORTIS SET IN.

00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:57.850
McDOWELL ALSO SUSPECTED THAT
SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE KILLER

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.485 align:start position:0%
HAD DUMPED THE BODY.

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:04.189
THAT'S BECAUSE KILLERS WHO KNOW
THEIR VICTIMS TEND TO COVER THE

00:12:04.222 --> 00:12:08.727
BODY OR CONCEAL THE VICTIM'S
FACE, WHICH WASN'T DONE IN THIS

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.563 align:start position:0%
CASE.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT BECAME EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:18.203 align:start position:0%
MULTIPLE PLAYERS IN A CRIME, YOU
HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:21.740 align:start position:0%
IDENTIFYING -- FIRST OF ALL, FOR
IDENTIFYING WHO THEY ARE, AND

00:12:21.773 --> 00:12:24.309 align:start position:0%
THEN FOR PLAYING ONE OFF AGAINST
THE OTHER.

00:12:24.342 --> 00:12:27.980 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AND KATHLEEN'S
DAUGHTER, NOW 9 YEARS OLD,

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:31.016 align:start position:0%
REVEALED ANOTHER PIECE OF NEW
INFORMATION.

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:35.888 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID TO ME, "GRANDMA, WHO
DO YOU THINK KILLED MY MOTHER,"

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:39.158 align:start position:0% line:0%
OR "MY MAMA?"
AND I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW.

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.127 align:start position:0% line:0%
WHO DO YOU THINK KILLED YOUR
MAMA?"

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.532 line:0%
AND SHE TOLD ME, "MY DADDY DID
BECAUSE HE WASN'T WHERE HE SAID

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:48.467 align:start position:0% line:0%
HE WAS THAT NIGHT."

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.402
&gt;&gt; HEY, TONY, WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:54.039
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE CHILDREN NOW
REVEALED THEY WERE WITH THEIR

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:57.409 align:start position:0%
FATHER'S BEST FRIEND
TONY BURELLO, WHO HAD TAKEN THEM

00:12:57.442 --> 00:13:00.679 size:84% position:42%
OUT FOR DINNER ON THE NIGHT
THEIR MOTHER WAS KILLED.

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:02.481
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:05.551 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AND LATER THAT SAME
NIGHT, THE CHILDREN SAID THEY

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:08.554
WOKE UP AND DISCOVERED THEIR
FATHER WAS NOT HOME AND HIS CAR

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:13.292 align:start position:0%
WAS GONE.

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:16.595
&gt;&gt; I REMEMBER ASKING TOM BEVANS
ONE DAY, "WHAT DO THEY WANT, A

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:18.897 align:start position:0%
PICTURE WITH HIS HANDS AROUND
HER NECK?"

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.234
TO ME, WE HAD SO MUCH EVIDENCE
THAT WAS POINTING TO HIM, AND WE

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:24.536 align:start position:0%
KEPT GETTING TOLD, "NO, IT'S NOT
ENOUGH.

00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:25.737 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT ENOUGH."

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.774
I WAS, LIKE, "YOU KNOW, THERE
WASN'T ANYBODY THERE TO TAKE A

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:29.875 align:start position:0%
PICTURE FOR YOU."

00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BEVANS THEN
REQUESTED FORENSIC TESTING OF

00:13:34.112 --> 00:13:38.150 align:start position:0%
THE BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE
COLLECTED DURING KATHLEEN'S

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:42.554 align:start position:0%
AUTOPSY TO DETERMINE THE
IDENTITY OF THE PERSON KATHLEEN

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:44.990
HAD BEEN WITH BEFORE HER DEATH.

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:49.895
INEXPLICABLY, IN THE TWO YEARS
SINCE THE MURDER, THE SAMPLE HAD

00:13:49.928 --> 00:13:52.731 align:start position:0%
BEEN MISLABELED, THEN
MISHANDLED.

00:13:52.764 --> 00:13:56.134 align:start position:0%
FORENSIC TESTING WAS NO LONGER
POSSIBLE.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:14:00.806
PROSECUTORS NEEDED MORE THAN
JUST CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
CORROBORATE THE CHILDRENS'
STORY.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.684 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: KATHLEEN LIPSCOMB'S
FAMILY HIRED A PRIVATE

00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:16.388 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATOR TO HELP SOLVE HER
MURDER.

00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:20.792 size:88% position:44%
AN ENTRY IN KATHLEEN'S DIARY
SUGGESTED THAT HER ESTRANGED

00:14:20.825 --> 00:14:23.829
HUSBAND, BILL, HAD CHEATED ON
HIS MILITARY PROMOTION TESTS,

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:27.065 align:start position:0%
AND KATHLEEN KNEW IT.

00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:31.236 align:start position:0%
IN ADDITION, THE DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN BILL AND

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:33.238 size:78% position:39%
KATHLEEN HAD BEEN BITTER.

00:14:33.271 --> 00:14:37.576
BILL WANTED CUSTODY OF THE
CHILDREN, AND KATHLEEN WASN'T

00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:39.578 size:78% position:39%
ABOUT TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:43.949
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT KATHLEEN
HAD BEEN USING THAT INFORMATION

00:14:43.982 --> 00:14:47.286 align:start position:0%
AS BLACKMAIL IN HER CUSTODY
BATTLE?

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:51.657 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE KNEW IT, AND HE KNEW THAT
IT WOULD BUST HIM, SO THAT'S THE

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.891 align:start position:0% line:0%
BUTTON SHE USED.

00:14:52.924 --> 00:14:56.862 line:0%
I MEAN, SHE PUSHED IT, AND HE
TOLD HER, "YOU CAN'T DO THIS

00:14:56.895 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0% line:0%
BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU'RE GOING
TO END UP ON A COLD SLAB."

00:15:00.932 --> 00:15:05.637
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AT THE CRIME SCENE,
KATHLEEN'S CLOTHING WAS NEATLY

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.242
ROLLED, SUGGESTING SOMEONE WITH
MILITARY TRAINING DUMPED THE

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:11.476 align:start position:0%
BODY.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.647
THE ONLY OTHER MILITARY PERSON
AROUND BILL LIPSCOMB'S HOME THAT

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.649 size:78% position:39%
WEEKEND WAS TONY BURELLO.

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:22.454
MONTHS AFTER THE CRIME, BURELLO
HAD BEEN DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED

00:15:22.487 --> 00:15:24.022 align:start position:0%
FROM THE AIR FORCE.

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:27.192 align:start position:0%
WHEN QUESTIONED, HE WAS EAGER TO
TALK.

00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:29.995 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE WOULD GO TO
CHURCH.

00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:34.566 line:0%
HE COULD HEAR GOD TELLING HIM,
"CONFESS, CONFESS YOUR SINS,"

00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:36.902 line:0%
AND THAT'S WHAT CHANGED TONY.

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:41.707 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: TONY BURELLO
IMMEDIATELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.678
HAD DUMPED KATHLEEN'S BODY IN
THE FIELD JUST AS DR. McDOWELL

00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:54.219 align:start position:0%
SUSPECTED, AND BURELLO SAID THAT
BILL LIPSCOMB WAS THE KILLER.

00:15:54.252 --> 00:15:59.057 align:start position:0%
HE ALSO CONFIRMED SOMETHING
ELSE -- THAT KATHLEEN'S BODY WAS

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.662 align:start position:0%
STORED IN A CEDAR CHEST, WHICH
EXPLAINED WHY HER LEGS WERE

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:06.231
FOLDED WHEN RIGOR MORTIS SET IN.

00:16:06.264 --> 00:16:10.235 align:start position:0%
SURPRISINGLY, TONY BURELLO STILL
HAD THE CHEST.

00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:14.906 align:start position:0%
HE SAID BILL LIPSCOMB ASKED HIM
TO DISPOSE OF IT AFTER THE

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:18.477 align:start position:0%
MURDER, BUT FOR SOME REASON,
TONY KEPT IT.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:23.248 align:start position:0%
FORENSIC SCIENTISTS FOUND A TINY
STAIN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE

00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:24.249 align:start position:0%
CHEST.

00:16:24.282 --> 00:16:29.988 align:start position:0%
TESTING CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS
KATHLEEN'S BLOOD.

00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:34.026 align:start position:0%
TONY BURELLO MET WITH
BILL LIPSCOMB WHILE WEARING A

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:38.897
HIDDEN MICROPHONE, BUT HE DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING INCRIMINATING, SO

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.134 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATORS DEVISED ANOTHER
STRATEGY.

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:45.637
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS AN EVENT THAT WAS A
CONSEQUENCE OF A MARRIAGE THAT

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.871 align:start position:0%
WENT BAD.

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:49.808 align:start position:0%
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
ANGER, THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:51.109 align:start position:0%
AMOUNT OF HOSTILITY.

00:16:51.142 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0% line:0%
I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD FEEL
THAT HOSTILITY SO I COULD

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:59.117 line:0%
UNDERSTAND IT AND UNDERSTAND HIS
REACTION TO IT, AND THEN DEVELOP

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.088 align:start position:0% line:0%
AN INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
THAT WOULD COUNTER THAT AND DEAL

00:17:03.121 --> 00:17:04.823 size:75% position:38% line:0%
WITH HIS OWN PSYCHOLOGY.

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:09.094
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE OSI MADE SURE
THAT BILL LIPSCOMB KNEW HE WAS

00:17:09.127 --> 00:17:10.529 align:start position:0%
BEING INVESTIGATED.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:13.298 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I WANTED HIM TO HEAR
FOOTSTEPS THAT WEREN'T THERE, I

00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:16.435
WANTED HIM TO HAVE THAT FEELING
IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH EVERY

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:19.538 align:start position:0%
TIME THE PHONE RANG, I WANTED
HIM TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER TODAY

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:22.607
WAS GOING TO BE THE DAY THAT HE
HEARD THE KNOCK ON THE DOOR, I

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.110 align:start position:0%
WANTED TO RAISE HIS LEVEL OF
ANXIETY.

00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:28.713 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: EVENTUALLY, BILL'S
FORMER GIRLFRIEND

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:33.585
SHANNON GILBERT ADMITTED THAT
BILL ONCE CONFIDED TO HER THAT

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:35.921 size:88% position:44%
HE PLANNED TO KILL KATHLEEN.

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
AND INVESTIGATORS LET LIPSCOMB
KNOW THAT BOTH GILBERT AND

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.694 size:78% position:39%
BURELLO WERE COOPERATING.

00:17:42.727 --> 00:17:45.530
&gt;&gt; BILL LIPSCOMB WAS PLAYING
MIND GAMES WITH US, AND WE WERE

00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:46.898 size:88% position:44%
PLAYING MIND GAMES WITH HIM.

00:17:46.931 --> 00:17:50.969 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AFTER WEEKS OF
THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS,

00:17:51.002 --> 00:17:54.106 align:start position:0%
DR. McDOWELL BROUGHT
BILL LIPSCOMB IN FOR

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.173 align:start position:0%
QUESTIONING.

00:17:55.206 --> 00:17:58.510 align:start position:0%
DR. McDOWELL VIVIDLY REMEMBERS
THE EXCHANGE.

00:17:58.543 --> 00:18:02.814
&gt;&gt; "OF ALL THE WAYS THIS HAD TO
END, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT

00:18:02.847 --> 00:18:04.749 size:81% position:41%
HAD TO END THE WAY IT DID.

00:18:04.782 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
WHY DID YOU KILL HER?"
AND HE SAID, "I DON'T KNOW WHY I

00:18:08.853 --> 00:18:10.021 align:start position:0%
KILLED HER."

00:18:10.054 --> 00:18:14.159
BUT THEN HE IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT
HIMSELF AND LEANED FORWARD AND

00:18:14.192 --> 00:18:17.929 align:start position:0%
CROSSED HIS ARMS AND SAID, "I
DID NOT KILL MY WIFE."

00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:19.231 align:start position:0%
BUT WE HAD HIM.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:22.701 align:start position:0% line:0%

ON THE SAME LEVEL AS BILL AND
GET HIM TO BREAK, AND WE

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.972 align:start position:0% line:0%
COULDN'T DO IT.

KATHLEEN THREATENED TO EXPOSE

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.615
BILL'S CHEATING ON THE MILITARY

OF THE CHILDREN.

00:18:37.849 --> 00:18:40.118 align:start position:0%
AND WITH THAT...

00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:44.356 align:start position:0%
BILL SOUGHT REVENGE.

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:48.260
ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER, BILL
ASKED TONY BURELLO TO TAKE THE

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:53.532 align:start position:0%
CHILDREN TO DINNER.

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:57.135 align:start position:0%
THEN HE CALLED KATHLEEN, ASKING
HER TO PICK UP THE CHILDREN

00:18:57.168 --> 00:19:03.875 align:start position:0%
EARLIER THAN PLANNED.

00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:06.478 align:start position:0%
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]
WHEN KATHLEEN ARRIVED AND

&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

00:19:10.548 --> 00:19:13.952 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY WANTED TO GO TO
McDONALD'S, SO TONY TOOK THEM TO

McDONALD'S.

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:24.095
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AND AT SOME POINT,
BILL STRANGLED HER TO DEATH.

00:19:24.128 --> 00:19:28.366 align:start position:0%
BILL STORED THE BODY IN A CHEST
UNTIL NIGHTFALL.

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:33.538 align:start position:0%
KATHLEEN'S BLOOD WAS FOUND IN
THE CHEST.

00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:38.143
ONCE THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP,
TONY BURELLO DUMPED KATHLEEN'S

00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:42.347 size:88% position:44%
BODY IN THE FIELD, TRYING TO
MAKE IT APPEAR TO BE A SEX

CRIME.

00:19:43.548 --> 00:19:47.419 align:start position:0%
BUT THE POSITIONING OF THE BODY
AND THE FACT THE BODY WAS

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:51.890 align:start position:0%
UNCOVERED REVEALED THE TRUTH --
THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE

KATHLEEN'S CLOTHING?

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:04.436 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE HAIRS WERE
PLANTED BY BILL LIPSCOMB OR HIS

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:08.139 align:start position:0%
PARTNER, ONE OF THE TWO, TO MAKE
IT LOOK -- NATURALLY THROW US

IDENTIFIED THE WOMAN WHO WAS

00:20:14.812 --> 00:20:18.550 align:start position:0%

APARTMENT AFTER HER MURDER.

00:20:18.583 --> 00:20:23.021 align:start position:0%

TO CHECK ON KATHLEEN WHEN SHE

00:20:23.054 --> 00:20:24.823 size:75% position:38%
DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:29.494
BILL LIPSCOMB PLED GUILTY TO HIS

PENALTY.

00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:33.064 align:start position:0%
HE WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN
PRISON.

00:20:33.097 --> 00:20:37.302 align:start position:0%
IN RETURN FOR HIS COOPERATION,
TONY BURELLO AVOIDED

PROSECUTION.

00:20:38.603 --> 00:20:43.608
NO CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST
SHANNON GILBERT, WHO CHANGED HER

WITNESS-PROTECTION PROGRAM.

DO WITH THE CRIME.

PSYCHOLOGY, AND CRIME-SCENE

RECONSTRUCTION HELPED SOLVE A
VERY COMPLICATED CASE.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:11.002
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU
REALLY DO NEED TO INCLUDE IS

00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:13.204 align:start position:0%
THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMPLEX
INVESTIGATION.

00:21:13.237 --> 00:21:16.107 align:start position:0%
IT INVOLVED A VERY LARGE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE AND A TREMENDOUS

AND ORCHESTRATION.

YOU'RE INTERVIEWING ME.

THAT THEY'RE VERY, VERY BRIGHT

THAT TRY TO SOLVE CRIMES OR WORK

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.257 align:start position:0% line:0%
ON CRIMES, ARE INVOLVED WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT, ARE NOT VERY

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.694 align:start position:0% line:0%
MOST OFTEN, IT'S THE OTHER WAY
