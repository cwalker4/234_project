00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:04.938
- One of my favorite messages
that humans have ever sent

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:08.575
for extraterrestrials to
someday receive was written

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:12.579 align:start size:84% position:16%
in 1974 by Frank
Drake and Carl Sagan.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.647 align:start size:84% position:16%
They sent the message
to a star cluster

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.250
25000 light years away.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.888
It contained 1679 binary

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.958
digits that, when decoded,

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.963
created an image, the
famous Arecibo message.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:33.333 align:start size:97% position:3%
This message is full of
general information about us.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.102 align:start size:81% position:19%
Up here in the
white are numbers.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.571 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now, since math is
probably pretty universal,

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.074
I feel like it's fair to say
that aliens will understand

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.077
that part, but what about
some of these other parts?

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.813
This is a human figure, but
will aliens be able to tell

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.082
that that is supposed to
be the shape of the thing

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.617
that made this?

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:53.987 align:start size:97% position:3%
Could an alien figure out
what all these symbols mean?

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:57.190 align:start size:97% position:3%
For that matter, could a human
even correctly figure out

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.758
what they all mean?

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.994
And I bet that if you were
to ask two people to guess

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
what all this means, you would
get two different answers.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:08.168
I wanna give some humans
a message and I wanna see

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.970
how quickly they come up with
meanings I didn't put in there

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.507 align:start position:0%
or conflicting interpretations,
because if that happens,

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.877
well it could spell trouble for
our ability to say much more

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.846
than simple mathematical truths

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.682
to whatever might be out there.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:26.186
