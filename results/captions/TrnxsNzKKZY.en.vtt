00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.650
I THINK HE WALKS AWAY FROM IT.

00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:48.385
WHEN THEY MAKE FUN OF THE

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:49.086

MR. PRESIDENT.

00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:10.174
I DON'T WANT TO PRAY.

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.275
YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT.

00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:13.077
WE CAN HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT.

00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:14.111
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD

00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:15.146

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.032
COULD DO.

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:42.467
MARIA:  WHEN

00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:43.902
MARIA:  WHAT DID HE INTERVIEW

00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.371
MICHAEL COHEN FOR 10 HOURS?

00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:48.206
THAT SOUNDS LIKE COACHING TO ME.

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:50.041
TALKING TO MICHAEL COHEN FOR 10

00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:52.110
HOURS BEFORE HE TESTIFIED.

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:52.677
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT.

00:05:52.678 --> 00:05:55.814
&gt;&gt; HE WAS TRYING TO BRAINWASH

00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:57.349
HIM WITH THOSE LASER EYES.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.650
LOOK AT ME.

00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:00.585
BEN STILLER IS FANTASTIC AS

00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:01.420
MICHAEL COHEN.

00:06:01.421 --> 00:06:02.421
THERE'S A SKETCH RIGHT THERE.

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:05.357
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM BROADEN

00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:05.657
THAT.

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:06.625
MARIA:  IT'S GREAT TO TALK TO

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:06.992
YOU.

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:09.595
&gt;&gt; I LOVE YOU MARIA.
