00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.980
this tank chats going to be about the
very famous Soviet tank

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.950
the t-34 we're going to look at the t-34
76 this model and also a look at a t-34

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.640
85 now this tank it's quite hard to
explain and talk about because it is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.789
surrounded by such a history and such a
number of myths and it's become an

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.970
iconic vehicle for Soviet Russia and
that Great Patriotic War so we're going

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.500
to try and take some of those issues
apart as we look at it this particular

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.030
t-34 76 is a very early one and we're
very fortunate to have it here it was

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.970
actually captured by the Finnish forces
in the continuation war there's the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.360
Winter War of 39 40 later on later 41 the
war begins again against the Soviet

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.310
Union and the Finns capture a number of
vehicles including this very early t-34

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.450
they put it into service themselves and
this particular vehicle it's got

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.190
modifications on it that the Finns did
and it was actually still in service as

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.560
a training vehicle into the 1950s with
the Finnish military and the swastika on

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.860
the side that by the way is a Finnish
symbol that's been used by their

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.120
military it's nothing to do with Nazism
people often wonder why that's on there

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.510
the fact they happen to be fighting on
the German sides against Soviet Russia

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.820
that's one of those coincidences but
again so this particular vehicle it's on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.330
loan to the Tank Museum and we're very
grateful for the Finns for lending it to

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.420
us now we need to start back with what's
the Red Army up to in terms of its use

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.780
of Tanks the Red Army is first formed in
1918 and it takes a number of Czarist

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.940
officers into its formation it looks at
what the best way for the Red Army to

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.530
fight a future war is going to be and it
studies quite a number of different

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.840
developments even studies like the
Commonwealth use of combined arms at the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.980
Battle of Amiens it looks at a whole
range of different issues and there is a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.420
massive debate within the Soviet millet
tree hierarchy about how should we fight

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.410
a war in the future now one of the
people Mikhail Tukhachevsky is looking

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.990
at the idea of using armoured forces for
a type of warfare that at one point gets

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.110
called the warfare of annihilation let's
have the Red Army as a massive very

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.080
sophisticated technologically advanced
Force which will deliver a crushing blow

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.720
on to any enemy there's another school
of thought that argues along the lines

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.180
of saying no let's use Russia's great
country its depth

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.580
let's go along the way of a of a sort of
sense of attrition rather than

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.230
annihilation and that traditionally that
attritional warfare is how Russia's

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.960
fought wars in the past now these
debates go on 1929 Stalin comes to power

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.830
he decides he's going to back Mikhail
Tukhachevsky --zz ideas and he's going

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.970
to took a chess keys actually even
arguing to say let's industrialize the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.990
whole of soviet society to build not
things like freezes or fridges for the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.360
homes let's do it to build tanks
aeroplanes and make us his great

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.730
military power now Stalin knows is about
to start implementing the five-year

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.100
plans he's going to back took a Chiefs
key because he wants he likes that as an

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.290
idea and he also needs the Red Army on
his side is he's going to implement all

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.020
these future plans now in 1930 then out
go Red Army agents to buy from Britain

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.390
the Vickers export tank and from America
they buy a couple examples and a license

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.140
for the Walter Christie tank there
hasn't gone in printed production in

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.209
America but has that famous Christie
suspension on a very fast vehicle and in

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.540
Russia these vehicles the Vickers export
tank is developed into the t26 tank and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.710
it is started to be built in huge
numbers in Russia and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.530
with the Christie tank it becomes the BT
series of tanks again these are going to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.940
be fast quick moving vehicles that are
going to be the equivalent of cavalry

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.050
tanks t-26 much more the infantry tanks
now those vehicles take time to build in

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.330
the factories and Russia also has a
problem of industrialization that's why

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.200
these five-year plans how do we actually
push through an industrialization

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.130
process so again from America the
Soviets bring in Alfred Karn who's an

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.150
American designer of factories and he
ends up building huge numbers of

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.630
factories and to help the Russians build
this new tank flea the famous Stalingrad

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.500
tractor factory is actually one of
Alfred Khan's

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.930
creations now that process of building
these vehicles some of them are not

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.500
built to a great standard the Russians
have a lot of trouble with their

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.320
metallurgy so some of the early tracks
are fairly weak and by 1937 they're

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.210
already looking at what might be the
replacement vehicle certainly for the BT

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.240
series of vehicles now this is when the
designer of the t-34 mikhail koshkin

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.840
comes into the picture he's working at
the car called locomotive or Comintern

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.760
locomotive Factory it's called basically
they're building tanks there and he set

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.690
the task of can he build a replacement
for the BT tank and his first model that

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.420
he comes out with is something called
the a 20

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.240
it's got sloped armor it's got a 45
millimeter gun it's gonna have

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.980
potentially a diesel engine in the back
and it's also one of these ones they

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.470
call it eight by six it's actually got
six of the road wheels are powered by

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.390
the engine as were the BT series and
that dates back to the fact that early

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.430
track technology was a bit unreliable if
you could run your vehicle on wheels on

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.960
the roads till you need the tracks that
would be better now the problem with

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.690
that it means extra technology lots of
extra come complexity to the design and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.660
build of the vehicle and that idea is
fairly rack

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.610
he dropped in this 820 prototype 20
millimeters of frontal armor nicely

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:59.430
sloped but again we're looking at 1937
here 1938 with late Kazan 1939 with

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.500
counting goal lots of lessons are
learned from these battles and what

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.050
comes back is a use of the t26 and the
BT tanks such as issues such as the

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.700
world's not being very good the enemy
anti-tank guns even though they weren't

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.000
that powerful could penetrate the armor
so koshkin has a rethink and he goes

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.370
back to Stalin and the red army and said
look shouldn't we build something more

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.800
powerful thicker armor protection
all-round a better tank and perhaps even

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.520
a universal tank in other words this
could be a tank that takes over from the

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:45.510
BT series and also the t26 series of
Tanks let's combine them into one new

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.660
type of model now he goes away the first
prototype of his new model it goes

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.040
through another development
it's got thicker Armour on it t 40 it's

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.280
got a bit of a thicker Armour on there
in the first place they start looking at

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.770
a bigger gun they improve on that newer
model and ultimately that becomes really

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:12.360
the prototype of what becomes the t-34
now cocking calls it the t-34 because he

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.660
dates back to 1934 is the time his first
thinking of some of the ideas and the

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.690
theories that go into that t-34 tank
so what's he come up with he comes up

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.710
with a tank that has an seventy six
point two millimeter gunner on it's

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.570
about a three inch gun and that's big
for tanks at the time he comes up with

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.919
he's already got the idea of the sloped
armor slope tom has been around for a

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:44.219
while but the level of protection now is
quite considerably more that he puts on

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:49.740
this first model t-34 and another issue
just like the American Sherman during

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.240
the production run of t-34 the levels of
armor protection go up they almost

00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:01.199
doubled during its production run
he gets this v12 diesel engine v2k

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:06.449
engine that goes in the back of this
vehicle diesel engine aluminium block

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:13.199
the designer of that engine ends up in
1938 guy killed kalpen ends up being

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:19.920
shot in one of Russia's or Stalin's
purges it's got a transmission system

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.839
that is at the beginning fairly rough
and ready but again through the process

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:31.500
of manufacture starts improving and this
first prototype is sent out on the road

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:37.829
for a 2000 kilometer road trip they go
from Kharkov they visit Moscow they show

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:44.579
the vehicle off to the Kremlin to Stalin
and it's taken around the houses and

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:49.470
again obviously in that sort of early
driving sudden transmission teething

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.569
troubles come out further changes are
being made now there's an onus now on

00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:58.800
the development of this tank because
already even though there's been

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.079
doubters about do we want to go this big
heavy it's about a 28 ton vehicle do we

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:08.939
want that amount of firepower you've got
the people building the kV 1 kV 2 tanks

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:12.660
they're looking at as if to say hang on
a second this has a rival for us we

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.829
don't like the idea there's people in
the Red Army are saying no it would be

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:21.540
much more sensible for the Soviet
economy to perfect and keep on building

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.879
the BT and the t26 tear it series of
vehicles but what's happening is the

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:34.829
Winter War 39 to 40 shows again as did
Cal King goal and late Kazan battles at

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:40.259
the end of the 30s the weakness of those
designs and of course in May of 1940

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:45.120
with the German invasion of France
blitzkrieg we see then or the Russian

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:51.959
see the use of new armor and the way
that the Germans are using vehicles like

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:57.509
the pans r3 and the pans are for so now
all of a sudden that t-34 there's an

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:04.259
emphasis behind it and by September of
1940 the very first production vehicles

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:09.529
are now starting to come out koshkin the
designer he dies of pneumonia in

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:14.050
September when they
first vehicles are being issued and his

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:20.170
role as a developer of the t-34 is then
taken over by the chap who's been

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.060
building the transmission so he ends up
looking after the development of the

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:33.040
t-34 through into the t-34 85 now that
t-34 tank the early models again like so

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.920
many tanks they have a number of
failures I've already mentioned

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.180
metallurgy that consistently becomes a
problem for the Russians transmissions

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.670
there's photographs of some of the early
t-34 is driving around with a spare

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.970
transmission literally bolted to the
rear of the vehicle because there was so

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.530
many failures so you took a spare one
with you they have a number of problems

00:11:53.530 --> 00:12:00.250
there with that vehicle and there's only
about 900 them are in service by the

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.250
summer of 1941 when of course
here comes Operation Barbarossa and the

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.900
in Germans invade the Soviet Union
there's about 500 kv-1 tanks ready at

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.510
about that time the vast majority of
this enormous Soviet tank fleet at the

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:23.680
time is still bTW tanks or the t26
series of Tanks in huge tens of

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.320
thousands of numbers now the Red Army
that meets that German invasion in the

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.020
summer of 1941 has gone through in the
late 1930s a series of purges from

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.080
Stalin
he's got rid of at least 35,000 officers

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.060
it's getting new equipment that's
starting to come into service it is

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.100
expanded massively and rapidly with this
threat of a German war on the horizon

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.300
originally it was being built up much
more along the lines of traditional le

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.950
Reaver was going to be there Poland then
all of a sudden Stalin has got his

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.690
Molotov Ribbentrop pact he's done a pact
with histor Hitler some say that's to

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.730
bite him more time some say was just
naivety he's got an extra year or so but

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:12.280
that Russian army is described as a
stumbling Colossus it is not in a very

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.350
fit state to fight the war that it's
coming its way even though it's got some

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.420
of these new vehicles coming into
service now this tank

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.580
the t-34 76
again we hear great stories about it in

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.870
terms of when the Germans first
encounter it they're absolutely amazed

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.020
at the thickness of its armor the power
of its gun but tactically it's used very

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.400
poorly by the Red Army what tends to
happen as some of this is too due to the

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.900
design and the crew ergonomics of it but
these guys who are driving these

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:53.020
vehicles have had very little experience
on the vehicle command control and the

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:58.000
leadership is frankly abysmal at the
time in the Red Army and so even though

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.750
there's some outstanding examples of
t-34s doing heroic actions holding up

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:09.250
enormous German forces statistically
really most of them about half of them

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.710
are breaking down before they even get
into action and that problem is as I

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.850
mentioned some of it as well as to do
with the design so for example when we

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:25.570
look at this vehicle the early model
t-34s with that turret that's a two-man

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:31.180
turret now I'm not that big a bloke but
I couldn't even fit my shoulders into

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.920
that turret across the rear there so how
two guys are supposed to be in there the

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.450
commander and also the gunner is
supposed to fit in that very tight space

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.700
you know that is a cramped area there
the other issue the commander doesn't

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.980
have a Coppola so his actual vision from
inside that vehicle he's got one

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.930
periscope and again the Germans report
on the fact that quite often they could

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.790
get three aimed accurate rounds off for
every one that the Soviets are firing

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.710
and only platoon commanders vehicles
have a radio

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.820
so these vehicles in a platoon are
signalling to each other either with

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.670
flags and as you can imagine under fire
the last thing you want to be doing is

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.990
opening up your hatch and starting to do
flag signals so again some of these

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.340
early accounts the Germans are reporting
on these tanks almost following each

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:28.000
other around not being very tactically
aware not using the very thick armor

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.290
that they've got comparatively at the
time and they're impressive firepower to

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:38.290
great effect now the early model L 11
gun the 76.2 mm

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:45.880
- gun a design viewer the gravy design
Bureau it in in Russia is ends up coming

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.130
up with a better design they call it the
f34 gun and they are not given official

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.120
permission to start producing this gun
but they go ahead anyway and it's only

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.399
because of the good reports on this
newer gun with its better penetration

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:05.350
that comes back from the frontline that
that starts being added to the 1941

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:12.310
model of the t-34 so again it's part of
this story that as the t-34 goes through

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:17.829
its development it goes through a number
of changes now that gun firing an

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:22.540
armor-piercing composite rigid round in
other words a slug of something like

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:29.290
tungsten within a wider 76.2 millimeter
sheath that round could go through

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:35.079
ninety millimeters of armor plate at
about five hundred meters and you have

00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:39.069
to think in the summer of 41 if you're
looking at the panzer three and the

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:42.880
panzer 4 most of those tanks maximum
you've got about 60 millimeters of armor

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.579
so that's a very effective tank killing
gun early in the campaign we've

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:55.329
mentioned about reliability that diesel
engine in the rear why tracks tracks of

00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:59.260
course the Russians know about Russian
winters and of course it's not that many

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:04.540
metaled road surface roads in Russia so
the idea of the wide tractors spread the

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.179
weight and that engine gives this
vehicle a power that can speed it up to

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:15.309
about 33 miles an hour so that's a good
turn of speed for about what turns out

00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:21.189
to be a 28 short ton tank so it's a
still a fairly weighty tank there now

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:27.760
the German invasion in the summer of
1941 causes something that again almost

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:33.070
adds this magic to the t-34 story
they've got to move some of the

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.290
factories that are now making the t-34
out the way of the advancing German

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:43.360
military and they take them back behind
the Ural Mountains and that means not

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.590
only taking the machinery taking bits of
equipment that means taking the

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.460
engineers or people that are
manufacturing men and women are

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.529
should be drawn back to reestablish
their factories and keep this production

00:17:56.529 --> 00:18:02.260
going and in that process one of the
things the Russians find is they say

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:07.840
look we're not going to do anything to
that vehicle unless even though they

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.270
know it's got weaknesses unless it
speeds production or it lessens cost

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.909
because we need those vehicles now the
Russians in 1941 can you believe this is

00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:24.909
a figure they lose twenty thousand tanks
in that German advance they have a lot

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:29.830
of tanks that they need to build and
they need to build quickly so with that

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:35.110
movement of the factories start this
process of things on the t-34 that were

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.700
considered superfluous start getting
removed and you get to the point that

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.110
there's a certain point where some
factories are sending out these t-34

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.929
tanks without even a driver's seat in if
you want to see you fold up your

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:52.510
greatcoat and sit on it and so some of
those vehicles are different from

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.720
different factories because of what's
available to man at that time but

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.649
they're also the Russians are realizing
there's a lot of things that can go into

00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:03.520
a tank that if it's just
is it really necessarily number one or

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.980
can we simplify it and the great story
of the t-34 is during its production it

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.230
ends up doubling the thickness of its
armor it doubles its penetration ability

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:21.130
of its firepower and it has the cost of
making one of these tanks so they start

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.399
with for about two hundred ninety
thousand rubles they get it down to

00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:28.330
about one hundred and sixty thousand
roubles and they get to the point that

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:35.350
they're producing 1200 of these t-34s in
about 1942 a month I mean that's a

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:40.240
staggering figure to be able to coming
out with and that's that key in the

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.950
background what we've got to remember
with the t-34 is the numbers that can be

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:51.700
produced it has excellent elements to it
as a tank it has a bismal crew

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:57.370
ergonomics the poor driver in here is
visibility the amount of muscle power he

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:03.279
needs to change gear all these things
are not good about that vehicle but when

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:08.049
you can produce them in
many numbers that is bound to have an

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:12.940
effect on the battlefield now its
superiority in firepower and armor

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:19.510
protection starts waning fairly quick
quickly in 1942 the original German 37

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.559
millimeter anti-tank gun not that
effective on a t-34 there's this account

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:29.350
of one of the gun crews they fire about
25 rounds the only effective round from

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:34.929
that 37 millimeter manages to jam the
turret but then the Germans are starting

00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:39.370
to get 5 centimeter towed anti-tank guns
and then seven point five centimeters

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:45.610
coming into service and of course from
1942 the Panzer 4 is then having that

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:50.980
long barreled high-velocity 75
millimeter gun fitted so all of a sudden

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:57.130
these t-34s are not as an impressive bit
of kit on the battlefield and again in

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.230
terms of losses many of these vehicles
we always think here tank museum tank on

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.669
tank warfare actually its anti-tank guns
are doing a huge amount of the damage

00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:13.450
now for the t-34 so success though it is
it is also the tank that gets knocked

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:20.950
out the most in World War 2 44,000 t-34
losses in the combat now some of those

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.720
tanks are taken back to the factories
rebuilt reissued and that's another one

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.070
of the issues because as I've mentioned
already all the different factories are

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.940
building two slightly different build
standards slightly different design

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.770
parts and of course when we're adding up
numbers there's the other issue which is

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.820
these factories are also they're doing
new build but also taking in damaged

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.630
vehicles and they're added to the mix
and then they go out again so you'll see

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:53.620
it's almost hard to find two 234 tanks
with exactly the same design build

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.520
because there's so many little
alterations and changes and improvements

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.059
simple things as well like in that
trying to make it simpler get rid of the

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:07.059
rubber on the tires things like the F 34
gun starts off with over 800 component

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:11.860
parts they cut that down to 600
component parts so again that idea of

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:18.580
simplifying the process now by the
summer of 1943 it is ready

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.260
apparent to the Red Army that not only
with the Panzer 4 with the long barrel

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.789
gun but then certainly at the Battle of
curse starting to meet the Panther that

00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:33.700
the t-34 is suffering so they start a
program for a replacement vehicle and

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.620
that's what we'll have a look at next
the realization that they're going to

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.240
have to build a new tank leads the
Russians to come up with a design that's

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.710
called the t43
now the problem with the t-thought 43

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:55.059
they've got some good ideas let's keep
about 70% of its construction from parts

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:59.649
that are already being built from the
t-34 the problem though is that when it

00:22:59.649 --> 00:23:06.070
comes out it ends up being less mobile
than the t-34 and even though it's got a

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:12.820
new turret with a new 85 millimeter gun
on it it's not considered a success and

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.080
therefore they go back to the drawing
board and have another look at the t-34

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.090
and what that develops into is they
realize actually we can enlarge the

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:29.470
turret ring on the t-34 from originally
it's 56 inches they take it up to 63

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:35.950
inches and they take this new three-man
turret that's been designed for the t43

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:45.789
adapt it and put it on an enlarged t-34
hull and that becomes the t-34 / 85 the

00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:51.309
85 millimeter gun equipped tank now that
process leads to the tanks going into

00:23:51.309 --> 00:23:56.740
service in about February of 1944 and
when we look at the t-34 85 we're

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.929
actually looking at a very different
beast yes it's a t-34 evolved but at the

00:24:01.929 --> 00:24:06.580
same time it's adding things for the
crew that makes this a much better tank

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.320
to be able to fight from for example the
commander now in the top has his own

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.299
Coppola and so he can look out all
around rather than that one original

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:22.809
periscope he was given the turret now
has a turret basket the original t-34

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:28.870
had no basket at all ammunition stored
on the floor under rubber mats you open

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.530
the box took out the ammunition pass it
up

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.640
now with this vehicle yes ammunition
still stored on the floor but it's now

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.340
got a turret basket which means the crew
can turn together within the vehicle as

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:48.270
well other changes that go on we've now
got a three-man turret so three men the

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:53.160
commander now doesn't just have to
command and man the gun he can just be

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.480
his what his real role is looking out
for targets commanding the whole vehicle

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.090
that's important we get a increase in
the ratio of radios not every tank gets

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.200
one but most of them now start getting
radios and that is fitted in the turret

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:13.440
in the t-34 85 the original fit in the
earlier t-34 turret was on the floor of

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.920
the vehicle so again access issues for
communications

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.830
now this enlarged turret three-man crew
that loader is now being added there as

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.480
well as the gunner so again
crew ergonomics better from the point of

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.270
view of the workability of the vehicle
much of the hull remains the same apart

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.410
from the addition of further thicker
armor so we're now up to about 90

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:42.780
millimeters of armor plate there because
the guns bigger the amount of ammunition

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.620
goes down early t-34s you get around 90
rounds of the 76 millimeter rare

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.670
ammunition in there now with this bigger
gun you're down to about 50 up to 55

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.660
rounds and there's normally about nine
ready rounds stored inside the turret

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.820
ready to be used the rest of them again
on those floor boxes down further below

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:08.250
now these vehicles go into production
they are also starting views tactically

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.720
if we go back to that earlier can't talk
about when we were looking at how the

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.190
Russians thought they were going to use
their military this early phase of the

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.790
war has been that war almost of
attrition they're using their space

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.330
they're using they're massing themselves
the second phase of the war and this

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.110
almost heralds it when it's coming in
from the beginning of 40 forwards

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:32.850
onwards you're now looking at that other
Soviet theory that they wanted to fight

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:38.190
with which is that war of annihilation
using their operational art that kind of

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:42.390
that that deep battle theory that
they've been looking at in the 1930s to

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.490
great effect with operations like
banquet Ron

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:51.520
and the advanced on Berlin stunningly
successful use of heavy artillery tanks

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.920
tank riders so on these vehicles you'll
notice on the side of them metal bars

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.030
are added so that again you've almost in
ended up with motorized infantry that

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:05.320
could be taken into action in the back
of these vehicles and the use of air

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.780
power of course those things coming to
back back together mean that the effect

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:17.170
that the Soviet Red Army has in 1944-45
is is gone leaps and bounds forward from

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.800
just trying to do their earlier war
tactics of delaying and trying to hold

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.140
up that massive German advance and as I
say vehicles like this are really key to

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.490
that
now the t-34 it's produced in massive

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.990
numbers as I mentioned earlier about
80,000 we think all told and its

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:40.510
continued introduction after the war
ends by the end of the war about 55

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:47.680
percent of the Soviet tank forces made
up of variants of the t-34 vehicle it

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.430
stopped production it actually goes back
into production in both Poland and

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.780
Czechoslovakia in the early 1950s and of
course there's so many of these vehicles

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:01.150
a bit like the American Sherman which is
got a lot of comparisons with it ends up

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.460
being either sold on gifted to Soviet
satellite countries used all around the

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:11.650
world the list of countries where the
t-34 is fought is enormous and those

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.360
battles it's involved on there's another
whole story the use of the t-34 after

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:22.240
world war ii still in service with some
armies right into the 21st century now

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.990
the issue about the t-34 overall as well
one of the other things when we look at

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:30.820
this tank is what we're looking at now
is less about whatever I say about facts

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:36.940
figures misinformation that's come out
over many decades because again from the

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:42.130
Soviet area some of this information was
big tup in a way about its success other

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.340
information didn't come out the archives
till much later on and it's still

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.380
appearing so trying to form a view of
this particular tank is very hard to

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.870
come up with an accurate one no doubt
I've been saying a number of mistakes

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:57.040
and what I've been talking to you about
in this talk but the issue really is

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.559
what this tanks
malaises this is the tank for the

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:07.019
Russian that symbolizes their victory in
world war two it is not the tank that

00:29:07.019 --> 00:29:11.370
wins world war two for the Russians it's
actually the spirit and the stoicism of

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.289
the Russian people that does that but
because just like in Britain the

00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:21.330
Spitfire becomes that iconic item this
is for the Russians one of those items

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.159
that is now moved beyond just the facts
and figures it becomes a symbol and an

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:33.480
icon of that victory and you can see
that recently because about 40 t-34 85

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.749
tanks have been gifted by the government
allows they've transported them back on

00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:44.820
railway flats going all the way through
Russia people have been turning up at

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:50.369
stations to almost pay homage to these
vehicles as they go past and those

00:29:50.369 --> 00:29:54.119
vehicles are going to be used again in
parades in celebration commemorations

00:29:54.119 --> 00:30:00.950
into the future that's what this item
actually means to the Russian people if
