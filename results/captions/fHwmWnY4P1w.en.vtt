00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.962
&gt;&gt; Tucker: UFOs HAVE

00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:16.131
CAPTIVATED THE PUBLIC INTEREST

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:18.366
FOR DECADES, BUT ALWAYS

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.933
DISMISSED INCLUDING BY ME AS THE

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.070
PROVENANCE OF WACKOS.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:23.772
BUT THAT IS CHANGING THINGS TO

00:00:22.203 --> 00:00:24.939
SOME REMARKABLE VIDEOTAPE AND

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.941
FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS FROM VERY

00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:27.509
SOBER PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED TO

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:29.577
IDENTIFY AIRCRAFT.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.945
THAT WOULD INCLUDE THIS VIDEO.

00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:31.913
IT SHOWS TWO NAVY PILOTS

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.682
ENCOUNTERING SOMETHING BIZARRE

00:00:32.047 --> 00:00:34.115
OFF OF THE EAST COAST OF THE

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:36.584
UNITED STATES.

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.320
WATCH THIS.

00:00:36.718 --> 00:00:41.723
&gt;&gt; I APOLOGIZE.

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:44.426
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:47.896
&gt;&gt; ROGER, THEY ARE SHOOTING TO.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.266
&gt;&gt; [BLEEP] IS THIS THING?

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:54.502
&gt;&gt; I TOOK IT ON RETURN.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.770
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH, MAN.

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:56.871
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT?

00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:59.007
&gt;&gt; Tucker: THESE ARE GUYS THAT

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:01.109
FLY FOR A LIVING THAT KNOW WHAT

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.010
OTHER AIRPLANES LOOK LIKE

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:02.544
INCLUDING THOSE MAINTAINED BY

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:05.080
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:06.147
THIS IS ONE AMONG MANY INCIDENTS

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:07.816
LIKE IT INCLUDING MANY THAT HAVE

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:09.517
HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:10.552
DAY TO SOBER PEOPLE.

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.887
LOTS OF INDEPENDENT WITNESSES AT

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:14.356
THE SAME EVENT.

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.224
COMMERCIAL PILOTS, MILITARY

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.158
PILOTS IN THE AFTERNOON.

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:17.592
NONE OF THEM HAVE OBVIOUS

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:18.360
EXPLANATIONS.

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:20.929
THESE ARE AIRCRAFT'S APPARENTLY

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:22.731
THAT ARE MOVING IN WAYS THAT

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:25.233
APPEAR TO VIOLATE PHYSICS AND

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:26.534
FROM ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT EVER

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.269
OBSERVED AND WAY FASTER THAN ANY

00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:29.137
PLANE THAT WE KNOW ANY FOREIGN

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:30.338
COUNTRY HAS.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.407
WHAT IS THIS?

00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:33.274
WE DO NOT KNOW, BECAUSE FOR SOME

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.578
REASON THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:41.282
NOT INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT.

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:42.917
LOU ELIZONDO, A FORMER ASSISTANT

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:44.152
OF RESEARCHING UFOs, THE DOD

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:45.286
IS NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.155
TO JOINS US TONIGHT.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.022
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:51.926
DID I OVERSTATE THAT?

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:53.228
IS THERE A CORPORATE OF

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.430
EVIDENCE, NOT DRUNK PEOPLE ON A

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.831
ROAD AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING, BUT

00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:58.333
SOBER MILITARY PILOT SAYING THAT

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.800
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.336
CANNOT EXPLAIN?

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:02.771
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT, INDIVIDUALS

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.305
THAT HAVE HIGH SECURITY

00:02:02.904 --> 00:02:06.674
CLEARANCES, TRAINED OBSERVERS,

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.576
WE HAVE PAID THEM AND PUT THEM

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:09.711
THROUGH SCHOOLS TO BE TRAINED.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.044
SCRUTINIZING WHAT THEY ARE

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.813
SEEING.

00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:14.349
THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WE

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:15.950
TRUST TO FLY WEAPONS PLATFORM,

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:17.752
SOMETIMES WITH LIVE AMMUNITION

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:20.922
OVER U.S. CITIES AND TO FIGHTS

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:22.757
AND WIN WARS ON OUR BEHALF.

00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:23.425
THEY ARE REPORTING THAT THEY ARE

00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:23.892
SEEING SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:02:23.558 --> 00:02:25.727
CANNOT EXPLAIN.

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:27.896
ALSO BACKED UP BY THE VIDEO

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.730
EVIDENCE AND THE RADAR DATA.

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.432
AND OTHER WITNESSES AS WELL.

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:33.134
&gt;&gt; Tucker: THESE ARE NOT

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:34.636
WEATHER BALLOONS, RIGHT?

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:36.204
&gt;&gt; WEATHER BALLOONS THAT ARE

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.140
EXPRESSING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

00:02:36.337 --> 00:02:40.108
FAR BEYOND OUR CURRENT

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:42.177
UNDERSTANDING OF AERODYNAMICS.

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:44.145
THINGS THAT ARE MANEUVERING IN

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.214
WAYS THAT NO AIRCRAFT THAT WE

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:48.116
ARE CURRENTLY AWARE OF HAS THAT

00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:48.917
CAPABILITY TWO.

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.918
FLIGHT PERFORMANCE

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.220
CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE WELL

00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:55.223
BEYOND THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT WE

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:56.124
WOULD CONSIDER NORMAL OR ROUTINE

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:57.926
FOR AIRCRAFT.

00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:59.727
&gt;&gt; Tucker: NO FLIGHT SERVICES,

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:02.330
NO WINGS OR ANYTHING APPROACHING

00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.730
A WING COULD ALSO NO OBVIOUS

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:04.566
PROPULSION.

00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:06.734
INFRARED DOES NOT PICK UP ANY

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.569
JET TRAIL OR ROCKET EXHAUST

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:08.336
COMING OUT OF THESE THINGS?

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:10.171
&gt;&gt; OR PLUME.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.572
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO HAVE

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:13.341
PROPULSION.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:14.576
YOU CAN DO IT WITH A GIANT

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:15.009
ENGINE PROPELLER OR ROCKET

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.811
ENGINE.

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:18.746
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU HAVE

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:20.615
OBJECTS THAT ARE DOING THINGS,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.050
MANEUVERING IN WAYS WITHOUT ANY

00:03:20.748 --> 00:03:24.752
OBVIOUS SIGN OF PROPULSION.

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:26.154
AND DEFYING THE NATURAL EFFECTS

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.288
OF EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL --

00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:30.758
&gt;&gt; Tucker: AT WHAT SPEED?

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:33.127
&gt;&gt; SOME ARE VERY, VERY FAST.

00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:33.528
&gt;&gt; Tucker: FASTER THAN OUR

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:35.730
AIRCRAFT?

00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:37.098
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, HYPERSONIC SPEEDS

00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:38.266
AND WITHOUT SIGNS OR SIGNATURES

00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:39.934
INVOLVED, WHEN IT IS MOVING

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.870
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE, YOU

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:43.104
WOULD EXPECTED TO HAVE CERTAIN

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.772
SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:47.308
PARTICULAR AIRCRAFT WHETHER A

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:48.977
DISMISSAL, ROCKET, YOU MIGHT SEE

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:50.712
A HEAT SIGNATURE COMING FROM IT.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.081
OR IONIZATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:54.916
YOU MIGHT HEAR A SONIC BOOM.

00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:55.517
WHICH YOU NORMALLY WOULD, AND

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.352
ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.586
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THEY DO

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:00.021
NOT HAVE ANY OF THOSE.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.389
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WE KNOW THAT THEY

00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:04.025
ARE NOT U.S. MILITARY, BECAUSE

00:04:01.523 --> 00:04:05.326
THEY WOULD NOT BE FLYING NEAR

00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:06.561
U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT AS THEY

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.730
SO OFTEN HAVE.

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:09.697
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE WOULD KNOW

00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:10.098
IF FOREIGN COUNTRIES HAVE THIS

00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:11.399
KNOWLEDGE.

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:12.400
I'VE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS PAID TO

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:14.569
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS IS

00:04:12.534 --> 00:04:16.304
A POTENTIAL THREAT, A GREAT ONE
