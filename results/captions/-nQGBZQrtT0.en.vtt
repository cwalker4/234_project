00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.207 align:start size:94% position:6%
IN 1998, GET THIS, HE HAD AN
AFFAIR.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.508 align:start size:94% position:6%
IT'S TRUE.
MY INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start size:94% position:6%
INTO IT RIGHT NOW.
IT WAS A WOMAN, IT WAS A WOMAN

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:09.048 align:start size:94% position:6%
NAMED MONICA.
VERY HEAVY.

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:12.818
I DON'T HAVE HER LAST NAME YET
BUT WHEN I GET IT, I'M GOING TO

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:17.957
SET MY ALARM FOR 3:20 A.M. AND
GO SIT ON MY GOLDEN TOILET BOWL

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:18.991 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND TWEET ABOUT IT UNTIL
COMPLETION.

[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; OH MY GOD.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.732
JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY AT
HOME, THIS WAS A PRESIDENTIAL

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:31.504 align:start size:94% position:6%
DEBATE.
ANY FINAL WORDS?

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:33.306 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!
