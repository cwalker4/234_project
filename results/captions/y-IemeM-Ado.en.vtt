00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.408
I'm in singapore, and I'm about to go on stage in just a few minutes

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
I have [not] given a presentation for over a year [now]

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.099
I was in a little fender-bender a while back and so I took a little bit of time off

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.160
 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.520
There's this sense of urgency now. The global dollar standard was put in place by a series of

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.819
accidental events that were very fortunate for the United States because it gave us an advantage over the rest of the world

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.479
But our politicians over the past decade or so have abused this privilege as though

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.270
it was their birthright, and now the rest of the world are turning their backs on the US dollar standard

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.699
This is going to cause a financial calamity the likes of which we've [never] seen before and it's going to be

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.070
devastating for most people. I don't *want* this to happen, but the damage has already been done

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.829
So I'm going around trying to alert people and show them how they can protect themselves and

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.520
turn this into a great opportunity for themselves

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.280
There's always one result from what we are doing right now, expanding the currency supplies all over the planet;

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.189
there's one result and that is higher gold and silver prices

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.349
I love America – at least the America that the Founding Fathers created

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.699
and I'm hoping people get interested in this so that they'll see that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.500
what made America great is the answer to our problems: to get back to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.849
free markets, free people, and sound money. Our own history proves that this is the road to maximum prosperity

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.790
We are entering a period of financial crisis that is the greatest the world has ever known

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.090
The wealth transfer that will take place during this decade is the greatest wealth transfer in history

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.380
Wealth is never destroyed; it is merely transferred, and that means that on the opposite side of every crisis

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.100
there is an opportunity. The great news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into your great

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.279
opportunity is to educate yourself. I

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.850
believe that the best investment that you can make in your lifetime is your own education:

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.869
education on the history of money, education on finance, education on how the global economy works;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.580
education on how all of *these* guys – the central bankers, the stock market – how they can cheat you, how they can scam you. If

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.360
you learn what is going on and how the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.179
financial world works, you can put yourself on the correct side of this wealth transfer

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.350
Winston Churchill once said that the further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future. This

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.989
program is all about creating your own crystal ball: being able to gaze into the future,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.880
being able to change this crisis – the greatest crisis in the history of mankind –

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.730
into your great opportunity

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.480
I

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.180
was born in Salem, Oregon in 1956 and we moved to California when I was four years old in 1960. But

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.310
when I went to school, it was obvious after just the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.400
fourth grade, that there was something different with me; and by fifth grade, I was in remedial classes. And

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.219
it turned out that I was dyslexic and teachers were not taught to recognize that back then. I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.279
was always falling behind everyone else.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.789
When I would get a teacher that would

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.500
lecture instead of making us read out of books, I would just absolutely excel;

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.559
I suddenly went from the dumbest kid in class to the smartest kid in all of the periods of that class

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.050
But the result was that,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.710
you know, after a while, I was in every single remedial class, and I just couldn't take it and in tenth grade

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.040
I dropped out, middle of 10th grade; and I've never been back to school. I

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.929
often say that in every crisis, there's an opportunity; and in this case,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.239
the handicap of dyslexia has also been a blessing. Because I couldn't learn out of books and I couldn't take notes

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.519
I just had to remember everything. And

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.880
I have the ability to – my brain's wired a little bit differently; I have the ability to

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.920
look at a chart

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.749
today, and I know how it relates to a chart that I saw 10 years ago

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.670
But it was back in about the year 2000 when Steve Jobs of Apple

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.320
introduced OS X – the world of books opened up to me... built right into the operating system was a

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.220
text-to-speech program;

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.279
now I could just have an assistant

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.530
slice and scan my books and turn them into text and e-mail me and then all I have to do is highlight the text,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.289
press a button, and the computer reads to me. "People are turning to assets; it will keep their value... if prices rise...

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.809
"So much money has been pumped into the system that people are worried about inflation down the road, said Bruno S. Frey, Professor of Economics

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.600
at the University of Zurich..." The dyslexia is no longer a problem

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.200
But what it's also done for me, is I have the ability to explain complex things to people in a simple manner

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.140
for some reason, and so I sort of made it my mission

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.950
to try and wake up the middle class, to let them know how the monetary system works; to let them know that

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.320
there is a major economic calamity coming sometime down the road

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.640
And it's most likely within this decade that we're in right now

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.410
The US dollar is

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.730
about 60% of the value of all the currency on the planet and

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.899
more than half of the dollars reside outside the United States

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.380
The reason they –

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.839
every country has US dollars is, first of all, that's what central banks use as the reserve currency

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.659
Second of all, oil is priced in dollars

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.830
So this is the world and what we –
 what you see here

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.749
is that these are the countries that are avoiding the US dollar in trade;

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.459
they're doing bilateral agreements where they'll either hold each other's currency and

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:29.130
settle that way, or they're establishing – like right now, they're talking about a BRICS bank: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.330
having a bank that will do settlements between the countries directly without using the US dollar

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.529
These countries, they tried to avoid using the US dollar like Iran tried

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.290
and we banned them from using SWIFT

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.419
How many here have made wire transfers before? So do you know what a SWIFT number is?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.020
It's a code that you plug in and this SWIFT system is what transfers those dollars

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.230
from one person's account to another person's account. Well Iran

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.780
decided that they were going to sell oil

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.680
only in Euros; they got banned from SWIFT

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:19.169
But there's countries right now coming up with a replacement for SWIFT, and it doesn't use the dollars, the SUCRE system; and

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.229
Iraq started selling oil for Euros

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.010
In

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.539
Libya, they were talking about creating the gold dinar and

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.520
selling oil for gold. So, those are the countries that are trying to use

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.669
something other than the dollar. Then we've got gold competing with currency

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:46.529
and there's a lot of talk around here about the gold dinar, and there's people that are actually using gold in some of the

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:53.219
countries over here. And then in Utah, Utah has recognized gold and silver as money again

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:00.390
It's legal tender currency in the state of Utah in the United States. And then you've got physical gold accumulation

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:07.470
I'll show you later that China is accumulating an immense amount of gold; that all the countries with an up arrow, that's gold accumulation

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.950
Then we have gold repatriation

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.879
Germany has been asking for their gold back, and they're getting it

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.680
Venezuela has repatriated their gold from the Bank of England. And

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.800
then, if we put this on a timeline

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.219
Here's the nails in the coffin for the dollar standard and you will see that there's not a lot of time left

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:35.670
This is my evidence that I think is proof that the death of the dollar is coming, and it's coming shortly

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.950
Nixon ended Bretton Woods

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:45.270
and we went on the dollar standard. Then the first nail in the coffin is, Iraq sells oil in Euros; the crisis of

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.530
2008 and we added

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:54.749
1.25 trillion to our base money in the United States. As we add to the base currency, people get worried about inflation;

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.960
they start rushing toward gold and silver. Iran ends oil sales in dollars

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.510
and they're taking commodities in trade for oil, they're taking – in

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.220
Turkey, they take the local currency and then buy gold in Turkey and export the gold to Iran,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.540
so they're basically selling oil for gold. They do the same thing with India

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.900
QE2 – quantitative easing, that's more currency printing in the United States

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.340
Libya

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.329
China and Russia bypassed the dollar, they did a bilateral trade agreement where they hold each other's currency

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.609
and they do direct debt settlement without having to wire transfer US dollars

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:45.260
Chinese president just recently, said that the dollar as the world's reserve currency is a product of the past

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.018
Utah recognized silver and gold as money

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:55.819
China and Iran bypass the US dollar with a bilateral trade agreement. Venezuela repatriates its gold. China and Japan

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.899
trade directly

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:02.479
India and Japan bypass the US dollar. Russia and Iran trade directly

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.510
Iran sells India oil for Rupees and commodities. China and Brazil trade directly

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.060
Swiss citizens demand gold repatriation

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.269
African countries ban the dollar; in Zambia, you can go to JAIL if you use US dollars

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.600
Quantitative easing

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.820
number three: they have announced at the Federal Reserve that they're going to be – they're starting with 40 billion dollars of

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.859
currency that they're creating each month and now it jumps to 85 billion dollars

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.140
That's more than one trillion a year;

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:42.589
and remember, it took 200 years to go from no dollars to 825 billion. And now they're going to create a

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.640
trillion every year

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.059
Iran trading energy for gold

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.910
Singapore removes tax on money

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:52.019
Germany repatriates 150

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:56.659
tons of gold from the New York Fed. The citizens of Netherland demand gold repatriation

00:10:57.209 --> 00:10:59.130
Ecuador

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.130
repatriates part of its gold reserves

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.470
Austrian citizens demanding gold

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:08.389
repatriation. China acknowledges fundamental market shortage of gold. And

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.190
now

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.529
the Fed is increasing the rate of printing when I said from 40 to 85

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.070
billion every month; just over a trillion per year

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:25.370
So those are the nails in the coffin for the dollar standard; and if you noticed, they are all speeding up

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.480
and they're all happening right now

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.920
You don't have a whole lot of time; and if you wait too long, then the opportunity is gone

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:36.449
It's going to fail

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:40.819
Why is the dollar sacrosanct? Why is it *not* going to happen to the US dollar? What will?

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:43.969
People think, oh no, it's high technology;

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.199
we have computers now, or the internet – these are ridiculous arguments

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:54.570
The truth is, all fiat currencies have failed and there's no reason why this one won't. What worries me again so much

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.910
is that it's a global situation. And so it's going to cause problems on a global basis

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.369
And it's a trust breaking down. And you're already seeing the trust breaking down, as I said earlier – because you're seeing different

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.950
countries exchange directly with each other's currency, circumventing the dollar; you're seeing that in oil;

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.849
you're going to see it more and more and people are just going to opt out of the dollar. And

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.510
you'll probably get to a point before the whole thing collapses entirely

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.359
where the dollar is more or less used internally, United States, and externally it's not used as much

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.910
because there'll be a lot of

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.789
agreements made between nation states outside of the United States that will want to use each other's currency and not the dollar

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.639
This isn't going to be pretty when it happens

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:41.789
I am not an end-of-worlder or a doomsday guy. All you can do is play the hand that you are dealt

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.080
If we go to a new monetary system, and I think it's absolutely inevitable:

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.450
there's just too much energy built up in this one that has to

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.750
release; it has to come crashing down somehow

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.700
When that happens, there's an enormous wealth transfer

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.450
for people that are on one side of the bet or another. And

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.570
people don't realize that

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.160
whether they are – they think they are making a bet or not, they are making the bet

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:18.900
They are involved; this wealth transfer affects everybody, whether you want to participate or not. If you are holding paper assets

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.620
and

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:27.690
paper currencies, you have bet one direction; if you're holding gold and physical assets

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.789
you've bet the opposite direction

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:38.219
So, these are changes in Chinese holdings. They are accumulating gold, they are getting rid of US Treasury bonds

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.930
This is gold held in China. The green line is the cumulative

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.880
gold, that's on this side, this scale, so it's gone from about

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.500
700 tons

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:57.419
to almost 6,000 tons just since the year 2000. So this is their central bank holdings

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.880
This is their mine supply

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.219
But this is – and my researcher put all of this data together. You're the first people to see this –

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.220
this is the amount of

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.169
gold flowing through the Hong Kong exchange that goes into China and

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:19.299
the past couple of years here, they have ramped up their buying. They know

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:26.469
that the dollar standard is coming to an end and they are protecting themselves, and you're probably going to see

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.589
gold-backed Renminbi someday – the Yuan

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.399
So

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:33.399
this is an interesting chart:

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.620
Change in Global Influence

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:41.979
So this is the correlation to this basket of currencies. This basket of currencies, if you add them all up,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.909
they're trading up or they're trading down and this was

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.569
pre-Crisis, so it's before 2008, so – this is from the International Monetary Fund, it's their data –

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.720
so from 2005 to

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:58.449
2008, this is the correlation of,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:05.289
you know, if that basket of currencies was trading up, the dollar was probably doing about the same thing, is what it's saying

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:11.200
That Chinese Renminbi, a little less so. And then, this is today

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.209
The US dollar is done for!

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:26.509
I don't think there's any question we're heading for a new monetary system. The question is, what would it consist of

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.639
You know, the four choices are sort of a

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:32.149
world of multiple reserve currencies, and Barry Eichengreen

00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:35.929
of Berkeley is the leading proponent of this, or leading

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:42.169
scholar on this topic. The problem with that and where I disagree with Eichengreen is there's no anchor in that system

00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:45.619
We did have multiple reserve currencies before, in the 1920s

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.519
He's right about that

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:52.519
And it was sterling in the dollar, but they were both anchored to gold. And in the post-Bretton Woods world since

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:55.429
1944, it's been one reserve currency

00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:01.969
which is the anchor, and it was anchored to gold until 1971. Since then, the dollar has been detached from gold

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.980
but all the other currencies are still linked to the dollar

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.550
So at the end of the day we've had an anchor of some kind, we've never had a world

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.589
of multiple reserve currencies with no anchor. I'm not sure that's that stable. The SDR

00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:16.578
is the second choice. The SDR is a basket currency sponsored by the IMF

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.169
At least for the time being it's also printed money; the IMF literally prints the SDRs

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.510
ships them out to the members. And their reserves go up, exactly the way the Fed creates money and

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.959
bank reserves go up

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:32.749
But it's not backed by anything. Third choice is gold, some variation on the gold standard

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.959
And the fourth choice is what I call chaos, which is that nobody does anything; there's a lot of wishful thinking;

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:39.690
there's a lot of denial;

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.690
there's a lot of delay, and we get to the point where people just totally lose faith in paper currencies,

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.969
go to hard assets, and we have a sequential

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:54.799
collapse of paper currencies around the world – at which point, governments will have to react with emergency measures. That could include coercion, confiscation,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.029
you know, various sorts of freezes on paper assets... could be a lot of things in that scenario, so to me

00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:04.818
it's multiple reserve currencies, SDRs, gold, or chaos

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.849
I favor gold, but I fear that we may get chaos

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.579
I've talked about every 30 to 40 years the world has a new monetary system. And

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:24.890
the thing is that over the years, governments and these central – and the banks, have basically screwed us more and more and more

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:33.198
And these new currency systems are always created by the same idiots that created the last one that fell apart

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.649
It's the big banks, it's the central banks, and it's

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.629
governments that are creating these new systems each time; and each time

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.300
the system they come up with

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:51.980
is a system that cheats the population more and enriches the government and the banks more. It's a system that transfers wealth

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.639
at greater and greater speeds. You know, this one is going to fall apart just like all of the others

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:07.189
There's a difference this time, though: there's the internet. People are connected all over the world; information is spreading and people are getting educated

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.959
So I'm hoping that we go back to gold. Not a gold standard; gold standards suck

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.570
Did a video on that

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.450
With a gold standard

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:26.029
there's supposed to be a certain amount of gold in the vaults for each unit of currency. In other words

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.600
It's a one-to-one ratio,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.899
is the way that it started. And then, they print more receipts than gold that exists

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.860
So if we have gold standards, we're going to get scammed again

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.509
If we used gold and silver, if the public gets educated enough before all of this happens

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.399
If we went back to gold and silver, then governments can't scam us; it limits

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:55.759
their ability to transfer wealth from the population to the government and to the banks

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:02.600
A lot of people say that you can't use gold and silver today because they're too heavy and bulky and it's completely wrong

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:08.629
You could put gold and silver in a vault and you could make payments to somebody by transferring ownership of

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.689
nanograms, grams, or ounces of gold and silver from one person's account to another

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.650
by means of a check, a credit card, or even your cell phone

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.819
If we go back to a

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.900
gold-backed currency,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.900
gold-backed US dollar,

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.220
at that point,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.799
I think the minimum scam that the US could get away with, which means

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.220
the minimum number of dollars in existence that they could make

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.509
convertible into gold, would be the dollars that are held in foreign central banks

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:46.330
That would be similar to the Bretton Woods system that we had from 1944 to '71. Well,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:52.809
I did some analysis on this when I was writing the book back in 2005, and back then it required $20,000 an ounce gold

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.200
for the Treasury to have enough gold to cover those dollars – or the New York Fed, actually – and

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:05.410
if they were going to back all of the dollars, you're talking gold measured in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per ounce

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:12.010
There just isn't that much gold and there's a whole lot of currency. We keep on printing it every minute of every day

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.819
This is gold and how it accounts for currency supply

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.620
This is our base money in the United States, which was

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:40.359
gold back here from 1900 until the Federal Reserve; the amount of currency in circulation and gold were the same

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.469
Then we established the Federal Reserve and we inflated for World War I; and we had more currency in circulation

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:52.690
than we had gold to back it. There were some bank runs in the '30s; then

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.380
Roosevelt unpegged the dollar from gold and

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.340
gold's value rose from $20 an ounce to

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.589
$35 an ounce. And when it did, the value of the gold held at the US Treasury

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:10.359
rose to meet the value of all the currency that was printed in the meantime

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.499
Here's the same chart again, but now I'm taking it out to

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:22.030
1971. And what you see is these gold inflows during World War I, during World War II, it's another

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.960
117 percent

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.470
gold increase. This is what made the United States a superpower: it's all financial

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.290
It isn't our war machine

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:38.979
necessarily; it's all the gold inflows that we got because everybody else was at war and we were

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.630
isolated from it. And they had to pay us for all their consumer goods and so on. And

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:48.219
then we jumped into the war and we inflated, and then in about

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.090
1959,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.650
countries started figuring out that we didn't have all the gold

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.109
You know, we were printing more dollars than gold that we had to back it; and under the Bretton Woods system

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:06.489
they could go to the New York Fed and turn in their dollars for gold at $35 per ounce. Only foreign central banks –

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.170
individuals couldn't do that

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.319
So gold started flowing out and the US

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.290
lost 50% of its gold from '59 to '71, and in the meantime, we kept on printing currency

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.839
If this had continued until it got down to zero, if there was one more dollar

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:29.109
out there that laid claim to gold, that came in and said, "we want our gold for currency"

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.520
and there was no gold to back it up, the entire world monetary system would have come crashing down

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:41.269
So Nixon had to take us off of the Bretton Woods system, the last vestiges of the gold standard, in August 15th of '71

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.820
So here's the same chart again:

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.250
there's the first chart and

00:22:46.649 --> 00:22:47.610
the

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.939
second chart to '71, and now I'm taking it out to '85, and I'm adding a second line here

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.919
How many people would agree that credit cards are replacing cash in circulation?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:05.419
Yeah, credit cards – you use your credit card more and more every year, right? You use cash less and less. Well

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:08.419
this is outstanding credit card balances. It's called

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.949
Revolving Credit Outstanding, is the name of the chart that you get from the Federal Reserve

00:23:14.129 --> 00:23:18.169
When you charge something on a credit card, you create currency

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.429
The bank didn't actually loan you anything; they invented numbers

00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:26.508
And then they have the gall to charge you interest if you don't pay those numbers back on time

00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:28.470
But

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:34.069
so, the thing is, that the merchant that you're paying, the restaurant or the grocery store, that

00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:41.689
merchant's checking account can't tell the difference between the credit dollars that *you* created or the cash dollars that you pay him

00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:49.429
So to that merchant's checking account, it all looks the same. And those dollars that you created stay in circulation until

00:23:50.009 --> 00:23:52.999
somebody saves them up and pays down credit card debt. So

00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:59.869
unpaid credit card balances, I include as part of the cash in circulation. And in

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:07.309
1971, Nixon took us off the gold standard and gold became a freely traded, separate, commodity-slash-money,

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:10.038
and it did an accounting of the currency supply

00:24:10.769 --> 00:24:16.878
There was quite a while here where we could have gone back on the gold standard. The value of the gold at the Treasury exceeded

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.589
all the dollars printed: from George Washington to Jimmy Carter. And

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.069
for a week or so, a couple of weeks, it

00:24:25.769 --> 00:24:33.349
exceeded base money *plus* outstanding revolving credit. So here's the same chart again. That was to

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:40.129
1985 and now I'm going to take it out to today. And so there's that

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:46.128
1980 peak where it shot past base money and base money + outstanding revolving credit

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.080
And then we get to the crisis of '08 and

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.940
Ben Bernanke – oh, by the way, instead of billions, we're now measuring in trillions

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.070
So we started in millions, and then it went to billions and now it's trillions

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:07.470
So, we did the bailouts and all the quantitative easings, and that's what the currency supply looks like today. And then, they announced

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.100
quantitative easing

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:16.590
3, which is that 85 billion a month that they're creating, and they think they're going to have to do it until about 2015

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:23.969
So, here's the projection: for gold covering the currency supply today, would be

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.629
$13,400 per ounce

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:33.300
gold, for history to repeat and for gold to do the same thing that it did in

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:40.410
1934 *and* in 1980. And believe me, it shocked people in 19- – in the

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.869
1970s. When gold was

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.740
$35 an ounce and

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.790
Nixon took us off the Bretton Woods system, all the economists were predicting that gold was going to go down, because now there was going

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.790
to be no more monetary demand for it

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.989
Anybody that said gold was going to go to a *hundred* bucks was considered an absolute lunatic –

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:03.540
and it went to 850; it rose 24 times its price. Well, when I wrote my book,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:11.519
we were right here with base money: so base money + outstanding revolving credit. It took about $6000 an ounce for history to repeat;

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.380
today it takes $13,400. And if you include the same

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.700
overshoot – remember in 1980, it didn't just cover base money

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.889
but it shot past it – $24,000 an ounce gold is what it would require

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:33.060
to meet that. Except we've – the Fed has announced that they're going to keep on printing

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:40.409
currency until there's lower unemployment, and the economy gets back on track. And they think till 2015. So

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:47.909
the projected price, according to the Fed and history repeating, if that was to – if the Fed does this, and

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.070
then history repeats and gold – the public gets afraid of

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.410
what the Federal Reserve is doing, and they rush toward gold and silver to protect their purchasing power,

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.000
gold would have to rise from there to way up here and that is

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.359
$26,000 per ounce gold to cover. If it does the same overshoot, we're talking about

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.729
$47,000 an ounce gold. Now, I don't even like to measure gold in

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.929
dollars. If you measure it in a price, price doesn't mean anything;

00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:23.009
it's the value. How much can you buy with the proceeds? If we have

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:29.250
deflation and some of this currency evaporates, because it's all just numbers that they type into a computer these days – if

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.969
we have deflation, maybe gold peaks at

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.770
$3,000 an ounce and the currency supply collapses to way down here somewhere,

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.280
and the Dow is at

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.030
1500. That means gold will still be double the Dow; you're still going to get

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.890
14 times more paper assets one day than you can buy today with them

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.050
And it's probably only a couple of years left

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:57.960
that this is going to take, as you saw about how the nails in the coffin of the dollar standard, how they're speeding up

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.030
If we have big INflation and the Dow goes to

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:09.569
30,000, maybe gold will be $60,000 an ounce; and if we have hyperinflation, the Dow would be

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.869
30 trillion and gold would be 60 trillion

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:19.290
It doesn't matter; in any case, gold would buy you 14 times more paper assets than it does today

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:26.279
So, these are the global assets: here's the sto-... the bond market, here's the stock market,

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.459
this is the value of real estate on the planet, and

00:28:30.429 --> 00:28:31.980
these are bank deposits

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.160
And there's gold

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.429
Now that little slice of the pie is going to get a lot bigger in just the next few years,

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.670
and it's not going to do it by a whole bunch more gold

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:46.050
just appearing. It's going to do it by the price of other assets going down or

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.969
at least their value going down and the value of gold going up

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:56.100
So the price of gold will change, that piece of the pie is going to grow; it was a lot bigger back in

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.740
1980, when gold was at $850

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:05.670
It's going to get a lot bigger today again; but today, as you've seen, it requires far far higher prices

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:13.230
So, the death of the dollar standard: how many people here believe that I'm sort of predicting what's going on in the

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.690
future here? You can see, that there's a new world monetary system coming

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:22.279
It happens every 30 to 40 years; except this time, instead

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:28.550
of a baby step off of gold, we've got to go from nothing back to something. It's going to be a worldwide

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.119
convulsion, the scale of which has never been seen before

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:40.099
At the end of the day, the fundamental, fundamental driver of gold, it's not so much that gold's in a bull market,

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.570
it's more the dollar's in a bear market. And people say, well, how high can gold go? And my answer is, well,

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.599
how low can the dollar go? The answer is the dollar can go to zero

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:53.629
If you divide any number by 0 the answer is infinity. So gold can go to infinity if the dollar goes to zero. Now, in

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:54.690
the real world,

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.639
something else will happen. It's not that gold becomes worth infinite number of dollars;

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:04.129
it's more the case that the dollar just falls off the stage. The dollar gets the hook, so to speak, and

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.740
you'll count gold in dollars to five thousand, to ten thousand at some point, but there will come a time

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.780
when you won't count gold in dollars anymore, because dollars won't count. People won't want dollars

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.810
There is so much opportunity in crisis, it is absolutely extraordinary. That's just not me saying that, that's just history

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:26.359
You read any amount of history – and I don't mean last week, I mean real history – you know, in times of crisis,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.630
it's when huge fortunes were made. Times of crisis is when human beings create and develop newest technologies and new...

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.369
science and new medicines. In times of crisis, there's so much opportunity – as long as you can remain calm, get educated,

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.209
be resourceful. The challenge for most people is that in crisis

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:48.920
they go into crisis mode. Which means they go into scarcity, they go into lack, they go into blame; and

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.719
none of those emotions are resourceful for helping you solve whatever challenge is in front of you

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.769
I believe that this is probably the greatest

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.610
opportunity of anyone's lifetime. There has never been a

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:13.060
situation where all the – everything came together, just like this. This is the first time in history

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:18.189
where all the world's currencies are just fiat currencies backed by nothing

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.709
And if what happens – what I think is going to happen happens,

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:31.300
this is the greatest wealth transfer in history. It's the greatest opportunity. And it'll never happen in our lifetimes again

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:40.180
So now we've learned the following hidden secrets of money. There is a global loss of confidence in the US dollar that is accelerating rapidly

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:46.270
The change to a new monetary system is inevitable and will most likely be chaotic

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.319
Gold standards do not work over long periods of time,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:58.000
but gold itself does. The public contributes to the massive amounts of currency creation by using credit cards and signing loans

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:05.590
Gold has already accounted for the expansion of US dollars twice in the last century and may likely do so again

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.970
So that's it for this episode. I thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed it

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:20.020
I know I threw around a bunch of astronomical prices for gold someday in the future, but it isn't the price measured in dollars

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.900
It's, how much is its value? What is it worth?

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:28.719
How much stuff can it purchase? The price measured in dollars, or any currency for that matter,

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.730
is just a bunch of numbers

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.000
And it really doesn't mean anything

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.119
There are numbers that are created by the world's central banks, by the commercial bank system,

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.489
and we're forced to transact in these currencies; but in our next episode,

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.959
we're going to clear away the smokescreen of national currencies and show you how the world monetary system really works, and

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.550
how all national currencies *have* to continue losing value

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:59.949
It is not possible for them to maintain purchasing power over any reasonable period of time

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:06.579
As for the golden nails in the dollar's coffin, it's only been a short while since we filmed the presentation in Singapore and

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:13.930
already there are more of them. So for an update, visit HiddenSecretsofMoney.com, and in your free information

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.050
toolkit,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:22.659
there's an exclusive presentation on the latest developments of the golden nails in the dollar's coffin. Now

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:27.190
I know this episode was kind of serious, and it might have you upset right now, but believe me,

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:33.580
it's not all doom and gloom. As I've said many, many times before, there are these brief moments in history

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:39.069
where the safest asset class, the safe haven investment for the last 5000 years,

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.959
also becomes the asset class that has the greatest potential gains in purchasing power. And I have bet my life on it

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:54.580
First I became an investor back in 2002, and then I started telling everybody about it. I started warning them

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.830
what was going to happen with the world economy and how to protect themselves, and I made it my mission to

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.060
educate as many as I could

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:09.580
So in 2005, I wrote my book. And then I gave people a means to protect themselves and opened up GoldSilver.com

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:15.370
I believe that my team and I have created the world's best precious metals dealership,

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:22.389
because we don't just sell gold and silver; we are gold and silver investors. And what we want to do is help you

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:30.519
understand how to get through what is coming, to protect yourself, and to turn all of these bad things around to your benefit

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:35.860
So if you decide that precious metals are for you, please visit GoldSilver.com

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:40.989
We'd love the opportunity to become your dealer, because we feel that we are more than a dealer;

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.039
we are a partner with you, and we're on the same side of the fence as you

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:51.609

00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:54.589
Thanks

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:59.509
Do you think this is a "man the lifeboats" situation? Let me ask you this:

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:03.199
if you knew the Titanic was going to sink

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.089
and you were *on* the Titanic, you know there's going to be a lifeboat situation coming up soon

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.479
Would you like – (...have life boats available) – that's right: would you like to get in the lifeboat early, get a nice seat?

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:18.740
Maybe close to the water. Maybe closer to the [food] supply

00:35:18.869 --> 00:35:23.629
Right there in the middle, nice and comfy... or you want to be one of the last ones on the boat and you're jockeying for position?

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.300
You have to throw a kid out to make room for you. Yeah, so uh...

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.910
you know, lifeboat situation, it depends

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:34.190
...how you like your accommodations on the lifeboat, is whether you should be

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:39.020
working your way towards it right now. And I will be edging my way towards it right now

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.370
