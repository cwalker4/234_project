00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.830
When You Eat Celery Every Day For A Week This
May Happen To Your Body

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.299
Celery, that crunchy and watery stick vegetable
we only seem to be able to eat with dips.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.210
It’s not everyone’s favorite vegetable,
but it certainly has its health benefits!

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.029
In fact, it might just be the most underrated
food at the supermarket.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.210
You’re probably under the false impression
that this vegetable is just water and some

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.739
fiber without any nutritional value.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.050
Well, we’re about to change that notion!

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.650
Celery actually has a multitude of amazing
health benefits that can not only help improve

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.040
your health, but also help improve your life!

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.269
This vegetable is actually loaded with significant
amounts of vitamins (A, B, C, K), calcium,

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.860
magnesium, and potassium.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.120
But if celery were to have an elevator pitch,
the hook would be its phytonutrients.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.290
These chemicals are used by plants to keep
insects and damaging sun rays away, but the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.550
effects on humans are far more impressive.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.740
Phytonutrients have anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant benefits.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.281
They can enhance the immune system and intracellular
communication, and they can repair DNA damage

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:21.400
that results from toxins.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.490
According to the US Department of Agriculture,
consuming phytonutrients on a regular basis

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.390
has had measurable results as an effective
strategy in combating cancer and heart disease.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.659
These long-term health benefits are impressive.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.240
But are there any short-term benefits that
come with eating celery?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.170
Some people have have actually experienced
a multitude of other health benefits by incorporating

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.890
celery into their daily diets for only a week!

if you eat celery every day for a week!

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.170
1.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.740
Weight loss.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.310
Celery is low in calories (one stack is only
10-15 calories) and its fiber content of 1.6

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.950
grams per cup can put a stop to unhealthy
cravings.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.640
Losing weight requires a caloric deficit.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.990
This means that you have to burn more calories
than you are eating every day in order to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.760
lose weight.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.970
Because celery is so low in calories, it’s
a great snack alternative to add into any

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.970
diet.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.890
Instead of munching out on crunchy, calorie
heavy chips, substitute them with celery!

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.870
This way, you can avoid going over your daily
calorie limit.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.520
Eating fewer calories will help you lose weight,
so add celery to your diet and reap the rewards!

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.170
2.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.959
Higher levels of hydration.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.810
Because celery is 95 percent water, it’s
a great way to prevent dehydration when you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.501
make it a frequent snack throughout the day.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:04.660
There are all sorts of health benefits associated
with being hydrated.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.140
This includes increased energy, improved complexion,
a healthier immune system, and more!

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.430
Stock up on that celery to keep yourself hydrated
(and drink your daily 8 cups of water a day,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.470
of course).

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.190
3.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.910
Anti-inflammatory.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.180
If you’re at risk for cardiovascular disease
and cancer, adding celery to your diet can

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.480
help you prevent chronic inflammation (which
is a condition that’s closely related to

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.500
those diseases).

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.960
4.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.989
It can stop heartburn and acid reflux.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.950
Celery has been recommended as a solution
for these conditions because of its low acidity.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.320
While more studies need to be done to confirm
the effects of celery on heartburn and acid

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.370
reflux, some people who tried it have reported
positive results in the past.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.370
5.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.910
It improves cholesterol and blood pressure
levels.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.769
A study by the University of Chicago found
that a chemical found in celery called phthalide

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.900
reduced cholesterol levels by 7 percent and
blood pressure by 18 percent.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.300

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.910
It improves digestion.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.340
People who suffer from stomach problems and
constipation know the importance of including

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.439
fiber in their diet.

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:27.729
Celery’s fiber content can help keep your
bowel movements healthy, among other things.

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:28.729

of gastritis.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.229
Celery contains a high level of the male pheromones,
androstenone, and androstenol.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.539
Some people believe that eating celery can
increase the perceived level of attractiveness

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.089
of the men who consume it.

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:06.749

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:07.749

It can keep your eyes healthy.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.169
Vitamin A, one of the main vitamins found
in celery, is known as a vitamin capable of

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.189
protecting the cornea.

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.289

The magnesium in celery is known to have a
relaxing effect in the nervous system.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.889
In fact, Hippocrates, the father of medicine,
once wrote that celery should be used to calm

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.089
the nerves and for falling asleep.

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:47.419
It’s also been historically used to treat
disorders related to the nervous system.

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.340

adding celery to your diet.

preach about celery as a mosquito repellant.

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.840
Studies have now shown that celery oil extract
rubbed on the skin works effectively as a

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.930
mosquito repellant.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.460
If you’re one of those people who is prone
to getting mosquito bites, try eating more

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.460
celery.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.529
You’ll thank us later.

a common and effective way to treat UTIs.

Aldosterone, the male hormone we discussed
earlier as having aphrodisiac properties,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.059
also creates a healthy environment for sperm
to mature.

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:13.729
Now that you know celery is more than a snack
full of water and some fiber, try including

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.509
it in your daily diet!

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:20.270

daily lifestyle.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.389

conditions, you may also want to speak to

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:08.849
your doctor to ensure you are not putting
your health at risk.

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:13.619

diet, be sure to add other vegetables and

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.819
nutrient-rich foods into your diet.

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:21.629
Try avoiding high-calorie or high-fat foods,
and try to avoid overeating sugar.

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:25.960
If you want to lose weight, cut these types
of foods out of your diet and incorporate

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.339
healthy foods while maintaining a good exercise
regimen.

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:32.979
