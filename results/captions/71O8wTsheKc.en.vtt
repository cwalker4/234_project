00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.410
The President:  Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.870
I want to begin by thanking
the Prime Minister

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.570
and President of Vietnam.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.730
We’re in Hanoi.
It’s an incredible city.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.570
What’s happened
over the last 25 years

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.200
has been incredible
for the people of Vietnam,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.310
the job they’ve done —
economic development.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.010
Really something special.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.480
So I want to thank
all of the people of Vietnam

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.920
for having treated us
so well.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.070
We have, I think,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.060
reasonably attractive news
from Pakistan and India.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.430
They’ve been going at it,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.310
and we’ve been involved in
trying to have them stop.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.280
And we have some
reasonably decent news.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.840
I think, hopefully, that’s going
to be coming to an end.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.639
It’s been going on
for a long time —

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.940
decades and decades.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.250
There’s a lot of dislike,
unfortunately.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.540
So we’ve been in the middle,
trying to help them both out

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.830
and see if we can get some
organization and some peace.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.830
And I think, probably,
that’s going to be happening.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.030
We have — Venezuela,
as you know,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.470
has been very much in the news,
and we’re sending supplies.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.450
Supplies are getting through
a little bit more.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.800
It’s not easy.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.140
It’s hard to believe somebody
would say “let’s not do it.”

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.970
What difference
would that make,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.190
except it’s great for its people
to let it get through.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.590
But we’re sending a lot of
supplies down to Venezuela.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.290
People are starving to death,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.830
and you would really think
that the man in charge,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.670
currently, would let those
supplies get through.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.560
We are getting them
into some of the cities

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.650
and some of the areas
that need them the most.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.449
And it’s not an easy job.
It’s very difficult, actually.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.890
On North Korea,
we just left Chairman Kim.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.940
We had a really, I think,
a very productive time.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.080
We thought, and I thought,
and Secretary Pompeo

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.070
felt that it wasn’t a good thing
to be signing anything.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340
I’m going to let Mike
speak about it.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.620
But we literally just left.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.530
We spent pretty much all day
with Kim Jong Un,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.570
who is — he’s quite a guy
and quite a character.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.660
And I think our relationship
is very strong.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.530
But at this time —
we had some options,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.650
and at this time we decided
not to do any of the options.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.080
And we’ll see where that goes.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.520
But it was a very interesting
two days.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.070
And I think, actually, it was
a very productive two days.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.970
But sometimes you have to walk,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.010
and this was just
one of those times.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.210
And I’ll let Mike speak to that
for a couple of minutes, please.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.410
Secretary Pompeo:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.330
We had been working, our teams —
the team that I brought to bear,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.620
as well as the North Koreans

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.740
— for weeks to try
and develop a path forward

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.260
so at the summit
we could make a big step —

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.130
a big step along the way
towards what the two leaders

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.090
had agreed to back in Singapore,
in June of last year.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.330
We made real progress.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.940
And indeed we made
even more progress

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.320
when the two leaders met
over the last 24, 36 hours.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.000
Unfortunately,
we didn’t get all the way.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.650
We didn’t get to something
that ultimately made sense

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.850
for the United States
of America.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.690
I think Chairman Kim
was hopeful that we would.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.480
We asked him to do more.
He was unprepared to do that.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.880
But I’m still optimistic.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.240
I’m hopeful that the teams
will get back

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.440
together in the days
and weeks ahead,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.260
and continue to work out
what’s a very complex problem.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.610
We have said,
since the beginning,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.290
that this would take time.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.970
Our teams have gotten to know
each other better.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.190
We know what the limits are.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.470
We know where some
of the challenges are.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.800
And I think as we continue
to work on this in the days

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.410
and weeks ahead,
we can make progress

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.570
so that we can
ultimately achieve

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.410
what it is that the world wants,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.040
which is to denuclearize
North Korea,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.160
to reduce risk
for the American people

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.990
and the people
all around the world.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.600
I wish we could have gotten
a little bit further,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.590
but I’m very optimistic that
the progress that we made —

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.880
both in the run-up
to this summit,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.560
as well as the progress
that the two leaders

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.710
made over these past two days —

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.590
put us in position
to get a really good outcome.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.450
And the President and
Chairman Kim

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.840
both felt good
that they had made that progress

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.810
but couldn’t quite get along
the line any further

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.760
to make a deal that would
have been bigger at this point.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.650
I hope we’ll do so
in the weeks ahead.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.850
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.660
The President:  Thank you.
The Press:  Mr. President —

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.360
The President:  All right,
Major, please.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.000
The Press:  Has this process
been more difficult

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.200
than you thought?
And was the North Korean demand

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.310
for lifting of some sanctions
the real sticking point here —

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.550
The President:  Yeah.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.930
The Press:  — in that you did
not want to do that

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.410
and they did?
And will there be —

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.630
The President:  It was
about the sanctions.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.440
The Press:  Will there be
a third summit, Mr. President?

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.550
The President:  Basically,
they wanted the sanctions

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.880
lifted in their entirety,
and we couldn’t do that.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.840
They were willing to denuke
a large portion of the areas

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.050
that we wanted,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.150
but we couldn’t give up
all of the sanctions for that.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.770
So we continue to work,
and we’ll see.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.780
But we had to walk away
from that particular suggestion.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.130
We had to walk away from that.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.360
The Press:  Will
all the sanctions

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.730
that are currently
in existence remain, sir?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.510
The President:  They’re
in place.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.360
You know, I was watching
as a lot of you folks

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.870
over the weeks have said,
“Oh, we’ve given up.”

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.790
We haven’t given up anything.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.050
And frankly, I think we’ll end
up being very good friends

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.500
with Chairman Kim
and with North Korea,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.100
and I think they have
tremendous potential.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.240
I’ve been telling everybody: 
They have tremendous potential.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.420
Unbelievable potential.
But we’re going to see.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.680
But it was about sanctions.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.330
I mean, they wanted
sanctions lifted

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.970
but they weren’t willing
to do an area that we wanted.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.340
They were willing
to give us areas

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.030
but not the ones we wanted.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.730
John?

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.340
The Press:  As we know, I mean,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.040
there’s an incredibly complex
set of issues

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.840
that are at play here in terms
of lifting the sanctions

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.100
and what denuclearization is.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.300
The President:  Right.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.580
The Press:  Did you get
any distance toward sort

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.340
of what Kim’s vision
of denuclearization is?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.670
The President:  Yes, we did.
We did.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.160
The Press:  Because there is
a lot —

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.380
a line of thinking that he wants
to keep some nukes.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.610
The President:  Yeah.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.980
The Press:  I mean,
would you allow him to do that?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.180
And if you can’t —

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.450
The President:  Well, I don’t —
John, I don’t want to comment —

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.650
The Press:  If you can’t get —
The President:  Excuse me,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.060
I don’t want to comment
on that exactly,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.500
but he has a certain vision
and it’s not exactly our vision,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.750
but it’s a lot closer
than it was a year ago.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.680
And I think, you know,
eventually we’ll get there.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.790
But for this particular visit,
we decided that we had to walk,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.910
and we’ll see what happens.
Okay?

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.520
Oh, look, we have a gentleman
nobody has ever heard of.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.890
Sean Hannity — what are you
doing here, Sean Hannity?

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.550
Should we let him do a question?
I don’t know.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.780
Yeah, John, go ahead.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.000
The Press:  If I could
just follow up.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.200
The President:  Yeah.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.670
The Press:  So if he wants
the sanctions completely off,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.650
and you want
more on denuclearization,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.610
how can you bridge
that gap between now

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.280
and the next time
you might sit down with him?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.550
The President:  With time.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.930
It’ll be bridged, I think,
at a certain point.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.240
But there is a gap.
We have to have sanctions.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.230
And he wants to denuke,
but he wants to just do areas

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.660
that are less important
than the areas that we want.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.350
We know that —
we know the country very well,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.700
believe it or not.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.200
We know every inch
of that country.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.890
And we have to get
what we have to get,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.570
because that’s a big —
that’s a big give.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.270
Yeah, Sean. Please.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.640
The Press:  I work
in radio and TV.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.870
The mic is on.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.719
Mr. President, thank you.
Mr. Secretary, good to see you.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.500
Mr. President, if you could
elaborate a little bit more.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.930
We have some history.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.210
President Reagan
walked away in Reykjavik.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.990
A lot of condemnation
at the time.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.520
And it ended up working out

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.130
very well in the end
for the United States.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.400
Was this mostly your decision?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.190
Or — and what message would you
want to send Chairman Kim,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.890
as he’s listening
to this press conference,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.560
about the future
and your relationship?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.770
The President:  Well, Sean,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.610
I don’t want to say
it was my decision,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.390
because what purpose is that?
I want to keep the relationship,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.660
and we will
keep the relationship.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.550
We’ll see what happens
over the next period of time.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.550
But, as you know,
we got our hostages back.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.170
There’s no more testing.
And one of the things,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.810
importantly, that Chairman Kim
promised me last night is,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.850
regardless, he’s not going to do
testing of rockets and nuclear.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.200
Not going to do testing.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.080
So, you know, I trust him,
and I take him at his word.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.420
I hope that’s true.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.320
But, in the meantime,
we’ll be talking.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.630
Mike will be speaking
with his people.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.140
He’s also developed a very good
relationship with the people —

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.830
really, the people representing
North Korea.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.720
I haven’t spoken
to Prime Minister Abe yet.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.600
I haven’t spoken to President
Moon of South Korea.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.090
But we will, and we’ll tell them
it’s a process

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.320
and it’s moving along.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.570
But we just felt it wasn’t
appropriate to sign

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.910
an agreement today.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.130
We could have. I just felt
it wasn’t very appropriate.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.830
Yeah, Jonathan.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.640
The Press:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.880
The President:  Thank you.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.120
The Press:  Two questions,
if I may.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.640
First, did you learn anything
new about Chairman Kim,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.900
through this meeting?

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.930
And secondly, of course,
while this was going on,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.140
the drama back in Washington,
your former lawyer,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.380
Michael Cohen —
who worked for you for 10 years;

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.520
his office right next to yours,
right by yours at Trump Tower —

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.850
he called you a liar,
a conman, a racist.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.900
What’s your response
to Michael Cohen?

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.870
The President:  Well,
it’s incorrect.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.460
And, you know,
it’s very interesting,

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.080
because I tried to watch
as much as I could.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.300
I wasn’t able to watch too much

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.090
because
I’ve been a little bit busy.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.890
But I think having
a fake hearing like that,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.380
and having it in the middle
of this very important summit

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.200
is really a terrible thing.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.020
They could’ve made it
two days later or next week,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.510
and it would’ve been
even better.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.360
They would’ve had more time.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.090
But having it during this
very important summit

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.910
is sort of incredible.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.770
And he lied a lot,
but it was very interesting

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.410
because he didn’t lie
about one thing.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.720
He said no collusion
with the Russian hoax.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.960
And I said,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.710
“I wonder why he didn’t just lie
about that, too,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.060
like he did
about everything else?”

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.750
I mean, he lied about so many
different things,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.290
and I was actually impressed
that he didn’t say, “Well,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.420
I think there was collusion
for this reason or that.”

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.900
He didn’t say that.
He said, “No collusion.”

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.080
And I was, you know, a little
impressed by that, frankly.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.540
Could’ve —
he could’ve gone all out.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.260
He only went about 95 percent
instead of 100 percent.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.930
But the fact is,
there is no collusion.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.770
And I call it the “witch hunt.”

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.590
This should never happen
to another President.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.120
This is so bad for our country.
So bad.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.740
You look at this whole hoax —

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.610
I call it
the Russian witch hunt.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.650
I now add the word “hoax.”

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.010
It’s a very, very bad thing
for our country.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.080
But I was impressed
with the fact

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.720
that he — when — you know,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.670
because the most
important question up there

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.930
was the one on collusion.
And he said he saw no collusion.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.560
So we’ll see what happens.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.359
But it was pretty shameful,
I think.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.200
Yes, ma’am. Please. Please.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.530
The Press:  President Trump —
The Press:  President Trump —

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.600
The President:  How about
one of you, instead of three?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.130
The Press:  Well, actually,
I do have the microphone.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.630
I guess, so — well —

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.920
The President:  Excuse me.
Excuse me.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.620
Person in the front.
Go ahead.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.530
The Press:  Thank you,
President Trump, for —

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.970
The President:  No, no.
No, not you.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.130
Excuse me.
Yeah, we’ll get to you.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.330
Thank you.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.840
The Press:  Thank you,
President Trump.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.520
Jane Tung (ph)
from (inaudible)

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.740
Television.
What was the atmosphere

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.190
like when you walked away
from the negotiation table?

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.430
And —

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.640
The President:  I think it was
very good, very friendly.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.690
This wasn’t a walk away,
like you get up and walk out.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.020
No, this was very friendly.
We shook hands.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.630
You know, there’s a warmth
that we have,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.580
and I hope that stays.
I think it will.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.180
But we are — you know,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.550
we’re positioned
to do something very special.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.190
This has been going on
for many decades. This isn’t me.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.539
You know, this was —
this should’ve been solved

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.350
during many presidential runs.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.830
And, you know,
people talked about it;

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.720
they never did anything.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.290
I get a kick out of so many
people from past administrations

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.940
telling me how to negotiate
when they were there,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.780
in some cases, for eight years;
they did nothing.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.900
But I think the relationship
was very warm,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.040
and when we walked away
it was a very friendly walk.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.589
Mike, you might want to speak
to that for a second.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.680
Secretary Pompeo:  No, I agree.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.040
I talked with
my counterparts as well.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.630
But we hope we can do more,
but everyone is very focused

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.010
on how we continue
to build on this.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.670
We are certainly closer today
than we were 36 hours ago.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.380
And we were closer then than we
were a month or two before that.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.080
So real progress was made.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.420
I think everyone had hoped
we could do it

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.870
just a little bit better.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.320
But the departure
was with an agreement

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.660
that we would continue
to work

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.130
on what has been
an incredibly difficult problem.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.160
Both sides are resolved
to achieve it,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.910
and everyone walked away
in that spirit.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.980
The Press:  And may I add:
You and Chairman Kim

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.110
are from very different
political systems.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.980
You are from
different generations.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.310
And what do you find —

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.620
The President:  It’s a very
different system.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.170
I would say that’s true.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.950
The Press:  How do you find,
you guys, in common?

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.180
Because we saw the atmosphere —

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.400
The President:  We just
like each other.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.150
I mean, we have
a good relationship.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.490
Yeah. It’s a totally different
system, to put it mildly.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.820
But we like each other.
A good relationship.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.850
Go ahead. In the back. Go ahead.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.740
The Press:  Mr. President,
do you think it was premature

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.070
to have held the summit

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.400
when all these things
had not been tied down?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.310
I mean, in the White House
schedule last night,

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.750
it said signing agreement today.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.460
And I wonder whether —
as a follow-up question,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.840
whether you could sketch out
what the next few months

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.110
look like.
Thank you.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.130
The President:  You always have
to be prepared to walk.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.810
I could’ve signed
an agreement today,

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.110
and then you people
would’ve said,

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.900
“Oh, what a terrible deal.
What a terrible thing he did.”

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.600
No, you have be
prepared to walk.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.360
And, you know,
there was a potential

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.800
we could’ve
signed something today.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.099
I could’ve 100 percent
signed something today.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.650
We actually had papers ready
to be signed,

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.180
but it just wasn’t appropriate.
I want to do it right.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.390
I’d much rather do it right
than do it fast.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:18.120
Yes, please. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go. First. Go. Yeah.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.020
The Press:  (Inaudible.)

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.720
The President:  You have
to speak up.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.660
The Press:  I’m a reporter
from South Korea,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.420
and I appreciate your effort
to advance denuclearization

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.680
in Korean Peninsula.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.530
And could you elaborate
on the options

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.130
and the various ways that
you discussed with Chairman Kim

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.880
to advance denuclearization?
Could you specify?

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.350
The President:  We discussed
many ways.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.530
And the denuclearization
is a very important —

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.690
it’s a very important word.
Become a very well used word.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.060
And a lot of people
don’t know what it means,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.620
but to me it’s pretty obvious:
We have to get rid of the nukes.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.830
I think he’s got a chance

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.210
to have one of
the most successful countries —

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.910
rapidly, too — on Earth.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.530
Incredible country,
incredible location.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.640
You’re right between —
if you think of it, you have,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.350
on one side, Russia and China,
and on the other you have

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.370
South Korea,
and you’re surrounded by water

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.850
and among the most beautiful
shorelines in the world.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.850
There is tremendous potential
in North Korea,

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.100
and I think
he’s going to lead it

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.100
to a very important thing,
economically.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.950
I think it’s going to be
an absolute economic power.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.320
Yes. Go ahead. Please. Go ahead.
Yeah.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.400
The Press:  Mr. President,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.870
David Sanger
from the New York Times.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.080
The President:  I know, David.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.450
The Press:  Six months ago,
when you spoke —

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.710
or eight months ago,
in Singapore, you said,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.120
if you didn’t have something
in six months,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.420
we should come back
and ask you about it.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.830
In that time,
you have seen Chairman Kim

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.320
increase the number of missiles
he’s produced

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.360
and continue to produce
more nuclear material.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.040
And that’s been
a pressure point on you,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.800
because he’s showing you
the arsenals getting larger

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.250
while this is going on.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.480
The President:  Well,
some people, David,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.200
are saying that, and some people
are denying that.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.280
They have shots from above —
way above —

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.220
and some people are saying that
and some people aren’t.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.750
But I could’ve taken
that out today,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.920
but I think you
and others would’ve said

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.180
we didn’t get enough
for what we’d be giving up.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.670
So — and, you know,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.950
don’t forget, we’re partners
with a lot of countries on this,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.330
if you think about it,
with the sanctions.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.260
We have a whole big partnership
with the United Nations

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.920
and many countries,
including Russia,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.600
China, and others.
And then, of course,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.340
South Korea is very important
to this whole thing, and Japan.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.880
I don’t want to do something

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.400
that is going to violate
the trust that we’ve built up.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.340
We have a very
strong partnership.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.420
The Press:  So can you just
give us a little more detail?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.780
Did you get into the question

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.430
of actually dismantling
the Yongbyon complex?

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.680
The President:  I did. Yes.
Absolutely.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.990
The Press:  And does he seem
willing, ultimately —

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.320
The President:  Totally.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.530
The Press:  — to take
all of that out?

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.740
The President:  Sure. Totally.
The Press:  He does?

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.950
He just wants
all the sanctions off first?

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.170
The President:  He would
do that,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.450
but he wants
the sanctions for that.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.690
And as you know,
there’s plenty left after that.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.770
And I just I felt
it wasn’t good.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.050
Mike and I spent a long time
negotiating

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.610
and
talking about it to ourselves.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.170
And just — I felt that
that particular, as you know,

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.470
that facility, while very big,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.580
it wasn’t enough
to do what we were doing.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.790
The Press:  So he was
willing to Yongbyon,

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.520
but you wanted more than that?
I assume —

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.040
The President:  We had to have
more than that, yeah.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.180
We had to have more than that
because there are other things

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.120
that you haven’t talked about,

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.860
that you haven’t written about,
that we found.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.530
And we have to have —
that was done a long time ago,

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.840
but the people
didn’t know about.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.140
The Press:  Including the
uranium —

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.400
The President:  And we brought —
yeah.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.790
The Press:  Including the second
uranium enrichment plant?

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.010
The President:  Exactly.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.550
And we brought many,
many points up

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.340
that I think they were surprised
that we knew.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.550
But we had to do more
than just the one level.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.330
Because if we did the one level,
and we gave up

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.120
all of that leverage that’s been
taking a long time to build.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.400
And I want to tell you,
by the way —

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.600
The Press:  So he was not
willing

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.880
to take out that second —

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.310
The President:  David, I want to
take off the sanctions

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.260
so badly, because I want
that country to grow.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.690
That country has got
such potential,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.020
but they have to give up,
or we could’ve done that deal.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.720
Mike, you want to speak to that?

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.680
Secretary Pompeo:  Only, David,
there are also timing

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.940
and sequencing issues

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.260
that were associated
with that as well,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.790
which we didn’t quite get across
the finish line as well.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.270
But remember, too,
even that facility,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.100
even the Yongbyon facility
and all of its scope —

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.000
which is important, for sure —
still leaves missiles,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.820
still leaves
warheads and weapons systems.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.410
So there’s a lot of
other elements

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.680
that we just couldn’t get to.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.090
The Press:  And the listing
of all of them.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.410
Secretary Pompeo:  Yes, sir.
And a declaration.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.640
So, all of those things,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.020
we couldn’t quite
get there today.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.920
The President:  That’s right.
Go ahead.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.600
The Press:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.820
The President:  Thank you.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.070
The Press:  I just wanted
to clarify,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.680
when you talk about
what you would willing

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.940
to give up
all of the sanctions for,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.510
are you still thinking
that you want North Korea

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.290
to give up everything to do

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.670
complete,
verifiable denuclearization —

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.560
The President:  Well,

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.780
I don’t want to say
that to you —

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.990
The Press:  —
before you lift sanctions?

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.230
The President:  Yeah. Yeah.
It’s a good question.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.440
I don’t want to say that to you

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.740
because I don’t want
to put myself in that position,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.340
from the standpoint
of negotiation.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.510
But, you know, we want a lot
to be given up.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.760
And we’re giving up.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.030
And we’ll have to — you know,
we’ll be helping them along

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.060
economically,
us and other —

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.380
many other countries
are going to be helping.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.700
They’re going to be in there.
They’re prepared to help.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.410
I can tell you: Japan,
South Korea, I think China.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.750
So many.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.690
And speaking of China,
we’re very well on our way

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.520
to doing something special,
but we’ll see.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.490
I mean,
I am always prepared to walk.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.340
I’m never afraid to walk
from a deal.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.960
And I would do that with China,
too, if it didn’t work out.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.180
The Press:  Are you concerned,

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.030
if you’re not able
to reach an agreement,

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.780
that the testing
will start again?

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.480
Or that while all of this time
is happening by —

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.770
The President:  Well, he said
the testing — yeah.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:37.980
The Press:  —
they are continuing

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.260
to develop their program?

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.750
The President:  He said
the testing will not start.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.110
He said that he’s not going
to do

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.920
testing of rockets or missiles

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.650
or anything having
to do with nuclear.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.450
And all I can tell you is that’s
what he said. And we’ll see.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.630
Yes, go ahead. Please.
Go ahead, please. In the back.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.050
Red. In the red.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.350
The Press:  Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.570
The President:  Yes, thank you.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.230
The Press:  Jessica Stone
from CGTN.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.370
I have a question about China,
as you were talking about.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.120
You talk about China
being willing, potentially,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.340
to help economically.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.770
And the fact that
you’ve talked —

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.080
or will talk to Presidents Moon
and Prime Minister Abe,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.100
how would you describe
China’s role

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.990
in facilitating the engagement
that’s happened,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.740
so far, between Pyongyang
and Washington?

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.290
The President:  I think China
has been a big help.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.920
Bigger than most people know.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.830
On the border, as you know,
93 percent of the goods

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.560
coming into North Korea
come through China.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.080
So there’s a great power there.
At the same time, I believe —

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.100
I happen to believe that North
Korea is calling its own shots.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.640
They’re not taking orders
from anybody.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.340
He’s a very strong guy.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.930
And they’re able to do things
that are pretty amazing.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.180
But 93 percent still
come in from China.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.140
China has an influence,
and China has been a big help.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.740
And Russia has been
a big help too.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.580
As you know, there’s a pretty
small part of the border,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.410
but nevertheless significant —
about 28 miles.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.000
And things can happen there too.
And they’ve been a help.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.490
Yes, go ahead, please.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.750
The Press:  Thanks, President.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.150
Jen Chen with Shenzhen Media
Group of China.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.190
In your meeting
with Chairman Kim

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.040
this morning and yesterday,
did the topic of China come up?

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.600
If so, what can you
share with us today?

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.180
And you probably will have the
(inaudible)

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.950
of Mar-a-Lago summit in March

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.620
with Chinese
President Xi Jinping.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.330
What would you like accomplished
with your agenda

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.380
regarding China at that time?
Thank you.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.240
The President:  We did talk
about China today a lot.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.840
And he’s getting along
with China and so are we.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.010
And we are — you know, we’re —
we’re, right now,

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.990
you look at what’s happened
to our country;

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.330
we’ve picked up trillions

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.030
and trillions of dollars
of net worth.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.360
Our stock market is almost
at its all-time high.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.490
Our economy is incredible.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.360
Our unemployment numbers
are among the best

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.460
we’ve ever had in our history.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.860
Individual groups like
African American, women —

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.880
you just take a look
at any group;

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.680
Hispanic, you saw
that just came out —

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.900
the best in history;

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.970
African American,
best in history.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.020
So many different numbers
are coming out so good.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.830
So we have
the strongest economy, probably,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.530
possibly that we’ve ever had.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.010
Fiat Chrysler just announced
that they’re going to spend

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.210
$4.5 billion right next to
Detroit, in Michigan.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.480
They’re building
a tremendous plant.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.390
It’s actually an expansion
of another plant.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.440
It’s going to be — it’s going to
double up their jobs,

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.680
and even more than that.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.450
A lot of great things
are happening.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.910
And with China, they’re having
some difficulty, as you know.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.620
But I think that
a lot of the difficulty

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.380
is because of the tariffs
that they’re having.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.720
And in addition to that,

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.380
we’re putting a tremendous
amount of money;

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.420
you saw trade deficits
went down last month.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.690
Everybody was trying
to find out why.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.070
Well, we’re taking
in a lot of tariff money,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.920
and it’s going right
to the bottom line

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.480
and it has reduced
the trade deficits.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.950
So we’ll see what happens
with China.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.900
I think we have
a very good chance.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.440
Their numbers are down.
But I don’t want that.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.850
I want their numbers —
I want them to do great.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.320
But we’ve been losing
anywhere from $300-

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.040
to $500 billion a year
with China for many, many years.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.430
And again, like other things,
many

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.580
Presidents should have
done this before me,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.630
and nobody did.
So we’re doing it.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.190
Go ahead. Go ahead, please.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.810
Right here.
This gentleman.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.790
The Press:  Chad O’Carroll
from NK News,

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.440
(inaudible)
with North Korea News.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520
What’s your message
for President Moon,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.240
who has effectively reached
the glass ceiling,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.650
as far inter-Korean
cooperation is concerned,

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.920
due to sanctions?

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.640
And what’s next for
U.S.-ROK military drills?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.100
The President:  Well, I like
President Moon very much.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.020
We have a great relationship.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.840
Believe it or not,
I have a great relationship

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.740
with almost every leader.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.490
A lot of people find that hard
to understand, but I do.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.900
But some take advantage
of our country

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.140
like you wouldn’t believe.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.000
And when they know I know it —
which I know in every case —

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.780
maybe it sort of freezes
them up a little bit.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.980
But we do; we have
a lot of good relationships.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.120
We’ll be calling
President Moon very soon,

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.110
as soon as I get by the phone,
on the plane.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.250
And he’ll be one
of the first calls.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.900
I’ll be calling Prime Minister
Abe of Japan,

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.950
telling him about where we are
and what we’re doing.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.270
But I’ll be making those calls.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.470
No, he’s working very hard.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.060
President Moon
is working very hard.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.850
He’d love to see a deal
and he’s been very helpful.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.880
Okay? Thank you.
Go ahead, please.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.400
The Press:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.370
I’m (inaudible), reporter from
Global Times China.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.350
I would like to ask you,
what are you expecting China

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.370
to do in the next step
to mediate your relationship

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.070
with North Korea?
Thank you.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.930
The President:  To use China?

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.150
The Press:  Yeah, from China.
The President:  Well, we do.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.770
I mean,
China has been very helpful.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.470
President Xi is a great leader.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.850
He’s a highly respected leader
all over the world

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.800
and especially in Asia.
And he’s helped us —

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.500
Mike, I would say
he’s helped us a lot, right?

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.700
Secretary Pompeo:  He has.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.020
The President:  We’ve —
I actually called him

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.310
just recently to say,

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.080
“Hey, you know,
whatever you can do on this.”

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.650
But he has been very helpful
at the border,

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.860
and he’s been very, very helpful
with, I think,

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.760
North Korea generally.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.020
Could he be
a little more helpful?

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.330
Probably.
But he’s been excellent.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.660
Go ahead, please.
No — yeah, please.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.900
The Press:  (Laughs.)

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.340
(Inaudible)
next.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.620
The President:  That’s okay.
You’re friends.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.560
The Press:  Thanks,
Mr. President.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.600
Could you — did you commit
with Chairman Kim

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.720
to a next summit
during your term?

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.090
The President:  No,
we haven’t — no.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.300
The Press:  Okay.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.530
The President:  We’ll see.
If it happens, it happens.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.770
I have not committed.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.090
The Press:  They are,
at this point,

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.400
some would say, a nuclear power.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.990
Do you accept North Korea
as a nuclear-armed state,

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.730
at least for the time being?

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.730
And are you thinking
about re-imposing

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.910
the military exercises
with South Korea,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.560
or will you keep it
a freeze-for-freeze?

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.590
The President:  Well, you know,
the military exercises,

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.200
I gave that up
quite a while ago

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.490
because it costs us $100 million
every time we do it.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.060
We fly these massive bombers
in from Guam.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.290
And when I first started,
a certain general said,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.910
“Oh, yes, sir,
we fly them in from Guam.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.150
It’s right next door.”

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.249
Well, right next door
is seven hours away.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.080
And then they come and they drop
millions of dollars of bombs,

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.700
and then they go back and —

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.400
But we would spend — I mean,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.780
we spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on those exercises,

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.370
and I hated to see it.
I thought it was unfair.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.730
And, frankly, I was, sort of,
of the opinion that South Korea

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.600
should help us with that.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.080
You know, we’re protecting
South Korea.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.010
I think they should
help us with that.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.970
So those exercises
are very expensive.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.980
And I was telling the generals —
I said:

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.750
Look, you know,
exercising is fun and it’s nice

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.920
and they play the war games.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.300
And I’m not saying
it’s not necessary,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.620
because at some levels it is,
but at other levels it’s not.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.670
But it’s a very,
very expensive thing.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.410
And you know, we do have
to think about that too.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.280
But when they spend
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.920
on those exercises
and we don’t get reimbursed —

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.080
we’re spending a tremendous
amount of money

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.630
on many countries,

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.680
protecting countries
that are very rich

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.880
that can certainly afford
to pay us and then some.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.140
And those countries —
by the way,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.340
and those countries know
that it’s not right,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.890
but nobody has ever
asked them before.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.110
But I’ve asked them

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.190
and we’re doing —
we’re gaining a lot of money.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.270
We’ve picked up over
a $100 billion

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.970
just in NATO over
the last two years.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.780
A hundred billion dollars
more has come in.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.190
And we’re doing that
with a lot of countries.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.420
You’ll be seeing that a lot.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.640
Yes, sir. Please.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.580
The Press:  Mr. President, sir —

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.280
The President:  Yeah,
one second, please.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.600
The Press:  Yes, thank you,
Mr. President.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.120
You have a
personal relationship —

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.790
and I believe
Vice President Pence does —

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.030
with the family
of Otto Warmbier.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.320
The President:  I do.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.620
The Press:  I’m wondering —
you’ve talked about, this week,

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.670
about Kim Jong Un
being “my friend” —

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.050
you called him on Twitter.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.540
You said you have
a great relationship.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.140
Have you, in Singapore or here,

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.800
confronted Kim Jong Un
about Otto Warmbier’s death —

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.020
The President:  I have. I have.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.280
The Press:  — and asked him
to take responsibility?

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.520
And what did he say to you?

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.740
And why do you
call him your friend?

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.950
The President:  I have.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.040
And I have,
and we have talked about it.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.960
And I really don’t think
it was in his interest at all.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.330
I know the Warmbier family
very well.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.330
I think they’re
an incredible family.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.550
What happened is horrible.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.910
I really believe something
very bad happened to him,

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.470
and I don’t think that the top
leadership knew about it.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.230
And when they had to send him
home — by the way,

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.840
I got the prisoners back.
I got the hostages back.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.540
And Otto was
one of the hostages,

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.670
but Otto came back in shape that
was not even to be talked about.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.530
I find it —
I thought it was horrible.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.160
Now, the others came back
extremely healthy.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.420
But Otto came back
in a condition

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.320
that was just — just terrible.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.170
And I will —
I did speak about it,

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:05.940
and I don’t believe that he
would’ve allowed that to happen.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.620
Just wasn’t to his advantage
to allow that to happen.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.820
Those prisons are rough.
They’re rough places.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.170
And bad things happened.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.430
But I really don’t believe
that he was —

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.960
I don’t believe
he knew about it.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.180
The Press:  Did he say —
did he tell you

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.040
that he did not — did Kim Jong
Un tell you —

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.250
The President:  He felt badly
about it.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.770
I did speak to him.
He felt very badly.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.420
But he knew the case very well,
but he knew it later.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.540
And, you know,
you got a lot of people.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.240
A big country. A lot of people.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.890
And in those prisons
and those camps,

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.250
you have a lot of people.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.380
And some really bad things
happened to Otto.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.720
Some really, really bad things.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.040
But he tells me —

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.290
The Press:  Why are you
(inaudible) —

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.790
The President:  He tells me
that he didn’t know about it,

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.690
and I will take him at his word.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.180
Yes, ma’am. Go ahead. Please.
Please. Go ahead. In the back.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.210
The Press:  Me?
The President:  No, in the back.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.910
Behind you. Thank you.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.420
The Press:  Mr. President,

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.130
(inaudible),
Sputnik News Agency.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.590
Have you discussed the issue
of possible inspections

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.960
to North Korea’s nuclear sites
during your negotiations?

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.060
The President:  You’re going to
have to speak a little louder.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.830
And where are you from?
Where are you from?

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.610
The Press:  Russia’s
Sputnik News Agency.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.530
Have you discussed the issue
of possible inspections

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.800
to North Korea’s nuclear sites
during your talks

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.500
with the Chairman?

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.720
The President:  Why don’t you
answer that, Mike?

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.970
I can’t —
The Press:  Inspections.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.220
The President:  Good.
The Press:  Inspections.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.460
Inspections of nuclear sites.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.700
The President:  I was worried
about my hearing.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.940
The Press:  Inspections, sir.
The President:  Oh, inspections.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.170
The Press:  
International inspections. Yes.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.500
The President:  Oh, inspections.
Inspections on North Korea?

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.740
Oh, we’d be able — yeah.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.110
The Press:  Yeah. Inspections
to the nuclear sites.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.480
The President:  We’d be able
to do that very easily.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.610
We have that set up, so we would
be able to do that very easily.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.010
The inspections on North Korea
will take place and we’ll —

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.530
if we do something with them —

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.620
we have a schedule
set up that is very good.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.370
We know things that, as David
was asking about certain places

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.590
and certain sites —

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.130
there are sites
that people don’t know about

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.610
that we know about.
We would be able to do

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.000
inspections, we think,
very, very successfully.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.120
Yes, ma’am. Please. Please.
Yes, go ahead. Please. Yes.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.820
The Press:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.400
The President:  A lot of people
here, by the way.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.230
A big group of people.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.440
The Press:  Yes.
The President:  Go ahead.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.970
The Press:  Kann News Israel,
Mr. President.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.190
The President:  Good. Good.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.630
The Press:  Following this
engagement with North Korea,

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.720
you are trying to bring peace
to the Middle East.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.010
The President:  Right.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.230
The Press:  The peace plan
is about

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.000
to be introduced
in the near future.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.810
And as you have mentioned before
—

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.140
The President:  Well, we hope.
We hope.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.770
We’re working hard on the peace
plan and we hope it will be

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:32.970
(inaudible).

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.990
The Press:  I believe you do.
But as you mentioned before,

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.850
it will require Israel to make
compromises to the Palestinians.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.030
As far as you know, is Prime
Minister Netanyahu

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.280
willing to make
these compromises

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.980
which are very much needed?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.360
And a second question: Mr.
Netanyahu

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.650
is about to indicted today
with corruption allegations.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.060
Do you wish to tell him
something on this occasion?

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.420
The President:  Well,
I just think he’s been

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.750
a great prime minister.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.630
And I don’t know
about his difficulty,

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.130
but you’re telling me something

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.170
that, you know, the people
have been hearing about.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.870
But I don’t know about that.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.660
I can say this: that he’s done
a great job as prime minister.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.550
He’s tough, he’s smart, he’s
strong. He is very defensive.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.070
His military
has been built up a lot.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.390
They buy a lot of equipment
from the United States

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.780
and they pay for it.
Of course,

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.760
we give them tremendous,
as you know, subsidy, also.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.030
Four billion dollars
is a lot each year.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.360
But they are —
they’ve been very good.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.080
They’ve been incredible,
actually, in many ways.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.100
But there is a chance for peace
between Israel

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.420
and the Palestinians.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.860
And, you know,
it’s interesting —

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.070
all of my life,

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.800
I’ve heard that the toughest
of all deals —

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.050
when they talk
about tough deals;

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.430
we all like deals —

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.440
but the toughest of all deals
would be peace

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.150
between Israel and Palestinians.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.190
They say it’s like
the impossible deal.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.390
I’d love to be able
to produce it.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.600
We’ll see what happens.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.449
You know, we were paying
the Palestinians a lot of money.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.070
And I ended that
about two years ago

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.870
because they weren’t saying
the right things.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.600
And I said,
why would we pay somebody

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.200
that’s not saying
nice things about us,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.250
and not really wanting
to go to the peace table?

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:14.400
And they’ve been much better.
And we’ll see what happens.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.800
The Press:  But has
Mr. Netanyahu made concessions?

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.030
The President:  But I think
we really —

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.860
I think we have, actually,
a good shot at peace

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.340
between Israel
and the Palestinians.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.540
The Press:  Has Netanyahu
made concessions?

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.370
The President:  Yeah, go ahead.
Please. Sir.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.840
The Press:  Mr. President,
I’m from China. My question is:

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.840
Do you still believe
it is possible

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.460
that the North Korea
and U.S. relation

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.260
could be like the U.S. and the
Vietnam relation in the future?

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.640
The President:  You
have to go again.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.140
The Press:  Do you believe —
do you still believe

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.600
that is it is possible

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.340
that the relation between U.S.
and North Korea, in the future,

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.710
could be like the relation
between U.S. and Vietnam?

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.310
The President:  Yeah.
I think we’re going have — yeah.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.409
I mean, we have very,
very good relations.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.180
And, by the way, speaking of —
you mentioned Japan —

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.540
we have a lot of good things
happening Japan.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.240
We have trade talks started.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.150
For years,
Japan has been sending millions

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.890
and millions of cars in,
and as you know,

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.170
it’s not been a very fair
situation for the United States.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.370
We’re starting trade
talks with Japan.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.240
They actually started about
three months ago,

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.930
and I think we’ll have a very
good deal for the United States.

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:18.080
But that’s been
a very unfair situation.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.660
Prime Minister Abe understands
that, and that’s fine.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.360
Yes, sir. Please. Back there.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.830
The Press:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.970
I’m (inaudible)
with Shanghai Media Group.

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:31.330
Do you think the next meeting
could be soon,

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.600
or might take some time?

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.830
The President:  Well,
I can’t tell you.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.450
I mean, it might be soon.
It might not be for a long time.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.850
I can’t tell you.
I would hope it would be soon.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.390
But it may not be
for a long time.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.250
I could’ve done —
I could’ve done a deal today,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.440
but it would’ve been a deal that
wouldn’t have been a deal that —

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.270
it would’ve been something

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.930
that I wouldn’t have
been happy about,

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.810
Mike would not
have been happy about.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.330
We had some pretty big options.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.230
But we just felt
it wasn’t appropriate,

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.290
and
we really want to do it right.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.050
Yes, in the back. In the back.
Yes, ma’am. Please.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.050
The Press:  Debi Edward,
ITV News.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.430
At which point did it
become clear to you

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.390
that you wouldn’t be getting
a deal here in Hanoi?

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.300
The language from yourself
and Kim Jong Un

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.070
was very positive last night
and even this morning.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.750
And therefore,
was it a mistake to come here?

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.960
The President:  No, I think
the language

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.600
was good all throughout.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.260
The language has been good
even now.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.950
But, you know,
I don’t go by language,

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.930
because we had probably
the toughest language

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.950
in the history of diplomacy
— if you call it diplomacy —

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.330
at the beginning, and yet,
we became very friendly.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.679
I don’t believe there was any
tougher language ever than that.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.640
But, again, this was something

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.980
that should’ve been handled
by other

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.770
Presidents long before me
and long

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.300
before they had the kind
of power that they have.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.810
But it wasn’t.
It should’ve been done by many —

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.090
I’m not just blaming
the Obama administration,

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.400
which, by the way,
it did nothing. Nothing.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.490
Did absolutely on North Korea.
It allowed things that happened,

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.410
and to happen,
that were very inappropriate.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.030
But I’m not blaming
the Obama administration.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.610
I’m blaming
many administrations.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.330
Something should’ve happened.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.260
But I don’t think the rhetoric
has been bad at all.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.870
Initially, it was horrible,
but now it’s been very good.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.480
All right, one more.
How about you? Go ahead.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.740
Please.
Please. Go ahead.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:20.880
The Press:  (Inaudible)
from South Korea,

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.640
(inaudible)
South Korean media outlet here.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.160
I’d like to ask you:
You said that we do not

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.710
particularly know
when there will be —

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.100
North Korean leader will
be willing to come to the table

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.280
and take the actions
that’s been required.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.890
If that’s the case,

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:42.140
would the U.S. be willing
to strengthen the sanctions

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.810
and perhaps put the pressure
on North Korea to move forward?

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.170
The President:  I don’t want
to comment on that.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.820
I can just tell you this:

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.700
that we have
very strong sanctions.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.720
I don’t want to talk about
increasing sanctions.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.510
They’re strong.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.240
They have a lot of great people
in North Korea

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.160
that have to live also.
And that’s important to me.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:04.910
And I would say this: My whole
attitude changed a lot

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.780
because I got to know,

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.080
as you know,
Chairman Kim very well.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.310
And they have a point
of view also.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.800
So I don’t really want to talk
about that.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.420
I just think that, hopefully,
for the sake of South Korea,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.230
for the sake of Japan,

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.020
and frankly,
for the sake of China —

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.400
I was talking to President Xi,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.430
who really is a man that gets
the respect of a lot of people —

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.860
I say, “You can’t love
having a nuclear state

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.560
right next to China.”

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.910
And he doesn’t.
He really doesn’t.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.760
I will tell you, he would like
to see that problem solved, too.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.010
So that’s it.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.170
Well, ladies and gentleman,
I’m about to get on a plane

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.490
and fly back to a wonderful
place called Washington, D.C.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.950
So, thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.900
Thank you, fellas.
Thank you very much.
