00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.909
Pat, guess what, Pat?!

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:04.909
What?

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:06.120
Guess what, Pat!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
What?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.590
I have a billion dollar idea, man!

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.320
Dude, your ideas suck.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320
C'mon.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Yeah.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.190
It's a billion dollar idea.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.180
You know how many times I have to hear messages
like this?

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.510
Pat, I got a billion dollar idea!

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.630
Pat, we're going to be the next billion dollar
company!

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.330
I was on a podcast earlier today.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.820
A guy asked me, Pat, what do you do if you're
18 years old and you got an incredible idea?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.890
I said, Stop focusing on having so many great
ideas.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.300
Pat, that doesn't make any sense!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.150
Stop focusing on great ideas.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.150
Why?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.210
I don't get what you're saying.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760
Let me explain to you why.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.800
Here's why.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.660
Say I have two people here.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
Okay?

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.220
On this end, I have somebody who's got the
most ridiculous idea in the world.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.700
It's the next Uber.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700
It's the next Facebook.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.260
It's the next whatever you want to call it.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Great idea.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.370
I have a guy here on this side who spent two
years mastering a skill set, while this guy

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.630
[on the other side] was just trying to come
up with great ideas.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.390
This guy here spent two years learning how
to sell.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.240
Day and night he mastered the art of selling.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.240
Selling.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.240
Selling.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.820
If I have to bet on who is more likelihood
to eventually make more money in life, I'm

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.179
putting all my money on this guy [selling]
over this guy [ideas].

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.829
Let me explain to you why.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:21.829
Okay?

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.200
So I have some examples here for you, which
will validate why I'm making this point to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200
you.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.329
We have five examples.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.209
And I promise you two of them you won't even
recognize who they are.

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.329
But you'll know once I make a point to you
here.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.329
Mark Zuckerberg.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.880
Everyone knows, Facebook.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.720
December, 2004, they got started.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.969
By the way, he didn't even come out with the
idea.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.709
The Winklevoss twins came out with the idea
of Facebook.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:46.790
But he [Zuckerberg] took it.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.069
You can call it stealing, whatever you want
to call it.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.319
And he started coding Facebook, okay?

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.319
We have Mark Zuckerberg.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.869
We have Steve Wozniak who learned how to create
the computer.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.279
That's April 1, 1976.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.409
We have McDonald's brothers, who started McDonalds,
April 15, '55.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.749
We have Nick Swinmurn - by the way, do you
even know who Nick Swinmurn is?

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.650
You know, I don't even know who Nick Swinmurn
is.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.120
Do you know who Nick Swinmurn is?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.739
Can you guess who Nick Swinmurn is?

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.370
Stop Googling it!

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.510
Stop Googling it and just stay with the episode.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.349
You don't know who Nick Swinmurn is, but you
will here, in a minute.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.280
Do you know who Martin Eberhard is?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.680
Oh my gosh!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.400
Martin Eberhard, wherever you are, I hope
you don't watch this episode.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.120
But there is a Martin Eberhard out there.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.870
Now watch this, here.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.879
All of these guys were great in ideas.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.930
Zuckerberg takes the idea from the Winklevoss
brothers.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.969
Okay?

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.569
And he starts coding with his friend, Edward.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.280
They raised $18,000 from Edward.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.500
There's so many different stories.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.750
And they created Facebook.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.160
It was mainly for, you know, the Harvard yearbook
was called The Facebook.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160
You've seen the movie before.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.349
If you haven't, you should watch the Social
Network.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.680
Great movie to watch.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:08.409
And then all of a sudden, Mark Zuckerberg
runs into a sales guy, named Sean Parker.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.400
If you don't know who Sean Parker is, Sean
Parker was the founder of Napster.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.840
This dude knows how to sell.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.629
The sales guy, who sold a vision, because
Mark said, this could be a million dollar

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.599
business.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.680
Parker said, no, no.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.650
This is a billion dollar idea.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.319
He [Parker] sold the vision to everybody.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.480
He came in and sold the idea.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.610
Now Mark is worth $56 billion.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.980
By the way, Sean Parker, the sales guy, is
worth $2.6 billion.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.230
You know what the Winklevoss brothers who
came up with the idea are worth?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.770
$200 million between the both of them, because
that's what they were settled with their lawsuit,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.519
$140 million and $60 million.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.519
That's what they got.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.519
The idea guys.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.879
Now of course, you're saying, Pat, at least
they're worth $200 million.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.879
Yes.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.879
I would much rather be the sales guy.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.129
Now let's go to the next example.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.129
Stay with me here.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.150
Steve Wozniak.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.560
I've interviewed Steve Wozniak many years
ago.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.189
If you haven't seen it, it's a fascinating
interview.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.680
Wozniak found a sales guy, named Steve Jobs.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.140
Steve Jobs knew how to sell.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.450
Steve Jobs had no clue what he [Wozniak] was
doing.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.000
Steve Jobs, when he worked at Atari, he would
ask him [Wozniak] to do the coding for him

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.870
because he didn't know how to do the coding.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.060
He [Wozniak] knew what he was doing.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.910
He was the idea guy.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.360
He [Jobs] was the sales guy.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.280
If he [Jobs] was alive today, his net worth
would be roughly $10 billion.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.750
I think Wozniak has $100 million - $200 million.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.180
Nothing wrong with that.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.650
Still good, but the sales guy learned how
to sell an idea to the rest of the people.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.650
McDonald Brothers.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.570
If you haven't seen the movie Founder, you've
got to watch it.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.260
These guys knew how to start a restaurant
in San Bernardino Valley, San Bernardino,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.360
which I've been to.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.631
It was an hour away from where I used to live.

00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.550
I was just there a couple of months ago.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.960
They're doing an incredible job.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.460
And one day, a guy named Ray Kroc, who's a
sales guy, is selling milkshake machines.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.550
One day he gets an order.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.080
He's in St. Louis, Missouri, he gets an order
from the McDonald Brothers, saying we need

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080
eight machines.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.440
He said, "What? is this a mistake?"

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.000
No, we need eight machines.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.230
And the guy hangs up.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.860
Ray Kroc decides to drive to San Bernardino.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.810
He goes there and says, Oh my gosh, this is
amazing.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.070
This is ridiculous.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.070
This can be something big.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.210
What if we go out there and scale this?

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.250
And what if we do this?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.520
And he starts selling it.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.380
He sold vision.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.360
He went to investors, country clubs, he sold
the vision of McDonald's.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.940
Ray Kroc.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.010
You guys know Ray Kroc.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.970
I believe he gave them $2.6 million to buy
out the name McDonald's and then after he

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.070
bought out McDonald's, guess what they couldn't
use?

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.850
Their own name, McDonald's.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.061
And Ray Kroc, the sales guy took McDonald's
to where it's at right now.

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:40.930
I think there's 38, 40,000 McDonald's around
the world.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.020
When he died, his net worth was $1.5 billion.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.810
His wife and him gave the $1.5 billion I believe
to some charity, all of it, 100% of it.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.470
That's the sales guy.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.470
Next one here.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.180
Nick Swinmurn.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.180
Nick Swinmurn.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.320
You don't know who Nick Swinmurn is.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.200
Let me tell you who Nick Swinmurn is.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.960
Nick Swinmurn is the founder of Zappos!

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.420
Holy moly.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.200
But you don't know who Nick Swinmurn is.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.390
Nick Swinmurn is the founder of Zappos and
he finds a sales guy.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.100
I guarantee you you've heard of Tony Hsieh
delivering happiness.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.790
Tony Hsieh comes in, and he says, we can turn
this thing into a monstrosity.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.790
And he does.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.250
Tony Hsieh goes from what he was worth to
now roughly shy of a billion dollars.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.250
He's around 850.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.480
By the way, Nick was smart.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480
He kept his shares.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.890
he's worth around a billion dollars today.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.080
Now, the next one.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
Martin Eberhard.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080
Do you know who Martin Eberhard is?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.890
By this time, I think you probably researched
his name to see who it is because you're so

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.890
curious, and you couldn't wait three minutes.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.450
Now let me tell you who it is, if you haven't
yet.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.860
Martin Eberhard is the original founder of
Tesla.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.490
He started Tesla.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.110
Elon Musk is not the founder.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.140
He [Eberhard] is the founder of Tesla. he
started Tesla.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.530
Elon Musk shows up.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.030
And he says, this thing can be bigger than
any one of you guys think it is.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.350
Because he sold the vision, because he's a
sales guy.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.300
He sold the vision to the world.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.990
You and I bought it.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.180
Tesla is now worth what it's worth, and Elon
Musk is worth somewhere shy of $20 billion.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.820
We're going to put his name over here.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.420
So what's my point here to you?

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.420
Oh my gosh.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.540
If I get another message with another person
telling me they got a billion dollar idea

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.080
that if I team up with them, we're going to
go out there and do this and this and that,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.080
all this other stuff.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080
Great.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.320
I like it, because I know how to sell a vision
once I buy into a product.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.550
I'm all good with this.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.090
I don't have a problem with that.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.090
But I'm talking to you.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.020
I also want you to make a lot of money.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.650
Focus on becoming an incredible sales person.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.370
Focus on communication.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.980
Focus on how to sell.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.620
Focus on looking at stuff where you can go
out there and communicate it to other people.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.360
Focus on seeing the vision of something being
able to sell a product to somebody else.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.680
When I got out of the military, I couldn't
sell anything to anybody.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.840
I couldn't sell anything to myself.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.030
I was the worst salesman in the world when
I got out of the military.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.270
I looked like a body builder because that's
what I was at that time.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.680
My body was incredibly fit at that time.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.660
But I couldn't sell a membership to anybody.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.780
I worked at Bally at Culver City.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.370
When I worked at Bally at Culver City, it
was the worst gym, from all the Ballys because

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.420
it was in a basement.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.420
The place smelled.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.420
It was old school.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.700
It was Nautilus gym, Sports Connection gym.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.710
But we worked there and the manager there
was a guy named Cisco, who was phenomenal.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.600
He knew how to sell to anybody.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.290
And one day, I'm like, I can't sell.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.290
I got to give up.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.290
I can't even go out there and do this.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.909
Cisco pulls me aside and he said the following
thing to me.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.500
He said, "Patrick, before you quit the game
of sales, I believe you can do good in sales.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.500
But I want you to do something."

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.510
I said, "What's that?"

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.380
"You need to go and learn how to sell at Fox
Hills Mall.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.420
Fox Hills Mall was a mall in Culver City,
okay?

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:50.210
So I said, "Dude, if I can't sell memberships
at a gym, with all the equipment here, and

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:55.170
it's a 36-month contract, you want me to sell
memberships at a mall when no one even sees

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.170
the gym?

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.840
And you want me to sign this 36-month contract
with credit cards?"

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840
Yes!

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840
Okay.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840
I go to Fox Hills Mall.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.770
I'm standing on my booth at Fox Hills Mall,
and I don't want to talk to anybody.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.640
I'm frightened of rejection.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.170
I don't want to talk to a single soul!

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.090
Then all of a sudden, these two other guys
I notice were around the booth.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.350
I'm behind the booth, because this is my hiding
spot, comfort zone.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.501
So slowly, I also come around the booth and
I'm still trying to stay as close to the booth

00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:21.990
because it's a safe place.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.860
I saw these guys selling a couple of memberships.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.860
I'm like, "wait a minute?

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.860
They sold a membership at the gym?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.860
That's crazy."

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.670
That person signed a 36-month contract at
the gym?

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.450
I would have never done that.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.040
Then I said, "Maybe people will buy."

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040
Then I came out.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.430
I started talking to people freely and then
all of a sudden, one girl sat down.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.910
First girl that bought a membership from me
at the gym. $75 down, $33 a month.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.630
I'll never forget this.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.090
I said, if this girl just gave me her credit
card, I can do it to everybody else.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.540
Then I started walking around the stores.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.900
Hey, have you been to Bally Culver City?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.900
How come you never bought a membership?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.900
Are you a member with us?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.900
Why not?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.870
Then all of a sudden, a month later, I became
the rookie of the month.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.330
Then I became the rookie of the year.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.380
Then I realized, I can sell, because I believe
in the product of working out.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.610
This is so easy for me!

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.740
Then the next thing was, I liked financial
services.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.150
Then I knew I could sell it.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.580
But I didn't come out with the product of
insurance.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.610
I didn't come out with the product of annuities
or stocks or bonds or mutual funds.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.370
I didn't invent those ideas.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.260
I learned how to sell.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.980
Then the idea kept getting bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.400
By the way, I'm here to tell you, the more
you focus on learning how to sell and you

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.980
improve that skill set, you are always on
demand.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.740
People always need you for the rest of your
career.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.000
Remember that.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.990
People always need a leader with sales who
sees how they can move an Army to a direction.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.770
They're always going to need someone like
that.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.790
You need to focus on mastering your skill
set and stop trying to come out with the next

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.260
Apple idea or Snapchat or Facebook or any
of that stuff that's going to turn into this

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.260
billion dollar idea.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.779
I'm not telling you don't come up with ideas.

00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:54.810
But I'm going to tell you, we got a good idea
here, with the person that knows how to sell

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.180
very well.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.310
This [the person that can sell] more than
a person who's got a ridiculous idea but has

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.310
no clue how to sell.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.370
No one's going to invest into this.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.730
This one [sales] is going to do much better
than this one [ideas].

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.930
All day, every day, twice on Sunday.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.690
So guess what my recommendation to you is?

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.770
Stop trying to be all these guys that think
they're going to come out with the next idea

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.750
that they're going to be the next Uber of
whatever.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.380
Or the next Facebook or Snapchat.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.400
Spend a year or two, work under somebody who
knows how to sell, and learn how to sell.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.670
Learn how to be an incredible communicator.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.680
Put yourself out there in front of people
that's a little bit uncomfortable.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.630
And see what happens to you in the world of
business.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.240
Because when you have to choose here, you
can choose who you want to be.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.570
Do you want to be the McDonald's brothers?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.090
Do you want to be any of these guys [ideas]?

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.670
Without these guys [sales], none of this happens.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.770
I suggest you learn how to sell.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.170
I suggest you learn how to sell and you become
the person that knows how to communicate a

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.500
product to somebody else.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.820
Anyways, you got any questions, any thoughts,
any other stories here that you know about,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.470
that you want to share that are similar to
this, comment on the bottom.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.790
If you've got any questions, thoughts, also
comment on the bottom.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.000
Take care everybody, bye bye.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.250
Hey, thanks for watching this video.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.910
Let me make a case for you why I believe you
need to subscribe to Valuetainment and also

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.450
join the notification squad.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.410
Look, there's two ways you can learn about
business.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.560
One of the ways is go to college.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.440
Learn a bunch of theories by professors who
have probably never ran a business before

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.410
or you can watch Valuetainment, ran by entrepreneurs
who have built and sold businesses and you

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.130
can learn from our mistakes and what we do
right.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:30.540
And by the way, I'm willing to bet anybody
who goes and takes this boring route vs. watches

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.120
Valuetainment, I'm putting my money on this
person who watches Valuetainment is going

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.980
to beat the person who goes to college.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.100
You don't believe me?

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.190
Test me on this.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:44.370
This is why I'm so certain you need to subscribe
to Valuetainment and learn the content so

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:51.530
you can also be a successful entrepreneur.
