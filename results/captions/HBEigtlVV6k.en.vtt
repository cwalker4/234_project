00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.335
-President Trump has been lying
about everything

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:04.603
from Paul Manafort's sentencing

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:06.239
to a meeting with
Apple CEO Tim Cook.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.675
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.845
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.348
Last week, the President's
former campaign chairman,

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.951
Paul Manafort, was sentenced
to 47 months in jail

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.520
for tax and bank fraud,
which is much less

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.391
than the 19 to 24 years
prosecutors recommended.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.359
And to justify the lenient
sentence, the judge in the case

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.095
said something
that didn't really add up.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.597
-The judge telling the court
just moments ago

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:36.101
that he believed that a sentence
of 19 to 24 years,

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:39.606
as was recommended
by the prosecutors in this case,

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.408
would be excessive
for Paul Manafort.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.210
The judge then also said --

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.178
Let me read this
for you here, Wolf.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:52.118
He said that Paul Manafort lived
an otherwise blameless life.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.853
-Well...

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:58.324
if you take out all the stuff
he's being blamed for, sure.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.960
I mean, Ted Bundy lived
an otherwise blameless life.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.397
And remember, this guy...

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.831
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.167
This guy right here
stole millions of dollars,

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.702
committed tax and bank fraud,

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.405
and, in June, he went to jail
for witness tampering,

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.106
a crime he committed

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:17.143
while he was on house arrest
for a different crime.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.545
The nicest thing
you can say about him

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.781
is that he's great
at multitasking.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.385
I bet his cellmate is going to
love his chore poster.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.252
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:29.622
And Manafort's corruption
went beyond financial crimes.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.124
He spent virtually his entire
career in Washington lobbying

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.360
on behalf of some of
the worst people in the world.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.731
-If you look at Manafort's
long history of lobbying,

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:42.101
it is about as controversial
as you can get.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.572
He has represented a gallery,

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.707
a rogue's gallery
of foreign dictators.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.743
-The firm he helped found
developed a niche,

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.078
representing a roster
of controversial

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:55.448
international clients
that has been described

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.550
as the Torturers' Lobby.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.351
-Filipino dictator Marcos,

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:03.055
Angolan guerrilla leader
Jonas Savimbi,

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.692
ousted Ukrainian president and
Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych.

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.160
-He lobbied for dictators,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.129
set up something
called the Torturers' Lobby,

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.934
and he was with Bane when they
blew up that football field.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.537
Also, let's just take a second
to note how insane

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.206
the racial disparities in our
criminal justice system are.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.274
Paul Manafort committed
tax and bank fraud

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.410
and created something
called the Torturers' Lobby

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.445
and was sentenced to less
than four years in prison.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.414
Compare that to what
a public defender in Brooklyn

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.915
tweeted last week.

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:32.351
"For context on Manafort's
47 months in prison,

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.588
my client yesterday was offered
36 to 72 months in prison

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.990
for stealing $100 worth
of quarters

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.825
from a residential
laundry room."

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:42.328
That's insane.
No one should go to jail

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.097
for stealing quarters
from a laundry room.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.633
And I'm saying that,
knowing that Donald Trump

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.069
has almost certainly stolen
quarters from a laundry room.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.605
That's why his coat
always looks like this.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:57.076
It's just...
loaded down with change.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:00.546
You know, in the summer, he has
a much harder time hiding it.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.481
[ Laughter ]

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.850
Manafort wasn't a marginal
figure in Trump's orbit.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.852
He was the President's
campaign chairman.

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.789
Just listen to that. President,
campaign, and chairman.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.724
Each one of those words
is super-important,

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.326
and yet Republicans
talk about him

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:16.596
like he was assistant TO
the regional manager.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.665
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:23.402
For example, here's what
Louisiana Senator John Kennedy

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:24.837
had to say on Sunday.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.840
-Can you answer the question,
though, on Paul Manafort?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.676
Because he was charged
with an array of felonies

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.345
because of the
special counsel's case.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.715
-Number one -- Number one,
I was surprised at his sentence.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.283
I thought it would be longer.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.652
Number two,
as I said in the past,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.088
Mr. Manafort is a grifter.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:46.759
He used to be a partner
with Roger Stone.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.630
Um, he's -- I'm sorry, Margaret.
He's just a sleazoid.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.498
-A sleazoid?

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.766
You sound like one of the guys

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.469
in Biff's gang from
"Back to the Future."

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.739
You should be wearing 3D glasses
and holding a skateboard.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.441
[ Laughter ]

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.742
Now, in sentencing Manafort,
the judge noted that the

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:06.145
specific charges in this case
were not directly related

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.381
to the question
of Russian collusion.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.683
He did not say
there was no collusion,

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.985
just that this case
was not about collusion.

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:15.855
But that didn't stop Trump
from twisting his words anyway

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.690
when he spoke to reporters
on Friday.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.193
-I feel very badly
for Paul Manafort.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:23.496
I think it's been
a very, very tough time for him.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.832
But if you notice,

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.801
both his lawyer,
a highly respected man,

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.070
and a very highly respected
judge --

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.408
The judge said there was
no collusion with Russia.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.609
This had nothing to do
with collusion.

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:40.646
There was no collusion.
It's a collusion hoax.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.782
It's a collusion witch hoax.
I don't collude with Russia.

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:45.885
-Did he just call it
a witch hoax?

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.353
[ Laughter ]

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:51.090
All of his catchphrases are
starting to blend together now.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.092
Trump has the same
diction and syntax

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:56.128
as a spam e-mail asking for
your Social Security number.

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:59.832
"Help. I need a monies
for a witch hoax."

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.867
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:06.372
Trump has this habit of
taking other people's words

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.875
out of context and insisting
those people exonerated him

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.077
when they did no such thing,
like when his former

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.913
personal lawyer, Michael Cohen,
testified before Congress.

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:16.015
Cohen said he personally
did not possess

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.950
any definitive evidence
of collusion,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.553
but Trump insisted that
what Cohen had actually said

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.155
was that there was
no collusion at all,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.290
although he couldn't seem
to make up his mind

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.325
about whether Cohen
was a liar or not.

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:28.494
-He lied a lot,
but it was very interesting,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.164
because he didn't lie
about one thing.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.099
He said no collusion
with the Russian hoax.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.502
And I said, "I wonder why he
didn't just lie about that, too,

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.870
like he did about
everything else."

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.672
I mean, he lied about
so many different things.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.608
And I was actually impressed
that he didn't say,

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.343
"Well, I think
there was collusion

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:45.878
for this reason or that."
He didn't say that.

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.981
He said, "No collusion."
And I was...

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.684
you know, a little impressed
by that, frankly.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.419
He could've --
He could've gone all-out.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.989
He only went about 95%
instead of 100%.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:02.327
-I love that Trump is impressed
that Cohen lied 95% of the time,

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:04.663
but not 100% of the time.

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:07.666
Trump talks about not lying the
way the rest of us talk about

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:09.902
those guys who climb mountains
without any equipment.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:11.437
It's like,
"Well, that's impressive.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.406
I could never do that."

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.541
Trump, of course,
is a pathological liar.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.209
His instinct is to lie
about everything

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.844
from Russian inclusion
to the smallest

00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:20.212
and most meaningless details.

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.614
In fact, here's an example
of one of the dumbest things

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:24.083
Trump has ever lied about.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.319
You might remember that last
week this clip of Trump meeting

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.522
with the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook,
went viral.

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:33.159
-You've really put a big
investment in our country.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.094
We appreciate it very much,
Tim Apple.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:40.566
-That's right.
He called him Tim Apple.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.802
Does Trump think
that when you run a company

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:45.738
you're named after the product?

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.907
-"Mr. President,
so, you know Bill Gates."

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.777
-"Uh, I believe
it's Bill Windows."

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:53.278
So, that happened last week.

00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:55.781
Now, a normal person
would have just let it go,

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.017
written it off as a slip
of the tongue, and moved on.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:00.085
But Donald Trump
is not a normal person.

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:01.953
And on Sunday,
the website Axios reported

00:07:01.953 --> 00:07:04.356
that during a meeting in Florida
with Republican donors,

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:06.492
Trump claimed the media
were spreading fake news

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.094
when they said he called
the CEO of Apple "Tim Apple."

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:11.197
Trump told the donors
that he actually said

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.432
"Tim Cook Apple" really fast

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:18.237
and the "Cook" part
of the sentence was soft.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:21.941
Okay -- of all...

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:25.411
"Tim Cook Apple" doesn't make
any more sense than "Tim Apple."

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.379
[ Laughter ]

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.382
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.686
"Tim Cook Apple" sounds like

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:37.356
how Tarzan would describe
someone making a pie.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:42.728
"Tim cook apple. Tim eat apple.
Tarzan love Tim!"

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:46.899
Second, the story you want us to
believe is that you didn't say,

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.034
"We appreciate it very much,
Tim Apple."

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:52.938
You said, "We appreciate it
very much, Tim Cook Apple."

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:56.942
If you're going to lie,
at least improve your situation.

00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:58.978
"Officer,
I have not been drinking!

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:03.549
Because I was doing
too much cocaine."

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:05.884
And even the people in the room
thought Trump's lie was bizarre.

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:07.786
According to Axios,
Republican donors in attendance

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.688
called it one of Trump's
weirdest lies ever.

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.723
"'I just thought,
why would you lie about that?'

00:08:11.723 --> 00:08:12.958
one of the donors told me.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.893
'It doesn't even matter.'"

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:17.930
No, it doesn't, but Trump lies
about stuff that doesn't matter

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.498
because he lies about
everything.

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.134
Trump lies for the same reason
Forrest Gump runs.

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.536
He just does.

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:26.272
"Lie, Forrest! Lie!"

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.405
[ Laughter ]

00:08:27.405 --> 00:08:31.544
So...when that version --

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.946
when that version of the story
didn't fly,

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.382
incredibly, Trump woke up this
morning and doubled down again,

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.918
this time with
an entirely new story.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.986
He claimed he combined
Tim Cook's name

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:43.689
and his company's name
because it was faster.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:46.025
-Trump took to Twitter, saying,

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.460
"At a recent roundtable meeting
of business executives

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.731
and long after formally
introducing Tim Cook of Apple,

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:55.668
I quickly referred
to Tim plus Apple as Tim Apple

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:58.270
as an easy way
to save time and words.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.173
The fake news was
disparagingly all over this.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.677
And it became yet another
bad Trump story."

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.044
-Only Trump could claim

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.947
that he was trying
to save time and words

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:11.383
by writing a long tweet
that takes up time and words.

00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:13.218
You know, if you really wanted
to save time and words,

00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:14.687
you could just not talk at all.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.856
Do all your campaign rallies
with duct tape over your mouth,

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.325
or at least skip a bunch of
words so it sounds like this.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:23.596
-We have won,
and I am very totally crazy.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.731
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:33.005
-Of course,
the best part of all of this

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:36.808
is that Trump now has to double
down and do it to everyone.

00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:39.678
"Oh, there's my friend
Elon Tesla.

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:42.748
Oh, if it isn't Steven Movies!

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.584
And there's my buddy,
Paul Crimes."

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.520
[ Laughter ]

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.355
Everyone...

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.356
Everyone in Trump's orbit
is a habitual liar.

00:09:51.356 --> 00:09:53.525
They lie about everything
from the dumbest things

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:54.926
to the most important things.

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:57.596
Just take Erik Prince.
He's an informal Trump advisor

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.298
and the former CEO of the
mercenary company Blackwater.

00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:01.900
Prince testified under oath
to Congress

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.902
that he had no official role
in the Trump campaign,

00:10:03.902 --> 00:10:06.271
but in an interview last week,
he admitted that he was present

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.240
at a secret Trump Tower meeting
in 2016

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.542
with emissaries of
several foreign governments.

00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:13.045
And in the interview,
he claimed that he hadn't lied

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.880
to Congress,
even though he obviously did.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.249
-How come you didn't mention
that meeting to Congress,

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.418
given it's so relevant
to their investigation?

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:20.886
-Uh, I did.

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:23.823
As part of the investigations,
I certainly disclosed

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:25.691
any meetings,
the very, very few I had.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:28.260
-Not in the Congressional
testimony you gave to the House.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.329
We went through it.
You didn't mention anything

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:32.164
about August 2016 meeting
in Trump Tower.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.234
They specifically asked you
what context you had, and
you didn't answer that.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:37.269
-I don't believe
I was asked that question.

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.172
-I've got the transcript
of the conversation here.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:42.207
-Sure. I might have been --
I think I was

00:10:42.207 --> 00:10:44.977
at Trump headquarters or the
campaign headquarters, maybe --

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.980
-Trump Tower.
August 3, 2016. You?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.782
Don't you think that's something
important to disclose to the

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.350
House Intelligence Committee
while you're under oath?

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.618
-I did.
-You didn't.

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.119
We just went through
the testimony.

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:56.755
There's no mention of the Trump
Tower meeting, August 2016.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:58.023
Why not?

00:10:58.023 --> 00:10:59.925
-I don't know if they got
the transcript wrong.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.027
-Damn.
Soon he's going to go from

00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:04.296
"I wasn't asked that question"
to "the transcript was wrong"

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:07.366
to "I was just trying
to save time and words."

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:09.735
Trump lying about the dumbest
things is revealing because it

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.970
shows that he and his associates
will lie about anything,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.839
from Paul Manafort
to Russian collusion

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.641

favorite company...
