00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.690
I'm walking

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.240
in the most beautiful neighborhood in the
 District of Columbia

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.900
it's a neighborhood where I'm privileged to
 live but it's an unfamiliar walk

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.609
my car is broken

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.300
it's about 9pm, streets are 
mostly deserted

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.830
when I get about three blocks from home

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.330
a police car

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.990
slows down

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.990
I keep walking and the car makes a right
 turn and circles the block and meets me.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.830
There are three cops inside

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.400
their greeting is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.580
"Do you live around here?"

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.520
I've been in this place before

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.920
I know that that's going to be the 
beginning

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.839
not the end of a long series of questions 
that I don't feel like answering, “Where do you live?"

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.140
"Kind of cold to be walking...can I see some 
I_D_?"

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.930
So I ask a question instead

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.620
"Why do you want to know."

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.860
The three officers exchanged a glance

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.110
the glance is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.740
"We got a smart ass on our hands..."

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.150
I get that a lot.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.970
"Is it against the law," I  asked, "to walk on the 
sidewalk if I don't live around here?"

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.760
They don't say anything, I say, "Have a 
nice evening officers," and head towards

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.020
home

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.700
So the police do this move that 
probably isn't technically called cat and mouse

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.590
but that's kind of what it is.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.070
They park their car

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.060
on the side of the road, they turn off
 their lights and they watch me walk, when I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.210
pass out of their range of vision they
 scoot up to where they can see me

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.100
and this way we arrive on the block 
where I live.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.490
I have a question

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.369
and so I stopped

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.130
'cause for once I have the power to summon
 the police immediately, quicker even

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.860
than the President of the United States who lives about

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.350
uh... two miles down the road.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200
Sure enough, as soon as I stop

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.350
car comes right up to me

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.630
and the police

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.990
officers and I have this conversation
 which consists mostly of questions

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.839
"Why are you following me?"

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.959
"Why won't you tell us where you live?"

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.719
"What made you stop me?"

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.899
"We don't see a lot of people walking in
 this neighborhood."

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:21.769
"Are you following me because I'm black?"

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.659
"No, we're black too."

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.749
That answer is true.

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.400
It's true but it's not responsive.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.349
I ask the officers have they ever been

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.039
followed around

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.190
and they say yes

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.529
but it doesn't bother them because they
 know that they haven't done anything.

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.179
They say they're suspicious 'cause they know everyone who lives in the neighborhood

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.279
and they don't know me, they don't see people 
walking in the neighborhood 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.249
what am I doing here.

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.879
I say, "Do you know who lives there?"

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.699
and I point to my house

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:58.309
and they say yes, we do. 
(laughter in background)

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.980
And so I walk

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.709
I walk up my stairs

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.430
I sit on my porch

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.729
and I wait.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:10.629
I wait because I'm a professor of
 criminal procedure.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.249
I wait because I remember the last time

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.849
with different officers

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.829
when I cooperated

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.859
that was on sixteenth street

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.899
They asked to search my car

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:29.769
I said yes

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.869
so that's what they did, or rather, one 
searched while the other watched me

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.599
with his hand resting on his gun

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.729
on sixteenth street

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:40.620
cars

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.339
zooming by

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:47.209
I pretended like I was invisible.

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.689
So now the officers park their car and 
position its spotlight on my face

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.869
all three of them join me on my porch

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:56.089
"Do you live here?" Yes.

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.909
"Can we see some I_D_?" No you may not.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.019
During the antebellum period of our
 nation's history

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.220
if you were black

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.179
you had to carry proof

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.739
of your status slave or

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.769
free at all times

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.959
Any black who was not supervised by a
 white was suspect.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.239
In North Carolina to make it easier for 
law enforcement

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.169
non-slave blacks

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.300
had to wear shoulder patches with the word "free"

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.389
The District of Columbia through its three 
officers sitting on my porch say,

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.699
"If you live here go inside

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.929
it's too cold to be outside."

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:37.979
I say, "I'm fine where I am."

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.280
Police say so are they

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.780
they won't leave

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.400
until I either produce some I_D_

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.080
or enter the house.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.400
This ladies and gentlemen is where the story 
gets surreal.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.509
I'd been working late because I was 
writing a book review for the Harvard Law 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.009
Review

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.129
The book, which I am carrying in my knapsack is race, 
crime and the law

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.110
by Randall Kennedy

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.319
Since, apparently none of us have anything 
better to do

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.159
I take the book out

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.490
and I say, “I'm going to answer your question about why

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.039
if I haven't done anything

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.409
this bothers me.”

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.230
So there's a quote from Skip Gates

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.280
Skip Gates knew about racial 
profiling a long time before it happened

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.099
to him in Cambridge

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.400
and he says, now this is what I'm reading to the police in nineteen ninety seven,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.569
"Blacks in particular black men swap
 their experiences of police 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:34.480
encounters like

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.020
war stories

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.620
and there are few who don't
 have more than one story to tell."

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.259
and Skip goes on to talk about driving while black and I tell the cops that this is the first time

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.259
I've ever heard of

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.639
walking while black.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.759
I have this big picture window in my house

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.300
I point and say, "I stand in that window; I see people

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.099
walking all the time

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.439
and I never see white people get stopped.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.240
and that's why I'm not going to show
 them my identification.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.419
This is not South Africa, this is not 
antebellum North Carolina and I don't

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.289
need a pass card.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.509
The cops are getting mad

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.659
they say there have been burglaries in my
 neighborhood and car vandalism;

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.219
the police are just doing their job

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.429
and what I'm doing

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:20.750
I'm wasting taxpayer money

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.900
so one cop says, "He must be homeless," the
 other one thinks that I'm on drugs

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.969
The thing that they're certain of is that

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.699
I don't live

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.509
in the house on whose porch I sit

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.929
and they say, when they find out who 
I really am

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:38.249
I'm going to be guilty of unlawful entry, 
a misdemeanor.

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:41.379
Uh... the sergeant tells me that since I'm being evasive she's gonna interview

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.399
my neighbors

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.619
the two officers who

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.289
remain there with me radio for backup.

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:55.830
uh... they give the dispatcher the 
wrong address and I correct them (laughter in background)

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.860
soon, a second patrol car with more officers
 arrives so, it was cold

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.919
but I'm stubborn.

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.810
uh... finally my neighbor comes out

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.080
and identifies me.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.340
I'm free now

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.560
free to be left alone

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.869
free to walk on a public
 street

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:16.969
free to sit on my porch

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:23.969
even if it's cold.

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.259
If I had a T_V_ show

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.969
I would say, "kids, don't try this at home."

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:34.360
It's unfortunate, but a lot of other uppity

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.629
black people have gotten themselves
 shot for less than what I did

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:40.730
but one reason I

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.259
felt safer with these cops is because 
they were African-American

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.040
uh... I don't think that they construed me as a violent person, they thought

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.320
that I was homeless or that I was on drugs but they didn't think that I was a

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.529
threat to them, that's not what they communicated

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:57.989
uh... one reason I was angry at the cops

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:00.229
is because they were African-American

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.509
they should have known better

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:04.619
so

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:09.120
before we go inside the cops and me, we
all look at my neighbor

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.999
like he can tell us the moral of the story

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:14.589
What are you supposed to learn…

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:15.870
He's black

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.569
like us

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:20.880
he says he's always happy to see the
police patrolling

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.369
our neighborhood

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.379
but he says there are a lot of
white people who walk late at night

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:27.909
and they're not questioned about

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:30.360
their right to be there.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.500
He tells the cops that they’re always
welcome to stop by his house for coffee

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.730
and then he goes home.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.780
The sergeant invites me to a crime
prevention meeting at the police station

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.520
in a few weeks

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.910
and then the five

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.050
officers get into their two cars

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:46.930
and drive away.
