ALLEGATIONS? &gt;&gt; I THINK WHEN MOST PEOPLE

00:06:58.423 --> 00:06:59.723 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK OF RACKETEERING, THEY

00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:00.624 line:92%
THINK OF RACKETEERING, THEY THINK OF THE MOB.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:04.127 line:92%
THINK OF THE MOB. IN 1970 THE PURPOSE WAS TO

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:05.795 line:92%
IN 1970 THE PURPOSE WAS TO INFILTRATE ORGANIZED MOB.

00:07:05.797 --> 00:07:07.631 line:92%
INFILTRATE ORGANIZED MOB. SINCE THEN PROSECUTORS HAVE USED

00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:08.999 line:92%
SINCE THEN PROSECUTORS HAVE USED THE STATUTE TO FOCUS ON

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.001 line:92%
THE STATUTE TO FOCUS ON INSTANCES WHERE THERE’S A

00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:12.503 line:92%
INSTANCES WHERE THERE’S A PATTERN OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON

00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:16.306 line:92%
PATTERN OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTERPRISE.

00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:18.241 line:92%
BEHALF OF THAT ENTERPRISE. SO THIS IS NOT JUST --

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:19.510 line:92%
SO THIS IS NOT JUST -- &gt;&gt; A PATTERN, SOMETHING THAT CAN

00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:20.411 line:92%
&gt;&gt; A PATTERN, SOMETHING THAT CAN BE REPLICATED.

00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:21.211 line:92%
BE REPLICATED. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:22.813 line:92%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT FEELS A LITTLE

00:07:22.814 --> 00:07:24.548 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT FEELS A LITTLE MORE LIKE INDUSTRY THAN A

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:24.915 line:92%
MORE LIKE INDUSTRY THAN A ONE-OFF.

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:26.250 line:92%
ONE-OFF. &gt;&gt; IT’S A GREAT TOOL FOR

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:27.718 line:92%
&gt;&gt; IT’S A GREAT TOOL FOR PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE BOTH STATE

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.353 line:92%
PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL CRIMES TOGETHER.

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:32.056 line:92%
AND FEDERAL CRIMES TOGETHER. SO THE CRIME OF RACKETEERING IS

00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:34.492 line:92%
SO THE CRIME OF RACKETEERING IS A FEDERAL CRIME BUT IT’S THE

00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:36.560 line:92%
A FEDERAL CRIME BUT IT’S THE UNDERLYING CRIMINAL ACTS CAN BE

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.661 line:92%
UNDERLYING CRIMINAL ACTS CAN BE STATE CRIMES THAT WOULD BE

00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:38.929 line:92%
STATE CRIMES THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR FEDERAL

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.763 line:92%
DIFFERENT FOR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TO OTHERWISE CHARGE.

00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:41.165 line:92%
PROSECUTORS TO OTHERWISE CHARGE. THIS IS A WAY OF BRINGING

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:44.068 line:92%
THIS IS A WAY OF BRINGING TOGETHER A VARIETY OF DISCREET

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:47.071 line:92%
TOGETHER A VARIETY OF DISCREET CRIMES, PUTTING THEM UNDER THE
