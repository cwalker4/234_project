00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:09.449
Right now the world economy stands at an alarming precipice, but would it surprise you to learn that the events of today are nothing new

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.069
Give me the next few minutes and I'll show you that there are

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.969
Cycles to history that can not only allow you to see the future but to make preparations for the very predictable outcomes

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.390
You're about to discover that huge financial

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.199
gyrations inflation loss of personal freedom and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.079
Out-of-control government are all things that we have been warned about for centuries and are the direct

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.640
Consequences of the monetary system itself. In fact most world history is determined by monetary history

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.329
So what lessons can we take from the past to help us navigate the perfect economic storm that awaits us

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.640
Debasing a nation's currency supply to pay for public works and war is a pattern that just repeats and repeats

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.279
Throughout history and it's a pattern that always ends badly in this double episode

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.399
We are going to create a timeline to show the similarities between ancient Rome and the United States today

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.720
Just like the USA Rome started out as a republic after

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.479
Overthrowing a monarchy. So let's begin with their early economy in around 500 BC

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.939
In the early days of the Roman Republic for the first

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.869
178 years there's no evidence of big inflation

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.189
They were using gold and silver coinage mostly as their currency small denominations were made out of copper and bronze

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770
Then Hannibal of Carthage

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.319
Starts to harass Rome in something called the second Punic War and to pay for this war

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.830
they did deficit spending by taking the coins that they took in in taxes melting them down and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:03.110
Adding cheap and abundant base metals such as copper so that they could mint more coins. This caused a big inflation and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.970
The inflation was one of the factors that brought the Roman Republic down to a dictatorship the Roman Empire

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.300
Most of Rome's gold and silver was stored in vaults under the floor of their Treasury

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.480
Which was also known as the temple of Saturn if you visit Rome go to the forum in the center of the city

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.959
where you can still find the ruins of the temple today and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
Here's something I found really interesting

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.150
The US Treasury in Washington DC has almost exactly the same design

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.219
So now let's start filling in our timeline of events to keep track of the major similarities between Rome and the USA

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.889
We just learned that the early Roman Republic enjoyed a long period of practically no inflation

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.820
Because they used sound money pure gold and silver

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.420
Interestingly the United States started on the same path from the late 1700s to the early

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.710
1900s prices were very stable

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.960
Thanks to laws that mandated the use of gold and silver as money and our people were not robbed by inflation

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:22.270
But in both instances it was the ongoing debasement of the money for war spending and Public Works that led to economic chaos

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.190
Tell us the parallels between Rome and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.130
What's happening in the United States today?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.640
Well, they obviously two very different societies, but there are some broad parallels Rome was a republic

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.889
They made sure they had two people each year. Who were the the rulers the consuls?

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.010
They always changed because the Romans were worried. They'd had a monarchy before very unpopular

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.809
They overthrew it so they didn't want anyone getting too much - too many powers

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.989
What did in Rome no surprise?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.810
excessive taxation and

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.209
debasing the money

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.280
when you look at the coinage it started out being an exact measure of copper for the Cistercian and silver for the denarii and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.160
By the time it was all over worth. Absolutely

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.739
Nothing with perhaps a wash of silver to make it look like the original thing, which is exactly what we're doing now

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.109
So this patterns repeat themselves?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.180
They always repeat themselves

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.809
The Romans were the first culture to understand that a currency maintains its value because of its rarity

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.969
Julius Paulus once said this device being officially promulgated

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.250
Circulates and maintains its purchasing power not so much from its substance as from its quantity

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.009
Even still the Romans never stopped churning out more currency just like the USA Today and the ancient Greeks before them

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.288
But in their race to debase the Romans came up with some new twists of their own

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.519
The first of these twists was coin clipping

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.549
Whenever a Roman would enter a government building, they'd simply clipped the edge off of their gold or silver coin

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.510
they would save up all of those clippings melt them down and mint more coins expanding the currency supply and

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.659
when that wasn't enough they developed the art of

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.729
revaluation where you just take a coin and you stamp a new value on it you got

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
1/100

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280
That simple

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.580
The move away from

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.699
precious metals to

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.539
Something less than precious metals and the Roman Empire famously clipped their coins

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.749
This was a debasement of the currency. There wasn't a paper currency, but it was a debasement of the currency in the US

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.588
There's a very interesting phenomenon going on where they're not clipping coins

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:58.119
But when you go to the supermarket you find that the portions of the items at the supermarket on sale are shrinking, you know

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.399
The servings on various other consumer products are getting smaller and smaller, but this price is the same

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:08.859
So it's very similar to that old Roman coin clipping trick from 2,000 years ago

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.849
It's it's another form of currency debasement, but it's hidden through cardboard and marketing and fancy presentation

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.149
But the people are nevertheless having their currency to baste

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.339
So why should you care about this the quality of a society is directly proportional to the quality of its money

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.439
Stable money leads to stable prices which leads to a stable society

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.569
whereas debasement of the currency leads to the demise of empires

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:47.679
The major reason for Rome's ongoing currency debasement was to pay for their ever-expanding empire and never-ending Wars

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.588
The precious metals content of their coinage fell further and further until it had next to no

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.179
Connection with the pure gold and silver that had initially provided them with a stable economy

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.869
Cut to today and we see the same pattern

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:08.859
up until the outbreak of World War one the United States had very high levels of precious metals in its coinage and

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.028
Treasury notes were backed by gold at a one-to-one ratio

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.679
From there the USA debased its currency more and more

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:22.449
to pay for World War 2 the Korean War and then the Vietnam War until

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:26.859
Finally the link between gold and the US dollar was severed completely

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.369
For those new to the series, let's revisit

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.129
The pivotal event that has managed to sneak under the radar of modern historians as nothing more than a side note

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:43.569
Even though it will have repercussions for generations to come. It was an unprecedented act of global debasement by a

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.459
Wanna be Emperor that would make any Roman ruler. Hang his head in shame

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.389
Most people think that President Nixon's criminal activities were limited to

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:01.419
Wiretapping and spying on the competition, but his greatest crime came on, August 15th

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.339
1971 when he severed the last ties between the dollar and gold when he ended the Bretton Woods system. I

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:17.740
Have directed secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.599
Except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interest of the United States

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.500
The Bretton Woods system tied all of the world's currencies to gold through the US dollar but instead of running out and hanging the guy

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.089
when he took as the world off of gold the world just yawned and

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.940
Accepted that we were now on a fiat currency system that we were now on this infinitely

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:50.409
Expanding system that we no longer had money we had currency

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.440
Money should be a fixed measure of value. It's like

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.799
5,280 feet in a mile or

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.939
12 inches in a foot I gave the example

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.580
Imagine trying to build a house a twenty five hundred square feet if the foot changed each day

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.339
It was 12 inches one day 10 the next 20 the next very hard to do if that's changing

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.589
Well the center or the clock

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.150
The the 60 minutes in an hour imagine if they floated the clock

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.539
So it's 60 minutes an hour one day 30 the next 90

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.370
The next you shouldn't have to have had just rivers futures to figure out how many hours you're working. You're baking a cake

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.730
I love this example

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.089
And it says that bake the batter for 45 minutes then you have to figure out is that inflation adjusted minutes?

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.430
Is it a California minute a Nevada minute just makes life infinitely complicated

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.940
So when you have a fixed measure

00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:53.199
When you go to the market you assume if you're getting 16 ounces of liquid, it's 16 not 13, not 18

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:58.329
Just makes a con which is the source of wealth people doing things with each other

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.880
infinitely easier

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.850
It is very odd

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.729
That we've established a situation where what people do is scramble to borrow liabilities

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.570
certainly

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.780
I guess the most attractive

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.070
Liability in the world or put a different way the most attractive free-trading lie on the planet is the US dollar

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.440
We joke an investment conferences

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.940
It's the worst currency in the world, except all the others if you're gonna trade it in a lie, it better be a liquid lie

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.589
What the United States dollar has going for it is the most liquid lie in the world

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.320
I mean if you think about the advantage that we have now, yes, it's

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:42.070
It's a horrible thing to do morally but what we do is amazing. It's amazing that we can get away with this

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.559
we print a lie a

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:51.039
dream on a piece of paper and we ship it to Brazil and they send us coffee and we ship the same lie to

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:56.529
Germany and they send us a Mercedes and we ship the same Y to Japan and they shipped us a stereo

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.030
It's actually a pretty cool deal

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.889
I mean, I feel bad about it in the sense, but it's it's grandly amusing and a sort of a cosmic sense

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:10.120
You just need to understand that somehow some time some way. There's going to be a reckoning

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:18.189
The dollars involved a worldwide as a major currency, so it's one half of everything we do and

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:25.360
It has no definition. I used to get a charge out of asking Bernanke and Greenspan had define a dollar and you know

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.519
They can't define a dollar they you know in the old days

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.429
It was a weight the weight of silver a weight of gold and and that's what it was supposed to be according to the Constitution

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:41.350
Well, dr. McCracken not being an economist, can you explain to me briefly how in the world do you determine?

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:46.420
What a value of a dollar is in relation to a French franc for instance

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.049
If you can't convert that dollar into gold what standard do you have? What is it worth at all?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.449
You determine that's going to be determined in the marketplace just as really largely it has already

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:01.210
So what is this going to do then to for instance the speculator in gold. How is this going to affect him?

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.760
Is that price going to drop arise the?

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.239
The official price of gold of course has not been changed

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.870
That was not that was not a part of this program at all nor is that contemplated?

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:19.329
Well, maybe they should have contemplated what was likely to happen because for anyone who had studied history the outcome was perfectly clear

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.440
Rather than help the economy

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.400
Nixon's actions made things a lot worse and the public started feeling the effects of inflation much more acutely

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.370
It was hard for savers to keep their heads above water unless they had saved in the ultimate stores of value

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.690
gold and silver

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.869
Just as it had always done throughout history

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:44.529
Gold once again accounted for the expanding fiat currency supply by rising in price to cover that supply

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200
Gold had done this as recently as

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:55.179
1934 when the USA's debasement really started heating up and gold was revalued from 20 dollars and 67 cents an ounce to

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.140
$35 an ounce

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:02.830
Now the process began again as the public bid the price up from $35 an ounce in

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.499
1971 climbing all the way to

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.259
850 dollars an ounce in 1980

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:16.270
Easily accounting for the massive quantities of currency the USA had conjured out of thin air now that Nixon had removed all restrictions

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.100
Gold had once again held an out of control currency to answer

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:29.309
Getting back to the Julius Paulus quote about the value of a currency being decided by the quantity rather than the content

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:31.150
one of the biggest economic

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:37.349
Hurdles that mankind repeatedly trips on is that we have never been able to control the quantity of currency

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:43.890
And this is one of the reasons why gold has always been the ultimate money. It can't be printed and it keeps us in check

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.499
Today, I think cryptocurrencies are a very exciting development and have tremendous

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:56.490
possibilities the bottom line is that governments have a long history of trying to cheat gold either through the basement or

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:03.089
manipulation of the markets but here's the thing in the end gold always wins and

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.570
That brings us back to the Romans who went through many cycles of currency debasement for war spending

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:17.279
Then inflation being felt by the public then revaluation of the currency then more debasement for deficit spending on war

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.739
resulting in even more inflation being felt by the public the cycle repeated again and again

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:29.640
Those who were able to hold gold outside the official system maintained their purchasing power those who did not

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:37.709
Suffered greatly in two 70 AD Emperor aurelion took power and had the now worthless official coinage recalled and minted again

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:44.250
To contain a small amount of silver just 5% this Act brought a new vitality to Rome

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:50.820
But unfortunately, it was short-lived as government after government gave in to the temptation of spending beyond their means

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:56.400
Eventually wars were funded by levying huge taxes on businesses and the rich

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:04.919
This only had the effect of closing down many essential businesses. The more meddling the government did with the economy the worse things became

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.529
The government started confiscating private property by force to fill their empty state coffers

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.830
Rome was sliding into ruin and

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:17.339
That brings us to Emperor Diocletian

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:26.520
His actions are the first recorded example of the following hidden secret of money wage and price controls do not work

00:15:27.089 --> 00:15:33.529
He came to power as inflation was surging but his decisive actions only added fuel to the fire

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:37.159
So because the economy was getting worse and worse

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:43.669
Diocletian created a whole bunch of great government solutions. He created a bunch of works projects

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.920
he hired he hired a bunch of the homeless and

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.950
People that were unemployed made them soldiers and government employees and this caused

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.159
deficit spending to just go out of control an

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:59.569
inflation raged into what is known as the first documented hyperinflation

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:03.739
So to get inflation under control in 301 ad

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.700
Diocletian issued his infamous edict of prices

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.800
this was a massive volume of a

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.479
List of all of the wages and the prices people could charge for goods and services

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.719
And it was all enforced under the penalty of death

00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:24.889
So what happened was instead of risking your life to sell something at a profit so that you could stay in business

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.350
People just closed up shop

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.700
Instead of doing a job that was listed in the book. That was below a living wage

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.859
People quit their chosen career and tried to pursue a job that wasn't listed in the book

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:43.909
The result of this was the Diocletian came out with a law that said every son had to go into his father's business

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.250
under the penalty of death

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:52.759
When governments start meddling with an economy. The result is always the same

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:59.148
Prices become distorted. This is a huge danger because prices act as a signal for an economy

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:02.899
They indicate to producers and buyers where true value lies

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.510
The outcome is always

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.779
economic turmoil shortages and black markets

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.369
We've seen what happened to gold when Nixon started his economic interference

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.419
so now let's go back and see what happened when Diocletian started his

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Jumbo-sized meddling with the economy

00:17:21.449 --> 00:17:28.519
We know when Diocletian created the Edict of crisis that the price of gold was fifty thousand

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.429
Denarii per pound and then we also know

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:39.929
From transaction receipts around fifty years later. The price of gold has risen to 1 billion two hundred million denarii pound

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.869
That's a forty-two thousand four hundred percent

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:50.669
Hyperinflation over a 50-year period that would be similar to if gold was $35 an ounce

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.010
50 years ago today

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:59.519
One ounce of gold would be about a million and a half dollars. Another analogy that I can make is

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.459
If an average family car was about two thousand dollars fifty years ago

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.599
Today it would be selling for eighty five million dollars

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.579
Just imagine 85 million on the windshield of a car at a car lot

00:18:15.309 --> 00:18:18.449
That's the type of inflation these poor people suffered through

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.449
Well weigh wage and price controls

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.499
Appends an economy gives more power to the government

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.179
What are price controls?

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:33.089
Prices are supposed to convey information. That's what markets are about knowledge and information

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.919
So a price will tell you something is dear Oh get out and produce more

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.579
The price is low. It may be a producer of producing too many of it. So it's a way of conveyance of information

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:51.870
so you devote your efforts to something that people want not what a bureaucrat dictates so when governments trashed the money and

00:18:52.659 --> 00:18:55.319
Your prices nominal prices are going up

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:02.130
The government responses. Oh, they're greedy speculators or merchants or whatever and so USA

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.539
You can't charge as much or what?

00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:09.839
That means is you get a black market and you hurt the production of the thing the idea that government can substitute

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:14.009
For people interacting among themselves is preposterous

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:21.030
This pattern of failed price controls is something we see throughout history and across the globe

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:28.919
Skip forward over 1,500 years and governments still hadn't learned their lesson during the chaos of the French Revolution the government

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.969
Issued a set of wage and price controls known as the law of maximum also imposed under the penalty of death

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.409
It's worth noting that when wage and price controls are implemented

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.880
Government always tries to deflect attention away from the problems that it has created

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:50.609
Itself by shifting the focus to businesses who are labeled as greedy hoarders or priced gougers

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.470
In reality most are just average people trying to keep their business afloat

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.970
Doing their best to deal with the unstable supply and demand curve

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.199
Created by government meddling and France was no exception to this blame game

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:12.509
During the law of maximum many innocent people were executed food shortages developed and black markets ruled until finally

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.900
fifteen months later

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:21.660
The Act was repealed because it didn't work and all the stored up energy of government manipulation was unleashed at once

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.769
Leading to a further period of chaos and inflation for France

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:31.560
I agree with steve forbes the idea of wage and price controls is absolutely preposterous

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.969
Now we'll skip forward another 200 years and government was added again

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:43.920
Many people don't realize that Nixon's speech from 1971 also included the announcement of a 90 day wage and price freeze

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:52.050
The United States was suffering from big inflation. Thanks to deficit spending for the Vietnam War silver had been taken out of circulation in

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:59.579
1965 reducing our coinage to worthless flex of base metal and the paper currency supply had been expanded greatly

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.630
Did that sound familiar?

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:08.430
Just like Diocletian Nixon's team of economic boffins thought they could curb inflation by fixing wages and prices

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:17.520
The time has come for decisive action action that will break the vicious circle of spiraling prices and costs. I

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.750
am today ordering a freeze on all

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.310
Prices and wages throughout the United States for a period of 90 days

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.810
Working together we will break the back of inflation

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.160
You'd think that these people would learn from history, but they don't

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.349
To get an idea of how out of touch the men with their hands on the economic levers were

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.820
Listen to what Nixon's adviser had to say about the duration of the controls

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.420
would it be your

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:52.229
anticipation that it would take more than 90 days to break the back of inflation as the president put it tonight that

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.579
There would have to be a further extension of an actual wage price freeze. I

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.380
Would not know I wouldn't I don't think one can say that

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.940
It will necessarily take longer

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.729
where we're sailing to some extent and an uncharted see here, but this

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.930
This I think is is a reasonable estimate of the time that's going to be required

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.110
Dan Rather

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:27.140
President Nixon is expected to speak for about 15 minutes on his new economic policies

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.090
The president's address tonight comes against a background of the following facts among others

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:40.129
record high gold prices and rapidly increasing cost of living figures for most Americans the wholesale price index rose by

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.650
2.1 percent during the month of May

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:48.949
The index of industrial commodities in the last three months has risen at an annual rate of fifteen point nine percent

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.099
The worst since the Korean War twenty years ago

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.900
All of that part of the general background of the president's remarks tonight

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:03.469
Every American family is confronted with a real and pressing problem of higher prices

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:10.820
And I have decided that the time has come to take strong and effective action to deal with that problem

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.369
Effective immediately therefore I am ordering a freeze on prices

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:22.550
This freeze will hold prices at levels. No higher than those charged during the first eight days of June

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.389
It will cover all prices paid by consumers

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.780
What was our effort how were dad signs saying?

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:35.630
What kind of an idiot would do the same thing over and over expecting it expect different results each time?

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:43.219
And it's the same pattern. It's happened to prepend li cycle after cycle after cycle after cycle for thousands of years

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.980
country borrows itself into bankruptcy

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:52.820
It creates more money to try to pay its debt prices go up people rebel the whole system falls apart

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.950
And I'm scared about it

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.320
Country's collapse over this they go to war about this kind of thing rebellion in the street

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:07.879
Overthrows a government the whole nine yards there is nothing to be gained from inflation and everything to lose and we're going to lose everything

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.829
Around the world people don't seem to realize that government intervention always makes things worse

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:22.859
It's the government manipulating things whenever you manipulate something and try and control it over here

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.359
And and not allow the free markets to balance everything all by themselves

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.619
Something comes squirting out way over here that you just don't expect

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.159
for instance the dot-com bubble popped in

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:42.749
2000 Alan Greenspan lowered interest rates to try and get the stock markets back up again, and he accidentally created a real estate bubble

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.750
That's now devastating the world

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.439
Beck during World War 1 they inflated the currency supply tremendously

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.950
The Federal Reserve was born just at the beginning of World War one

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.000
we added to the currency supply by adding bonds to our

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.650
back our currency along with gold then there was this big

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.929
It's called the Depression of 1921. It's the single greatest

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.530
Deflation that the US has ever seen it's bigger than the Great Depression the contraction of the currency

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.819
Supply was huge. The reason nobody knows about the depression of 1921

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:22.770
they're they only know of the stock market crash of 29 and the Great Depression is

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:31.380
Because the government did not rush in to save us the Federal Reserve didn't try to suddenly lower interest rates down to zero

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:39.629
They didn't manipulate the free markets. They let the free markets work. It was horrible for a year. There were bankruptcies and foreclosures

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.270
People lost homes and things like that

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.720
but the bankruptcies and the businesses that that

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:51.480
folded there were new businesses that were more efficient that grew up to take their place and

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.260
when a home gets foreclosed on it gets resold to somebody else and

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.859
yes, it was horrible, but the people that were

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.289
leveraged out are the people that weren't in full control of their finances or the

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.000
Inefficient businesses that were just hanging on by a thread anyway, yeah, they went under

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:17.459
but because the government didn't rush in to save us and the Federal Reserve didn't try and manipulate the economy the free markets healed at

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.529
All and in 18 months was a memory

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:25.080
In fact, 10 years later. Nobody could even remember the memory it was gone

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.369
Mark Twain is often quoted as saying history doesn't repeat

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.589
But it sure does rhyme and as you've seen from this episode that sure rings true

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:45.480
the wage and price controls we will probably end up trying this in the United States sometime in the future and you know

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.290
They tried it during Diocletian. It didn't work. It destroys the economy and eventually they have to repeal the Act

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.920
They tried it during the French Revolution. It didn't work

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.020
It ruins the economy and they have to repeal it Nixon tried it it didn't work

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.609
It ruined the economy and they had to repeal it. It's not gonna work the next time they try it

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.320
This stuff just keeps on happening

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.080
Over and over and over again and part of it is caused by the four-year election cycle

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.930
all of the

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:23.940
Politicians are worried about what's going to happen on their watch and they push all the problems forward to them to the next administration

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:30.269
They really don't care what's going to happen out in the future. They care what's happening. You know how they're remembered

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:35.490
So I'm expecting this to happen in the United States sometime right now

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.540
I'm expecting a deflation, but when we get to big inflation or hyperinflation

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:44.670
You can pretty much count on the fact that they're going to make the same stupid mistakes

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.780
Because politicians do not read monetary history

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:59.299
This is just the beginning of the similarities between ancient Rome and the USA in the next episode

00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:04.158
we're going to focus on some more amazing events that are echoing throughout history to today and

00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:12.318
We'll see what the future holds for the United States if we continue down the same path so many societies have gone before

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.580
You
