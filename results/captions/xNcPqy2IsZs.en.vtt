willing to walk away like that.

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.585 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; He loves cassie.

00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:09.788 line:92%
Oh, the tears last night from

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.323 line:92%
Colton, really changed the way

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.158 line:92%
we look at the bachelor forever.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:13.592 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
What a night.

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:14.993 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; What a night.

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:16.361 line:92%
Welcome to "Access live."

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:18.864 line:92%
Bachelor nation's Ashley.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.666 line:92%
We got some unpacking to do.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.200 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
The tears.

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:23.501 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; The tears.

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:28.406 line:92%
&gt;&gt; First of all, I like this new format.

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:31.176 size:88% position:44% line:92%
It feels more authentic.

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:32.561 size:84% position:42% line:92%
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:34.012 line:92%
Could this be the new thing?

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.847 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I don't know, could it be the

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:36.815 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
new thing?

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.133 line:92%
Yeah, it takes the pressure of

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.518 line:92%
proposing at the end of it it

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:41.519 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
off now.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.522 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Look at Colton.

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.192 line:92%
&gt;&gt; The asterisk with no hope.

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:49.361 line:92%
I don't know how I feel about

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:50.262 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
fantasy suite.

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:52.864 line:92%
The whole season we teased, the

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:53.832 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
virgin bachelor.

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:57.068 line:92%
Will he lose his virginity?

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:01.406 line:92%
&gt;&gt; He had a -- I talked to

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:02.340 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
taysha last night.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.276 line:92%
You could tell how he wasn't

00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:06.461 line:92%
into me in the fantasy suite.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:08.013 line:92%
The door closed and I could tell

00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:11.716 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
it wasn't me.

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:12.817 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What about the deal with

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:14.252 line:92%
cassie, this is a huge thing

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:17.856 line:92%
with a lot of my friends.

00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:20.225 line:92%
Sue she's not that into him.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:21.426 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Women like to be chased.

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.261 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Can he win her over now?

00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:25.196 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Is that also what she

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.898 line:92%
signalling, chase me, or is she

00:01:26.898 --> 00:01:27.866 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
not that into him?

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.702 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I can answer that question

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:30.835 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
assertively.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.570 line:92%
She's definitely not saying,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.538 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
come chase me.

00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:36.558 line:92%
I do feel like -- I'm the last

00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:37.842 line:92%
one to talk, I feel like I'm

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.078 line:92%
saying this over and over again.

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:42.047 line:92%
I was the person told, I don't

00:01:42.047 --> 00:01:42.380 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
like you.

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:44.015 line:92%
I don't think I'm going to get

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:44.249 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
there.

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:45.850 line:92%
And then if it weren't for me

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:47.719 line:92%
being friends with them, like

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:48.887 line:92%
inviting him to my place,

00:01:48.954 --> 00:01:50.555 line:92%
inviting him to events, who

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:51.923 line:92%
knows if I would be engaged now.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.391 size:81% position:41% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Because you knew --

00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:54.259 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I knew.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.260 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
That's the thing.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.095 line:92%
Last night Jason said something

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:58.163 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
so poignant.

00:01:58.213 --> 00:01:59.965 line:92%
He said, you need to kind of

00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:03.201 line:92%
exhaust all your options because

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:05.236 line:92%
if you leave any what if's

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:06.938 line:92%
hanging out there, you're always

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.440 line:92%
going to look back, I could have

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.608 line:92%
done that, I could have done

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:10.809 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
that.

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:12.444 line:92%
Who knows if it would have led

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.613 size:81% position:41% line:92%
to a happy ever after.

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:17.949 line:92%
I think Colton going after

00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:18.917 line:92%
cassie is what he should do.

00:02:18.917 --> 00:02:21.119 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I want to show you, look at

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:23.722 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
somebody leaving.

00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:25.690 line:92%
Does this look like somebody

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:27.025 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
heart broken?

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.628 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'm sad to see it over, but I

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:32.163 line:92%
did make the right choice

00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:33.498 line:92%
because I can't be here, not

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.517 line:92%
because I don't care about him a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.402 line:92%
lot, but because, like, I can't

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:39.637 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
make a commitment.

00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:43.975 line:92%
I think Colton -- Colton wants a

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.677 line:92%
wife and a family and a life

00:02:45.727 --> 00:02:46.745 size:84% position:42% line:92%
with someone right now.

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:49.147 line:92%
And I want him to have that.

00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:52.217 line:92%
So I don't want him to be --

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.819 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
with me.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.855 line:92%
I can't wait to be with family

00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:58.790 line:92%
back home and move on with my

00:02:58.823 --> 00:02:59.024 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
life.

00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:06.748 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I want cassie.

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:09.334 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; It's so sad.

00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:10.535 line:92%
&gt;&gt; If I leave for the airport

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:12.070 line:92%
now, can I hang out in the

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:13.738 line:92%
lounge about an hour, hour and a

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:14.072 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
half?

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.908 line:92%
&gt;&gt; So confused why she said he

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:18.076 size:88% position:44% line:92%
wants a wife and family.

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:19.811 line:92%
&gt;&gt; He told you, girl, last week.

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:20.912 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
He doesn't care.

00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:22.180 line:92%
He just wants to be with you.

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:23.681 size:81% position:41% line:92%
&gt;&gt; That's her way out.

00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:25.250 line:92%
&gt;&gt; That's her excuse she's going

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:27.552 line:92%
to stick to the entire time.

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:28.319 size:75% position:38% line:92%
So what happens now?

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:29.971 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I don't know, what happens

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:30.105 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
now?

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:31.239 line:92%
There's a knock on the door,

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.024 line:92%
she's going to answer the door

00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:35.560 line:92%
tonight and you'll find out.

00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:37.429 line:92%
&gt;&gt; They're gonna get married.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:40.198 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, I so love Hannah

00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:40.532 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
G.

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:42.667 line:92%
It comes down to the other two

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:43.435 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
women.

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:44.869 line:92%
Taysha, ifrl like it was more of

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:45.870 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
a friendship.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.372 size:84% position:42% line:92%
She looked so gorgeous.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.075 size:88% position:44% line:92%
They showed up after the

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:50.542 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
final --

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:51.176 line:92%
&gt;&gt; You know what happens when

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.378 line:92%
you get dumped, you have to show

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:54.379 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
up real correct.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.480 line:92%
This is what you're missing out

00:03:55.513 --> 00:03:55.580 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
on.

00:03:55.647 --> 00:03:57.449 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:03:57.582 --> 00:04:00.118 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I look -- their teeth look

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:00.635 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
good.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.288 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Here's Hannah G.

00:04:03.354 --> 00:04:05.090 line:92%
I thought, first of all I didn't

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.691 line:92%
think she would be this heart

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:07.926 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I understand why she was so

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:08.693 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
heart broken.

00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:10.395 line:92%
She was left hanging way more

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:11.930 line:92%
than taysha was left hanging.

00:04:11.963 --> 00:04:13.298 line:92%
She didn't have the date in the

00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:14.232 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
fantasy suite.

00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:15.383 line:92%
She thought she was going to get

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.036 line:92%
the first date that week.

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:18.903 line:92%
Hypothetically, imagine if

00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:20.472 line:92%
Hannah G. Did get the first date

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:23.324 line:92%
that week, they had the fantasy

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:25.143 line:92%
he obviously liked her more than

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.078 line:92%
he liked taysha, then went into

00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:28.580 size:78% position:39% line:92%
the date with cassie.

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:29.914 line:92%
I wonder if he would have been

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.616 line:92%
like, okay, let's bring the two

00:04:31.683 --> 00:04:33.084 line:92%
of them next week instead of

00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:35.920 line:92%
just latching onto cassie.

00:04:35.954 --> 00:04:38.039 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Maybe because she got the

00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:39.174 line:92%
first impression rose, Hannah,

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.792 size:84% position:42% line:92%
usually you get chosen.

00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:43.661 line:92%
Tons of chemistry, the shower --

00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.631 line:92%
not with taysha, but Hannah G.

00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:47.765 size:75% position:38% line:92%
They made out a lot.

00:04:47.816 --> 00:04:49.434 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Hannah G. Was the first one

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.101 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
he kissed.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:51.102 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I can't remember that.

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:52.237 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I can't remember.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.372 line:92%
&gt;&gt; He told her, I thought it was

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.206 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
you.

00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:56.324 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
You feel like home.

00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:57.876 line:92%
&gt;&gt; What does that sound like to

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.578 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
a girl, though?

00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:01.813 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
You feel like home?

00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:04.282 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&gt;&gt; That sounds best,

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.383 size:81% position:41% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Y'all don't hear --

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.584 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; My safe place.

00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:09.087 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Y'all don't hear mom?

00:05:09.087 --> 00:05:10.955 size:88% position:44% line:92%
You remind me of my mom.

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:12.790 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Ooh, buzz kill.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.759 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Guys, he said everything

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.628 size:88% position:44% line:92%
changed with cassie come

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:17.061 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Portugal.

00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:18.730 line:92%
That's why what if the dates

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:21.299 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
were swapped?

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:22.333 line:92%
Because he just changed his mind

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.335 line:92%
and made that affirmative

00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:25.136 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
decision this week.

00:05:25.136 --> 00:05:29.507 size:78% position:39% line:92%
&gt;&gt; I texted Harrison.

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:31.376 line:92%
I want her as the bachelorette

00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:33.645 line:92%
because she was so sweet and

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:34.913 size:88% position:44% line:92%
authentic with her love.

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.047 size:81% position:41% line:92%
She looks sensational.

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:37.715 line:92%
&gt;&gt; She was there for the right

00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:38.016 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
reasons.

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:41.603 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Right, she was.

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:43.655 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Maybe she was -- it didn't

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.824 line:92%
seem like cassie -- she was out.

00:05:46.824 --> 00:05:48.359 line:92%
Hannah was like, I was hoping

00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:50.078 line:92%
this would be a different way.

00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.530 line:92%
&gt;&gt; When she went home after the

00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:54.465 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
show was over.

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:55.967 line:92%
Do I need to comb my hair, is he

00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:57.368 line:92%
going to come back for me?

00:05:57.435 --> 00:05:59.170 line:92%
&gt;&gt; That was sweet and sad.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.705 line:92%
If he were to go to cassie and

00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:03.208 line:92%
said, you know, can we do this?

00:06:03.274 --> 00:06:05.410 line:92%
Say she rejects him tonight.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.679 line:92%
Going back to Hannah G. May not

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:08.796 line:92%
have been the worst idea.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.516 line:92%
&gt;&gt; If it's not Hannah G., who do

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.785 size:75% position:38% line:92%
we like for the next

00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
bachelorette?

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:14.602 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
We'll hear tonight.

00:06:14.652 --> 00:06:16.321 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'm going with Hannah B.

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:18.022 line:92%
She's been my girl the entire

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.289 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
time.

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.191 line:92%
She's the perfect combination of

00:06:20.258 --> 00:06:22.994 line:92%
hot to guys, relatable to girls.

00:06:23.027 --> 00:06:24.796 line:92%
She can be serious and like very

00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:25.897 line:92%
woman power when she needs to

00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:26.531 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
be.

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:28.866 line:92%
But she can be cute and funny

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.367 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
also.

00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.336 line:92%
&gt;&gt; She's sassy, good southern

00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:31.402 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
girl.

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.371 line:92%
&gt;&gt; You have to leave it to Jimmy

00:06:33.438 --> 00:06:34.405 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Kimmel, you know?

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:37.008 line:92%
He knows how to just make it all

00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:37.875 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
come full circle.

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.844 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:41.179 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I don't know what Chris

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.014 line:92%
Harrison did to Colton to

00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:44.549 line:92%
convince him to stay, but

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:48.753 line:92%
whatever it was, it worked.

00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.221 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Last night, last night was

00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:53.491 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:58.162 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&gt;&gt; Wait, I'm confeuused.

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:02.867 line:92%
Did Colton lose his virginity to

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:03.868 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Chris Harrison?

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:04.636 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&gt;&gt; That was wild.

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:06.537 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Whatever he said to Colton,

00:07:06.604 --> 00:07:08.306 line:92%
maybe cassie is not into you.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:09.574 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Maybe she's just not that

00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:10.191 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
into you.

00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:11.442 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&gt;&gt; We all see the movie.

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:12.377 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
He went there.

00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:14.145 line:92%
&gt;&gt; We've all seen she's not that

00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:16.247 line:92%
into him from what they've

00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:16.714 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
aired.

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:17.782 line:92%
Possibly there's stuff they

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.550 line:92%
haven't aired to make us think

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:20.785 size:81% position:41% line:92%
otherwise, but it's so

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:22.387 line:92%
interesting that Colton says,

00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:25.223 line:92%
she loves me, she's just scared.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.091 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I'm a good read of people.

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:28.059 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
I can feel it.

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:28.926 size:75% position:38% line:92%
That's what he said.

00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:31.763 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Not if you've seen her side

00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:32.030 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
interviews.

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:33.164 line:92%
However, same could have been

00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:34.966 line:92%
said about Jared and you guys

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:36.184 line:92%
did not ever see him liking me

00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:36.968 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
at all.

00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.835 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Eight that is true.

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:40.271 line:92%
&gt;&gt; My husband came after me so

00:07:40.338 --> 00:07:41.272 size:81% position:41% line:92%
hard and he caught me.

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.107 line:92%
&gt;&gt; You can hear more of Ashley

00:07:43.107 --> 00:07:45.076 line:92%
on her podcast, I don't get it.

00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:45.977 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Ben and Ashley.

00:07:46.044 --> 00:07:48.112 line:92%
And the bachelor finale are
