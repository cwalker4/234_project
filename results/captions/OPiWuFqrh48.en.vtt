00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.960
Welcome to Hollywood Graveyard,
where we set out to remember and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.519
celebrate the lives of those who lived
to entertain us, by visiting their final

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.020
resting places. Today we're exploring
Hillside Memorial Park, where we'll find

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.220
such stars as Al Jolson, Dinah Shore,
Leonard Nimoy, and many more.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.500
Join us, won't you?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
Hillside Memorial Park is a Jewish cemetery located in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.120
Culver City California, just a few miles
southwest of Hollywood. It was founded in

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.640
1941 and in 1957 was acquired by Temple
Israel of Hollywood and has serviced

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.230
Hollywood's Jewish community ever since. It features beautiful works of art from

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.250
Jewish tradition and culture.
Note that the cemetery is closed on

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.440
Saturday in observance of Shabbat.
Hillside is a medium-sized Cemetery

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.119
so we'll be covering it in two parts. For
this first part we'll be visiting the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.800
main mausoleum and the surrounding areas.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.440
We'll begin our tour at Hillside's most
iconic monument, visible right from the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.690
405 freeway. This cascading waterfall and
75 foot marble pillar monument

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.840
memorializes as one of the world's most
legendary entertainers, Al Jolson.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
He was a singer stage and film actor and
comedian dubbed in his day as the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.009
world's greatest entertainer. He
captivated audiences with his

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.720
performances on Broadway stages, becoming
a rock star before the age of Rock, and

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.700
was the king of Broadway for decades. By
the late 20s Hollywood came calling and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.020
in 1927 Jolson starred in Hollywood's
first feature-length talkie,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.400
The Jazz Singer, ushering in the sound
era.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:12.760
[music]

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.040
"Mammy...

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.720
My little Mammy."

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.370
Jolson often performed in blackface,
certainly inappropriate and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.930
controversial by today's standards, but
before you decry him as a racist let us

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.129
understand the era and the context. As a
Jewish man, Jolson fought against

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.629
cultural discrimination in the early
20th century, particularly discrimination

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.950
against African-Americans. He used his
blackface persona to ridicule the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.629
prevalent idea of 'white supremacy,' and in
an era when blacks were not allowed to

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.709
perform in most venues, Jolson helped
introduce black music like jazz and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.359
blues to white audiences, breaking down
the barrier of white-only and black-only

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.010
entertainment... essentially bridging a
long-standing cultural gap in America.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.280
He even helped promote and demand equal
treatment for black entertainers of the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.139
era like playwright Garland Anderson, and
Cab Calloway. Jolson was a man who had

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.950
his flaws, like all of us,
but he was no racist. In fact this very

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.480
monument was designed by renowned
African-American architect, Paul R Williams.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.720
Let's make our way up to the
mausoleum. On the lawn to the right, next

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.769
to the road, is actress Suzanne Pleshette.
She can be seen in films like Alfred

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.609
Hitchcock's, The Birds, but is perhaps
best remembered for her role as Emily

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.380
Hartley on The Bob Newhart Show, a role
that earned her two Emmy nominations.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.880
Nearby on this lawn is Suzanne's husband,
comedic television actor Tom Poston.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.920
He started his career in the 1950s,
appearing on variety shows like the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.310
Steve Allen Show, a recurring role that
earned him an Emmy. His career spanned

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.200
the decades that followed, often starring
alongside friend and fellow comedian Bob Newhart.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.159
He was nominated for three more
Emmys for his role on Newhart, and had

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.030
guest roles on popular comedies of the
20th century, including Home Improvement,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.019
and Murphy Brown. He was also a frequent
panelist on To Tell the Truth.

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.540
Just before the entrance of the mausoleum, on the left,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.840
is the tomb of producer Mark Goodson.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.660
He is remembered for having
created and produced some of the

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.590
greatest and most popular game shows of
the 50s to the 80s, including Match Game,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.880
To Tell the Truth, What's My Line?,
Family Feud, and The Price is Right.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.440
His marker is inspired by his company logo.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.960
Heading into the mausoleum then

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.139
immediately back out to the courtyard we
find the crypt of David Janssen low on

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.800
the left wall. He was an actor best
remembered for his portrayal of

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.900
Dr. Richard Kimble in the 60s TV series, The Fugitive. He had starring roles in many

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.130
other TV series of the era, including
Richard Diamond: Private Detective, and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.840
Harry O.  In 1996 he was ranked number 36 on TV Guide's list of greatest TV stars.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.520
He died of a heart attack at the age of
48.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.540
Several spaces above Jansen is George Jessel.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.880
Like many of his era, Jessel began
entertaining on stage in vaudeville.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.480
In 1925 he originated the lead role in the
Broadway production of The Jazz Singer, a

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.860
role that quickly made him a leading man.
He was set to reprise the role on-screen

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.660
in 1927, but when negotiations fell
through the role went to Al Jolson.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.740
He acted in over 30 film and television
productions in his career, and became a

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.249
prominent producer of musicals in the
40s and 50s.

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:31.359
He was known as the Toastmaster General
for his frequent role as master of

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.280
ceremonies at political and
entertainment events.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.360
From the courtyard we head to the corridor to the south.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.229
On the far left is Michael Landon.  He was

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.379
one of the great television actors, known
for playing wholesome, down-to-earth

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.780
characters like Charles Ingalls on
Little House on the Prairie.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:06:11.590
[music]

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.060
He also played Little Joe Cartwright on
Bonanza, and Jonathan Smith on Highway to Heaven.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.460
He appeared on the cover of TV
Guide more than any other actor,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.820
except Lucille Ball.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.980
Across from Landon, back in
the mausoleum, on the left, is Eddie Cantor,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.260
another of the all-around great
entertainers of the 20th century. He was

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.680
a musician, actor, dancer, and comedian,
starting in vaudeville and moving onto

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.160
Broadway, radio, and television. He turned
down the role for the lead in The Jazz Singer,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.650
but his role in the 1930 film,
Whoopee, made him his star. He was a

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.419
regular on TV and radio throughout the
30s 40s and 50s. He also co-wrote the

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.700
tune "Merrily We Roll Along," the theme for
the Warner Brothers Merrie Melodies Cartoons.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:14.600
[music]

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.640
Further in the mausoleum, on the left, is
the large black tomb of Jack Benny,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.960
one of Hollywood's most legendary comedians.
He could elicit laughter from a mere

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.600
sideways glance alone - he was that good. A staple on stage radio and television

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.530
through the first half of the 20th
century, Jack Benny is widely considered

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.090
one of America's greatest entertainers.
His miserly persona, poor violin playing,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.620
and perpetual age of 39 were just a few
of the running gags that made his

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.810
character so beloved to audiences. After
more than 15 years on the radio, the Jack

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:53.600
Benny Program ran on television from
1950 to 1965, and set the standard for

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.880
television comedy for years to come.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.150
"Now, this is the ordinary inexpensive

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:05.660
violin that I use just on my television
shows. And this is the $30,000

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:12.080
Stradivarius that I use in my concerts.
And I want to show you why this is worth

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.990
every dollar that I paid for it.
Now first listen to this cheap one, this

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.220
is a cheap one just listen to it.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:43.760
Now, here is my Stradivarius. I want you
to listen to the difference.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.320
See, there's no substitute for quality."

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.280
Jack is entombed with his wife Mary who

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.360
starred alongside him on his radio and
television programs.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.410
Down the hall and on

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.100
the first right,
on the far wall, is the niece of Allan Sherman.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.780
He was a comedy writer and song
parodist best remembered for his hit

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.220
single, "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh."

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:43.660
[music]

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.600
He also voiced The Cat in the Hat in a 70s cartoon.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.240
Back the way we came we head up to the second level.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.250
On the wall just opposite the stairs, above

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.810
eye-level, is the crypt of Jeff Chandler.
He was one of Universal's most popular

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.940
actors during the 50s scene in action in
western films like Broken Arrow. His role

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.070
as Cochise earned him an Academy Award
nomination. He was also a talented singer,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.210
releasing several albums in his career.
He died at just 42 after complications

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.580
from back surgery.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.280
Back downstairs and
outside we followed the wall on the

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.450
right and find the crypt of Max Factor
Sr.  He was the founder of the

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.930
cosmetics company,
Max Factor. He was instrumental in

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.190
developing the modern cosmetics industry
and even popularized the use of the term

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.810
'makeup' as a noun. He headed to Los
Angeles when he saw an opportunity to

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.460
provide wigs and cosmetics to the
budding film industry. By the 19-teens

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.260
Max Factor had become the ultimate
authority in cosmetics for film making.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.920
During those early years he personally
applied his cosmetics to the biggest

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.310
names in Hollywood, including Mary
Pickford, Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, Jean

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.140
Harlow, Bette Davis, and more, always able
to make up each actor to be shown in the

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.730
best possible light on screen. After his
death he was entombed at Hollywood

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.910
Forever, but when that cemetery fell into
disrepair, his remains were moved here.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:11.040
His son Max Factor Jr. carried on the family business and is entombed two spaces away.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.220
Further along this wall, below eye level,
is Dinah Shore. She was an actress and

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.480
one of the most prominent female
vocalists of the big-band era. Among her

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.640
many popular recordings is the holiday
classic, "Baby It's Cold Outside."

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:39.520
[music]

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.420
Later in her career she became a television personality,

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.450
hosting her own variety shows, The Dinah
Shore Show in the 60s, and Dinah! in the

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.640
70s. After her death in 1994 a portion of
her cremated remains were entombed here,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.180
another portion at Forest Lawn in
Cathedral City,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.180
and the remainder rest with relatives.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.520
Just past the door on
this same wall is the crypt of Eydie Gorme.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.920
She was a popular big band
singer in the 50s and 60s with hits like

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.000
"Blame it on the Bossa Nova."

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:32.880
[music]

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.120
She often sang duet with her husband
Steve Lawrence, and also successfully

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.250
crossed over into the Latin music market
with a series of albums in Spanish.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.380
She earned several awards in her career
including a Grammy and an Emmy.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.180
On the lawn just behind us is the grave of
Lorne Greene. He was an actor, best

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.860
remembered for his long-running role as
Ben Cartwright

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.300
on TVs Bonanza, a role which earned him a
Golden Globe nomination.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:21.980
[music]

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.620
He also starred as Commander Adama on the original Battlestar Galactica.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.780
A few spaces right
is Sheldon Leonard. He produced many of

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.280
the popular television shows in the 60s,
including the Dick Van Dyke Show,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.680
The Andy Griffith Show, and Make Room for Daddy, which earned him two Emmys.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.620
Earlier in his career he could be seen in front of the camera, playing tough guys in

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.060
films like Guys and Dolls. His name
served as the namesake for the

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.340
characters Sheldon and Leonard on the
Big Bang Theory.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.480
Heading around to the garden north, just
past the bridge, on the right we find

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.860
Leonard Nimoy. He is most famous for his
portrayal of Spock on the original Star Trek

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:10.360
TV series and subsequent Star Trek
films. Mr. Spock was named by TV Guide as

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.900
one of the 50 greatest TV characters, and
Nimoy's portrayal earned him three Emmy

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.580
Award nominations.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.240
"She really liked those ears?"

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.590
"Captain, the Horta is a remarkably

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.060
intelligent and sensitive creature, with
impeccable taste."

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.740
"Because she approved of you."

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.480
"Really kept in my modesty -"

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.240
"Does not bear close examination, Mr. Spock.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.780
I suspect you're becoming more and more
human all the time."

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.520
"Captain, I see no reason to stand here
and be insulted."

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.820
Nimoy devised the Vulcan salute, which
was inspired by a Jewish blessing

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:49.800
gesture, seen here on his marker.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.020
Famous for the catchphrase "live long and prosper,"

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.100
Leonard Nimoy did just that,
living to the age of 83.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.180
In 2016 a

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:03.410
documentary was made about the life of
Nimoy, directed by his son Adam.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.470
Continuing down the sidewalk, on the lawn
to the left, we find the grave of

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:13.199
Theodore Bikel. He was a musician and
actor of both stage and screen.

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:17.189
He originated the role of Captain Von Trapp
in the original Broadway production of

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:20.900
The Sound of Music,
a role which earned him the Tony nomination.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.180
In fact the song "Edelweiss" was written
specifically for Bikel to sing and perform.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:51.100
[music]

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.420
He also played Tevye in the Fiddler on
the Roof in over 2,000 performances, more

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:01.019
than just about any other actor except
Topol. On-screen he can be seen in films

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:05.430
like My Fair Lady, The African Queen, and
The Defiant Ones, which earned him an

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.990
Oscar nomination. He also had many guest
appearances on TV shows like,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.180
All in the Family, and The Twilight Zone.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.970
Further along this sidewalk is the grand

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.860
monument to Hollywood producer Jerry
Weintraub. He began his career as a

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.519
manager and concert promoter for
performers like John Denver, Frank

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:28.050
Sinatra, Bob Dylan, and more. He went on to become a producer for film and

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.820
television.
Some of his notable productions include

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.700
Oh, God!, The Karate Kid, and the Ocean's
11 films. More recently he produced

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:42.388
the HBO series, Westworld. He won three
Emmys in his career.

00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:43.810
Finally we head

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.820
around to the north and back inside the
mausoleum. Just inside this entrance is

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.440
the tomb of Aaron Spelling. He was one of
the most prolific TV producers in

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.070
Hollywood history, having produced a
number of successful and iconic

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:02.620
television shows, including Melrose Place,
7th Heaven, Charlie's Angels, Charmed,

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.340
and Beverly Hills, 90210, which featured
his daughter Tori.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:30.760

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.770

Thanks for watching, we'll see you on the
next one!

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.270
I'm just sitting here editing the next
Hillside video and I had a thought...

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.380
why don't you guys choose the next
Cemetery that we visit? We've hit a lot

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.380
of the big ones here in LA but there's
still a lot more to see. So let's do this...

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:07.770
I'll create a poll and post it on my
Patreon page. Head over there and cast

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.240
your vote for the cemetery you'd like to
see next. The cemetery with the most

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.600
votes will be our next tour.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.770
And Halloween's just over a week away so

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:22.040
don't forget to get your copy of my book,
Zombie Junior, while it's still on sale.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.360
Hope you all have a wonderfully spooky
Halloween, and I can't wait to see

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.880
where we're headed next.
