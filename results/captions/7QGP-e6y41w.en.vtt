YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE
GET SO CAUGHT UP WITH ALL THE

TRUMP, WE FORGET TO NOTICE WHAT

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:49.882

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.255

BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
TRUMP PRESIDENCY-- IN A MIRROR,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.628
LIKE THE MEDUSA-- HE HASN'T
REALLY ACCOMPLISHED MUCH.

RACISM.

I'M SORRY, I MISPRONOUNCED
THAT.

I'M SORRY, IMMIGRATION.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.873
HE PROMISED TO REDUCE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION, AND YET, IN THE

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.209
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS,
UNAUTHORIZED BORDER CROSSINGS

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.145
HAVE SPIKED TO THE HIGHEST PACE
IN 12 YEARS.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.948
OF COURSE THEY'RE RUSHING IN
NOW.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:28.154

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.229
TRUMP TRIED TO CLAIM THAT THE
SURGE IN BORDER CROSSINGS IS

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.800
BOTH A VICTORY AND A DISASTER,
TWEETING:

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.735
"'WALL STREET JOURNAL': 'MORE
MIGRANT FAMILIES CROSSING INTO
