00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.270
Sadhguru: The color of the clothes

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.102
or the colors of anything around you,

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.244
does it have some impact?

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.063
You need to understand this.

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:28.492
How color happens, first of all?

00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:32.252
Why this seems to be white right now

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:34.882
is because when the light falls on it,

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:37.315
it reflects all of it,

00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:39.303
so it looks white.

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.233
Why this seems to be red right now,

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.058
is not because it’s red.

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:46.653
It is just that it holds back all the colors

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:48.405
and only reflects red.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:51.121
That’s why you’re seeing red.

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:53.814
And what is red for you

00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:57.862
may not be red for some other creature.

00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:00.074
If you dress up really jazzy colors

00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:02.475
and go and stand in front of your dog

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:05.562
he looks at you in an uninterested way,

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:07.305
because he doesn’t see any color,

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:08.794
he sees everything black and white,

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:10.146
do you know this?

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:12.317
Don’t dress up for him, okay?

00:01:12.317 --> 00:01:14.055
Dog lovers, I’m saying.

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:20.225
You wear only black and white, dog lovers.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.782
Nothing else works.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.328
You don’t impress him with red, green, blue and whatever.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.875
So, color is not what it is,

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.426
color is what it gives away.

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:37.496
What you reflect will be your color.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:40.476
What you hold will not be your color.

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.035
This is the nature of life,

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.542
not just of color.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.286
This is the nature of life itself.

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:50.637
Today if you radiate love,

00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:53.174
people will see you as a loving human being.

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:54.857
If you hold back all your love,

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:58.404
because you’re a very… you’re a love bank,

00:01:58.404 --> 00:01:59.926
you’re full of love,

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:01.756
but you don’t radiate,

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:05.693
people will think you’re

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:07.223
that

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:10.456
If you radiate joy, people will think,

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:12.397
‘Oh, he’s a joyful person.’

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:14.017
If you are a joy bank,

00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:15.496
you held back all your joy

00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:18.528
because you want to take it to heaven,

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:22.219
people won’t experience you as a joyful human being, isn’t it?

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.778
What you give away is always your quality, isn’t it so?

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.078
So that is not just for a human being,

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:32.457
that is the nature of the Existence itself.

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:37.659
What is thrown away is the quality of that substance.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.468
Now, this reflects everything,

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:42.310
so this is white.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.635
That reflects only red, so it is red.

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:48.181
That reflects only blue so it is blue.

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.154
Everything else is held back.

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:52.719
What it holds back you don’t see.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.349
What it gives away is what you see.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.179
So, how is color significant for human consciousness as such,

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.049
or for any kind of spiritual process?

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.220
It is significant in the sense

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.700
that the color that you reflect,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.860
will naturally add to the aura that you carry.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.889
People on the ascetic path don’t want to wear anything,

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.400
because they don’t want to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.911
add any new things to them.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.822
They just want to work with what they have.

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:34.772
They don’t want to take on anything more.

00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:39.131
What you are right now, to work that out

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.562
is quite substantial.

00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:42.370
Adding one more thing and one more thing,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.990
it complicates.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.672
So they don’t want anything, they walk naked.

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:50.162
If socially walking naked is difficult,

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.403
they will put on one little loin cloth

00:03:52.403 --> 00:03:54.892
so that socially there is no issue.

00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:56.161
But the idea is,

00:03:56.161 --> 00:04:00.372
they don’t take on anything more than what they are.

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.920
They know what they are is substantial.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.109
There’re other aspects to it, that's different.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.301
I’m saying about the color.

00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.482
So orange,

00:04:11.572 --> 00:04:15.111
the chakras in the body,

00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:17.982
all the hundred and fourteen chakras

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:21.513
or rather hundred and twelve chakras

00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:23.172
ascribe to some color.

00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:25.854
The two do not ascribe to any color,

00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:27.682
because they’re not physical in nature.

00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:31.183
Anything that’s physical in the existence

00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:34.402
naturally reflects light.

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:36.893
You understand what I’m saying?

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:41.428
Anything that’s physical in the existence reflects light.

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:43.184
Once it reflects light,

00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:47.332
it will have color in your perception.

00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:49.702
It may not have any particular color,

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:52.713
or it may not have the color that you’re seeing,

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:55.055
you’re only seeing what’s being reflected.

00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:58.036
What you’re seeing is the reflected light.

00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.976
You’re not seeing the color of the substance

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:02.104
that you’re seeing.

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:05.296
You’re not seeing color of the thing that you’re seeing.

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:09.506
You’re only seeing the color of the reflected light.

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:11.614
Black reflects nothing.

00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:13.248
It holds back everything,

00:05:13.248 --> 00:05:15.235
so it becomes black.

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:21.356
You see,

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.808
we say the grass is green,

00:05:24.808 --> 00:05:26.490
no, the grass is not green.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.850
It is giving away green,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.658
so we see it is green.

00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:34.579
The sky is blue

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:35.638
no, no, no,

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:36.819
the sky is not blue.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.810
You go there and see, there is no blue out there.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.236
Sky is blue for a completely different reason,

00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:50.050
because the refraction quality of the color blue is different

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.299
from the other colors;

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:54.198
that’s why the sky is blue.

00:05:55.348 --> 00:05:57.980
So why is it that spiritual processes

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.091
for different types of processes we use different kind of colors is

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.330
those who are on a path

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.929
where they don’t want to gather anything,

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:11.840
they will wear white.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.889
Those who are into a different kind of sadhana,

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.451
if their sadhana is mild,

00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:22.480
but they are on the spiritual path,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.642
but they are involved with various aspects of life,

00:06:25.642 --> 00:06:27.700
they don’t want to gather life around them.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.960
They want to be participating in life

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.890
but they don’t want to gather anything,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.989
such people will choose to wear white.

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:38.111
People who are on a more intense sadhana,

00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:41.837
which is oriented towards a particular chakra in the body

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:45.701
which is known as Agna, between the eyebrows,

00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:48.463
they will wear orange,

00:06:48.463 --> 00:06:52.853
because the color of the chakra is orange.

00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:55.479
They want to radiate that color,

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.601
because the whole process is about enlightenment

00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.502
and reaching to that state of knowing,

00:07:03.502 --> 00:07:05.784
opening up that dimension of perception

00:07:05.784 --> 00:07:07.984
which is referred to as the third eye,

00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:10.823
so they will seek always ochre,

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:13.426
or orange color

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:16.635
because that is the color of the Agna.

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:22.725
The yellow robes were worn by Buddhist monks

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:26.794
because the process that Gautama gave

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:29.365
to the initial stage of Buddhist monks,

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.734
was very rudimentary process.

00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:34.624
He chose this process for the people

00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:37.454
because it did not need any preparation.

00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:41.355
but he wants to cause a wave of awareness.

00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:48.475
That means he doesn’t stay in any town for more than a day,

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:51.047
continuously he's moving from village to village,

00:07:51.047 --> 00:07:52.947
town to town.

00:07:52.947 --> 00:07:56.557
There’s no time to prepare people for any kind of practice,

00:07:56.557 --> 00:07:59.187
so the practice that he gives them is very rudimentary,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.572
but still he’s converting them into monks.

00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:05.478
He's fixing their life

00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:09.019
but not giving them enough preparatory steps.

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:11.435
So he told them to wear the yellow robe,

00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:15.651
because yellow is the color of the Mooladhara.

00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:21.088
The most basic chakra in the body is Mooladhara,

00:08:21.088 --> 00:08:24.107
so he wants them to be stable.

00:08:24.107 --> 00:08:30.127
For a monk the most important thing is he practices stability in his life.

00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:32.137
So he just wants them to be stable.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.358
They don’t have to fly off into a blissful experience.

00:08:35.358 --> 00:08:37.786
They don’t have to get enlightened right now,

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:39.341
they don’t have to get anywhere,

00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:41.588
they just have to learn to be stable,

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:47.208
because he is preparing soldiers to shake the world with awareness.

00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:50.748
So he told them to wear yellow robes.

00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:56.117
Later on, when they graduated to what he called as arhats,

00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:59.096
the arhats in the Buddhist tradition,

00:08:59.096 --> 00:09:01.848
wore ochre robes,

00:09:01.848 --> 00:09:05.518
that is orange as all the Indian sanyasis wear.

00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:10.691
But then after Gautama passed away,

00:09:10.691 --> 00:09:15.328
when they tried to spread the Buddhist way of life,

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:22.096
people in India they were at least 30% of the population were sanyasis or monks by nature.

00:09:22.096 --> 00:09:24.718
By culture it was just like that.

00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:26.697
So this one more set of monks,

00:09:26.697 --> 00:09:29.129
they just accepted them and they became kind of part of them,

00:09:29.129 --> 00:09:31.879
they couldn’t maintain a distinct identity.

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:37.419
So from ochre they shifted to little more maroonish color,

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.741
more for an identity sake,

00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:44.451
because they would simply mix with all the other yogis

00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:47.334
and monks who were walking all over the place.

00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:49.892
So they wanted to set up a distinct identity,

00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:54.149
so they switched to a little maroonish color later on.

00:09:54.149 --> 00:09:58.023
But the basic Buddhist color is still yellow,

00:09:58.023 --> 00:10:02.001
because yellow is the color of the Mooladhara,

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.792
and it can be taught without preparation.

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:07.134
No preparation, no teaching, no nothing,

00:10:07.134 --> 00:10:11.523
a simple process just to stabilize and stabilize and stabilize

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:13.533
Such a process is taught

00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:18.926
when you are charting out a spiritual path for a few lifetimes.

00:10:18.926 --> 00:10:22.134
See, that tradition still continues in the Buddhist way of life.

00:10:22.134 --> 00:10:24.483
They keep coming back and coming back

00:10:24.483 --> 00:10:26.154
to do more work and more work

00:10:26.154 --> 00:10:29.562
because the process is such, it’s of stabilization,

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.185
not of realization.

00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:34.555
So that's why the yellow.

00:10:35.665 --> 00:10:37.715
Devi is always red because

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:39.955
red is the most vibrant color.

00:10:39.955 --> 00:10:43.545
Of all the colors, red is the most vibrant color

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:48.878
and feminine represents that.

00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:50.534
whether you like it or not

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:54.344
there is a longing in a woman to be like a flower.

00:10:56.004 --> 00:10:59.727
because nature has given that possibility for her.

00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:03.957
There is a certain quality in the feminine

00:11:03.957 --> 00:11:07.507
which is flowery.

00:11:08.577 --> 00:11:10.456
So, when we say a flower,

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:14.237
the first thing that comes into most people’s mind is always red.

00:11:14.237 --> 00:11:16.618
A red flower is always the real flower;

00:11:16.618 --> 00:11:19.358
other things are on the way.

00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:23.336
Red is vibrant.

00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:26.780
It is the color of vibrance.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.128
Devi,

00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:29.947
or the feminine form of the Divine,

00:11:29.947 --> 00:11:32.399
is the most vibrant form of Divine.

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.572
Something nobody can miss.

00:11:34.572 --> 00:11:36.279
The reason why,

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.908
even if there are other bigger temples,

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:40.057
in every village,

00:11:40.057 --> 00:11:41.048
in every town in India,

00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:42.958
we will set up a Devi temple,

00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.601
You walk into the Devi temple,

00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:46.290
she hits you in the face,

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.351
you can't miss it,

00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:51.382
because it’s vibrant.

00:11:51.382 --> 00:11:55.179
The color of vibrance is always red.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:58.816
If… it doesn’t matter what kind of a person you are,

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:01.150
if you come dressed in full red clothes,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.880
suddenly people will think

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.418
you’re vibrant...

00:12:05.418 --> 00:12:07.643
even if you’re not.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:09.568
Yes or no?

00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:10.990
red dress,

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.493
suddenly sets you off like you’re vibrant.

00:12:14.493 --> 00:12:18.130
And to do certain type of sadhana which is Devi oriented,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.389
red is needed.

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:23.062
The most important things in your life

00:12:23.062 --> 00:12:25.209
are usually red, you know,

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:28.252
your blood is red.

00:12:28.252 --> 00:12:31.182
If it’s not red enough you

00:12:31.182 --> 00:12:34.998
you go down, you know.

00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:36.693
Flowers are red,

00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:40.172
the rising sun can become

00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:42.312
reaching towards red,

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:44.423
anything that you consider

00:12:44.423 --> 00:12:46.546
as vibrantly alive

00:12:46.546 --> 00:12:49.172
you tend to paint it red,

00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:51.122
because there is a connection

00:12:51.122 --> 00:12:54.325
between red and vibrance.

00:12:54.325 --> 00:13:00.634
And Devi is manifestation of vibrance that you cannot miss.

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:08.204
So the Devi temples always have very active involvement of red,

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:08.955
in many ways

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.936
only red flowers are used.

00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:12.747
Blood is spilled all over the place.

00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:14.605
We don’t do the blood business,

00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:21.773
but one way or the other it needs lot of spilling of life.

00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:24.735
Either you must know how to spill your life just like that

00:13:24.735 --> 00:13:26.026
without killing yourself,

00:13:26.026 --> 00:13:27.936
if you do not know the technology

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:29.405
you have to kill.

00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:31.954
We know the technology, so we don’t kill.

00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:35.373
Somebody else who do not know the technology of spilling life

00:13:35.373 --> 00:13:36.700
without killing the body,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.845
they will cut the body.

00:13:37.845 --> 00:13:41.464
Most Devi temples have daily sacrifice.

00:13:41.464 --> 00:13:46.194
So colors have some impact.

00:13:46.194 --> 00:13:49.355
It definitely influences a few things.

00:13:49.355 --> 00:13:51.176
But it’s not everything.
