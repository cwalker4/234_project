00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.989
He's the world leader accused of personally approving murder on the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.989
streets of London. The conclusion that the Russian state was probably

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.989
involved in the murder of Mr Litvinenko is deeply disturbing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.989
But is the president implicated in an assassination also responsible

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.989
for theft on an extraordinary scale? He has fleets of things that almost

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.989
no billionaire in the West would have. Vladimir Putin has been

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
accused of looting his own country. TRANSLATION: Today Putin behaves

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.989
like a Tsarnaev. -- Tsar. Tonight we investigate the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.989
truth about President Putin's riches. Why would it be kept secret?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.989
Because it belongs personally to Putin, not to the state. For the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.989
first time the Americans say what they really think about the Russian

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:31.989
president. Is Vladimir Putin corrupt? In our view, yes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.989
There is no other world leader like Vladimir Putin. Action man. Man of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:58.989
the people. And ruler of Russia. From Ukraine to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.989
Syria, Vladimir Putin's influence is being felt. He's faced countless

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.989
accusations of corruption, but he still has record approval ratings in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.989
Russia. What do you think of Vladimir Putin? But should the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:38.989
Russian people trust Vladimir Putin? President Putin's official income is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.989
around $100,000 a year, yet he lives like the super rich. He has a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.989
collection of expensive watches, even his designer tracksuit cost

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.989
$3,000. He has a level of living that is far in excess of anything

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.989
anyone in the West would have, even the very richest. It's that kind of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.989
level that we see from Saudi Princes. So how rich is Vladimir

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.989
Putin? Well, it may be one of Russia's best-kept secrets, but one

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.989
journalist came up with a figure. Stanislav Belkovsky claimed Putin

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.989
had secret share holdings in some of Russia's biggest companies. I met

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.989
him in Moscow. I've got this information from my confidential

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.989
sources. What figure did you come up with for Vladimir Putin's wealth?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.989
$40 billion in assets, not in cash of course. I'm sure Putin is the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.989
richest man in Europe, one of the richest men in the world. Putin

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:02.989
himself dismissed the $40 billion claim.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.989
But a secret CIA report agreed with Belkovsky's figure. In their view,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.989
Putin was worth around $40 billion. Did you tell the CIA the details of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.989
your 40 billion figure? No, no. I think CIA and FBI have this

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.989
information separately without my assistance.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.989
Russia's role in the Ukrainian conflict has led to closer scrutiny

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.989
of Putin's finances. Many of his inner circle have faced financial

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.989
sanctions from the Americans and the European Union. Now the US won't

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.989
publicly confirm the 40-billion figure, but they have told Panorama

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.989
what they think about Putin's wealth. I'm not in a position to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.989
give you figures, but what I can say is that he supposedly draws a state

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.989
salary of something like $110,000 a year. That is not an accurate

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.989
statement of the man's wealth. And he has long time training and

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.989
practices in terms of how to mask his actual wealth. Is Vladimir Putin

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.989
corrupt? In our view, yes. How long has the United States known that

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.989
Vladimir Putin was, in your words, a corrupt figure? I think for many,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.989
many years. Russia dismisses this sort of talk as nonsense. But the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.989
fact that the Americans are finally labelling Putin as corrupt shows how

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.989
bad relations have become. So what's the truth about Putin's money? Has

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.989
Russia's president been making billions on the side and if he has,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.989
where's it all hidden? I've come to Estonia to meet a man who says he

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.989
knows about some of Putin's cash. He fled Russia after falling out with

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.989
Kremlin insiders. Our contact helped Putin collect money from the super

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.989
rich. They all thought it was to pay for health care. But Sergey

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.989
Kolesnikov says some of the donated cash was diverted and ultimately

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.989
used to help build a billion-dollar palace for Putin.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.989
TRANSLATION: Regrettably these fund, which were supposed to be invested

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.989
in decent investment projects, to a significant extent ended up being

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.989
spent on a palace on the plaque sea coast. -- Black Sea coast. And here

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:01.989
it is. President Putin says the palace is

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.989
nothing to do with him. But we've seen documents linking Vladimir

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.989
Putin to the palace at the time it was built. They show a secret money

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.989
trail, and it's claimed Putin was at the heart of it. These are documents

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.989
from one of the offshore companies that diverted millions of dollars to

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.989
the palace. According to Kolesnikov, the owner of this company was Putin

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.989
himself. The offshore company was overseen by Kolesnikov and his

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.989
business partner, a Kremlin insider called Nikolai Shamalov.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.989
TRANSLATION: Shamalov said that he was taking 96 shares, 96%, keeping

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.989
2% for himself and he would be giving 94% to Putin.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.989
There's more evidence. Kolesnikov and Shamalov were recorded

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.989
apparently discussing $440 million of investments belonging to Putin.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:27.989
They refer to Putin using a nickname: Mikhail Ivanovich.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:41.989
Shamalov is still a trusted Kremlin insider. In that recording, he was

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.989
discussing Putin's Secret Fortune. Finding evidence like that about

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.989
Putin is not easy. He used to run Russia's intelligence service. He

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.989
knows how to hide secrets. Few from his inner circle ever talk, but

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.989
Panorama has tracked down one who will. I've come to Nice in the south

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.989
of France to meet him. So I'm at the hotel and we're about to be picked

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.989
up and taken to the interview location. The truth is we have no

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.989
idea where we're going. We certainly don't have anything like an address.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.989
The reason is probably because the man that we're on our way to

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.989
interview is on the run. He was one of Russia's richest and

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.989
most important men. But he fled his homeland and says he can't go back.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.989
His driver has brought me to a secret location. Hi. How are you? P

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.989
Sergei Pugachev -- this is Sergei Pugachev. He says he helped Putin

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.989
become president. They were friends. Their children played together.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.989
TRANSLATION: I had a very close relationship with Putin. Putin

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.989
consulted me. Putin confided in me. Pugachev took Putin to see one of

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.989
the presidential palaces. TRANSLATION: Of course, this was an

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.989
absolutely new world, new life. Of course, he was astonished by it. In

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.989
that first term as president, what was Putin's attitude to money?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.989
TRANSLATION: I think that Putin was preoccupied with the issue of wealth

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.989
from the start. For Putin this was an important factor. We talked about

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:03.989
it. He didn't hide it. He knew he wanted to leave office as a wealthy

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.989
person. Vladimir Putin has come a long way. He wasn't born rich and to

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:22.989
understand him, you need to go to his home city, St Petersburg. This

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.989
is where he grew up, there on the fifth floor. Putin's family had one

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.989
room in a shared apartment. No hot water and a shared kitchen in the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.989
corridor. Vladimir Putin grew up in poverty. But it was in St Petersburg

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:50.989
that Vladimir Putin first tasted power. Back in the '90s, not long

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.989
out of the KGB, Putin became a deputy mayor. On his watch, millions

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.989
of dollars disappeared from public funds to a company called Twentieth

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.989
Trust. The detective who investigated says Putin was one of

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.989
those who benefitted. He says Putin ended up with a property in

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.989
Torrevieja in Spain. TRANSLATION: If Twentieth Trust is

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.989
building a Villa for Putin in Torrevieja, is this Putin personally

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.989
receiving the money or not? In my opinion, the answer is

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.989
straightforward. But the criminal case was closed

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.989
after Putin became president. Zykov says he was forced into retirement.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.989
The Kremlin has denied the claims. But Spanish investigators revealed

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.989
the details of wiretapped phone conversations between Russians

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.989
who've been linked to organised crime. They can be heard discussing

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.989
Putin's property in Spain. One of the gangsters says Putin's house is

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.989
in Torrevieja, the same Spanish town Zykov had identified. It looks like

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:15.989
Zykov was right. Putin got a house in Spain. So in St Petersburg, Putin

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.989
learned how to profit from power. He also built a loyal team. After he

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.989
moved to the Kremlin, they came with him. The men closest to Putin have

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.989
been with him for years. They were with him here in St Petersburg and

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.989
they've stayed with him ever since. This is the group that he trusts and

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.989
that he rewards, and this is the group that runs Russia. Putin's

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.989
lawyer at the Town Hall became president and then Prime Minister of

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.989
Russia. His former deputy also served as prime minister. The Chief

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.989
of Staff at the Town Hall now runs Russia's anti-drugs agency. His

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.989
former assistant now runs the biggest oil company in the world.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.989
And his form ere economist -- former economist now runs the biggest gas

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.989
company in the world. All of them worked with Putin in this building.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.989
They rose up together. They went with him to Moscow. They have been a

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.989
very stable elite. This whole group, who grabbed the commanding heights

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.989
of the Russian economy, they all work together in a very small

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:51.989
office, in fact, in St Petersburg. As President, Putin was at the

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.989
centre of this new elite. He had power and access to the super-rich.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.989
You can see how Putin used it by looking at his relations with

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.989
Britain's most famous Russian, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. He

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.989
was one of the unwitting donors to Putin's Palace. He thought all his

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.989
cash would be spent on health care, and he gave more than $200 million.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.989
TRANSLATION: Abramovich's role was rather simple. He provided $203

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.989
million. Were these oligarchs effectively just paying tribute to

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.989
Vladimir Putin? I think this is exactly what they thought.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.989
Abramovich and other wealthy Russians are expected to pay for

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:15.989
important projects, like hosting the 2018 World Cup.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.989
The Fifa World Cup, ladies and gentleman, will be organised in

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.989
Russia. But we have been told about a gift that can't be explained away

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:35.989
as good for anyone other than Vladimir Putin. A 35mm or is yacht

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.989
like this one. -- 35 Ian dollars yacht. Given by Roman Abramovich.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.989
And our source is the man who managed the yacht.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.989
He fell out with the Kremlin, he is a wanted man in Russia and he is

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:13.989
living in the UK. Dmitry, I am Richard. Nice to meet

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.989
you. Dmitry Skarga says he oversaw the transfer of the yacht from

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.989
Abramovich to Putin. In March 2002 in Amsterdam, there was a

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.989
representative of Mr Abramovich. Skarga says the yacht was given to

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:45.989
an offshore company but the real owner was President Putin.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:18:05.989
We have seen documents that would appear to support Skarga's story.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.989
Roman Abramovich's lawyers said the claims were unsubstantiated, little

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.989
more than a rehash of speculation and rumours. But they didn't

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.989
specifically deny that he had given President Putin a yacht.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.989
You can hardly blame Abramovich for wanting to keep on Putin's good

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:38.989
side. Standing up to him can be dangerous.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.989
This is a billionaire Mikhail Khordorkovsky publicly challenging

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:59.989
Putin about corruption. Khordorkovsky was jailed for tax

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.989
evasion and embezzlement. His business was taken by the Russian

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.989
state. The beauty of the system is that it's organise and run according

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.989
to the old adage, for my friends everything, for my enemies the law.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.989
The message that Putin chose to send to all of them was, I can put you in

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:30.989
prison for anything. I don't need to have a watertight case. That is the

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.989
genius of the system. Sergei Pugachev claims he lost his business

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.989
too. He started a multi-billion dollar compensation claim against

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.989
the Russian state. But the Russian authorities accuse him of stealing

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.989
billions of dollars from a bank used to own.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.989
TRANSLATION: There is no court in Russia, that is why I went to the

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.989
International court. I am convinced I will win. The Russian state says

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.989
you effectively looted your bank after it was bailed out by the

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:11.989
Russian Central Bank. Lead you do that? Well, of course not. -- did

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.989
you do that? These are absurd accusation is not substantiated by

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.989
anything. We don't know who is telling the truth about Pugachev's

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.989
fortune, but the allegation is clear, Putin controls the super-rich

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.989
in Russia. People who possess a fortune, a large business in Russia,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.989
realise that they do not own this, because everything depends on Putin.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.989
They depend on hundred percent on his mood. -- 100%. For those who

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.989
have been in Putin Circle, the benefits have been immense. A

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.989
cellist who is godfather to Putin's daughter has a valuable stake in a

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.989
major Russian bank. A neighbour has an even bigger stake. Another

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.989
neighbour ended up running the railways. A childhood friend has

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.989
made a fortune from government contracts. And his brother has made

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.989
even more. The Americans say this is how Putin's Russia works. We have

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.989
seen him enriching his friends, his close allies. And marginalising

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.989
those who he doesn't view as friends. Using state assets. Whether

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.989
that is Russia's energy wealth, whether it is other state contracts,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.989
he directs those to whom he believes will serve him and excludes those

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:54.989
who don't. And if you want to make money in

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.989
Russia, this is the industry, the nation's greatest riches are in oil

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.989
and gas. Russia exports well over 1 billion barrels of oil per year. And

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.989
here too Vladimir Putin has been accused of taking a cut for himself.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.989
Putin came and established a system where high rank officials want to

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.989
control vital strategic assets. What we have now is a bunch of shady guys

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.989
who barely appear in public, who control vital businesses linked to

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.989
the state, which makes one wonder whether they are real beneficiaries

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:43.989
or somebody superpowerful is behind their back.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.989
I have come to New York to meet a man who says Putin took a slice of

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.989
his oil business. He is yet another Russian who has fled abroad. He says

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.989
his life has been threatened. This is his first TV interview.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.989
Max, I am Richard. Max Friedzon started his business in Saint

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.989
Petersburg when Putin was the deputy mayor. He gave him a monopoly to

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.989
supply oil to the local airport, but he says the help came at a price.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.989
TRANSLATION: I know from my business partner that Putin asked for a share

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.989
in the business. Initially, they were asking for 15%. He called them

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.989
greedy bastards. He managed to put them down to 4%. Obviously this

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:54.989
wasn't registered in any official papers. The Kremlin says Max's story

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.989
is untrue. But the Americans have highlighted another energy company

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.989
that they say Putin has links to. It is called Gunvor. According to the

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.989
Americans, Putin had secret investments in the company. What

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.989
exactly do you mean by investment is? We believe it's a place where he

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.989
is storing money. How much? I can't give you an estimate. Gunvor said

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.989
these frames were illogical and preposterous conspiracy theories,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.989
and that President Putin does not and never has had any ownership in

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.989
Gunvor. The Americans insist they are right. They haven't provided any

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:50.989
evidence. It's important because Gunvor has

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.989
traded much of Russia's state oil. It has made big profits, and nearly

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:04.989
half of the company was owned by this man, Gennady Timchenko, one of

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.989
Putin's friends. He has now sold his stake. It is said he is worth $10

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.989
billion. And he is on the US sanctions list. The Americans claim

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.989
his activities in the energy sector have been directed by President

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.989
Putin. Has Gennady Timchenko been holding well for Vladimir Putin, do

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.989
you think? I don't know if I would put it that way in terms of holding

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.989
his wealth, I would say he has been tremendous Lien Richard personally

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.989
by Vladimir Putin, as have another handful of people in his inner

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.989
circle. There are allegations that he holds tremendous amounts of

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.989
Putin's well. Gennady Timchenko's lawyers say the US has never

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.989
produced any evidence and that the claims are propaganda in which their

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.989
client is a collateral target. Mr Timchenko categorically denies that

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.989
President Putin has controlled his assets or enriched him, but to our

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.989
sources say Mr Timchenko was very much under the control of Vladimir

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:40.989
Putin. -- two of our sources. TRANSLATION: From the very start,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.989
Putin understood that money which Timchenko was managing, or one way

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.989
or another without any doubt, belonged to Putin. It was never a

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:02.989
secret. Mr Timchenko's lawyers say that our two main sources are not

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.989
credible and may have axes to grind. President Putin denies all the

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.989
allegations in this programme. His spokesman declined to answer our

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:20.989
absurd questions because the issues we had raised were pure fiction.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.989
This all matters because President Putin is one of the most powerful

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.989
people on the planet. But he has been accused of using that power to

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.989
enrich himself on a vast scale. TRANSLATION: I started arguing with

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.989
Shamalov and he said to me, who do you think you are? You are a series

00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:05.989
prefixerf. The tsar made a decision, your job is that of a surf to

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.989
deliver. -- a serf. People say that Putin can demand anything he wants,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.989
so that any figure on his wealth is meaningless. Everything that can be

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.989
converted into cash can be his own. How would you describe that kind of

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:36.989
wealth? Putin has been accused of corruption

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.989
on an extraordinary scale. The modern tsar who plundered his own

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
empire.
