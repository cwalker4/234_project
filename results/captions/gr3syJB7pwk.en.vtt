00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:01.723
STREET.

00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:03.958
WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.059
CONNECTION TO U.S./CHINA TRADE.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.461
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE ONGOING

00:00:06.462 --> 00:00:07.695
TRADE TALKS TO CONTINUE WITH

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:09.063
UNCERTAINTY OVER WHAT HAPPENS

00:00:09.064 --> 00:00:10.365
NEXT THE TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS.

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.201
THIS COMES AS HUAWEI IS SYNING

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.902
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OVER --

00:00:14.903 --> 00:00:16.938
SUING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OVER

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.873
THE LAW PASSED LAST YEAR WHICH

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:19.974
BARS THE COMPANY'S EQUIPMENT

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.110
FROM CERTAIN NETWORKS.

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:26.114
I SPOKE WITH JOHN BOLTON.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:27.382
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:27.715
LAWSUIT.

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:28.516
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THE

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:30.352
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE U.S.

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:30.752
GOVERNMENT?

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:33.355
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ASPECTS

00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:34.222
TO THIS.

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:35.657
YOU

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:35.690
NUU

00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:37.225
NUMBER ONE, THE UNITED STATES AS

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.161
WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES, ALLIES

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.296
AND FRIENDS OF OURS, SOMETIMES

00:00:41.297 --> 00:00:43.065
BACK DECIDED NOT TO PROCURE

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.633
HUAWEI EQUIPMENT FOR OUR

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.335
NATIONAL SECURITY RELATED

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:48.170
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND I

00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:49.504
THINK FOR VERY, VERY GOOD

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:50.172
REASON.

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:52.507
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ALSO

00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:53.575
INDICTED THE CHIEF FINANCIAL

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:55.410
OFFICER OF HUAWEI.

00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:57.312
THAT WAS NOT A POLITICAL ACT

00:00:57.313 --> 00:00:57.646
EITHER.

00:00:57.647 --> 00:00:59.147
SHE WAS ACCUSED OF FINANCIAL

00:00:59.148 --> 00:00:59.748
FRAUD.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.451
THE EXTRA DIGS

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:02.484
THE EXTRADIIGS

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:02.517
THE EXTRADITIS

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:03.885
THE EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS HAVE

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:05.620
BEGUN IN CANADA.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.090
IF AN AMERICAN COMPANY WITH AN

00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:09.491
AMERICAN CFO HAD DONE WHAT THE

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:10.592
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ACCUSED

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:11.827
HUAWEI OF, WE WOULD THROW THE

00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:14.229
BOOK AT THEM, AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.966
MARIA:  JOINING US NOW IS AUTHOR

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:18.467
GORDON CHANG.

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:19.601
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:20.235
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:20.936
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:01:20.937 --> 00:01:22.338
MARIA:  WHERE ARE WE ON THIS?

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:25.808
SAY WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:28.177
WHETHER OR NOT THIS BOEING

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:30.079
GROUNDED SITUATION THAT CHINA'S

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.416
GROUNDING THE 737-8 JET -- MAX

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:36.919
JETS IS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.353
TRADE STORY.

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:38.754
&gt;&gt; ON BOEING, FIRST OF ALL, I

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:40.489
THINK IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.690
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:44.960
CHINA HAS A BRAND-NEW COMPETITOR

00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.196
FOR THE 737 MAX SERIES AND

00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:50.432
THAT'S THEIR KOMAX919 WHICH IS

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:51.333
ABOUT TO BE SOLD.

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:52.835
SO I THINK CLEARLY THAT'S IN THE

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:54.203
BACK OF THE CHINESE MINDS WHICH

00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:55.871
IS THE REASON WHY THEY WERE

00:01:55.872 --> 00:01:58.040
AMONG THE FIRST TO ACTUALLY

00:01:58.041 --> 00:01:59.775
GROUND THE PLANE.

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:01.610
SO THERE ARE POLITICAL

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:02.911
CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS SAFETY

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:03.212
ONES.

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:04.813
MARIA:  WHERE ARE WE ON A DEAL?

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:05.748
&gt;&gt; WHO KNOWS.

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.816
IT CHANGES DAY BY DAY.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:08.884
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT EVERYONE

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:10.453
WANTS A DEAL BUT A DEAL'S NOT

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:12.588
GOING TO STAY TOGETHER BECAUSE

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.658
THE COMMUNIST PARTY GENETICALLY

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.426
CANNOT HONOR TRADE OBLIGATIONS.

00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:19.128
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A SERIES OF

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.929
DIFFICULT, I THINK DISCUSSIONS

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.364
WITH THE CHINESE BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:22.765
NOT GOING TO ENFORCE IT AND

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.800
WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO BACK

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:26.001
AND SNAP BACK TARIFFS AND ALL

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:26.836
SORTS OF THINGS.

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:28.170
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS KEEP THE

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.839
TARIFFS ON UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.873
STOP STEALING OUR STUFF AND THEY

00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:32.475
STOP THESE TRADE VIOLATIONS

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:35.044
WHICH HAVE GOTTEN WORSE UNDER

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:35.444
XI-JINPING.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:37.980
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THE TRUMP

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.081
ADMINISTRATION IF IT DOES A DEAL

00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:40.616
AND THE PRESIDENT IN PARTICULAR

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:42.652
ARE KIND OF LOSING THIS

00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:44.587
NEGOTIATION IF THEY GO AND DO A

00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:48.324
DEAL WITHOUT STRONG ENFORCEMENT

00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:49.825
MECHANISM,

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:51.761
MECHANISM HAVE THEY GIVEN IN?

00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:52.895
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE.

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:53.896
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:54.597
DO IT.

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:56.132
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS WE'VE

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.233
GOT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS RUNNING

00:02:57.234 --> 00:02:58.868
FOR PRESIDENT AND THERE ARE

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.903
THREE STATES, WISCONSIN,

00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:01.704
MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU'VE

00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:03.339
GOT A LOT OF BLUE COLLAR WORKERS

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.639
THERE.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.041
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY I'VE BEEN

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:07.376
BETRAYED, IF THE PRESIDENT DOES

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:07.677
THAT.

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:09.011
I'M NOT GOING TO RUSH TO

00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:10.079
JUDGMENT AND SAY THE PRESIDENT'S

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.148
GOING CAVE.

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.449
I THINK THERE IS A RUN OF STUFF

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.684
ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT WILL

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:16.319
FORCE HIM TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.621
&gt;&gt; IF A DEAL DOESN'T GET DONE,

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:19.555
THEN EVERYBODY'S SAYING WHAT'S

00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:20.690
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE MARKET.

00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:23.159
IT'S LIKE A LOSE, LOSE SCENARIO

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.459
HERE.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.495
&gt;&gt; HE CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT THE

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:25.929
STOCK MARKET.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.564
MARIA:  HE CAN'T CAVE ON THESE

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:27.897
ISSUES.

00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:29.799
THERE'S BEEN A TIPPING POINT IN

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.233
THIS SUBJECT.

00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:31.701
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT CHINA HAS

00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:32.602
BEEN DOING.

00:03:32.603 --> 00:03:33.970
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.206
SUCKING UP OUR INTELLIGENCE AT

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:37.807
EVERY POINT, WHETHER IT'S

00:03:37.808 --> 00:03:39.309
THROUGH ACADEMIA OR ACQUISITIONS

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.078
OR JUST TRANSFERRING TECHNOLOGY.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.546
HE CAN'T CAVE, JUST FROM WHAT

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:45.215
YOU SAID, JUST FROM THE

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:46.049
CONSTITUENTS IN ALL THOSE

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.382
STATES.

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:48.151
&gt;&gt; GOING BACK TO HUAWEI, THIS IS

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.487
A FIGHT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF

00:03:50.488 --> 00:03:53.323
THE 21st CENTURY WHEN YOU

00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:56.960
COMBINE 5G AND A.I. AND HUAWEI

00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:58.094
IS 5G.

00:03:58.095 --> 00:04:00.930
CLEARLY, THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGING

00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:02.332
IN ACTIVITIES LIKE DOWNLOADING

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:03.666
DATA FROM THE HEADQUARTERS OF

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:06.269
THE AFRICAN UNION FROM 2012 TO

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.638
2017 AND THE CHINESE DID THAT

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.373
WITH HUAWEI EQUIPMENT THAT THEY

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.242
DONATED TO THE A.U. WHEN THEY

00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:13.877
GAVE THEM THE BUILDING.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.812
CLEARLY, THIS IS NOT SOME SORT

00:04:15.813 --> 00:04:16.413
OF THEORETICAL ISSUE.

00:04:16.414 --> 00:04:19.182
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:21.384
CHINESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING.

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:26.256
WE'VE GOT AN FTC CASE AGAINST

00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:26.757
QUALCOMM.

00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:30.761
THE STAR WINS ON

00:04:30.762 --> 00:04:30.794
THE STAR WITS ON

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:30.828
THE STAR WITNEON

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:31.361
THE STAR WITNESS ON THE FIRST

00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:35.299
DAY OF THE TRIAL WAS HUAWEI.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.202
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT WEAK CAR SALES DATA

00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:39.436
OUT OF CHINA OVERNIGHT.

00:04:39.437 --> 00:04:42.473
WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT OF HOW

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:44.608
THE ECONOMY IS DOING AND HOW

00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:45.909
MUCH PRESSURE IS ON THE CHINESE

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.610
TO GET A DEAL DONE.

00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:48.545
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE IS CERTAINLY A

00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:48.812
LOT.

00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:50.080
THE CHINESE ECONOMY PROBABLY

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:50.981
STARTED TO CONTRACT IN DECEMBER

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:52.516
WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT NOT

00:04:52.517 --> 00:04:56.053
ONLY CAR SALES WHICH ARE DOWN

00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:58.021
13% IN DECEMBER --

00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:00.124
MARIA:  CONTRACT OR GROW SLOWER?

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:05.295
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, THIS IS CONTRACTION.

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:06.930
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THEY WERE

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.334
DOWN, WHICH MAKES MONTHS SEVEN

00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:11.769
AND EIGHT WHAT'S

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.002
AND EIGHT.WHAT'S

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:15.139
MARIA:  WHAT'S THE 6% NUMBER,

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.741
CHINA SAYS THEIR ECONOMY IS

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:18.142
GROWING 6%.

00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:22.413
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD A WELL-KNOWN CHINESE

00:05:22.414 --> 00:05:24.548
PROFESSOR IN BEIJING CREATED A

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:25.349
SENSATION ACROSS CHINA WHEN HE

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.251
SAID LOOK, OUR ECONOMY'S GROWING

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:30.154
NO MORE THAN 1.67 AND IT MAY BE

00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:30.554
CONTRACTING.

00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:32.756
YOU LOOK AT CAR SALES, THEY

00:05:32.757 --> 00:05:33.991
CLEARLY SHOW THAT RETAIL SALES

00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:35.292
WERE NOT UP IN THE MONTH.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.561
YOU SAW EXPORTS AND IMPORTS

00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:38.529
CRUMBLE IN DECEMBER.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.064
THEY WERE DOWN IN THE COMBINED

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:40.765
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY PERIOD.

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:42.566
MARIA:  THAT'S PASS

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:42.633
MARIA:  THAT'S FASS

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:43.000
MARIA:  THAT'S FASCINATING.

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:46.370
&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK AT THE PMIs FOR

00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:48.506
CRITICAL MANUFACTURING SECTOR,

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:49.206
THEY'VE BEEN NEGATIVE

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:49.640
CONSISTENTLY.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.008
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS ON

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.177
XI-JINPING TO GET A DEAL DONE?

00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:54.579
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S A LOT.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.848
THERE'S A LOT OF SNIPING FROM

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:57.281
THE SIDELINES.

00:05:57.282 --> 00:05:58.516
HE OWNS THE TRADE WAR.

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:01.352
HE OWNS THE SLUMPING ECONOMY.

00:06:01.353 --> 00:06:02.487
AND WHEN YOU'RE CHAIRMAN OF

00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:03.488
EVERYTHING AS THE PEOPLE SAY,

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:04.989
HE'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERYTHING.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.325
SO HE COULD ACTUALLY BE I THINK

00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:08.759
IN A VULNERABLE POSITION RIGHT

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.428
NOW BECAUSE OF THESE TWO ISSUES.

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:13.131
&gt;&gt; HE'S PROMISED HIS PEOPLE

00:06:13.132 --> 00:06:13.564
PROSPERITY.

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:14.866
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T GET

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:15.400
IT?

00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:17.602
WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR SOCIAL

00:06:17.603 --> 00:06:17.936
UNREST?

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:19.704
MARIA:  UNREST IN THE STREETS

00:06:19.705 --> 00:06:20.738
WHICH IS WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT.

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:24.676
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A BIG YEAR FOR

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:25.376
SENSITIVE ANNIVERSARIES, 100

00:06:25.377 --> 00:06:27.946
YEARS OF THE MAY 4th MOVEMENT,

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:29.647
706 YEARS SINCE THE FOUNDING OF

00:06:29.648 --> 00:06:30.615
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC.

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:33.518
MARIA:  ARE THEY GOING TO PUT AN

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.252
ENFORCEMENT ISSUE IN THERE?

00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:36.421
HOW WILL THEY ENFORCE THAT CHINA

00:06:36.422 --> 00:06:36.888
KEEPS PROMISES.

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.125
&gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE AN

00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:41.593
UNSUBSTANTIAL ENFORCEMENT

00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:43.128
PROVISION LIKE SNAPBACK TARIFFS.

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.362
THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE NEED TO

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:44.863
GO.

00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:47.599
THE CHINESE VIOLATE EVERY

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.966
AGREEMENT.

00:06:47.967 --> 00:06:49.000
MARIA:  KEEP THE TARIFFS IN

00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:50.101
PLACE AND --

00:06:50.102 --> 00:06:53.271
&gt;&gt; WE'RE PUTTING TARIFFS ON

00:06:53.272 --> 00:06:54.105
ALREADY.

00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:56.174
WHY DO YOU NEED SNAPBACK?

00:06:56.175 --> 00:06:58.944
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BAN THE IMPORT OF

00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:00.879
PRODUCTS THAT BENEFITED FROM THE

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.014
THEFT OF U.S. INTELLECTUAL

00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:04.349
PROPERTY, 3 TO $400 BILLION A

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.956
YEAR, SOME SAY MORE.
