00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:01.830
NARRATOR: Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.830
Ancient astronaut theorist,
Giorgio Tsoukalos,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.210
is at the home of
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.040
After examining all of
the material related

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
to the Majestic 12, she
believes that the most

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.790
compelling documents
are those that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.040
surfaced in Maryland in 1994.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.000
This, to me, this is the best
document that's been leaked.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's called Restricted
SOM1-01, Majestic 12 Group.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.750
And all of us, when we first
saw that title, Extraterrestrial

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.380
Entities and Technology,
Recovery and Disposal, one

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.420
of the first things that
everybody wanted to do

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.830
was find out, OK, did they
use this stamp in 1954

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.750
from the war office.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.250
Turns out that they did, all
the way up until the 60s.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.540
And one of the more
important pieces I think

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.920
is, as you go through here,
they found in a government

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.580
printing office--

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.120
take a look at this--
this is from a blow up,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.960
where they were doing a test.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.380
And look at this
"unauthorized", and look

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.420
at what happens to that z.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.620
It raises slightly.
- Right.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.460
So Bob went to the
government printing office

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.420
and found a guy named McCarter,
who was printing in the GPO

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.790
in Washington DC in 1954.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.460
And he took one
look at this text,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.710
and he said this was
done on monotype.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.960
I used it.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.460
And the z would collect
dust, and that's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.120
why the z's would print raised.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.920
So different steps
have been taken

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.170
to authenticate this document.
- Yes.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620
The fellow I spoke
to, he, fortunately,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.620
had been a long, long time
employee of the public printer

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.790
and had actually worked on the
kind of presses that he thought

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330
were appropriate
for this document.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.080
He said based on
the printing, I'd

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.790
say it clearly
was printed on one

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.670
of the presses in this
building or in this basement

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.620
of the Pentagon in 1954,
which is what it says.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.960
And then when you
start getting into what

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.670
is in this book, you
have the illustrations

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.960
and sketches of four
different categories

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.500
of different craft UFOs.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.040
And on this page,
here are the disks.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.460
Here is a long,
cigar shape, which

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.290
is described in this
document, as being

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.460
up to 1,000 feet in diameter.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.330
And then, this one, the
ice cream cone, and this,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.960
the triangle, and there
is a paragraph in here

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.960
that implies that we are dealing
with collaboration, that there

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.210
must be some agreement
between the United States

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.790
and the extraterrestrials.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.210
Really?

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.710
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
There is on this page 17,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.580
it's under Chapter
5, and it goes

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.750
into a, encounters initiated
by the extraterrestrial

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.420
biological entities.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.880
Possible contact may take
place as a result of overtures

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.040
by the entities themselves.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.540
In these instances, it is
anticipated that encounters

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.830
will take place at
military installations

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.250
or other obscure locations
selected by mutual agreement.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.710
This is--
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: By mutual?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.540
LINDA MOULTON HOWE: Yeah.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.920
1954.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.040
NARRATOR: According to
the Majestic 12 documents,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.420
the men who made up this group
and were in communication

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.250
with beings from
other worlds included

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.210
top scientists,
government officials,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.460
and high-ranking
military personnel.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.790
In 1954, President
Eisenhower supposedly

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.790
met with extraterrestrials
in Palm Springs

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.290
at Edwards Air Force Base,
otherwise known as Muroc.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.790
And there's a lot of
whistleblower testimony about

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.120
his presence at this meeting.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.620
He was just as probably
alarmed or shocked as anybody,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.420
you know, realizing
the larger picture.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.210
But with all the
whistleblower testimony

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.960
about these
different encounters,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.960
I pretty much side on the
fact that he did make contact.
