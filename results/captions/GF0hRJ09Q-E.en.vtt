00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:17.830
one thing I would say if you don't agree
with me then just keep it to yourself

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.810
hi I'm David Fletcher and I've been
asked to give you a talk about my five

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.820
worst tanks I'm not doing the best
because that's been done before I'm

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.070
gonna do the five most awful tanks we've
got because we're doing it in the tank

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.290
museum and because it's mainly British
tanks in here that's what you'll see I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.879
can't do foreign ones because we haven't
got any really awful foreign tanks in

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.550
the collection but for British ones
we've got some hideous things and I hope

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.350
you'll enjoy watching them if nothing
else now this is my number five in it's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.870
the British charioteer it was actually a
post-war tank but just so that you know

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.179
it's this yellow one on my right not
this thing on my left which is the AMX

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:13.640
13 somebody's put in it we've had to
come into a dark and dingy corner of the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.380
VCC to see it and you'll see that the
tank itself has been shoved up against

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.530
another tank here
you can't move down the side of it you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.270
can't get behind it and the turrets been
reversed apart from that it's perfect

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.689
but that's just the way I want to talk
about it now

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.110
the charioteer was built in a hurry and
it was an improvisation at the time

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.299
Major General Duncan was direct to Royal
armoured Corps and he was very concerned

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.759
that we would soon be at war with the
Russians

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.259
he never said the Russians but since
we're very rarely likely to be at war

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.439
with anybody else we assumed it was the
Russians now he therefore decided that

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.219
the Cromwell tank would have to
go into action again after the Second

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.890
World War but the Cromwell had a 75
millimeter gun which wouldn't even have

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.970
scratched heavy Russian tanks so general
Duncan suggested that he wanted the 20

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.890
pounder the new gun for the Centurion
and he wanted that on a cromwell chassis

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.480
now he went to various people like if
the rde who were the designers and told

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.100
them what he wanted and left it to the
technicians to design the tank

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.420
and charioteer was the result in fact
it's a horrible thing the turret besides

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.740
being enormous and it has to be enormous
because to give the gun any sort of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.380
elevation you need to have it all about
the level of the hull they didn't large

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.459
the turret ring I don't know how they
did that without I'm setting the tank

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.810
but they managed to enlarge the turret
ring but still not enough to get the gun

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.530
to go up and down so the turret had to
be bigger so the gun could do that now

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.410
the turret itself would have weighed so
much that it would have ruined the tank

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:17.690
so the turret has armor 1.5 inches thick
at the front which isn't really much at

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.760
all but it's even worse at the solids
the sides of this turret or one inch

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.800
thick that's about 25 millimetres it's
nothing and it means the thing is

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.320
virtually destroyable by anything that
cares to fire at it and sending it out

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.579
even with a bigger gun wasn't much of an
advantage because it was whatever

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.480
happened it was gonna get hit and the
crew were gonna get killed they'd done

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.070
away with the front hull machine gunner
although they sometimes set a man in

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.260
there in supreme discomfort and
otherwise it was a did the ordinary

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.540
cromwell chassis powered by the
rolls-royce meteor engine and christie

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.269
suspension it had it was quite an
automotive li quite a good chassis but

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.090
this turret and gan rue ended the gun is
what we called the 20 pound him in those

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.970
days it's about 84 millimeters caliber
and it was a very powerful anti-tank gun

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.030
but in this thing and this mounting up
so useless now you could say that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.010
charioteer was a tank destroyer like the
american vehicles because they were

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.919
often quite lightweight and designed to
destroy tanks and not worry too much

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.320
about incoming fire the trouble is that
chariot has got a coaxial machine gun

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.080
and with a cock that's a machine gun
alongside the main gun and anything with

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.750
a coaxial machine gun is automatic
a tank and they these things were issued

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.440
to the British territorial army as their
only tank available to defeat the big

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.610
Russian tanks and they wouldn't stand a
chance but that's how it was done and it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.370
was really the turret that makes it such
an awful tank and that's why it's on my

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.690
list but I'll tell you a bit of the
story about chariot here apart from

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.040
being seeing a bit of service with the
territorial army they were mostly sold

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.370
abroad countries like Austria and
Finland bought them and they were

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.240
supplied to the Lebanon and Jordan as
tanks they weren't all that effective

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.639
but in those days we didn't worry too
much as long as someone brought them and

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.690
got him off our hands we were quite
happy got rid of the ruddy tanks and

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.660
that was all that mattered this one was
actually kept as a sample and that's why

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.520
we've got in at Bovington we've since
painted it up in the markings of the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.190
Arab Legion so it's shown as a Jordanian
tank but it never was it never left this

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.630
country this particular one and it
really is one of the most dreadful tanks

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.490
that's ever been produced they one of
the problems they found with it was that

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.639
the when they fired the gun it produced
such a huge dense cloud of smoke that

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.260
the commander couldn't see what he'd hit
or followed it so quite often if he

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.590
could manage it the commander dismounted
walked to one side or the other to where

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.690
he could see and had the fourth man the
chap who was sat down here hauled into

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.800
the turret and made the gamma he fired
the gun he couldn't see what he was

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.250
firing at but the commander could but
you're not supposed to do things like

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.840
that with a tank it's silly but that's
the sort of thing they had to do to make

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.090
charioteer effective and if the russians
had allowed us to do that fine but they

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.740
wouldn't of course they had powerful
tanks that he could knock out our tanks

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.189
easily and this was the easiest one of
all to look

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:07.189
so that's really why I've elected to
include it in my list of the worst tanks

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:15.389
now Black Prince is on my list of worst
tanks and you may wonder why you may

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.469
think it looks pretty good it comes at
the end of the war it's got a powerful

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:25.349
gun and you may think yourself well this
is crazy but there was a reason and I'll

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:29.009
come to it in a minute
Black Prince was designed by Vauxhall

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:34.169
Motors which is why it looks very much
like a Churchill in fact it was

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:39.810
originally portrayed as the large
Churchill before the people at Vauxhall

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.819
decided to call it Black Prince and I
was going to say it may have been known

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:49.349
as Black Prince to its friends but never
had any friends so I don't see how they

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:53.129
could do that but anyway that was what
they did it's really a Churchill but

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:57.930
what they've done is made it wider and
of course heavier because they wanted to

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.300
get a 17 pounder gun in it's got the 17
pounder mark six gun can actually

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.469
mounted with the bees on the top they
own the turret and a slightly lower

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:12.180
front end they thought that by lowering
it they'd improved the drivers view I

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.629
don't really know when they did or not
but that's what they were trying to do

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:22.740
at the time now the tank itself was
pretty heavy to start off with it

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:28.800
weighed 50 tons which was as much as
really anyone wanted to tanked away at

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.659
that time of the war at the end of the
war really and 40 was considered heavy

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:38.969
enough and that applied to the later
Churchill's but 50 was a little bit over

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:44.490
the top but they decided they wanted an
infantry tank with the 17 pounder they'd

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.820
already got the a 30 they were designing
the Centurion which had the same gun but

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.709
in a slightly better turret so quite why
they did built this at all I have no

00:08:55.709 --> 00:09:00.600
idea but they built six of them as
prototypes and this is the only one

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.180
that's left this is number four in the
series as you can see it's got a church

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.709
or type suspension but running on wider
tracks because obviously it's carrying

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:14.670
more weight
but the armor is actually no thicker at

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.800
its thickest and the armour on a number
a mark seven Churchill its 152

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.860
millimeters at the front which is six
inches which simbad but they could have

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.140
made this a lot thick a lot heavier but
the real reason why I think this is such

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.340
a dreadful tank is because in the back
it's got the same bedford

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:43.670
twin six engine as the Churchill and
when I said that it's the same engine

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:49.590
it's the same horsepower 350 horsepower
as you've got in a Churchill yet a

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.660
church always 40 tons and this thing
weighs 50 and what they discovered of

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:00.930
course was that that engine in a 50 ton
tank would only drive the tank at 11

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:06.750
miles an hour which is pathetic really I
mean even a tiger could do more than

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:13.020
twice that but this thing could only do
11 miles an hour on a good day with a

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.300
following wind uphill it was even worse
so that was the one reason that I've

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.490
elected this tank to be one of the most
awful tanks we produce why they didn't

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.850
put a bigger engine I don't know
they reckon they could have put the

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:32.490
rolls-royce meteor in the rolls-royce
meteor is 600 horsepower and probably

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.390
would have driven this tank at about 22
miles an hour which is quite respectable

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.940
but it would have meant installing the
engine slightly leaning over you'd have

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.200
to do it an angle because I hadn't left
enough room for it and in around the

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.250
engine covers at the top there but that
isn't impossible you could have done

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:55.080
that and it would have worked perfectly
well like that but they didn't do it for

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:01.680
some reason and then the thing goes with
this old engine and nothing nothing else

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.820
in the back we've tried to drive it and
you find this is exactly the same

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:12.000
problem now even the gearbox is quite
novel it's a 5-speed gearbox whereas the

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.110
original Churchill he'll do the
Churchill's the 708 had a four-speed

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.870
gearbox and with the gearbox they found
that they had five gears running pretty

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:27.750
close together
and what they did was made sure that the

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.130
driver changed gear quickly if you
change gears slowly with this weak

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:39.150
engine pushing you along the tank would
stop in one and a half seconds that was

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.140
all it took to bring this tank to a
grinding halt and you'd have to start

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.610
from first and work your way through the
gears again so as you went up the

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.860
gearbox it was crucial to change gear
quickly so that the tank still had some

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.460
momentum when you got up to the next
gear and that's one of the other

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.690
failings with it but the real failing
and the thing that is hardest to explain

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:08.010
is why they fitted it with this idiotic
old engine the meadows of the Bedford

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:14.640
flat 12 was really considered a bit out
of date by then anyway so why install it

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.529
in a new tank but they did and that's
why it's on my list of really dreadful

00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:29.459
tanks it doesn't need to be that slow
but it is this is number three and I've

00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:33.690
chosen this because it's an amphibious
tank in fact it's the only truly

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:39.230
amphibious tank we've got in the museum
it's actually l1 III the

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:44.490
vickers-armstrong amphibian that came
out just before the war and the reason

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:51.779
that I'm selecting it for one of my most
awful tanks is because it suffers in the

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:57.720
same way as all these light amphibious
tanks do from the conundrum if you like

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.300
that in order to float it's got to be as
light as possible which means very thin

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:11.400
armor but in order to resist an D tank
fire it needs to have reasonably thick

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.680
armor and it's a conundrum that they
can't really sort out this particular

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.380
tank actually has a hull of very thin
armor inside and it's surrounded by

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.360
these floats which are sort of kapok
filled made of aluminium and they're

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.450
supposed to keep it buoyant in the water
but really the whole thing is is a joke

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:39.180
of a tank it's not bulletproof in any
the word apart from with the revolver

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.730
maybe for a while from a distance but
that's really what I want to show you is

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.990
the whole fact that all the amphibious
tanks although they seem to be

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:54.210
incredible because they can go on land
and water are in fact almost completely

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.040
useless the other trouble with these
vehicles is they're good enough at going

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.960
on land they're very fast on land in
fact in the water they're pretty good

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.000
and I'll show you why in a minute but
it's getting out the water they have a

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.130
problem with if they they can choose
where they go in that they can't always

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.300
choose where they come out and if where
they come out is very muddy they're

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.010
likely to get stuck if there are loads
of reeds there they're likely to get

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:28.350
snarled up in them and not climb up the
bank so that's always a drawback with

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.420
all these amphibians they're good enough
on land and good enough in the water but

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.910
absolutely hopeless when it comes to
getting out the water now I'd like to be

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.440
able to show you the amphibious nature
of it it's not that easy but you've got

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.870
the drive sprockets at the front on each
side and the drive sprocket drives a

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:55.170
shaft from each drive sprocket the shaft
goes back to the propellers the

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.510
propellers are in one owners quart
nozzles the propeller is surrounded by a

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:08.280
rudder it's like a tin shroud if you
like and the two propellers go left and

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.970
right as you'd expect and the brother
goes with them

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:17.130
so for steering it's actually very
effective in the water but that doesn't

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.770
really solve the issue the fact that out
on the water

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:24.780
they're completely and utterly useless
as tanks it's armed with a single

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.460
Vickers machine gun which is probably
better than spitting at people but only

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.839
just and that's on the side in this case
because we've turned the turret around

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:40.430
and it has a crew of two a driver in the
front here and a commander in the turret

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:46.890
but although it may look the part
it really is utterly useless and you

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:52.279
wonder why they bother to produce them
this vehicle came out before the war as

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:57.500
I say it was tested they weren't very
happy with it they put it away while

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.990
they had a war they thought they'd sort
of test it afterwards in 1945 it was

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:08.899
dragged out again and started up and
they gave it another test but they never

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:12.680
got any further with it they only built
the one they never built more than one

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:21.019
thank goodness and this is it just one
really horrible and pointless tank built

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:26.750
for for no good reason by the fact that
they could build it I think and that's

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.589
it really it's not a lot it's powered by
a Meadows engine so it's actually quite

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:36.290
powerful but absolutely hopeless as a
fighting tank which is what they're

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:45.050
really meant for so it seems silly right
we're going to look now at the

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.390
Covenanter this is number two in my list
and it's done for a reason because it is

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:56.810
really an awful tank by general
consensus as much as anything else to

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.160
start off with the tank was built
originally by the London Midland and

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.530
Scottish railway company who weren't
actually probably the ideal people to

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.150
design the tank but they had help from
the department of tank design and oddly

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:16.069
enough I mean it's such a good-looking
tank then it's difficult to see how it

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:22.579
could be so awful but it is originally
when it was designed they decided to

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:29.450
make it the first all welded tank it was
gonna be constructed of armour plate but

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.790
welded together so it didn't require any
internal frame now the trouble was the

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.380
LMS company the railway company this
building it didn't have welders they had

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.330
riveters and they persuaded the
Department of tank design to have the

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:50.480
tank riveted with riveting you need a
frame to rivet the armor to and that

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.230
immediately puts up the weight the next
problem was the wheels the original idea

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.690
was to make these wheels of aluminium
alloy because that was lighter

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:07.220
and they've discovered to their horror
that the Royal Air Force had put an

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.710
absolute ban on anyone else using alloys
except themselves because they needed it

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.640
for aircraft construction for that
reason the wheels are made of armoured

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.460
steel they're good and strong but they
put the weight up again and in fact but

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.810
the time they'd finish doing all this
the extra framing and the extra weight

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:31.850
of the wheels they'd already reached the
limit of what this tank could support as

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.590
far as weight is concerned and they did
nothing towards putting that right they

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.720
just hoped for the best
it's powered by a horizontally opposed

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.640
12 cylinder Meadows engine which is in
the back of course behind the turret and

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.230
it's got the radiators here at the front
and we'll come to them in a minute but

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.630
first of all the weight is the big
problem the fact that they designed it

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:02.240
as a welded tank gone over to riveting
and that had really brewing the tank to

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:10.490
start off with the rest of it mediocre
at the best it was really too small the

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:17.450
thing was that the design was terrific
and this amazing selection of horizontal

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:22.490
Armour was tremendously good because she
the one thing you don't need is any

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:28.670
vertical face of armor that will absorb
fire you want it as horizontal as you

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:33.530
could get it and with the hull they had
done that they made it almost flat all

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.480
the way back it's hardly a vertical face
on it with the turret it's slightly

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.350
different you've got a vertical face at
the front but notice how the turret

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.000
comes out at the sides it sort of
appears to bulge out now the reason for

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.320
that was because they've lowered the
hell there's sort of Headroom in it they

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.460
wanted as much room as possible for the
crew to use their elbows there's three

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:01.070
men in that turret and they needed room
so that if they moved an elbow to pick

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:05.630
up around or something they'd have room
to put it without banging the sides

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:12.260
that's why the turrets this weird
language shape at the top but the real

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.000
mistake with this tank was placing the
radiators

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.260
in the front and the engine in the back
there are two radiators under this

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.810
armored louver here and they're both
there to cool the engine now the engine

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:30.220
as I say is a horizontally-opposed 12
cylinder by meadows quite an effective

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:36.040
engine in its own way but you don't if
you're designing a tank at home don't

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.080
Kevin say put the radiator in a
different place to the engine it's just

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:47.020
not meant to go there the result is that
you've got the radiator at the front and

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:52.270
every single one of these tanks when
they left the factory had developed a

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:57.010
serious cooling problem usually with the
radiator boiling or something like that

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.140
and it was all to do with where it was
they did try and remedy it they kept

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.640
trying to change it they kept changing
the layout of the cooling fans on top

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.570
and everything else to try and make it
work a bit more reasonable but it didn't

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.490
it just continued to be a fault and it
meant that of over 1200 of these tanks

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:24.850
built none now at all were ever accepted
for combat they were only ever used for

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:30.460
training and that at a time when in this
country we were desperate for tanks the

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:36.010
Covenant had got pushed aside and became
a training tank I've had it suggested to

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:42.010
me that had we put a bigger gun in later
on it would have made a good and quite

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:49.900
reliable reconnaissance tank but really
this is a tank designed in 1938 and it's

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:56.200
got all the faults over 1938 tank it
just isn't fit for a battlefield of 1944

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.850
so that idea went out the window
straight away the tank had a 2 pounder

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:05.050
gun in the turret and that was all it
was capable of carrying couldn't carry

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:09.400
anything more if they wanted to so that
was that but this is the real problem

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.470
with his tank is putting the radiator at
the front it meant that all the coolant

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.550
all the pipes carrying coolant passed
around the side of the fighting

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.230
compartment so that whatever the man
lives out and touched he was liable to

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.060
scold him because it was pretty hot and
it meant that the turret itself got very

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.570
warm
which is okay in a cold climate but not

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.740
so hot in the desert you don't want a
warm tablet when you're already been

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:41.470
roasted by the Sun otherwise it's quite
a reasonable tank and it's got a

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:46.600
Christie suspension it's quite fast but
its trouble is not always gonna go very

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.340
well and when it breaks down which this
thing did regularly it's nothing but

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.260
trouble they were originally gonna put a
full Wilson transmission in here but

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.460
that's something else they decided not
to do so the tanks got an ordinary crash

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:08.680
gearbox and Meadows gearbox and then two
and botan units of epicyclic drive by

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.660
Wilson on the side and that's all it's
got it hasn't got a proper sort of

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.860
modern transmission at all and there
they had better ones available at the

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:23.260
time so that's the Covenanter it doesn't
look bad but it is it really was a

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:30.040
dreadful tank not the worst not quite
but nearly so and certainly as far as

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.300
the army was concerned in the Second
World War one of the worst tanks of all

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.160
because it was only fit for training
they were never used operationally and

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:47.320
that's a bad a quite an indictment by
itself right now what we going to look

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:53.230
at next is a 38 valiant and this is the
top of my list for the tanks that are

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.160
really awful there is nothing in the
whole tank museum more dreadful than

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.080
this thing and I mean that quite
sincerely but we'll talk about it anyway

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:09.610
for a start it was designed as a heavy
assault tank it was designed to have 114

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:14.470
millimeters of frontal armor which it's
actually got but it's such a large ugly

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.450
car slump as you can see because it was
built rather like the old Matilda -

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:26.530
we've bolted together castings but this
thing here this sort of molded section

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:33.520
was an absolute trap for the driver
it meant that once the driver got in he

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.890
was in severe danger for a start if he
moved the gear leaver over to first gear

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.340
he got trapped behind the battery box
and actually needed a crowbar to get it

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:49.559
out again which doesn't sound very ideal
for changing gear they also had an

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:55.230
arrangement whereby to use the brake he
had to use his heel rather than his toe

00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:00.500
and there was always a danger that his
foot would slip between the two pedals

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:07.039
and one of the results of that was that
if the foot slipped he got trapped

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:11.070
literally the man couldn't get out they
said the only way really to get him out

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:15.750
was chop his leg off which doesn't sound
all that healthy either the third thing

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.169
was that he has a seat which raises and
lowers here now the trouble with it is

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:26.220
that in the raised position it ends up
with him sticking his head out of this

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.679
hatch here and the back of the armor
clouding him on the back of the head all

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:36.659
the time and they said that the only
time they ever tested this vehicle which

00:25:36.659 --> 00:25:41.340
was a suspension test across country
Drive the driver got out after a while

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.870
and said if he stayed in any longer he
be crippled and that was one of the

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.309
worse things about it but the whole
design is awful I mean this huge turret

00:25:50.309 --> 00:25:56.669
which designed to take a six pounder or
a 75 millimeter gun also although you

00:25:56.669 --> 00:26:00.539
can't see it so well from here at the
back that's we'll get a close-up in

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:05.789
later on the back of it is only nine
inches off the ground and that really is

00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:10.169
too low it means that the tank going
over a bump is going to bottom on

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:14.789
whatever it hits and each of the
suspension arms it's based on the

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:19.370
Valentine really built by are designed
by Vickers when are built by them the

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:26.309
suspension arms are on wishbones and
each one is fed by its own type of oil

00:26:26.309 --> 00:26:33.480
and liquid to keep it going and those
bits and pieces underneath the tank are

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.750
likely to get wiped out when it's going
over any sort of rough ground at all so

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.549
it means if this tank is traveling over
say Goss or anything like that the

00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:49.020
chances are a half the suspension is
going to be ripped off inside and that's

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.640
not all that convenient either so all in
all it really is a dreadful tank

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.460
it's powered by a GMC Diesel same as a
Valentine but it's so much heavier

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.950
that's also chronically slow so it
hardly got a thing going for it really

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:10.919
this thing it really is a dreadful
design and as I say that officer in

00:27:10.919 --> 00:27:16.710
charge of the trials called the trials
off because the tank was so awful and

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:22.770
made so many mistakes that he hauled the
crew out of it and took him home

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:28.710
and decided not to go on with the test
at all the tank is really unpleasant and

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:34.830
uncomfortable to travel around him and
that was used after the war as an

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:40.230
example the what was then called the
armoured school used to get a load of

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.220
young officers and line them up and then
as a special treat

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.309
a 38 valiant used to drive past them and
they'd watch it go by and then it would

00:27:50.309 --> 00:27:55.770
stop and their job was to go over it and
find out how many awful things they had

00:27:55.770 --> 00:28:00.630
going for it they there's no record as
where anybody found them all but it's

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:06.840
quite enough things in this tank to make
it absolutely horrible and really when

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.710
you think that it was produced at the
end of the war it was actually built by

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.480
Rustin and Hornsby limited in Lincoln
but it was a Vickers design because it's

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.540
based on the Valentine and when you
think that this is at the end of the war

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:26.250
we've made enough mistakes up till then
so why we came up with this dreadful

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.120
thing I have no idea
so here we are it's the worst tank in

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.500
the world as far as I'm concerned and
that is why I've elected it to be my

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:40.530
number one tank it's got all the faults
that you can hope for in one vehicle and

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.649
really is an excellent example the most
awful kind of tank you'll find anywhere
