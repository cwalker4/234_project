00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.100
Our skin colour was beaten into us 
as nothing but pure evil.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.160
We we to be ashamed of it. We were illegitimate, our mothers were whores, our fathers were savages

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.260
and we had to pay for those sins.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.900
Do you know anything at all about your parents?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.080
Basically no, it would be easier to break
through CIA, KGB files than to get through

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.100
information on my background.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.880
From when I was a little girl, I knew I was
black, at the age of 4 and a half

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.120
I knew what the word nigger meant...

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.600
They just don’t see your Irish side. Listen
to me. I’m speaking with a Dublin accent!

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.720
Countless children in Ireland suffered abuse
in institutions run by the Irish Catholic church.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.220
But this is the story of the illegitimate
children born to Irish mothers and African

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.720
fathers in Ireland in 50’s and 60s.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.740
The abuse and racist treatment of the children
has never been acknowledged by the Irish Catholic

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.460
church or the Irish state and the secrets
of their identities remain hidden.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.820
We didn’t look like a community. But we
are a community. You know. We are there.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.120
We are in Ireland, you know, 
we are experiencing racism.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.120
People discovering their mother only died
only a year ago and they’d been 40 years

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.240
searching and given the impression they’d
no parents. Unbelieveable miscarriage of justice

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.440
and nobody seems to accept responsibility
for this.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.600
The state just devolved all powers around
education and childcare and health to the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.810
religious - the state didn’t want to know,
the nuns and priests had complete control

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.340
- they were like gods.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.660
Mixed race illegitimate children were very
rarely put up for adoption.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.960
The majority were placed into industrial schools.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.580
These were institutions that were run by the
Irish Catholic Church to care for children.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.660
They used euphemisms like convents or orphanages.
They were industrial schools. They were like

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.810
workhouses. The last thing they had in these
places was love, care, attention or the welfare

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.069
of a child.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.300
When you’ve been in an institution for 18
years and called nigger, wog, golliwog, beaten

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.940
stripped, sexually abused. You know why you
are there. You know why you’re there.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.120
You know you’re there because your mother 
didn’t want to look after you.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.200
I never met my father. I was never interested
in meeting my mother if I’m really honest.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.700
Rosemary has spent her adult life trying to
trace records of her father.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.520
But it’s almost impossible to find anything
because all information about him has been redacted

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.020
by the Irish state.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.240
At 3 I was sent to this dreadful couple.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.340
I’ve got a letter somewhere.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.880
This is where she says that we are rotting
her beds. I’m not keeping them any longer.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.500
Yeah. We are filthy dirty. We were three years
old

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.960
Rosemary now lives in London and has decided
to travel back to Ireland in an attempt to

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.260
search for information about her father.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.180
This is the first time in 40 years that she
will go back to St Joseph’s Industrial School

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.580
in Kilkenny where she was abused as a child.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:06.480
From Day one i was picked on. The daily micro
humiliations designed to keep you in your

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.940
place cos you not one of us. You need to be
grateful you’re even here, you’re not

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.700
as good as the rest of us, cos they’re white.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.020
They're white.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.400
Scrubbing the colour off my skin. Not being
allowed to have a bath first.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.160
The water would get dirty.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.360
That’s what Kilkenny means to me but it
also means meeting my son’s father.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.320
Meeting a man who gave me 
love for the first time… (Cries)

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.040
I think this is it. This is it. My God
that’s it.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.380
I thought they’d torn it down or something.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.660
The word must have got out there was a black
girl coming but all these girls were standing

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.840
there just looking at me and I’m looking
at them and I don’t know what the hell is going on.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.000
They used to take photographs of us here.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.320
Somewhere there’s an archive of school photographs
and my little black face is peeking out.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.160
This was the nun’s bit and we were in the
grey buildings. We were in those nasty buildings.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.360
What an ugly fucking building. No wonder I
was clinically depressed for the ten years

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.520
I was here. Ugh.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.199
These are the playing fields.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:45.330
This was the production site of the industrial
school. But I also remember being left in

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.680
the chicken coup. That was a common punishment.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.270
You’d be taken out to play and the older
girls had responsibility for you.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.220
But that’s when they would
take turns sexually abusing you as well.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.990
They’d say I’m going to take you to the toilets,
you need to a wee, you need to go for a wee.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.229
So they’d take you into the toilets and
do what the fuck they liked with you and the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.600
nuns didn’t say anything because they had
completely insulated themselves,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.240
wrapped themselves in luxury.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.480
Rape and sexual abuse were endemic 
in industrial schools

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.640
and orphanages run by the Irish Catholic Church.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.280
Whilst the sexual abuse of children at St
Joseph’s was documented in the Ryan Report,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.280
the ill-treatment of mixed race children has never
been acknowledged.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.360
Does it feel very strange being back?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:46.120
I feel incredibly removed from it. I don’t
even know if I have any emotion about it.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.760
I mean memories of this place just make me
feel dead inside.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.080
When Rosemary was 16 she became pregnant and
had to leave St. Joseph’s.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.680
Her son was put into a church run mother and
baby home and Rosemary was fostered by Brian

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.160
and Mary, who welcomed her into their family.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.960
Rosemary came to us when she was just turned
17 and because Rosemary had just had a baby

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.960
the nuns, and the whole of Irish society,
believed that there was no way she could either

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.200
go back to school or go back to the orphanage
where she had been.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.840
That’s my first novel, it’s American edition.
That’s what I would have looked like exactly

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.950
when she came. That was that same year.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.500
The reason the nuns had rung my wife and asked
me would we take Rosemary was because we had

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.880
adopted a little girl some time before that.

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.880
My wife stood outside the Winns Hotel in Dublin. 
The Winn’s Hotel was where the priests and

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:03.490
the nuns went for their afternoon tea. And
a young nun drove up, skidded to a stop, dumped

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.380
this creature on the street and said ‘thanks
very much’ and drove off. That’s how she

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.479
came into our lives, one week after she had
turned, her 17th Birthday and a week or two

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.759
after she had had the baby taken.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.480
How was she when she arrived?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.100
She had an air of bravado. Think my wife found
her quite exciting and a bit adventurous because

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.720
my wife was a, wasn’t exactly the adventurous
type. She was very kind and very generous.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.140
Physically she wasn’t in good shape. I realised
in fact she was emaciated.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.920
She’d never talked about her experiences?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.360
When she got to trust us she began to talk.
I asked her would she write it down.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:48.300
The most important part was that she was being
treated as a sex object even within the orphanage.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.920
But no way I could have used that in the Ireland
of the 70’s cause there was no-one who would

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.640
have listened to me, no-one would have believed
me. And even today it’s hard to say it.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.040
These mixed race Irish children were not considered
by the church and state to be appropriate

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.970
candidates for adoption. Their stories of
racial discrimination, physical abuse and

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.080
mental abuse, are truly shocking.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.600
Anne Ferris is a former member of the Irish
Parliament. She was adopted herself and has

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.399
spent her career campaigning in the Irish
parliament for a bill to allow adopted children

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.750
access to their family records.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.280
Do you think there was a different policy to deal with children of mixed race?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:43.480
I don’t know, I really don’t know whether
there was a policy, you know, say a state

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:50.029
policy or a religious policy coming from on
high. But certainly, listening to the stories,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:58.440
there was a policy in the various institutions
or orphanages that the mixed race people were in.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.740
In Northern Ireland if you’re adopted you
can go and get your records. In England you

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.400
can get your records. Here we can not get
our records, we can’t get them.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.680
And that’s wrong. Of course it’s an 
abuse of a person’s human rights.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.240
Jude, who’s now in his 70s, has been searching
for the identify of his parents for over 50 years.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:37.739
All I know is that my father was from Trinidad.
Now, I still don’t know whether that’s

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:41.720
the truth or not. And my mother was from Carlow.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.160
Slowly as you move on in life you realise
that some of it might be deliberately kept from you.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.269
I realised something’s not right here,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.520
There seems to be a barrier that you can not
break through. And you wonder, why is that?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.920
You know?

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.720
Denise moved to London in her early 20s after
both of her adoptive parents died.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.199
She has also been searching for many years for more
information about the identity of her father.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.680
If you are born to an Irish mother and there
is nothing there that leads you to your father

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.520
you either have to create one or be messed
up with out it

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.960
because you haven’t got it there to, you know...

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.670
One of the reasons why I’ve never really
fitted in because I’m not white and Irish

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:51.009
but I have Irish sensibilities that have stood
to me in this country, you know. So all in

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:56.269
all I think I fared well. I balance, my my
two identities.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.240
I know where I come from, I know where my
history comes from but I’m not going to

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.120
let it hold me back.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.959
Rosemary believes she knows her father’s
name and that he once studied medicine in

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.080
Dublin but beyond this she has very little
information to go on.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.240
I’ve spent years trying to track this name
down - it’s like the name doesn’t exist.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:36.040
So I must admit as I’ve gotten on I’ve thought
maybe the name I think I have isn’t even my name.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.000
This is the magic room. I’m so nervous.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.960
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness. Ohhh wow.
Ohhh.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.800
So this is the register of Apothecaries Hall
and it lists the people as they sit their examinations.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.280
So he’s here.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.080
Amijo Adaser that’s him.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.880
And the address is given as Gold Coast, it’s
Ghana.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.320
There’s his name.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.080
Now it says here that he’s a graduate of
Paris University.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:13.480
So he’s already a GP by the time he got
here. 498, Student 498.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.160
There he is.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.680
Is it possible for me to take a photograph?

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.720
I thought nigger and savage were pet names.
I actually thought it was my pet name.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.760
Always, come here N, always called savage. You’re
father was a savage, he was a cannibal, he

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:37.520
was this, he was that. And I got this every
single day, day and night, there was no exceptions.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:48.760
So, you know I’m just looking at this and
it’s like Fuck you all. There we go.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.149
This skin here was considered a disability
therefore I was defective by reason of my

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.000
father’s anecestry. My father was, now I can prove, was a physician.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.720
You know it’s
like. Fuck’em.
