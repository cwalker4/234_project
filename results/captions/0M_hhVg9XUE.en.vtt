00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.310
One of the most mysterious characters in A
Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones is

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.800
Varys, the “master of whisperers” – or
“spymaster” – at King’s Landing, also

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.280
called “the Spider” for his “vast web
of informers”. Varys is a schemer and a

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.000
manipulator , a master of disguise and illusion, and a keeper of secrets. Whenever anything

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.740
important happens at court, he’s there – watching,
whispering, “spin[ning] his secret webs”.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.199
What’s this guy up to? Who is he, really, and what does he want?

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.860
Let’s start at the beginning. Varys was
born not in Westeros, but in a city called

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.010
Lys , as “an orphan boy”, and apparently
a slave . He tells us that he grew up with

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.430
a “troupe of mummers” – mummers are
actors, or performers – but one day in Myr,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.280
he was sold to a sort of a sorcerer, who cut
off Varys’ cock and balls and burned them

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.320
in a magic ritual. Varys was left for dead
on the streets, but he managed to survive

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.910
and became a great thief . When he was driven
from Myr, he went to Pentos, and formed a

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.810
“criminal partnership” with a young Illyrio
Mopatis. Varys trained children to work for

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.340
him as thieves, like a sort of a Fagin without
balls , and came to learn that “Secrets

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.720
are worth more than silver or sapphires”
– so Varys’ thieves stole information,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.560
which eventually made Varys and Illyrio rich
and powerful. Meanwhile, in Westeros, King

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.259
Aerys Targaryen was going mad, convinced that
everyone around him was plotting against him

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.409
– so when Aerys heard about Varys’ “talents”,
he brought him to King’s Landing to serve

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.560
as his “spymaster” . In the following
years, Varys “crouch[ed] at the king’s

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.329
side, whispering in his ear” like Grima
Wormtongue, feeding Aerys’ paranoia , which

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.850
probably contributed to Aerys’ madness,
and ultimate downfall in Robert’s Rebellion.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.810
It doesn’t seem that Varys intended this,
though, because he apparently tried to stop

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.820
Aerys from opening his gates to the Sack of
King’s Landing . Anyway, Varys continued

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.380
in his role as master of whisperers under
the new king, Robert Baratheon. He learned

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.540
all the secret passageways around the Red
Keep , he built up his network of spies – mostly

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.439
mute children who he calls “little birds”
, and he solidified his power, by making people

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.539
need him, convincing them that he’s on their
side , making sure he’s too useful – and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.520
knows too much – to be gotten rid of .
And eventually the series begins. Varys’

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.110
actions, as seen through the eyes of Eddard
and Tyrion and others – are… confusing.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.060
In Book 1, Varys warns Ned that the Lannisters
want to kill Robert , he reports on Daenerys

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.190
Targaryen to the small council using Jorah
as his spy , though we later find out Varys

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.250
also protects Dany . Varys suggests the dismissal
of Barristan Selmy from the Kingsguard , and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.599
he tries to save Eddard from execution . In
Clash, Varys is helpful and almost friendly

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.610
with Tyrion , helping him run the city, and
protect his relationship with Shae, but in

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.819
Storm he testifies against Tyrion in his trial
, but then he helps save Tyrion from execution

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.410
and leads him to kill Tywin before sending
him to Pentos. Then Varys disappears from

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.879
King’s Landing , leaving a coin in the dungeons
that makes Cersei mistrust the Tyrells , and

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.030
he’s gone for all of Feast, but at the end
of Dance, he turns up out of nowhere, and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.900
murders Pycelle and Kevan Lannister . What’s
he trying to achieve with all this, what’s

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.209
the goal here? It’s really hard to see Varys’
motivations, because he does everything indirectly,

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.360
and secretly, and subtly, but it is possible
to piece together his grand plan.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.000
Back in the very first book, we see that Varys
is conspiring with his “old friend” Illyrio

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.620
Mopatis, who arranges the marriage between
Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo. We’re

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.489
told that the plan at this point is to use
Drogo’s Dothraki army to invade Westeros

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.549
and crown Dany’s brother Viserys as King
. But Viserys dies, then Drogo dies, and Daenerys

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.140
ends up the queen of Meereen, so in the show,
the plan now seems to be to help Daenerys

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.560
take over Westeros . But in the books, it’s
more complex. There’s this boy called Young

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.200
Griff, who Varys and Illyrio claim is actually
Aegon Targaryen, the son of Prince Rhaegar,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.220
and nephew of Daenerys, widely believed to
have been killed as an infant during Robert

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.569
Rebellion . Varys and Illyrio say they secretly
rescued Aegon from the war , and have been

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.790
raising him ever since to be a perfect king
for Westeros .

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.269
Which raises the question of what they were
planning to do with Viserys – Viserys and

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.220
Aegon can’t both be king. One likely explanation
is that Varys and Illyrio lied , and never

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
actually intended for Viserys to be King – and
why would they? He’s crazy , and cruel,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.229
and would obviously make a bad ruler . Aegon,
on the other hand, seems a pretty decent kid,

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.150
and has a better claim to the Throne, and
has been “shaped for rule since before he

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.500
could walk” by Illyrio and Varys’ people
– they clearly want Aegon, not Viserys,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.130
on the Throne. So why do they try to give
Viserys a Dothraki army, why tell him to invade

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.350
Westeros? The plan seems to have been to use
Viserys’ Dothraki invasion of Westeros as

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.380
a way of destabilising and distracting Westeros,
making it easier for Aegon to turn up later

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.710
and take over. Compared to crazy Viserys and
his “savage” foreign army, Aegon would

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.410
look like the good guy – “A savior come
from across the sea to bind up the wounds

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.910
of bleeding Westeros” . Of course, after
Viserys dies, the plan changes – for a while,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.210
they try to get Aegon and Daenerys together,
to marry, and join their forces, and invade

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.030
Westeros together , but that doesn’t work
out and Aegon ends up invading Westeros without

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.120
her, landing in the Stormlands with an army
called the Golden Company in Dance. So the

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.970
plan has changed a lot throughout the series
, but the overall goal seems to have remained

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.460
the same – to make Aegon Targaryen the King
of Westeros.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.169
This really helps to understand Varys’ actions
throughout the series. Early on, he’s trying

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.570
to “delay” any conflict in Westeros until
Viserys is ready to invade – so he tries

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.350
to protect Robert and Ned from the Lannisters,
and he maintains an appearance of loyalty

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.160
by informing on Daenerys, while on the downlow
he’s supporting her, not only by protecting

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.050
her from assassination, but by sending useful
people like Ser Barry, and later Tyrion, to

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.530
help her. By the end of Storm, Varys changes
his strategy, trying to destabilise and weaken

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.819
the Lannister regime in preparation for Aegon’s
invasion – so he leads Tyrion to kill Tywin,

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.039
he drives apart Cersei and the Tyrells, and
he kills Kevan Lannister, the last person

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.500
at this point who’s really holding the realm
together. All throughout the series, Varys

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.419
is working to pave the way for Aegon’s invasion
. But – why?

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.039
Varys endlessly says that he “serve[s] the
realm”, that he’s “a loyal servant of

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.970
the realm” , and the realm needs peace”
. If that’s true, why does he create conflict

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.620
and chaos and try to start a war to install
Aegon as King? If Varys wants a good Targaryen

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.710
king, he should have just supported Prince
Rhaegar, all those years ago – Rhaegar sounds

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.199
like he would have been a great ruler , and
since he was Aerys’ rightful heir, there

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.270
would have been no war required to make him
King. But Varys actively worked against Rhaegar,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.550
by warning the Mad King against him , possibly
even urging Aerys to disinherit him, so that

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.880
crazy kid Viserys would get the Throne instead
. If Varys really wants a good king and a

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.169
peaceful realm, why did he undermine Rhaegar?
And later, under King Robert, the realm enters

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.970
a period of peace and prosperity – the World
of Ice and Fire calls it a “golden era”

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.509
. Admittedly, there is that massive debt , probably
cause of Littlefinger, but still, the realm’s

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.470
doing really well. So why does Varys spend
this time plotting to ruin the peace, start

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.569
a war, and install a new king? After Robert
dies, things do get bad in the War of the

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.330
Five Kings – which again is mostly Littlefinger’s
fault – but the war does end, and the realm

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.770
starts getting back into pretty good shape
under Tommen. Varys says himself that Kevan

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.970
Lannister does a good job of starting to “make
peace” and “unit[e] the Seven Kingdoms

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.220
under Tommen’s rule” . But instead of
supporting what could have become a peaceful,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.660
stable regime, Varys again undermines the
peace by killing Kevan, creating conflict,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.550
and continuing the plot of Aegon’s invasion
. That’s three potentially peaceful and

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.720
prosperous regimes that Varys has actively
undermined. If Varys really just wants a peaceful

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.020
realm, why does he keep doing this? What possible
reason could he have to support this kid Aegon

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.370
above all others?
Varys suggests that Aegon would be a great

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.879
king. He says he’s been trained, educated,
instilled with good values, “shaped for

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:11.050
rule since before he could walk” . But isn’t
it extremely naïve to believe that training

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.590
can guarantee that someone will be great king?
Aegon is just a teenager, with little experience

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21.220
of the real world – he’s barely even been
to the realm he intends to rule. Even if Aegon

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.849
does turn out to be a great king, what’s
stopping his heir or successor from being

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:31.139
just as bad as Mad Aerys? Within just a generation,
Varys’ grand plan could easily leave Westeros

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:34.909
in a worse position than it was in in the
first place. And that’s if the plan even

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:40.029
works – if Aegon is defeated, thousands
would lose their lives for nothing . And the

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:45.320
original plan, sending Viserys in first, is
even more risky – loosing thousands of Dothraki

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.510
“savages” on Westeros would be terribly
destructive and cause lots of long term problems.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.700
And what if Viserys actually succeeded in
taking over Westeros? He could do all sorts

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.740
of damage and it’s not like he’d happily
hand over the crown when Aegon showed up.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.470
Varys’ supposed plan for peace involves
an awful lot of war and destruction and risk,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.860
and he’s actively sabotaged several other
much safer opportunities for a peaceful realm

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.580
to pursue it.
It seems obvious that Varys and Illyrio’s

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.450
true goal isn’t just a peaceful realm, but
a realm ruled by Aegon. But why? Why does

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.790
a eunuch from Myr and a merchant from Pentos,
men with no apparent connections to Westeros

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:29.589
or the Targaryens , work so hard to put Aegon
Targaryen on the Iron Throne? Tyrion asks

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:33.779
this of Illyrio in Dance, and Illyrio says
he hopes to get money out of it, but Tyrion

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:37.110
thinks he’s a “Liar”, that “There
is something in this venture worth more to

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.490
[him] than coin or castles”, and Illyrio
admits that “even fat old fools like [him]

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.570
have friends, and debts of affection to repay”
. What are these “debts of affection”,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.560
who are these friends? Could they explain
the real reasons why Varys and Illyrio want

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.170
Aegon on the Throne? The answers may lie in
a theory called the Blackfyre theory.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.399
To cover some history real quick – bout
a hundred and twenty years ago, the King of

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:06.970
Westeros was Aegon the Fourth Targaryen, called
“the Unworthy” (waynew) because he was

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:12.329
one of the worst Kings the realm had ever
had. He was corrupt, and cruel , full of greed

00:10:12.329 --> 00:10:17.500
and lust . He fathered dozens of bastards,
including Brynden Rivers, or “Bloodraven”,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.980
now known as the “three-eyed crow”, and
Shiera Seastar, who may be related to Quaithe,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.490
and Aegor Rivers, called “Bittersteel”,
and Daemon Rivers, who took the name Blackfyre,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:33.420
and a black dragon as his heraldry. On King
Aegon’s deathbed, he legitimised all his

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.910
bastards , which gave them some claim on the
Throne . Aegon’s trueborn son Daeron still

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.230
should have been the rightful heir, but that
was disputed by Daemon, who called himself

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.490
King, and fought a war with Daeron for the
Throne. Daemon was killed in this First Blackfyre

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.050
Rebellion, but Bittersteel, who supported
him, fled Westeros, founded a mercenary company

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.920
called the Golden Company, and swore to put
a Blackfyre on the Iron Throne . Over the

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.820
next fifty years, there were five more Blackfyre
rebellions, some led by Bittersteel and his

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.120
Golden Company, until finally, in the Fifth
Blackfyre Rebellion, a young Ser Barristan

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.290
Selmy killed Maelys the Monstrous – “the
last Blackfyre”. Or at least, we’re told

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.120
that Maelys is “the last Blackfyre” – but
he was apparently only the last of the male

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.600
line of House Blackfyre , which might imply
the female line is still alive. Many fans

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.870
believe that Aegon is a descendant of that
female line – that he’s not really a Targaryen,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.140
but a Blackfyre. And there’s strong evidence
supporting this idea.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:35.959
And we’re repeatedly warned in visions and
prophecies of a “false” dragon , or “the

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:40.540
mummer’s dragon” – a mummer’s dragon
is a cloth dragon on poles used in performances

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.490
. And of course, Varys is closely linked to
mummers – he was raised by them, taught

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.930
by them, and constantly uses their skills
of acting and illusion. So the idea here is

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:55.290
that Aegon is the mummer’s dragon, the “false”
black dragon who Varys presents as a Targaryen

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.279
even though he’s actually a Blackfyre. Which
fits perfectly with Varys’ talk of power

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:06.550
and belief and perception – he says that
“Power resides where men believe it resides”

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.950
– and men believe that power resides in
Targaryen blood – no matter if the boy is

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:16.070
actually a Blackfyre. Another little symbolic
hint is a story we’re told about a black

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.459
iron dragon that was used as the sign for
an inn, until someone broke it and threw it

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:24.240
away because it looked like the Blackfyre
dragon, but “many years later”, part of

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.160
it washed up, and the black iron had gone
“red with rust”. This alludes to the story

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.990
of Aegon – the black dragon, House Blackfyre,
was seemingly destroyed years ago, but a survivor

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:40.180
has now emerged, disguised as a red dragon
– a Targaryen.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.790
But probably the strongest evidence for the
Blackfyre theory concerns the Golden Company,

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:50.820
the army that joins Aegon in his invasion
of Westeros in Dance. It is super fuckin weird

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.170
for the Golden Company to fight for Aegon
Targaryen, because the Golden Company was

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:00.110
founded by Bittersteel to fight against the
Targaryens, for the Blackfyres – they fought

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.040
in the Blackfyre Rebellions, they were led
by Blackfyres . They are “A brotherhood

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.180
of exiles … united by the dream of Bittersteel”
– and the dream of Bittersteel was to defeat

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.500
the Targaryens and put a Blackfyre on the
Iron Throne . So why would the Golden Company

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.649
fight for Aegon Targaryen? Tyrion questions
Illyrio about this , and Illyrio “brushe[s]

00:13:19.649 --> 00:13:24.709
away the objection as if it were a fly”,
saying eh, Blackfyre, Targaryen, tomato tomato,

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:29.760
all the Company really wants is to go home
to Westeros . Which is, like, maybe, but that

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.930
seems to contradict Illyrio’s earlier claim
that the Golden Company fights for Aegon because

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.180
of a contract “writ in … blood” – which
sounds like it refers to the Golden Company’s

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:44.050
history with the Blackfyres. So there is a
lot of uncertainty and secrecy here, but given

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.459
what we know about the Golden Company, and
given all these hints about the Blackfyres,

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:52.170
and the “mummer’s dragon”, it seems
likely that the Golden Company fights for

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.970
Aegon Targaryen because they know he’s secretly
a Blackfyre.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.959
Some versions of the theory go further, suggesting
that Aegon might not only be a Blackfyre,

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:06.040
but that he might be Illyrio’s son. Illyrio
clearly has affection for Aegon – he’s

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.399
really sad that he doesn’t get to spend
time with him , he praises him , gives him

00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:13.370
little gifts of his favourite food , he even
has a chest of children’s clothes in his

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.940
home , that may have been Aegon’s when he
was younger. Maybe Illyrio treats Aegon like

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.639
this cause Aegon’s his son. Aegon’s Blackfyre
blood would come from Illyrio’s now-dead

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:29.040
wife, Serra – who had “pale golden hair
streaked by silver”, like a Blackfyre, and

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.810
a name that sounds like a Targaryen or Blackfyre
name . Serra may be this Blackfyre survivor

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.699
through the female line, and the mother of
Aegon Blackfyre with Illyrio. The evidence

00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:44.570
for this idea isn’t very strong, but it
would go a long way in explaining why Illyrio

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:50.399
wants Aegon to be King. Illyrio deeply loved
Serra, he sacrificed a lot of political power

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:55.480
and status to be with her , and after she
dies of greyscale, he keeps her petrified,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.079
stony hands as a keepsake – which is quite
creepy, but it’s also a clear expression

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:06.120
of passionate love. Maybe Serra wanted for
her son Aegon what all her Blackfyre ancestors

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.010
had failed to claim – the Iron Throne of
Westeros. It might even have been a “Promise

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.940
me, Ned” sort of a situation – maybe as
Serra was slowly dying of greyscale, she got

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.610
her husband Illyrio to swear to honour her
memory by granting her son his – perceived

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.070
– birthright – the Throne.
This also could give Varys a pretty good person

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.279
reason to support Aegon Blackfyre – Varys
is a close friend to Illyrio, and may also

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:35.519
have been close with Serra, so it makes sense
that he might want to help support Aegon.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:41.180
Some people even suggest that Varys and Serra
might be related – brother and sister, perhaps.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.410
After all, they both happen to come from Lys,
and they both happen to end up with Illyrio

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:51.350
in Pentos. Maybe Varys shaves his head to
hide the pale blonde hair that he may share

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.889
with Serra. There’s a hint for this in that
another character who shaves his head bald

00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:01.839
is Egg, in Dunk and Egg. Egg shaves his head
to hide his Valyrian-blonde hair, and when

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:07.370
Varys is introduced in the first book, he
is “plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:13.000
as an egg”. Also, having Blackfyre blood
might explain why Varys was castrated in a

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.449
magic fire ritual – we know that fire magic
in this series sometimes requires king’s

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:23.230
blood , and if Varys is a descendent of the
Targaryens and Blackfyres, he has king’s

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.339
blood – maybe that’s why he was bought
by the sorcerer in the first place. One more

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:31.000
thing is that we’re told that “Only the
blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.920
of the [Red Keep]” – specifically its
secret passageways, and as it happens, Varys

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.060
knows those secrets very well . So it’s
possible that Varys is Serra’s Blackfyre

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.579
brother. But even if he’s not, even if he’s
only a close friend of Serra and Illyrio,

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:50.630
these connections could help make Varys and
Illyrio’s grand plan make a whole lot more

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.670
sense.
Because the story we’re told, that Varys

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.529
“serves the realm” and just wants peace,
doesn’t make sense – Varys has actively

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:03.480
undermined three potentially peaceful regimes,
and he’s taken huge, dangerous risks, orchestrated

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.809
whole wars, all to crown a teenager who might
not actually make a good king. Could this

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:14.380
really be the ultimate goal of this master
player of the game of thrones? All this stuff

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.709
about “debts of affection”, and the Blackfyres,
and familial connections, hint that there

00:17:18.709 --> 00:17:24.380
might be a deeper layer to Varys as a character.
Cause all this time, Varys has seemed to be

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.279
so dispassionate, so cold and calculating
. People see him as creepy , almost inhuman

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:36.750
– not as a man, but a sinister, all-seeing
Spider , and a eunuch besides – Cersei says

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.390
that the reason why Varys is “so dangerous”
is that “He doesn’t have a cock” – implying

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.770
that he lacks the passions, and desires, and
weaknesses, that motivate other people . And

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.250
Varys plays this up, saying oh, “no one
loves a eunuch”, “they sing no songs for

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.230
spiders”, and in the show it’s suggested
clearly that he has no “desire”, which

00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:01.280
leaves him free to work towards higher, rational
goals like a peaceful realm. But maybe there’s

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.610
more to Varys than this cold, rational exterior
. After all, he grew up with actors , he’s

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.860
a master of disguise , he talks endlessly
about the power of illusion , and he says

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:17.059
quite explicitly that his role as a “sly”
unscrupulous spy is an act . Maybe behind

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:23.429
the act, behind the illusions, and the lies
, is a man, just a man, with human passions

00:18:23.429 --> 00:18:29.169
– someone who works out of love for his
friends and family. George Martin says the

00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:34.450
only thing worth writing about is “the human
heart in conflict with itself” . A cold,

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.830
rational, scheming Spider who manipulates
politics and orchestrates wars for purely

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.830
cold, rational reasons is not “the human
heart in conflict with itself”. A much better

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.120
story is that of a man who was born alone
into the world , who was betrayed at a young

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.610
age , who was cut , and beaten , and suffered,
and so learned to cherish the family he had

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.419
. A man who used illusion and deception to
play the part of a passionless eunuch who

00:18:58.419 --> 00:19:02.830
only “serve[s] the realm”, all the while
secretly working, over years and years, out

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:08.419
of love for his family – Illyrio, Serra,
and Aegon. Maybe this could be revealed in

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:13.020
a climactic, dramatic scene where Varys’s
plans come crashing down, perhaps even the

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.340
scene of Varys’ death, imagine – a sudden,
tragic, bittersweet realisation that this

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.950
evil scheming spider, who stole, and lied,
and started wars, and killed good men, who

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:29.289
turned the whole damn realm into his puppet
show – did what he did out of love.

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:34.250
Either that, or he’s a merman.
