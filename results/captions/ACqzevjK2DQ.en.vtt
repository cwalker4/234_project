00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.900
Even before the ink was dry on the designs of the M3 Medium, in August of

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.880
1940, ordinance told the designers to get started on the replacement vehicle

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.020
but this happened in February of '41 simply because they were too busy putting the finishing touches onto the M3

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.920
The resulting product was manufactured in September of '41; it was the Medium Tank T6

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.460
The remake the designers were given was pretty simple.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.140
Put the 75 millimeter into a rotating turret, and make the tank smaller than the M3.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.720
The T6 showed up at Aberdeen for testing; it was a strange combination

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.420
of the archaic and the modern. Certainly the stabilized gun and the syncromeshed transmission

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.680
showed promise. On the other hand, you still had something that had fixed, forward firing machine guns and it had all of

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.000
four hatches for the five crewman; two of those hatches were in the hull sides. The first of the production

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.340
M4A1's was built in the Lima Locomotive Works in February of 1942.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.740
This was sent to Aberdeen Proving Grounds to work out some of the bugs. They were built to a British

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.760
contract. The second tank was sent to the United Kingdom for testing, it was named Michael,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.600
possibly after Michael Duarte, the head of the British tank mission in the U.S.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.640
That tank can still be seen today at The Tank Museum in Bovington, still in  its shiny

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.780
gloss green with the fixed forward firing machine guns. As such it is the oldest surviving Sherman Tank.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.900
We're going to move forward to August of '43, and the reason is because that's when the Montreal Locomotive Works

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
ceased production of the Ram and started production of the Grizzly.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.720
Now, the Grizzly is basically an M4A1 built with a couple of local tweaks in Canada.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.740
Most of the 188 Grizzlies that were manufactured did not see combat.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.800
As a result, the generally survived the war. Thus, most of the M4A1's you see in private hands

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
or in museums today are actually Grizzlies which have been backdated to look like

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.110
an American M4. This vehicle behind me here at the Military Vehicle Technology

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.120
Foundation at Portola Valley, California is one of these Grizzlies and will be the subject of our tour

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.020
which will happen in the usual manner: outside first, engine

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.260
and then in Part 2 we go inside. Pleasantries out of the way, let's get going.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.600
We're going to start off with the first elephant: This particular M4 has been parked in between its two close contemporaries

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.960
The T-34-76 on one side, the Panzer 4 on the other

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.100
Immediately you'll see that this tank is not the smallest of the three. Most of this extra height

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.560
is in the hull; the turrets are pretty much equivalent.You may at first think

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.660
that this is actually a good thing because you've got more room, more comfortable positions for the crew,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.590
you've got more stowage... you also have a bigger target. The reason this was done

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.530
is located to the left. The engine in the tank is mounted the same way it is on this stand

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.080
except a slight forward angle to allow the power shaft to go under the turret basket.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.460
It's a tall engine. You need a tall engine bay. But the other advantage to the tall engine bay

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
is that you can fit a whole variety of engines into this one tank, which is applicable

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.300
considering the American manufacturing capability of the time. Moving to the hull,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.160
the cast hull marks this as an M4A1; welded hull variants were simply M4

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.020
There was a composite, or hybrid, version that had a cast front and a welded back.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.900
The U.S. Army categorized those as M4. The armor is

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.280
about 2 inches thick, starts at 37 degrees, goes up to 55 at the top

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.360
giving you an effective thickness of about 2.5 to 3.5 inches.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.420
On a welded hull Sherman that 2 inch plate is at an even 57

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.280
This, if you count the slope, is at the better part of 3.5 inches and it compares

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.600
favorably to, say, the T-34 and better than most of the German tanks

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.280
There are, however, two small catches. Those are the bulges for the driver and the bow gunner.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.160
These are weak points; surprise, surprise. So what they ended up doing

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.190
was welding, you'll often times see a piece of sheet metal welded in front of these

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.990
bulges to give it a little extra protection. The other catch is

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.020
this is what you'd call a small hatch Sherman. The early versions, because they had that steep

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.040
slope, didn't have much room on the roof of the hull to allow the hatch.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.440
So, the hatches on the early versions were very small. The earliest M4 actually

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.800
came with a direct vision port in the bulge itself, but that was soon deleted.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.220
Moving on to the components we're going to start with the most important part of the tank.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.660
No, it's not the gun; at least not in this case. If you think about it it's a small quirk of geography

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.830
Unlike most of the other combatants, the U.S. was separated from the rest of the world,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.900
and the fighting, by a couple of small bodies of water called the Atlantic and the Pacific.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.260
This meant that you had to get whatever it was you built in Ohio and

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.410
in Detroit and Wisconsin and everywhere else that they were making tanks from the U.S.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.400
to, say, Europe on a ship. To get it onto a ship you had to lift it up.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.940
We didn't have, back then, the roll on roll off ships that we're familiar with today. You had

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.580
to get a crane, hook onto the lifting eyes, lift it up, put it over and down into the hold.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.940
Your next catch is that most of the cranes of the time had a weight limit

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.140
and a lot of that weight limit was frequently 40 tons which

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.080
basically put an upper end limit. You could build a heavy tank in the U.S.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.400
but if most of your ship cranes or land cranes couldn't lift it and out of the ship

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.420
it's not going to do you a lot of good. That was why the American heavy tank

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.230
never found great favor. There were other problems as well. The M6 heavy for example

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.980
was mechanically unreliable, god awful, huge and ugly and whatever.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.520
But by and large the Americans pinned their flag to the medium tank, and of course the lights.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.100
As we move on, we have the brush guards covering the service lights and marker lights,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.420
another brush guard for the siren and we have a G stamp

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.840
for General Steel. General Steel was basically a subcontractor.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.100
If memory serves, there's about 4,237 parts in an M4A4

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.160
and about 80 of them were subcontractors

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.980
This meant that General Steel, who was of course in the U.S., were shipping

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.580
These casting to Montreal for final production.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.520
As we move on, we go to the three piece transmission housing.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.120
Of course later on you ended up with the single piece and the finally the sharp nose

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.920
but all the Grizzlies as near as we can tell, were made with the three piece. This is one of the later versions

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.540
of the three piece because you have this little lip protecting the bolts.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.260
The idea of the bolts? Simple enough: If you have to change out the transmission or something you simply

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.200
unbolt this, hook up a crane, pull off the housing, there's your transmission right in front of you.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.420
It took about 2 hours to change a transmission which, by the standards of the time,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.680
especially if you compare it to the Panther we did before, is pretty quick.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.980
The bolts were originally open and exposed and susceptible to enemy fire which meant

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.890
that when you had to change the transmission, you had to spend half the time just shearing off the bolt

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.680
so this lip was added for protection.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.220
By the end of Sherman's production run though, the housing

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.380
completely encased the bolt; the bolt was in a recess and thus much more protected.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.760
While I'm here I'm going to go off on a bit of a tangent

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.280
I was having a chat on the phone with Tom Yance who made me feel like I know absolutely nothing

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.420
He postulated to me that Sherman's reputation for reliability was overstated

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.980
and that in fact it was not anymore reliable than any other tank of the time

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.140
which, of course raises an eyebrow

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.080
because we all know that Sherman was praised for its reliability.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.980
To some extents, it was. I mean, if you compare it to the early Cromwells for example, yeah it definitely was.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.920
But compared to other in-service I have never actually done a per-mile breakdown rate assessment

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.460
The way he put it was, and i think he might have been on to something,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.240
The reliability of Sherman came from the operational readiness rate.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.780
When a commander said "Tomorrow morning we're going to attack with my 100 tanks",

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.100
How many of them would actually cross the starting line? And it would be 99 or 100 tanks

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.740
And the reason they could do that was because of the maintainability of the tank.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.920
There are a couple of features here. First we've already mentioned how quick it is to exchange parts

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.860
The second thing is that the Americans brought spare parts and they brought a lot of them

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.600
Unlike, say, the Germans, where units would be fighting each other at the train depot to get a part,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.820
Americans had spare parts coming out the wazoo. They basically had entire tanks in individual component form

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.400
sitting in the warehouses

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.440
So, we have to repair a tank. Let's say the transmission needs replacing, pull off the housing,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.980
go get the spare part, bring the spare part back, plug it in and it will fit perfectly

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.420
because the American parts were built to high design tolerances.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.680
If you saw a vice or other fitting materials on the workbench it was a sign of incompetence

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.360
because if you did your job right the first time, the part fit.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.800
So, you now have this part that fits, it goes right in,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.680
you close up the transmission housing, you're done in 2 hours,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.620
you can go on to the next tank.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.600
So,  you could change three Sherman transmissions in the same time it'd take you to do one Panther.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.860
Put that way, I think you very well may have a point. Now, again,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.700
I have not done the per-mile reliability assessment ratings or checks

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.300
If anybody out there on the web has done so or can link to them, please put it in the comments,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.360
I'd be curious to see the results

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.640
Other features on the front, that little tangent over, the gun crutch a.k.a. travel lock,

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.840
gun crutch is, of course, what the English would call it,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.280
and the bow .30 cal machine gun

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.060
That's the front. That didn't take too long. Let's go around the side.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.060
As you come around to the side of the tank, you see that the running gear is taken, pretty much, straight off the M3

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.740
Medium. There are a couple of minor differences, the tracks are not one of them.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.840
They're the same 16 and 9/16 inch wide. They came in a smorgasbord of variations

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.940
I'm not going to list them all right now, but I am going to mention the Canadian dry pin.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.960
CDP was a shorter pitched track; there were more links per side. It meant that

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.240
you had to have more teeth on the sprocket wheel.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.520
So, if you're looking at a Sherman and you see that there seems to be a rather inordinate amount of teeth

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.800
on the sprocket, chances are that you are dealing with a commonwealth vehicle.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.740
Obviously the Canadians like CDP the most but I do believe that the British used them as well

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.900
The problem with the narrow track also carries on from the M3 Medium.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.020
The thinking behind it is that if you have small narrow track, there's less weight of metal you have to haul around,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.840
your tank will go faster.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.600
Which is fine on hard surface, not so fantastic if you're

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.260
going around in the mud in Russia

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.380
So, some work-arounds were developed

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.360
The first work-around was the simple duck bill. This is an extended end connector; there's basically a

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:04.000
little plate that comes out a couple inches; it gives you a bit more surface area in contact with the ground.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.780
If this wasn't enough you could then move to the Easy 9 suspension.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.820
What this was, was there was a spacer that you would put in between the bogie and the hull side.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:20.360
It would shove the bogie out about 6 inches and there's another advantage to modularity of the bogie system.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:28.100
You them had enough room to mount additional extended end connectors on the inside of the track,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.120
and this really did increase the flotation capability of the vehicle.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.040
One of these E9s is still visible at the National World War 2 Museum in New Orleans

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.280
if you happen to be down that way and you wanted to look it up.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.020
The bogies were originally the light duty version, or at least, what we would now know as light duty.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.640
The return roller was up top and center.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.860
In the middle of 1942 they changed. They moved the roller to the rear; that's your visual identifier.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.140
They replaced it with a metal skid and that design kind of tweaked a bit over time.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.080
Most importantly they increased the diameter of the springs under here

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.060
from 7 inches to 8 inches making them a lot more durable.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.640
The whole system would span a 7.5 foot trench and it would climb a 24 inch wall.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.340
And you look at the M10 we did before and that would only scale an 18 inch wall.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.960
Why the difference, because the running gear is the same? As near as I can tell, it's a matter of weight.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.280
The M4 had a little bit more weight pushing down on the track and gave you a little bit more grip.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.340
The last thing I'll mention while we're on the subject of running gear is the gap in between the bogies.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.680
On most M4s the spacing between the wheels is pretty much the same as you have here.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.240
The exception is the M4A4.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.460
This had a longer engine; the entire hull needed to be extended which meant that the bogies were spread out a bit further.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.080
So, an M4A4 would have a gap between the bogies about the size of an additional road wheel.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.440
The primary user of the M4A4 was the British.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.660
There was also the M4A6 but you almost never see any of those.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.200
As you move up a little bit, just forward there is a mount for either a radio antenna

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.820
or if there's no radio because its not a command tank a ventilator.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.740
Then we move to the sponson where much of the ammunition was stowed.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.320
This is actually in common with a lot of other tanks despite the reputation the M4 had for burning.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.320
It was indeed the ammunition that was the cause, not the petrol.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.600
And there were a couple of solutions proposed. Eventually of course, wet stowage

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:35.040
but the interim solution was applique armor: You simply put more armor between

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.140
the guys shooting at you and the ammo.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.220
Whether or not it did sufficient amounts of use is another matter

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.620
but they put the applique anyway and then they put a nice, big, white,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.860
helpful aiming mark so that the gunners could get their detonations anyway.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.760
As you move further up, you'll see a lot of Shermans will have similar applique  armor

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.400
on the front of the turret

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.660
The reason this was done was that in order to make room for the gun control equipment on the inside of the tank

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.560
They had to shave out some of the metal of the wall on the inside of the turret.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.620
This meant that you had thin armor now between the outside world and the gunner and the TC.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.340
The long-term solution was a new casting of the turret.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.080
You will see some turrets that actually have a bulge cast into it.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:26.180
The short term solution was just, from the factory, additional plates of applique armor that would be welded to the side.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.380
Now we come to the back of the tank where ordinarily I'd talk about track tension.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.300
I'm not going to do it this time. Half of you are going "Hooray!".

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.340
The reason for this is that it's exactly the same as you saw on the M3 Medium and the M10 Tank Destroyer.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.520
It's the big wrench, the big bolt, that's as far as I'll go with that.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.880
Instead I will mention the engine: the Wright Whirlwind R975

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.600
When we first encountered this engine in the M3 Medium it was rated by the manual at 400 horsepower

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.160
running a higher octane level of fuel

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.580
In this installation the manual rates it at only 350 horsepower running on 80 octane.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.820
The engine had a couple of quirks: The first one was its tendency to over rev.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:25.140
I was talking with a driver of the time and he said that the problem was

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.600
In times when you really really needed the power like when someone was shooting at you

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.920
and you wanted to go somewhere really quickly,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.940
You didn't think too much about the engine. You just put your foot down,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.440
the engine would rev up and then you had a good chance of blowing the engine.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.540
The other problem, being a radial engine is that you have to hand crank the thing

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.160
because all of the fluids, the oils will all settle at the bottom of the cylinders  and you end up with a hydro-static lock.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.720
As a result if you have a cold engine, you've got to turn it over, hence turning over the engine.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.740
To do that you used the hand crank.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.940
Which is simple enough.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.580
Insert it into this little hole back here, the M18 Gun Motor Carriage, the Hellcat, had the same thing.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.640
Just feed it through, it hooks in

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.700
to a little notch in there and you can then start cranking

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.520
60 times

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.380
before the engine is considered to be suitably rotated and you can start it up.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.500
To give you a better idea of what's going on back here let's move over to the demonstrator model

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.160
we have around the corner.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.320
Now we have the demonstrator model. You can see the aiming mark that's on the inside of the tank.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.040
And you can also see from the bar, just how deep inside it is.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.160
Fit it into the notch and start cranking. You'll see the radiator fans turning on the far side.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.860
I'm not going to do it all 60 times.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.800
So, that done I'll just put this right back in.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.300
Of course, you wouldn't have to do this if the engine was warm but still I have no doubt that a crew was

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.860
very happy to get engines a little bit more modern later on in the war that you didn't have to do this every time.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.580
Again, the M18 Gun Motor Carriage, you still had to it had the radial engine.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.220
While I'm back here, the other two things we see here are the large air filters and the exhaust port

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.440
and the cooling air would be blasted through the big gap in between the hull roof

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.300
and the back wall, to be deflected downwards right into the dust

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.380
and dirt just what you didn't want to have signifying your position

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.560
to anybody within miles in North Africa's desert.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:54.500
There were also sand shields; you'll see on the side of the hull the holes for the mounting of the sand shields; they did not last very long

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.980
Once they were broken off nobody bothered to repair them

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.620
So, getting up, this is not the hardest tanks to get up.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.380
You've got good hand holds.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.160
Of course, you can use the bogies.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.480
So now that we're up here we can start talking about the different engine deck variants.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.920
The M4s and M4A1s with the Continental radial, they had an engine deck similar to this

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.560
with an armored intake up the front and no grill further back.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.080
The M4A2 was the twin diesel version and it used the same power pack we saw on the M10.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:36.160
This had large grills opening up on the rear deck.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.940
The M4A2 of course was mainly a Lend-Lease tank. The Soviets used it; some of the British got them

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:49.020
and of course the U.S. Marines used them as well simply because they were the only Shermans that they had available at the time

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.960
and the Marines said "Well, we'll take these now, please. Thank you very much".

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.900
The M4A3 was a version that had the Ford V8, the GAA; excellent engine, about 500 horsepower.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.640
This became the de facto American tank after the war. It saw plenty of service in Korea

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:14.200
This also had large grills on the back, different filler part configuration of course because there's only the one engine.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.560
The grills were a bit larger than those on the M4A2.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:26.360
The M4A4 was the one with the wonderful Chrystler 30 cylinder contraption, the A57 multi-bank.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.780
This was the longer engine with the longer engine deck

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.260
and your visual identifier is outside.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.560
The British actually really liked the M4A4 and we''ll be coming to that one in a future story.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.380
The M4A6, there was another version based off

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:53.180
of the M4A4 chassis so it was also elongated it had a caterpillar multi-fuel radial engine.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.100
However, only 75 of those were built

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.840
and they only ever saw service in the U.S. So if you see a

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:06.200
tank with spaced road wheels, and it's actually in operation in Europe,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.540
It's British probably but it's certainly an M4A4.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:17.260
There was the M4A5 designation which you will note I have skipped.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.140
The M4A5 is what the Americans called the Ram.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.100
Quite why they did that i don't know because the Ram was really an M3 based vehicle.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.080
If you look at the builders plate of this Grizzly, it actually says Montreal Locomotive Works

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.880
M4A1. So, perhaps that's why they didn't come up with a separate designation for the Grizzlies themselves.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.340
Okay, so to get the engine deck up, which is a two man job, I have

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.280
summoned my beautiful assistant here, Meathead

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:57.660
This is your moment of fame to the Inside the Hatch audience. If you don't know him, he's popular enough on the NA side of things

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.380
-If you could give me a hand here please                                                    -Absolutely

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.860
-Thank you very much                                                             
  -That was heavy

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.540
-Go away

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.340
So now we have the engine bay open. You can see the Continental as it is installed inside the tank.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.520
It's mounted on the brackets. There are four large bolts that are holding it in place.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:26.340
So if you wanted to pull the engine out, you'd undo the deck, lift that out of the way, lift up the engine

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.180
by of course, disconnecting the power shaft, the fuel lines and what have you.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.700
This particular engine will get the tank up to a burst speed of 24 miles an hour and a sustained speed

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.820
of about 21. Of course this was the weakest of the engine options.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.960
Later versions of the tank would go a  bit faster: up to 30.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:51.360
You can also see in here the red pipes for the fire extinguisher system. This was a 2 shot system, it could be fired

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:57.100
from either inside the tank or by use of a handle on the engine deck just left rear of the turret.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.520
Further forward under its own fuel tank port is the auxiliary motor.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.340
This of course would be used for running the system without draining

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.060
the main fuel tanks and of course putting wear and tear on the main engine.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.520
Speaking of fuel, the fuel in this system would be 168 gallons.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.180
That would be enough to get you about 120 miles.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.520
Some help he was. I told him to go away and he took it literally.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:36.800
Well that brings us to the end of Part 1 and of course Part 2 will be the interior positions which we will get to at a later date.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.160
I'll see you then.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.360
later vehicles showed up with a new suspension

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.560
Hello spider... Are you having fun?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.380
I'm going to skip forward a little very quickly to...

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.300
Some time in 1943. Wait, what?

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.000
[Off Camera]-I imagine that music will be played over this

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.940
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Daaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Daaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.840
You're going to be relocated from the Sherman... To the T-34
