00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.740
Theresa May’s Brexit deal has been voted
down by MPs -meaning we’re getting closer

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.700
and closer to a no-deal Brexit.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.679
But what could no-deal Brexit actually mean
for you?

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.520
So you wake up on March 30th 2019 and the
UK has just left the EU.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.600
The plan was to have a deal in place by the
time we left - making sure our exit was nice

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.960
and smooth, with a transition period helping
to ease us out of the union.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.630
I know we can get a deal that delivers for
Britain.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.880
We will be able to reach a deal that will
work for us and work for them.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.870
I’m absolutely confident we’re going to
get a good deal with the EU.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.570
But now, none of that is in place - so what
the hell is going to happen?

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.380
One of the first questions would be - what
about the UK border?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.040
If there's no agreement about customs checks,
there could be big delays.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.300
Lorries that used to be waved through will
probably now need their details checked.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.300
That’s one truck?

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.760
That’s one truck of what we, as customs
clearing agents in Dover and the UK do.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.130
In a no-deal scenario, you’re looking at
100% worth of checks like this?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.130
Yes.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.710
Could you cope with that?

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.710
No.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.550
According to the freight industry, that could
mean queues of up to 17 miles at the Port

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.760
of Dover.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.910
Because of that, there are fears it could
disrupt deliveries of food and medicine coming

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.270
into the UK.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.700
However, the Deputy Mayor of Calais has said
that on the French side, they have been preparing

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.300
for no deal for over a year.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.360
And he says there will definitely be no delays
at the border in the event of no deal.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.690
Now, problems at the ports are one thing.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.530
But there could be even bigger problems at
the land border between Northern Ireland and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.870
the Republic of Ireland.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.020
There used to be a physical border here, with
customs checks.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.840
But for many Irish nationalists, this was
seen as a symbol of British occupation.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.750
All those barriers were removed as part of
the Northern Ireland peace process.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.510
So, for many on both sides of the border,
putting barriers up once again would feel

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.630
like a return to the troubles of the past.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.700
But the EU has said that if there’s no Brexit
deal, there’d be no alternative to a “hard

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.700
border”.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.380
So on top of all the trade delays a no-deal
Brexit could cause - there’s also the possibility

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.670
of renewed violence.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.260
- There is real potential for trouble of extremists
wanting to exploit the chaos of a possible

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.260
no-deal Brexit?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.010
Yeah, well we’ve seen that time and time
again where there is an issue, no matter what

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.640
the issue is in Northern Ireland, that people
do tend to come onto the streets. For either

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.080
a short period of time or a more protracted
period of time. And that we do see some serious

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.990
public order - and indeed terrorist-related
violence - as a result of that.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.340
Now, what if you've booked a flight to Europe
- but then we have a no-deal Brexit?

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.540
Well, airlines will lose their automatic right
to fly between Britain and EU member states.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.819
Authorities would need to try to reach some
sort of an agreement on air travel so that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.090
planes could carry on landing in other countries.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.390
The EU has said there is an emergency plan
in place to ensure some air routes continue

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.660
operating in the event of a no-deal. So hopefully
your holiday plans won’t be affected.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.890
And also, the UK government would try and
get a more comprehensive agreement - while

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.410
EU countries, they still want to fly here,
so it’s in their interests to keep the airspace

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.450
open.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.490
But if things don’t go to plan, it could
result in planes being grounded - meaning

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.770
you won’t be able to take off, and could
be left stranded.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.260
Now, what about those of you waking up in
the UK on March 30th who are EU citizens?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.370
Well, your status in the UK will eventually
change after a couple of years. Although that

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.349
would happen regardless of whether we leave
with a deal or not.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.620
That's because freedom of movement will end
- so EU citizens will no longer have an automatic

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.099
right to live and work here.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.890
Similarly, Brits who live in Europe will also
lose those rights - as well as losing your

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.260
guarantee of free healthcare in the EU.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.540
And on top of that, the value of your UK state
pension could be at risk down the line.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.290
However, before you start panicking, the government
has said there is no need to worry.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.690
That’s because, if you're an EU citizen
living in the UK, you can apply for Settled

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.090
Status for £65.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.931
So, providing you can prove you live here
and that you're not a security threat, all

00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:22.009
of your current rights and privileges will
be protected.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.990
Once you’ve got Settled Status, you can
carry on living here just like before.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.990
EU countries are also in the process of announcing
similar schemes for Brits living abroad.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.849
But what other changes are you likely to notice?

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:41.449
Well, perhaps the biggest risk of a no-deal
Brexit is the potential shock to the economy.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.359
The Bank of England thinks the value of the
pound will tumble, the economy will shrink

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:50.419
- and that it’ll be even worse than the
2008 financial crash.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.860
The country is not yet fully prepared for
a cliff-edge Brexit.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.780
Now that's based on a lot of detailed predictions
- but remember, they have sometimes been wrong

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.780
before.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.360
A big part of our economy is our trading relationship
with Europe.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.710
Being in the EU means that we can buy and
sell goods with EU countries without paying

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.460
tariffs at the border.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.590
But if there’s no deal, Britain would have
to treat all countries equally - whether they're

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.689
in the EU or not - that’s according to rules
set by the World Trade Organisation, the WTO.

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.240
So what does that mean? Well, take cabbages
for example.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.270
Under WTO rules, we could introduce charges
on cabbages coming into the UK from the EU.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.680
That means cabbages - and other food - would
get more expensive for me and you.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.599
On the other hand, it might be good for the
British farming industry - because it would

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.430
make their cabbages more competitive.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.210
Alternatively, we could just set extra charges
really low - or even at zero percent.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.919
But because we now have to treat all countries
equally - that would apply to the whole world.

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.779
So, on the plus side, that might help keep
food prices low for consumers, like you.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:04.119
But it would also mean that British farmers
might be undercut by competitors from around

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:05.119
the world.

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:10.210
And, don’t forget, because of issues at
the border that we spoke about before, EU

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.150
countries importing stuff to the UK might
face extra paperwork and customs checks.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.660
That all costs money - and it’s likely that
you, the consumer, would have to foot the

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.660
bill.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.539
So will there be chaos if we leave without
a deal?

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:26.770
Not necessarily.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.119
The government has been preparing for this
for a while - and it says contingency plans

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.680
are in place.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.620
For instance, there's an airfield near the
Port of Dover which will be converted into

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.520
a lorry park - and companies have been hired
to run extra ferry services to carry goods.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.389
Those measures are designed to ease congestion
at one of Britain’s busiest ports.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.249
The government has also announced plans to
stockpile medicines and fly in vital supplies

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:53.679
if necessary.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:59.460
- The stockpiling is going to be done by pharmaceutical
companies and we will support them, and are

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.599
supporting them, in doing that.

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.281
A lot depends on whether the government will
be able to strike so-called "mini-deals" on

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:08.569
different aspects of life after a no-deal
Brexit.

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.400
These would be separate, stand-alone agreements
to solve problems like air traffic, or congestion

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.819
at the borders.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.949
But the EU has insisted it will only agree
to basic emergency measures - allowing some

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.219
flights and cross-border trade for a limited
time.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:28.479
And don’t forget that many MPs, they really
don’t want a no-deal Brexit and have said

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.110
they will try to ensure it doesn’t happen.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.449
In January, for example, Labour and Tory MPs
came together to defeat the government and

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.030
give MPs more control in the event of a no-deal
Brexit.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.419
I do also feel, having spent the past six
or seven months on the backbenches talking

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.399
to various other backbenchers, that parliament
will stop a no deal.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.349
So what about the rest of Brexit?

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:55.909
Most EU law will simply be converted into
British law - so it’s unlikely you’ll

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.469
notice any sudden changes to the way the way
your life is governed.

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:05.719
But there will be one huge constitutional
change: EU institutions will immediately cease

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:11.259
to have any say in how the UK is run - so
every future decision will come straight from

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:12.710
our Parliament.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:18.219
So that’s how a no-deal Brexit could affect
you, come March 30th - what do you think?

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:21.749
Is it really that bad - or will things work
out better than predicted?

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:26.419
Let us know in the comments below - and tell
us anything you’re confused about as Brexit

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:27.499
Day approaches.
