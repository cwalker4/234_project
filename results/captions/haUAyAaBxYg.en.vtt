00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.651
(sighs)

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.927

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.863
'cause I don't like being blindfolded.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.153
I wore a hat today 'cause
I didn't do my hair.

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:09.890
(laughing)

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.300

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.540
I don't know what you're saying to me

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.523

is derivative of Spanish.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.000

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.373

- You were, I got the
Latin part at the beginning

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.190
'cause there were a lot of familiar words.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.520
And like, so it's a little bit different,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.754
and I don't know Portuguese.
- Yeah,

00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:22.770
it's 100% the word that people think

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.700
that I speak when I'm speaking Portuguese.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.840
People think I'm speaking Spanish.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.680

something in Portuguese?

understands high German.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.993

I'm not sure what Asian,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.680

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.780
- Oh, Flemish, oh.
- And Belgian.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.700
Very very similar to
Dutch, it's just kind of

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.940
like a dialect honestly.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.780
It's what's spoken in Belgium.
- Okay.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.150
- Which is where my dad is from.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.270
And the second one I
was speaking is Chinese

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.710
'cause my mom is Chinese and so

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.000
I learned those two
languages from my parents

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.940
and a little bit in school as well.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.630

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.463

- Ooh, say my name again?

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.610
- Carlos.
- Oh, see you said it first,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.960
say it with something else.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.600
- It's definitely from a
Middle Eastern countries or

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.510
speaking it, a language from
a Middle Eastern country,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.030
like maybe, or maybe a
North African country?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.930
- Can you count to 10 for me?
- Yeah.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:42.531
- Hmm, ha.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.000
- How do you say thank you?

00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:47.330
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.827
- Fuck, I have no idea.
- Yeah?

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:51.030
- I mean I think this might actually be

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.450
somewhere in the Middle East, uh, maybe?

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.750
- I'm going with Egyptian.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650
Oh, hi.
- How are you doing?

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.210
- Okay, okay.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.130
- Did you think I would look like this?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.810
- No, I didn't, I didn't.
- OK.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.250
- He's speaking Egyptian.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.150
If that isn't even a fucking language.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.860
- Was it?
- No, no, no. (chuckling)

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.730
- Oh, wait.
- No, so it's not Egyptian.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.757
Nah, (laughs) I told you
I'm not speaking Egyptian,

00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:17.450
I'm speaking Amharic.
- What is that?

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.876
- Amaringa is Amharic.
- What's that?

00:05:19.876 --> 00:05:21.590
- My parents are from Ethiopia.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.098
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:25.100
- Is there any like, influence from the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.120
Arabic language into Amharic?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.700
- Kinda, so Arabic,
Amaringa, and Amharic and

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.533
Hebrew, they're all like

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:31.590
Semitic languages.
- Okay.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.780
- So it comes from like that base.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.940
In the country of
Ethiopia there's over like

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.890
80 dialects and Amaringa,
so Amharic, what I'm

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.550
speaking is considered like, one of

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.410
the most like beautiful dialects.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.150
- I don't think it's very beautiful.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.550
(crowd chuckles)

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.287
(imitating foreign language)

00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:48.810
But it's not a romantic
language the way it sounds.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.733
- Could you share some sentences
in your language please?

00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:01.050
- What about, like, counting one to 10.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.700
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Okay.

00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:11.027
- Oh.

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:11.860
- Say mom.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.170
- Say dad.

- Say hello.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.840
- Oh, I've never heard any of these.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.613
- Can you say um, thank you?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.530
- Oh fuck, I have no idea.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.180
- I've never heard any
of these words before.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.793
I'm gonna go with Indian.

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.034

people don't know.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.680
- Well I'm from Northern Iraq,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.290
but you can be like
Armenian, Sierran, Turkish.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.920

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.074
maybe like, a French-ish language.

00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:39.907
- Okay.

00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:42.400
- But then seeing you I'm
like, okay you're brown.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.200
- First one was Kinyarwanda.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.033
- Kinyarwanda?

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:45.866
- Yeah, it's called Kinyarwanda.

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:46.900
- Oh, where's it from?

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.800
- Rwanda. (laughing)

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.040
- Oh Rwanda, okay, okay, okay.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.588
- Then, the second one was uh,

00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:54.600
Swahili, which is kind
of used in East Africa.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.330
- And the third one was French.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.163
- The third one was French, yeah.

00:08:57.163 --> 00:08:58.270
- Oh, shit, that's crazy.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.000
Nice, man. (laughing)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.520
- So in Rwanda we speak like,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.020
four national languages.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.384
So there is French, English, Kinyarwanda,

00:09:07.384 --> 00:09:10.800
and Swahili, like, we're
in the East African blocks

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.620
so we speak Swahili.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.020
- Speak your language, girl.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.463
- Asian, go ahead.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.723
Definitely Asian.

00:09:22.106 --> 00:09:22.939
- Oh.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.590
- She sounds like my nail tech,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.320
so I'm gonna go with Korean.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.543
Not to be racist.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.523
- Are you Korean?

00:09:37.523 --> 00:09:39.720
Shit.
- That's not Mandarin.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.553
That's not?
- I can speak Mandarin,

00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:41.510
but that's not Mandarin.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.950
- Yeah, and that's not Cantonese.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.630
Like I didn't recognize that.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.000
- It's Shanghainese.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.070
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.414
- A lot of people don't
know that it's even like,

00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:53.340
a dialect but it's spoken in Shanghai.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.170
- Oh, okay, that's crazy.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.760
- The language is kind of like, fading

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.070
because a lot of the younger people

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.310
aren't speaking it anymore.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.180
Like, for a while you
couldn't speak it in school,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.860
like, it wasn't allowed
for you to speak it

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.030
with your friends at school,

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.680
because they wanted you to speak Mandarin

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.430
'cause that's what like,
the global language

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.263
all over China is.

00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:12.070
Like, my grandparents, my
parents, they all speak it,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.350
but then whenever they
address the younger kids

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.749
like, they just switch to Mandarin.

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:18.230
And like, they're usually
always really surprised

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.370
that I can understand
and speak Shanghainese.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.666
Now I kinda, I wanna like, teach my kids

00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:24.900
Shanghainese too, just to keep it alive.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.760
- Keep it going, yeah, okay.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.200
I'm learning all of these new languages

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.670
I didn't even know, so this is dope.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.238
Thank you so much for
sharing that with me.

00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:31.571
I appreciate it.

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:36.853
- Yeah. (laughing)

00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:41.486
- Hey. (laughing)

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.757
- Did you do your homework?

00:10:48.757 --> 00:10:49.830
(both laughing)

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.853
- Hello?

00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:56.290
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.090
- Oh no, that's not.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.923
(crowd laughs)

00:10:58.923 --> 00:11:00.330
- She came out with (speaks
in foreign language),

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.290
but I don't know that second line.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.270
What was, would you say that second line?

00:11:06.158 --> 00:11:07.241
Not familiar.

00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:10.413
- Ah, this is too easy.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.110
- She just said hi to me,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.570
like hi how are you?

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.710
- She's some type of, like, Asian mix with

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.330
like, an island, 'cause
she has like a lot of

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.720
Latino, like in Spanish
derivatives but like,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.180
she's definitely Asian.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.144
- Getting warm, getting warm.
- Guam?

00:11:28.144 --> 00:11:29.690
What is it?
- Tagalog.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.130
- What is that?
- Philippines.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.945
From the Philippines, yeah.
- Philippines,

00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:35.827
which is literally,
like they shouldn't put

00:11:35.827 --> 00:11:37.167
it in a Latino place.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:39.560
(laughing)

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.280
- Hello.
- How did you learn?

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.100
- Well, well no, I am Filipino.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.548
People don't think that though.

00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:45.430
- Oh, okay.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.510
- I learned English
more than I did Tagalog.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.588
- Can I ask you like, why
you think your parents

00:11:49.588 --> 00:11:51.860
didn't like, teach you it?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.273
Or you weren't taught it?

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.983
- 'Cause.

00:11:56.854 --> 00:11:59.040
(crowd laughing)

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.710
They're shameful.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.950
Just kidding, hopefully they
don't get offended by that.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.583
- I think it's a very real thing, yeah.

00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:05.663
- Mhm, yeah.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.960
'Cause I think the thought process is that

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.130
in order to succeed you're gonna have to

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.060
speak the language of the majority.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.250
- Yeah, and it's like,
a lot of our parents

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.600
come here and they're like,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.520
you know, they've worked
so hard to get here and

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.340
they've sacrificed so much and

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.020
they just want the best
for their children and

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.921
you know it's coming
from that kind of love.

00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:28.660
But it doesn't always like, you know,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.957
pan out for like, the best for the child,

00:12:30.957 --> 00:12:34.937
as far as like, their
identity, cultural identity.

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:35.833
(drum roll)

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:37.416
Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:41.320
- It was fun, it was really
fun 'cause now I have

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.220
all these other languages
that I wanna learn.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.170
- Yeah, I definitely would
wanna get some lessons

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.130
from sunshine, who speaks Tagalog.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.530
- Hey hey.
- Yeah, what's up, yeah.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.740
- I think it was really cool to learn how,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.860
I think interconnected languages are.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.470
There's a lot of
similarities between a lot of

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.160
different languages and
once you look at the

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.410
history in it, it makes sense.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.860
So I think this is pretty dope.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.900
- No, I felt really guilty about like,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.310
trying to guess where
people's languages come from.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.260
Doing the linguistic profiling thing.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.090
- Well I know like everyone
here volunteered for it and

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.073
it's all fun and games but uh,

00:13:11.073 --> 00:13:12.630
like, I don't know, there are real

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.910
consequences out in the world when

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.440
people try to profile using language.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.808
Like, kinds of assumptions people make.

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:19.544
- Go learn a language, bitch.

00:13:19.544 --> 00:13:22.461
(crowd applauding)
