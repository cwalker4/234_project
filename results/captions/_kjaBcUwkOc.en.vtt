00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.403
Alexandria... Ocasio-Cortez.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.772
-(whooping)
-By now you probably know her

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.608
as Congress's
superstar freshman Democrat.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.410
Or, if you watch Fox News,

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.746
what would happen if Stalin
was good at Instagram.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.649
Either way, you cannot deny
she's making waves.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.951
Because she's only been
in office for six weeks,

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.187
but already
she's put forward a blueprint

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.755
to combat climate change,

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:25.124
which is one of the more
ambitious policy proposals

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.393
Washington has seen
in a very long time.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.862
And it's called
the Green New Deal.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.398 line:0%
We are going to transition
this country

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.200 line:0%
into the future...

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.636 line:0%
NEWSMAN: The Green New Deal
 calls for a ten-year

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.071 line:0%
 national mobilization."

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.106 line:0%
 The goal:
 in one short decade

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.408 line:0%
 to bring greenhouse
 gas emissions to zero,

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.379 line:0%
 meet 100% of energy needs
 by renewable sources,

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.581 line:0%
 overhaul
 transportation systems...

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.216 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN: 
 ...expanding a high-speed rail

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.087 line:0%
 to "a scale where air travel
 stops becoming necessary."

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.155 line:0%
NEWSMAN: It would modernize
 U.S. infrastructure,

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:57.590 line:0%
 upgrade or replace

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.659 line:0%
 every building
 for energy efficiency...

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.928 line:0%
 ...create millions
 of high-paying jobs,

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.130 line:0%
 bring equality
 and equal justice

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:07.767 line:0%
 for underserved minority
 and impoverished communities.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.936 line:0%
 The plan calls for
 government-guaranteed jobs,

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.771 line:0%
 government-provided
 health care,

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.673 line:0%
 free education for life,

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.676 line:0%
 and safe, affordable housing
 for everyone.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.345
Wow. That's a lot
of major issues

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:22.715
for a climate change plan
to solve. I mean...

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.150
No, I expected
the Green New Deal

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.853
to tackle greenhouse gases
and fossil fuels,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.622
but apparently it's also
gonna give everyone a job

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.924
and health care
and free education

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.426
and provide affordable housing

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.927
and get your parents
back together?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.596
(laughter)

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.631
And don't get me wrong,
these are admirable aspirations,

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:39.799
but I'm always skeptical

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.801
whenever someone proposes
a cure-all.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:44.003
You know? It's like one of those
old-timey health products

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.404
that traveling salesmen
used to sell.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.306
It'd be like, "Just one bottle
will cure insomnia,

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.275
"headaches, seasickness,
mustache weakness,

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.177
and even a total eclipse
of the heart."

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179
(laughter)

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.580
But I will say this.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.617
The main part of the bill
is about climate change,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.285
and Ocasio-Cortez is right

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:01.721
that the U.S.
needs to take drastic measures

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.590
to prevent
climate change's worst effects.

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.893
Of course, over at Fox News,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.596
as soon as they heard "Cortez"
and "climate change,"

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.665
sirens started going off

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:14.901
like bin Laden just emerged
from the ocean

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.236
holding Aquaman's trident.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.205
They were like,
"This is not a drill!

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:21.107
"We have a code A.O.C.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.076
Man your battle stations!"

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.212
What is this Green New Deal?

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.549
Answer:
radical environmental socialism.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.151
One of the most dangerous,
impractical, misguided,

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:34.086
economically guaranteed

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.622
to be devastating plans ever.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.025
It sounds more like
a-a green nightmare to me

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.127
when none of us are able
to turn on the heat

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.562
or turn on the air conditioning.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.197
When we outlaw plane travel,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.365
we outlaw gasoline,
we outlaw cars,

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:49.101
I think, actually, probably
the entire U.S. military

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.636
because of the Green New Deal.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.572
There's another victim
of the Green New Deal.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.774
It's ice cream.
Livestock will be banned.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.143
The Green New Deal wants
to go after flatulent cows.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.412
So what are they saying?
We're gonna ban hamburgers

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.280
and Americans
are never gonna have a barbecue

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.416
-and flip a hamburger again?
-No more steak.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.619
I guess government-forced
veganism is in order.

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:08.754
"Yeah.
They'll force-feed us broccoli

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.624
"while giving us
a tofu enema. Yeah.

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:14.427
"We're all gonna be gangbanged
by vegetables.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.962
"Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.065
That eggplant emoji--
not funny anymore. Yeah."

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.067
(laughter)

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.636
You know... you know what I love
about American politics

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.272
is that whenever someone

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.107
in the opposing party
says something,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.043
there's this weird thing where
you immediately have to take

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:32.612
the exact opposite position.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.914
Ocasio-Cortez says
that cow farting

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:36.749
contributes to climate change,

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:39.118
which is true, by the way.
It's true.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:40.753
And all of a sudden,
Fox News is like,

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:43.990
"Cow farts are the smell
of freedom, okay?

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.058
"Every time a cow farts,

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.228
George Washington gives me
a thumbs-up from the grave."

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.230
(laughter)

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:52.898
And, look,
there are legitimate concerns

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.300
about the Green New Deal.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.902
You can ask questions like
how are you gonna pay for it?

00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:59.672
Can it actually get done
that quickly?

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.674
Can we really replace coal

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.644
with the electricity between
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga?

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.679
Is it feasible?

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:09.115
There are enough real questions
about the Green New Deal

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.516
for conservatives
to take issue with,

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.418
but I guess it's more fun
to just scare America

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.821
into thinking it's about
to become a vegan North Korea.

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:17.657
Yeah!

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.659
Because, obviously,
the Green New Deal

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:23.195
doesn't ban meat or dairy
or air travel or cars.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:24.630
Right? You'll still be free

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:27.233
to eat your steak-flavored
ice cream on your private jet.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.436
What Ocasio-Cortez wants to do
is invest in alternatives

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.038
that are better for the Earth.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.173
Like, wherever it makes sense
to replace air travel

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:37.076
with high-speed rail,
we should do that.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:39.078
And honestly,
why would you be against that?

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.479
Who's that one guy
who'll be like,

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:42.782
"But if we don't use planes,
how will I take a shit

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.217
"in a bathroom that's only
two inches larger than my body?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.087
Huh? This is an outrage!"

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.389
But look,
it's no surprise that Fox News

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.525
would oppose a plan
that a Democrat came up with.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:53.926
What is surprising

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:56.262
is that the country's
most powerful Democrat

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.998
would also be dissing
the Green New Deal.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:01.233
Speaker Nancy Pelosi
throwing some shade at it,

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:02.601
telling Politico...

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:04.570
(reading):

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.478
Ooh!

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:15.548
"The green dream
or whatever they call it"?

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.949
That's so cold.

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:18.384
She dismissed the Green New Deal

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:21.220
like it was, like, that weird
kind of YouTube challenge.

00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:23.389
You know? It was like,
"All the kids these days

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:25.558
"are trying to snort cinnamon
up their butts

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.828
"or save the planet
for the human race

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.896
or something like that."

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:34.467
But, look, not everyone is so
lukewarm on the Green New Deal.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.737
In fact, polls show young people
are extremely supportive

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.905
of strong action
against climate change,

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:41.140
which is probably why

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:43.109
many of the Democrats
running for president

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.311
have also said
that they support it.

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:47.747
Because if you want to connect
with the youth and the energy

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.382
of the Democratic party
right now,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.550
you want to be on board
with Ocasio-Cortez.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.387
She's basically the Cardi B
of politics.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.022
Yeah. It doesn't matter
what she's rapping.

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:58.924
You want to feature
on her tracks.

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:00.693
Yeah. Oh,
she's basically like...

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.428
♪ I like high-speed trains ♪

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:04.029
♪ Carbon tax and no planes ♪

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:05.564
♪ That's what I'm doing now ♪

00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:07.566
♪ And the people gather round. ♪

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.602
That's her thing.
