00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.270
- My name is Mimi.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.320
- Mimi!
- Yeah.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.680
- I wouldn't be surprised if
you, like, huffed spraypaint

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.394
or some crazy-ass shit.

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:11.040
("In the Hall of the Mountain
King" by Edvard Grieg)

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.163
I'm Rayne!

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:17.090
Hoo, hah, heh!

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.860
I've done ecstacy,
molly, and like, shrooms?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.960
Yeah, I smoke the fuck outta weed,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.360
I smoked before I came here.

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:30.460
(Rayne laughs)

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.768
- Hello.
- Hello!

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:32.993
- I'm Shaun.
- Who?

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:34.300
- Shaun.
- Shaun.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.700
You look like you play music,
and musicians like drugs.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.930
Common or not common?

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510
- Pretty common.
- Pretty common.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.930
- But I use it in a kind
of uncommon way, I think.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.070
- Does it make you high?
- Oh yeah.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.230
- Oh yeah?

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.820
Is it LSD, I think that's what it is?

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.060
- It is not LSD.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.009
I use psilocybin
mushrooms, magic mushrooms.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.842
- Oh!

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.090
Cool.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.610
Can you describe what it feels like,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.100
and then what the experience

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.120
is like?
- Yeah, sure, absolutely.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.900
There's a couple different
components to it.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.260
On one hand, you get a lot of tremendous

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.530
rushes of energy through the body.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.680
It's kinda like stepping
into an open volcano

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.280
and just getting, like, blasted up.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.169
Like, your whole body could be shaking.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.620
- Okay, I'm vibing with that.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.160
That's some cool shit, I don't know why

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.040
I didn't think about
shrooms in that category.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.910
Okay, bye!

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.000
You look like you work in
construction and skateboard,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.160
or some shit.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.890
I feel like every single person I met

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.530
in construction did coke.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920
I feel like those two things go together.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.810
What do you, what's up?

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.790
- Opiates.
- What's a opiate?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.310
- Painkillers.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.050
- Okay, what was it like?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.860
Was it just like numby, was it floaty?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.100
- When it peaks, it's just
a warm feeling that starts.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.840
- When it peaks.
- In your center.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.890
And spreads out to the rest of your body.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.223
- You got a story to
tell, that's pretty cool.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.510
Is it common or not common?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.560
- In the gay community, yes.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.859
- Poppers?

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.692
(they both laugh)

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:00.970
- Want some?
- He got it!

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.887
Oh no, that's some gay shit!

00:02:02.887 --> 00:02:04.100
What's the feeling like?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.450
- Um, gives you a rush.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.120
Makes you warm, makes your
heart beat a little bit.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.960
You should try 'em some
time when having sex.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.990
- Okay, yeah!

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.308
It was lovely meeting you, Henry. (laughs)

00:02:15.308 --> 00:02:16.370
Hello.
- Hello, Kate.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.480
- Kate!
- Yes.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.320
- Okay.
- How's it going?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.043
- It's going, Kate, shit.

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:23.350
You do coke, don't you Kate?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.727
When's the last time you did it?

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.307
- This morning?
- Yes, yes!

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.150
And what's your frequency at this point?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.983
- All day.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.190
- That's probably coke.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.923
- I do coke.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:36.840
- I know. (laughs)

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.990
- I do mushrooms every Friday.
- Yes, okay!

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.020
- And I also have been
in the weed industry

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.450
since I was 14 years old.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.857
- Wow, it was lovely meeting you.

00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:47.843
- You too.
- You have a good one.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.063
I knew it was coke.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.600
- My name is Mimi.
- Mimi!

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.433
- Yeah.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:55.640
- But yeah, you're good,
you're fun to look at.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.040
You look like a party monster.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.360
I wouldn't be surprised if
you like, huffed spraypaint,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.870
or some crazy-ass shit.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.510
Coke and LSD, that's the final answer.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.200
- Coke and LSD?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.570
I don't do coke.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.743
But yeah, acid's my favorite one.

00:03:08.743 --> 00:03:10.340
- Why?
- I feel like I've learned

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.330
a lot about myself, and
about how I want to navigate

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.000
my life from doing acid,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.780
and when I do acid, it's a way of,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.350
getting out of my head a little bit,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.570
and thinking about my
surroundings, and like,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.470
life differently.
- Okay, I can see that.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.320
- One time, I threw up at the zoo on acid.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.540
- That was good?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.040
- Yeah.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.580
- Common or not common?

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.420
- Extremely common.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420
- That's good, that's good.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.530
'Cause I can guess that.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.740
- Is it social or is it
like a personal thing?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.310
- It's social in like getting it,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.840
but once you get it--
- Then you go home.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.280
- You like, go home and lock the door.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.920
- Ah.
(she laughs)

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.350
- Question, are you injecting?

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.980
- Yes, I used to, I've
been clean for over a year.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.210
- Congratulations on being clean.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.950
Was it heroin?
- Yes.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.170
- It's heroin?
- Yep.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.540
I'm surprised, no one ever
guesses what I used to do.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.570
- I wouldn't have guessed heroin,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.090
but I see you in, like,
really dark moments,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.360
like, for real, like in a corner,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.000
would you have a spoon,
was there a spoon involved?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.960
- Oh yeah.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.170
That's how you cook the dope

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.860
so you can shoot it into your arm.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.350
- I'm so happy that you're past that.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.183
- Yeah, me too.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.310
- Did you have to get, like, rehab,

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.060
did somebody find you or something?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.780
- My dad found me unresponsive
in my room a couple times.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.430
- Oh shit.
- And, uh,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.120
I just cried in his arms,
I was like I can't do this,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.510
I can't live clean, I can't live using,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.000
like, I'm just a fuck-up
no matter what I do.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.330
And then, a year later, I loved it.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.880
- Okay.
- I loved being clean.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.780
- I'm very happy to hear that.
(everyone in studio claps)

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.400
- I learned a lot about drugs today.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.130
I got things I gotta try.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.803
I'm gonna go smoke a
blunt and call it a day.

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:45.803
Thank you!
(everyone in studio claps)
