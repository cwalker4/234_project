WELCOME, ONE AND ALL, TO "THE

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.272
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:12.812
SINCE-- SINCE DONALD TRUMP WAS
ELECTED PRESIDENT, I'VE REMINDED

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:17.050 align:start position:0%
MYSELF TO NEVER STOP BEING
SHOCKED.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.018 size:78% position:39%
BUT IT'S HARD,  YOU KNOW.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start position:0%
IT'S LIKE MY BRAIN HAS DEVELOPED
A THICK CALLOUS, LIKE A

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.135 align:start position:0%
BUT TODAY, I HAVE TO SAY, I AM
SHOCKED ANEW,

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:38.538 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE TRUMP MET WITH INCOMING
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, NANCY

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.139
PELOSI, AND SENATE MINORITY
LEADER, CHUCK SCHUMER, IN THE

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.642 align:start position:0%
MOST SERIOUS ROOM IN AMERICA,
THE OVAL OFFICE.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:51.551 align:start position:0%
AND THEIR MEETING LOOKED LIKE
THIS:

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M SORRY.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.587
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.888 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS SOME MIX-UP IN THE
CONTROL ROOM THERE.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS-- THAT WAS CATS BOXING,
I THINK.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:02.562 align:start position:0%

HAPPENED TODAY.

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE FACT IS, YOU DO NOT HAVE
THE VOTES IN THE HOUSE.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.469 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NANCY, I DO!

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.504 size:88% position:44%
AND WE NEED BORDER SECURITY.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:12.271 align:start position:0%

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:40.833 align:start position:0%
THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN THREATENING
A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:45.605 align:start position:0%
FUNDING IT, AND PELOSI HAD HER
MESSAGING READY:

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.773 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
RECOGNIZE THAT WE MUST KEEP

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:51.010
GOVERNMENT OPEN, THAT A SHUTDOWN
IS NOT WORTH ANYTHING, AND THAT

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A TRUMP

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.015 align:start position:0%
YOU'LL HAVE--

NO ONE WINS.

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:23.509 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHY THEY BANNED IT FROM
THE OLYMPICS.

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:26.445 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
THEN PELOSI PSYCHOANALYZED

00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:30.382
TRUMP, SAYING, "THIS WALL THING,
IT'S LIKE A MANHOOD THING WITH

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:33.953 align:start position:0%
HIM-- AS IF MANHOOD CAN BE
ASSOCIATED WITH HIM."

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.889 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Audience: OOOOOH!

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:38.424 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH!

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:38.791 align:start position:0%
OH!

00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:39.325 align:start position:0%

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.901 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, THAT'S COLD!

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:53.906 align:start position:0%
SO THE WALL IS A METAPHOR FOR
HIS MANHOOD.

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.608 align:start position:0%
NO WONDER HE'S HAVING TROUBLE
ERECTING IT.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.611 align:start position:0%

THANK YOU.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:02.014 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:05.150
STILL, THAT'S PRETTY-- THAT'S
PRETTY COLD FROM NANCY PELOSI, 

00:08:05.183 --> 00:08:06.652 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW.

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:08.320
IT'S LIKE SHE ALWAYS SAYS, "WHEN
THEY GO LOW, WE PUNCH THEM RIGHT

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:10.923 align:start position:0%
IN THE JUNK."

00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:12.057 align:start position:0%
BOOM!

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:16.228 align:start position:0%
TRUMP ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THE
MEETING AND SAID THAT ALL THAT

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:19.532
SHOCKING ANTAGONISM THEY HAD
BETWEEN THEM WAS ACTUALLY THEM

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.901 align:start position:0%
JUST PALLING AROUND.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.135 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I
THINK IT WAS A FRIENDLY MEETING.

00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:29.141
YOU SAW THE BEGINNINGS OF IT,
BUT IT WORKED OUT TO BE PRETTY

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:30.309 align:start position:0%
GOOD.

00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:30.843 align:start position:0%
I LIKED THEM FOR A LONG PERIOD
OF TIME, AND I RESPECT THEM

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:31.877 align:start position:0%
BOTH.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:32.811 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE JUST LEARNED
TRUMP'S DEFINITION OF

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:33.945 align:start position:0%
FRIENDSHIP.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:35.648 align:start position:0%
"FRIENDSHIP: NOUN: PUBLIC
ARGUMENT WITH THOSE WHO OPPOSE

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.283 size:81% position:41%
EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR."

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:42.655 align:start position:0%
AND HERE'S THE THING--
FRIENDSHIP.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:43.789 align:start position:0%
FRIENDSHIP.

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:45.157 size:88% position:44%
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT TRUMP
THREATENING TO SHUT DOWN THE

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.428
GOVERNMENT OVER HIS WALL: THIS
MORNING HE TBEETED A LONG TWEET

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:56.201 align:start position:0%
IN WHICH HE SAID, "WE ALREADY DO
HAVE A WALL."

00:08:56.234 --> 00:08:59.805
"DESPITE THE LARGE CARAVANS THAT
WERE FORMING AND HEADING TO OUR

00:08:59.838 --> 00:09:01.607 align:start position:0%
COUNTRY, PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO GET THROUGH OUR

NEWLY BUILT WALLS, MAKESHIFT
WALLS, AND FENCES, OR BORDER

00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:06.979
PATROL OFFICERS AND MILITARY.

00:09:07.012 --> 00:09:11.016
THEY ARE NOW STAYING IN MEXICO,
OR GOING BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL

DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT, ICE,
BORDER PATROL, AND OUR MILITARY

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.432
HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB OF
SECURING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER."

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:32.404 align:start position:0%
TRUMP'S PROBLEM IS THAT HE HAS
TO SAY WE BUILT THE WALL TO

00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:37.476
SATISFY THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR
HIM IN 2016, BUT HE ALSO HAS TO

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:41.814
SAY THAT WE NEED TO BUILD THE
WALL TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:42.815 align:start position:0%
HIM IN 2020.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:46.518 align:start position:0%
HE NEEDS A WALL THAT BOTH DOES
AND DOESN'T EXIST.

00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:47.786 align:start position:0%
I JUST HOPE HE HAS GOOD MIME
SKILLS.

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:52.691 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"OH, HERE IT IS, HERE IT IS.

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:53.726 align:start position:0%

OH, WAIT.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.769 align:start position:0%
THERE'S A LADDER.

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:07.940 align:start position:0%
HERE, I'LL GO UP THE WALL ON THE
LADDER.

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
