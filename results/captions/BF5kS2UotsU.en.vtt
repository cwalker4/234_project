00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.985
I WAS DRESSING AS A
FORTUNE-TELLER.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.788
I DID A BARBARA WALTERS
INTERVIEW ONCE AND SHE SAID

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.124
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN
FIVE YEARS.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.492
I SAID MAYBE DIRECTING.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.828
SHE SAID WHAT ABOUT A BABY, A
HUSBAND?

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.498

WHAT HAPPENS?

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:29.589
&gt;&gt; I PLAY A GIRL NAMED RENEE AND
SHE HAS REALLY LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.190
SHE FEELS REALLY BAD ABOUT
HERSELF.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.561
WHEN THE TRAILER CAME OUT, I GOT
NICE BACKLASH WHEN THEY WERE

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.997

BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT AN UGLY
MONSTER, SHE JUST HAS LOW

SELF-ESTEEM, AND SHE HITS HER
HEAD IN A CYCLE CLASS AND ALL OF
