00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:11.021
The Universe is really big.

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:13.849
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.702
There are about a hundred billion stars
in the Milky Way Galaxy,

00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:21.413
and if you take a camera and you point it
at a random part of the sky,

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:23.674
and you just keep the shutter open,

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:26.731
as long as your camera is attached
to the Hubble Space Telescope

00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.282
it will see something like this.

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:32.171
Every one of these little blobs
is a galaxy,

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:33.810
roughly the size of our Milky Way.

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.624
A hundred billion stars
in each of those blobs,

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:40.973
there are approximately a hundred billion
galaxies in the observable Universe.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.591
A hundred billion is the only number
you need to know,

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:46.182
the age of the Universe
between now and the Big Bang

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:48.636
is a hundred billion in dog years

00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:50.280
(Laughter)

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.175
which tells you something
about our place in the Universe.

00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:56.378
One thing you can do with a picture
like this is simply admire it,

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.755
it's extremely beautiful,
and I've often wondered

00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:02.328
what is the evolutionary pressure
that made our ancestors develop,

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.157
adapt, and evolve to really enjoy pictures
of galaxies, when they didn't have any.

00:01:07.158 --> 00:01:09.095
But we would also like to understand it,

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:12.838
as a cosmologist I want to ask,
"Why is the Universe like this?"

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:16.294
One big clue we have is
that the Universe is changing with time.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.435
If you looked at one of these galaxies
and measured its velocity,

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:21.406
it would be moving away from you,

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:25.240
and if you look at a galaxy even further
away, it will be moving away faster.

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:27.597
So we say
that the Universe is expanding.

00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:29.921
What that means, of course,
is that in the past,

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.536
things were closer together.

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:34.751
In the past, the Universe 
was more dense, and it was also hotter,

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:37.395
if you squeeze things together
the temperature goes up.

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:39.018
That makes sense to us.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:41.425
The thing that doesn't make sense
to us as much is

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.893
that the Universe at early times,
near the Big Bang,

00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:46.680
was also very, very smooth.

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.389
You might think that's not a surprise;
the air in this room is very smooth,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.169
you might say: "Well, these things
smooth themselves out."

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.165
But the conditions near the Big Bang
were very, very different

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.101
than those of the air in this room.

00:01:58.102 --> 00:02:00.372
In particular, things were a lot denser,

00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:04.689
the gravitational pull of things
was a lot stronger near the Big Bang.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.576
What you have to think about is,

00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:09.013
we had a Universe
with a hundred billion galaxies,

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:10.757
a hundred billion stars each,

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:13.668
at early times,
those hundred billion galaxies

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:18.049
were squeezed into a region
about this big, literally at early times;

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.512
you had to imagine doing
that squeezing without any imperfections,

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:26.380
without any little spots where there were
a few more atoms than somewhere else,

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:28.845
because if there had been,
they would've collapsed

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:31.754
under the gravitational pull
into a huge black hole.

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.447
Keeping the Universe very, very smooth
at early times is not easy.

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.039
It's a delicate arrangement.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.394
It's a clue that the early Universe
is not chosen randomly,

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:42.415
there was something
that made it that way,

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.290
and we would like to know what.

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.846
So part of our understanding of this
was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:50.643
an Austrian physicist in the 19th century,

00:02:50.644 --> 00:02:54.232
and Boltzmann's contribution was
that he helped us understand entropy.

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:55.611
You've heard of entropy,

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:59.377
it's the randomness, the disorder,
the chaoticness of some systems.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.825
Boltzmann gave us a formula,
engraved on his tombstone now,

00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:05.210
that really quantifies what entropy is.

00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:08.725
It's basically just saying
that entropy is the number of ways

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:12.538
we can rearrange the constituents
of a system so that you don't notice.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.680
So that macroscopically,
it looks the same.

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.507
In the air in this room,
you don't notice each individual atom.

00:03:18.508 --> 00:03:20.566
A low entropy configuration is one

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.448
where there are only a few arrangements
that look that way.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.067
A high entropy arrangement is one

00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:27.540
that there are many arrangements
that look that way.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.356
This is a crucially important insight,

00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:32.640
because it helps us explain
the second law of thermodynamics;

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:35.660
the law that says that entropy
increases in the Universe,

00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:38.299
or in some isolated bit of the Universe.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.462
The reason why the entropy increases
is simply because there are many more ways

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:45.513
to be high entropy than to be low entropy.

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:48.954
That's a wonderful insight,
but it leaves something out.

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:51.366
This insight that entropy
increases, by the way,

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:54.220
is what's behind what we call
'the arrow of time, '

00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.413
the difference between the past
and the future.

00:03:56.414 --> 00:03:59.657
Every difference that there is
between the past and the future

00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:01.891
is because entropy is increasing.

00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:04.789
The fact that you can remember
the past but not the future.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.406
The fact that you are born,
and then you live,

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.906
and then you die, always in that order,

00:04:09.907 --> 00:04:11.817
that's because entropy is increasing.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.742
Boltzmann explained
that if you start with low entropy,

00:04:14.743 --> 00:04:16.478
it's very natural for it to increase

00:04:16.478 --> 00:04:18.971
because there are more ways
to be high entropy.

00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:24.201
What he didn't explain was why the entropy
was ever low in the first place.

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:26.926
The fact that the entropy
in the Universe was low,

00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:30.451
is a reflection of the fact
that the early Universe was very smooth,

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:34.130
we would like to understand that,
that's our job as cosmologists.

00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:38.106
Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem
we've been giving enough attention to.

00:04:38.107 --> 00:04:41.001
It's not one of the first things
people would say if you ask

00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:44.275
a modern cosmologist what are
the problems we're trying to address.

00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:47.996
One of the people who did understand
this was a problem was Richard Feynman.

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.594
50 years ago, he gave
a series of different lectures

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:52.267
- you've heard about them already -

00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:55.456
popular lectures that became
"The Character of physical law,"

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:57.591
he gave lectures to Caltech undergrads

00:04:57.592 --> 00:05:00.296
that became
"The Feynman lectures on physics,"

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:03.663
to Caltech graduate students,
"The Feynman lectures on gravitation."

00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:06.747
In every one of these books,
every one of these sets of lectures,

00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:08.486
he emphasized this puzzle:

00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:11.659
why did the early Universe
have such a small entropy?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.251
So he says:
- and I'm not going to do the accent -

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:18.019
"For some reason, the Universe,
at one time, had a very low entropy

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.659
for its energy content,
and since then, the entropy has increased.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.750
The arrow of time cannot be
completely understood

00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:27.883
until the mystery of the beginnings
of the history of the Universe

00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:32.251
are reduced still further
from speculation to understanding."

00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:34.256
So that's our job, we want to know.

00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:36.505
This is 50 years ago,
surely, you're thinking,

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:37.949
we've figured it out by now.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.337
It's not true
that we've figured it out by now.

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:42.721
In fact, it's more
than a fifty-year old problem,

00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:45.199
Boltzmann understood
that this was a problem,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.339
and he suggested an answer to it.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.871
Before I get to that,

00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:53.185
I should say that the reason the problem
has gotten worse, rather than better,

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.774
is because in 1998, we learned something
crucial about the Universe,

00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:58.073
that we didn't know before.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.840
We learned that it's accelerating.

00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.560
The Universe is not only expanding,

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.705
if you look at that galaxy,
it's moving away,

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:06.519
you come back a billion years later
and look at it again,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.410
it'll be moving away faster.

00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:11.890
Individual galaxies are speeding
away from us, faster and faster,

00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:14.461
so we say the Universe is accelerating.

00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:16.733
Unlike the low entropy
of the early Universe,

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:20.421
even though we don't know the answer
for this we at least have a good theory,

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.591
that can explain it
if that theory is right,

00:06:22.592 --> 00:06:24.522
and that's the theory of dark energy.

00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:27.628
It's just the idea
that empty space itself has energy,

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.717
and every little cubic centimeter of space

00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:31.451
whether or not there's stuff,

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:34.305
whether there's particles,
matter, radiation, or whatever,

00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:37.161
there's still energy,
even in the space itself.

00:06:37.162 --> 00:06:41.144
This energy, according to Einstein,
exerts a push on the Universe,

00:06:41.145 --> 00:06:45.581
it's a perpetual impulse that pushes
galaxies apart from each other.

00:06:45.582 --> 00:06:49.324
Because dark energy,
unlike matter radiation,

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:52.580
does not dilute away
as the Universe expands.

00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.840
The amount of energy in each cubic
centimeter remains the same,

00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:58.264
even as the Universe
gets bigger and bigger.

00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:02.305
This has crucial implications
for what the Universe is going to do

00:07:02.306 --> 00:07:03.450
in the future.

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:06.091
For one thing, the Universe
will expand forever.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.593
Back when I was your age,

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.155
we didn't know what
the Universe was going to do,

00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:12.876
some people thought it would
recollapse in the future,

00:07:12.883 --> 00:07:14.814
Einstein was fond of this idea.

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:18.209
But if there's dark energy
and the dark energy does not go away,

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.562
the Universe is just going
to keep expanding for ever and ever.

00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:24.667
14 billion years in the past,
a hundred billion dog years,

00:07:24.668 --> 00:07:27.957
but an infinite number
of years into the future.

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:33.093
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes,
space looks finite to us.

00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:35.111
Space may be finite or infinite,

00:07:35.112 --> 00:07:37.301
but because the Universe is accelerating

00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:40.571
there are parts of it
we cannot see and never will see.

00:07:40.572 --> 00:07:43.200
There's a finite region of space
that we have access to,

00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:44.693
surrounded by a horizon,

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:48.681
so even though time goes on forever,
space is limited to us.

00:07:48.682 --> 00:07:52.103
Finally, empty space has a temperature.

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.212
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking
told us that a black hole,

00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:58.075
even though you think it's black,
it actually emits radiation

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.271
when you take into account
quantum mechanics.

00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.754
The curvature of space-time
around the black hole

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:07.867
brings to life the quantum mechanical
fluctuation that the black hole radiates.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:11.205
A precisely similar calculation
by Hawking and Gary Gibbens

00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:14.220
shows that if you have
dark energy in empty space,

00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:17.084
then the whole Universe radiates.

00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:20.706
The energy in empty space brings
to life quantum fluctuations,

00:08:20.707 --> 00:08:23.258
so even though the Universe
will last forever,

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:25.519
and ordinary matter radiation
will dilute away,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.018
there will always be some radiation,
some thermal fluctuations,

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:32.078
even in empty space.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.686
So what this means is that, the Universe
is like a box of gas that lasts forever.

00:08:37.687 --> 00:08:39.907
What are the implications of that?

00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:43.106
That implication was studied by Boltzmann,
back in the 19th century.

00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:48.173
He said, well, entropy increases
because there are many many more ways

00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:51.039
for the Universe to be high entropy
rather than low entropy.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.549
But that's a probabilistic statement.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.552
It will probably increase,

00:08:55.553 --> 00:08:57.617
and the probability is enormously huge,

00:08:57.618 --> 00:08:59.644
it's not something
you have to worry about,

00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:02.923
the air in this room all gathering over
one part of the room,

00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:06.457
and suffocating us,
it's very, very unlikely.

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:10.424
Except if they lock the doors
and kept us here, literally forever,

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.931
that would happen.

00:09:11.932 --> 00:09:13.531
Everything that is allowed,

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:17.396
every configuration that is allowed to be
attained by the molecules in this room,

00:09:17.397 --> 00:09:18.812
would eventually be attained.

00:09:18.813 --> 00:09:23.425
So Boltzmann says, you can start
with a Universe in thermal equilibrium,

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:26.767
he didn't know about the Big Bang
or the expansion of the Universe,

00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:29.774
he thought that space and time were
explained by Isaac Newton,

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:32.258
they were absolutely,
just stuck there forever.

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:36.104
So his idea that natural Universe
was one in which the air molecules

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:39.816
were just spread out evenly everywhere,
everything molecules.

00:09:39.817 --> 00:09:42.817
But if you're Boltzmann,
you know that if you wait long enough,

00:09:42.818 --> 00:09:44.852
the random fluctuations of those molecules

00:09:44.853 --> 00:09:50.255
will occasionally bring them into lower
energy, lower entropy configurations.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:54.080
And then of course, in the natural course
of things, they will expand back.

00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:56.589
So it's not that entropy
must always increase,

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.324
you can get fluctuations
into lower entropy,

00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:02.724
more organized situations.

00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:07.017
Boltzmann then goes on to invent
two very modern-sounding ideas,

00:10:07.018 --> 00:10:10.042
the multiverse and the entropic principle.

00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:13.733
He says, the problem with thermal
equilibrium is that we can't live there.

00:10:13.734 --> 00:10:16.875
Remember, life itself
depends on the arrow of time.

00:10:16.876 --> 00:10:19.677
We would not be able to process
information, to metabolize,

00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:22.799
walk and talk if we lived in
thermal equilibrium.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.632
So, if you imagine a very big Universe,
an infinitely big Universe,

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:29.378
with randomly bumping into
each other particles,

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.692
there will occasionally be
small fluctuations to lower entropy states

00:10:32.693 --> 00:10:34.266
and then they would relax back.

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.404
But there would also be
large fluctuations,

00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:40.593
occasionally you'll make a planet,
or a star, or a galaxy,

00:10:40.594 --> 00:10:43.127
or a hundred billion galaxies.

00:10:43.128 --> 00:10:47.636
So Boltzmann says, we will only live
in the part of the multiverse,

00:10:47.637 --> 00:10:51.620
the part that has an infinitely big set
of fluctuating particles,

00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:55.117
where life is possible, that's the regions
where entropy is low,

00:10:55.118 --> 00:10:59.983
maybe our Universe is just one of those
things that happens, from time to time.

00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:03.049
Now, your homework assignment is
to really think about this,

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.704
to contemplate what it means.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:08.540
Carl Sagan once famously said
that in order to make an apple pie,

00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:10.925
you must first invent the Universe.

00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:13.043
But he was not right.

00:11:13.044 --> 00:11:16.550
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want
to make an apple pie you just wait

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:20.121
for the random motion of atoms
to make you an apple pie.

00:11:20.122 --> 00:11:21.132
(Laughter)

00:11:21.133 --> 00:11:23.533
That will happen much more frequently

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:27.195
than the random motions of atoms
making you an apple orchard,

00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:31.382
and some sugar, and an oven,
and then making you an apple pie.

00:11:31.383 --> 00:11:35.966
So this scenario makes predictions,
and the predictions are

00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:39.473
that the fluctuations
that make us are minimal.

00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:43.635
Even if you imagine that this room
we are in now exists and is real,

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:46.570
and here we are and we have
not only our memories,

00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:49.637
but our impression that outside there is
something called Caltech

00:11:49.638 --> 00:11:52.085
and the United States
and the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:56.051
It's much easier for all those impressions
to randomly fluctuate into your brain

00:11:56.052 --> 00:11:58.971
than for them to actually randomly
fluctuate into Caltech,

00:11:58.972 --> 00:12:00.824
the United States and the galaxy.

00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:04.169
The good news is that, therefore,
this scenario does not work,

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.623
it is not right.

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:08.744
This scenario predicts that we should be
in minimal fluctuation,

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:10.410
even if you left our galaxy out,

00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.947
you would not get
a hundred billion other galaxies.

00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:15.463
Feynman also understood this,
Feynman says:

00:12:15.464 --> 00:12:18.699
"From the hypothesis
that the world is a fluctuation,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.634
all the predictions are
that if we look at a part of the world

00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:24.065
we have never seen before,
we will find it mixed up,

00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:26.495
not like the piece we just looked at."
High entropy.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:30.183
"If our order were due to a fluctuation,
we would not expect order anywhere,

00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:31.822
but where we have just noticed it.

00:12:31.823 --> 00:12:35.431
We therefore conclude
the Universe is not a fluctuation."

00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:38.655
So that's good, the question is then,
what is the right answer?

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:42.601
If the Universe is not a fluctuation, why
did the early Universe have low entropy?

00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:45.968
And I would love to tell you the answer
but I'm running out of time.

00:12:45.968 --> 00:12:47.805
(Laughter)

00:12:47.806 --> 00:12:50.433
Here is the Universe
that we tell you about

00:12:50.434 --> 00:12:52.805
versus the Universe that really exists.

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:54.927
I just showed you this picture,

00:12:54.928 --> 00:12:58.983
the Universe is expanding for the last
ten billion years or so, it's cooling off.

00:12:58.984 --> 00:13:02.656
But we now know enough about the future
of the Universe to say a lot more.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.424
If the dark energy remains around,

00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:09.046
the stars around us will use up
their nuclear fuel, they'll stop burning,

00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:10.880
they will fall into black holes.

00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:14.596
We will live in a Universe
with nothing in it but black holes.

00:13:14.597 --> 00:13:18.114
That Universe will last
10 to the 100 years,

00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:20.505
a lot longer than
our little Universe has lived.

00:13:20.506 --> 00:13:22.767
The future is much longer than the past.

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:25.679
But even black holes
don't last forever, they will evaporate,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.794
and we will be left with nothing
but empty space.

00:13:28.795 --> 00:13:32.183
That empty space lasts
essentially forever.

00:13:32.184 --> 00:13:35.657
However, you notice that
since empty space gives off radiation,

00:13:35.658 --> 00:13:38.971
there's actually thermal fluctuations
and it cycles around

00:13:38.972 --> 00:13:42.974
all the different possible combinations
of the degrees of freedom

00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:44.974
that exist in empty space.

00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:46.984
So even though the Universe lasts forever,

00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:50.564
there's only a finite number of things
that can possibly happen in it,

00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:55.735
they all happen over a period of time
equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.

00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:58.335
So here are two questions for you:

00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:01.739
number one, if the Universe lasts
for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.657
why are we born
in the first 14 billion years of it,

00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:09.274
in the warm, comfortable
afterglow of the Big Bang?

00:14:09.275 --> 00:14:11.778
Why aren't we in empty space?

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:15.234
You might say, there's nothing there
to be living, but that's not right.

00:14:15.235 --> 00:14:18.249
You could be a random fluctuation
out of the nothingness.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.557
Why aren't you?

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:21.666
More homework assignments for you.

00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:24.142
So, like I said,
I don't actually know the answer,

00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:26.380
I'm going to give you
my favorite scenario;

00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:29.090
either it's just like that,
there is no explanation,

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:32.279
it's a brute fact about the Universe
that we should learn to accept

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.473
and stop asking questions.

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:39.053
Or maybe the Big Bang is
not the beginning of the Universe.

00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:42.170
An unbroken egg is
a low entropy configuration

00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:44.613
and yet when we open
our refrigerator we do not go:

00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:48.933
"How surprising to find this low entropy
configuration in our refrigerator."

00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:51.470
That's because an egg
is not a closed system.

00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:53.429
It comes out of a chicken.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.041
Maybe the Universe
comes out of a Universal chicken.

00:14:57.042 --> 00:14:57.994
(Laughter)

00:14:57.995 --> 00:14:59.927
Maybe there is something that naturally,

00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:02.853
through the growth of the laws of physics,

00:15:02.854 --> 00:15:07.089
gives rise to a Universe like ours
in low entropy configuration.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.245
If that's true it would happen
more than once,

00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:11.517
we would be part
of a much bigger multiverse.

00:15:11.518 --> 00:15:13.078
That's my favorite scenario.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.584
So the organizers asked me to end
with a bold speculation;

00:15:16.585 --> 00:15:21.120
my bold speculation is that I will be
absolutely vindicated by history,

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:26.897
and 50 years from now all of my current
wild ideas will be accepted as truths

00:15:26.898 --> 00:15:29.091
by the scientific and external communities

00:15:29.092 --> 00:15:31.824
who will all believe
that our little Universe

00:15:31.825 --> 00:15:34.377
is just a small part
of a much larger multiverse,

00:15:34.378 --> 00:15:38.480
and even better, we will understand
what happened at the Big Bang

00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:42.032
in terms of a theory that we will be able
to compare to observations.

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:45.257
It's a prediction, I might be wrong,
but we've been thinking,

00:15:45.258 --> 00:15:48.365
as a human race,
about what the Universe was like,

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:51.022
why it came to be the way it did,
for many many years.

00:15:51.023 --> 00:15:54.089
It's exciting to think, we may finally
know the answer some day.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.212
Thank you.

00:15:55.213 --> 00:15:56.751
(Applause)
