DETECTIVES...

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.476 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A NASTY, NASTY CRIME
SCENE.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.312 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: ...AND A CRIME THAT
OFFERS FEW CLUES.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.149 align:start position:0%

CRIME BY A JILTED LOVER?

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:22.555 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HER BODY WAS POSITIONED IN A
WAY THAT WAS VERY SEXUALLY

SUGGESTIVE.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.825
&gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT
ANYBODY'S CAPABLE OF SOMETHING

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:26.993 align:start position:0%
LIKE THIS.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.463
&gt;&gt; Narrator: UNTIL ONE MAN'S
WORDS REVEAL A TWISTED MOTIVE

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:41.908 align:start position:0%
AND A KILLER WITH A BIZARRE
PAST.

JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, WITH ITS
WARM, SANDY BEACHES AND

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:50.183
SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE, WAS THE
PERFECT PLACE FOR 25-YEAR-OLD

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.718
COREY PARKER TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:56.956
SHE LIKED IT A LOT BETTER THAN
THE COLD WINTERS OF HER HOMETOWN

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.292 align:start position:0%
OF ROCHESTER, NEW YORK.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.660 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; COREY WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:01.794 align:start position:0% line:0%
SHE WAS VERY TALL.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.529 line:0%
SHE HAD A PRESENCE ABOUT HER.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:07.133 line:0%
SOME OF OUR BEST TIMES TOGETHER
WAS A GIRLS' NIGHT<i> IN</i> -- YOU

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.036 align:start position:0% line:0%
KNOW, RENT MOVIES AND GO HANG
OUT AT THE HOUSE.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.339 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: COREY WORKED HER
WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AS A

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.573 align:start position:0% line:0%
WAITRESS.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:18.077 line:0%
DURING THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY
OF HER JUNIOR YEAR, SHE DIDN'T

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.048 align:start position:0% line:0%
SHOW UP FOR WORK, SO HER FELLOW
EMPLOYEES WERE CONCERNED.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:25.751 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY THAT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:29.889 line:0%
SO THE MANAGER DIRECTED ONE OF
THE COOKS TO GO BY HER APARTMENT

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.390 align:start position:0% line:0%
TO CHECK ON HER.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:35.761
&gt;&gt; Narrator: HER APARTMENT DOOR
WAS LOCKED, BUT HER CO-WORKER

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:42.034
LOOKED INSIDE AND SAW HER BODY
ON THE BED, COVERED IN BLOOD.

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:46.439 line:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS CRIME SCENE WAS ONE OF
THE WORST THAT THIS COUNTY HAS

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:49.775 align:start position:0% line:0%
EVER SEEN IN TERMS OF ITS JUST
GRUESOMENESS.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:53.346 size:88% position:44% line:0%
THERE WAS BLOOD ALL OVER HER
BEDROOM, ALL OVER HER BODY,

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.648 align:start position:0% line:0%
ALMOST AS IF IT HAD BEEN PAINTED
ON HER.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.551 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE SCENE APPEARED
TO BE STAGED.

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:03.322 line:0%
&gt;&gt; COREY'S BODY WAS POSITIONED
IN A WAY THAT WAS VERY SEXUALLY

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.457 align:start position:0% line:0%
SUGGESTIVE.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.793 align:start position:0% line:0%
SHE WAS NUDE, HER LEGS WERE
SPREAD APART.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.997 line:0%
THERE'S EVERY INDICATION THAT
THERE WAS A SEXUAL MOTIVE TO

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.198 align:start position:0% line:0%
THIS CRIME.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:16.669 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INTERESTINGLY, THE
AUTOPSY FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:17.937 align:start position:0% line:0%
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; COREY PARKER WAS STABBED 101
TIMES.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:26.445 size:84% position:42% line:0%
OF THOSE 101 STAB WOUNDS, I
BELIEVE 54 WERE POSTMORTEM.

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:31.884 align:start position:0%
OVERKILL DOES INDICATE TO
INVESTIGATORS A RELATIONSHIP

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.886
BETWEEN VICTIM AND PERPETRATOR.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.757 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: POLICE LEARNED THAT
THE NIGHT BEFORE HER MURDER,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.060 align:start position:0%
COREY SPENT THE NIGHT AT A LOCAL
BAR WITH FRIENDS.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.063 align:start position:0%
WITNESSES SAID SHE LEFT AROUND
1:00 A.M.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:49.335
THE CLOTHES COREY WORE TO THE
BAR WERE FOLDED NEATLY AT THE

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.470 align:start position:0%
BOTTOM OF HER BED.

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:55.074 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; WE ALSO KNOW THAT SHE HAD
PREPARED HERSELF FOR BED AND

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:58.878
CRAWLED IN HER BED, SO WE KNOW
THAT SHE WASN'T ATTACKED UNTIL

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
AFTER SHE WAS IN BED.

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:05.017 align:start position:0%
SO EITHER HE WAS WAITING IN HER
BEDROOM CLOSET...

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start position:0%
OR HE LET HIMSELF INTO THE
APARTMENT.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:16.963
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS FOUND
A GOLD-PLATED ZIPPO LIGHTER IN

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.264 align:start position:0%
COREY'S BEDROOM.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:23.469 align:start position:0%
ALTHOUGH COREY SMOKED, NONE OF
HER FRIENDS RECOGNIZED IT.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:27.306 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATORS DUSTED THE
LIGHTER FOR FINGERPRINTS BUT

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.608 align:start position:0%
NONE WERE FOUND.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:32.745
&gt;&gt; IT BECAME APPARENT TO US THAT
THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THAT WAS

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:34.247 align:start position:0%
COREY PARKER'S LIGHTER.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.950
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INSIDE THE KITCHEN
OF COREY'S APARTMENT, POLICE

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:43.122 align:start position:0%
FOUND A BLOODSTAIN ON THE
KITCHEN COUNTER NEXT TO THE SINK

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:50.596
AND ON THE WINDOWSILL ABOVE THE
SINK, BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.500
THIS LED POLICE TO BELIEVE THE
KILLER ENTERED AND EXITED THE

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.103 align:start position:0%
APARTMENT THROUGH THE KITCHEN
WINDOW.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:00.973
&gt;&gt; THE REASON, WE BELIEVE, THE
KILLER DIDN'T GO OUT THE DOOR

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:05.144 align:start position:0%
WAS BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT THAT
WAS OUTSIDE.

00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:09.248
THE KITCHEN WINDOW OFFERED THE
SUSPECT A WAY TO BOTH GET IN AND

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:12.451 align:start position:0%
OUT OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT
BEING ILLUMINATED.

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:16.222 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: COREY'S PHONE
RECORDS REVEALED THAT A FORMER

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:21.027 align:start position:0%
CO-WORKER, 27-YEAR-OLD
ERIC JONES, HAD BEEN CALLING HER

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.696 size:88% position:44%
REPEATEDLY BEFORE HER DEATH.

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.433 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE HAD BEEN ASKING COREY OUT
FOR SOME TIME.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.035 size:88% position:44%
SHE HAD BEEN TELLING HIM NO.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:33.773
&gt;&gt; EMPLOYEES AT THE RESTAURANT
TOLD US THAT HE HAD AN OBSESSION

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:38.511
OR AN INFATUATION WITH HER AND
WAS CONTINUOUSLY TALKING TO HER

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:41.747 align:start position:0%
WHEN SHE'D COME TO WORK OR
TRYING TO ASK HER OUT.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.085 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: JONES HAD NO
CRIMINAL RECORD BUT ACTED

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.788 align:start position:0%
BIZARRELY WHEN INTERVIEWED BY
POLICE.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.758 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE A
HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS, BY

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:56.128 align:start position:0%
HIS OWN ADMISSION, BUT HE TOLD
POLICE OFFICERS THAT HE HAD

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.365 size:88% position:44%
FANTASIES ABOUT RAPING AND
KILLING WOMEN, WHICH CLEARLY

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:01.100
JUMPED OUT AT LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:04.503 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE DESCRIBED SEXUAL FANTASIES
THAT HE HAD ABOUT COREY.

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:06.405 size:78% position:39%
SOME WERE FAIRLY VIOLENT.

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:10.576 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: HE EVEN TOLD
INVESTIGATORS HOW HE WOULD HAVE

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:13.913 align:start position:0%
MURDERED COREY HAD HE BEEN GIVEN
THE CHANCE.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:18.617
&gt;&gt; HE DESCRIBED HOW HE WOULD
HAVE SLIT HER THROAT EARLY IN

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.654 align:start position:0%
THE MURDER SO THAT SHE COULDN'T
SCREAM FOR HELP.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:25.358 align:start position:0%
AND THAT DESCRIPTION WAS SIMILAR
ENOUGH TO HOW SHE WAS REALLY

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.428 align:start position:0%
KILLED THAT IT AGAIN RAISED THE
POLICE SUSPICION.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.299 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER WHO PERFORMED

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:39.205
COREY PARKER'S AUTOPSY FOUND NO
SIGNS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, BUT

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:43.075 align:start position:0%
COREY HAD BEEN STABBED OVER 100
TIMES.

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:48.547
THERE WERE NUMEROUS DEFENSIVE
WOUNDS ON HER HANDS AND ARMS,

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.616 align:start position:0%
PROVING...

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:53.953 align:start position:0%
THERE HAD BEEN AN INTENSE
STRUGGLE.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.889 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; OUR THEORY WAS THAT
COREY PARKER FOUGHT FOR HER LIFE

00:05:56.922 --> 00:05:59.024 align:start position:0% line:0%
IN ORDER TO PREVENT A SEXUAL
ASSAULT.

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:03.162 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS FOUND
SEVERAL FOREIGN HAIRS IN COREY'S

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:03.896 align:start position:0% line:0%
HANDS.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:07.166 align:start position:0% line:0%
ONE HAD AN INTACT ROOT.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.636 line:0%
&gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT THE HAIR HAD
ROOT MATERIAL ON IT AND WAS NOT

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.173 line:0%
FROM HER WOULD ALLOW YOU TO AT
LEAST PRESUME THAT THAT HAIR HAD

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:16.242 size:81% position:41% line:0%
TO BE OBTAINED FORCEFULLY.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:18.944 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: DNA TESTING
REVEALED THE BLOOD IN THE

00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:23.883
KITCHEN CAME FROM THE SAME
PERSON AS THE HAIR IN COREY'S

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:24.984 align:start position:0%
HAND.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:29.155 align:start position:0%
SURPRISINGLY, THIS DNA DID NOT
MATCH THE PRIME SUSPECT,

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:34.460
ERIC JONES, COREY'S CO-WORKER,
DESPITE HIS BIZARRE BEHAVIOR.

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.962
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY HE
WAS MENTALLY UNSTABLE AT THIS

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:42.768 align:start position:0%
TIME, AND WHILE PRESCRIBED
MEDICATION TO CONTROL HIS MENTAL

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:44.270
ILLNESS, HE WAS NOT TAKING IT.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:48.007
AND SO I THINK AT THE TIME THAT
HE GAVE THESE STATEMENTS, HE WAS

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.341 align:start position:0%
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE DNA FROM
COREY'S APARTMENT DID NOT MATCH

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:57.750 size:88% position:44%
ANY OF THE DNA PROFILES IN
EITHER THE STATE OR NATIONAL

00:06:57.783 --> 00:07:00.453 align:start position:0%
CRIMINAL DATABASES.

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:05.157
IN THE SEARCH FOR COREY PARKER'S
KILLER, INVESTIGATORS DISCOVERED

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.595 align:start position:0%
THAT SHE HAD JUST STARTED DATING
SOMEONE NEW.

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.997 size:75% position:38%
HIS NAME WAS DAVID WILT.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.167 align:start position:0%
BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR
INVESTIGATORS TO ELIMINATE HIM

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.335 align:start position:0%
AS A SUSPECT.

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:20.739 align:start position:0%
HE WAS OUT OF STATE AT HIS
PARENTS' HOUSE FOR THANKSGIVING.

00:07:20.772 --> 00:07:24.243 align:start position:0% line:0%
AND SO, YOU KNOW, HE HAD A VERY
SOLID ALIBI.

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:27.646 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS
INTERVIEWED EVERYONE COREY SPOKE

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:31.083 align:start position:0%
WITH AT THE RITZ BAR ON THE
NIGHT OF HER MURDER.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:36.121
MOST OF THE PEOPLE COREY SAW
THAT NIGHT LEFT THE BAR BEFORE

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:37.355 align:start position:0%
SHE DID.

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:42.061
BUT ONE FRIEND, TIFFANY SMITH,
STAYED WITH COREY UNTIL 1:00 IN

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:43.262 align:start position:0%
THE MORNING.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:47.566
TIFFANY TOLD POLICE THEY BOTH
LEFT THE BAR AT THE SAME TIME

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:51.170 align:start position:0%
IN THEIR OWN CARS AND WENT THEIR
SEPARATE WAYS.

00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:55.641
BUT TIFFANY TOLD FRIENDS THAT
WASN'T THE ONLY CONTACT SHE HAD

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:57.977 align:start position:0%
WITH COREY THAT NIGHT.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.880 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID SHE CALLED COREY
FROM HER CELLPHONE AROUND

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:03.115 align:start position:0% line:0%
2:00 A.M. AND COREY ANSWERED THE
PHONE.

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:06.886 align:start position:0% line:0%
SHE SAID WHEN COREY ANSWERED THE
PHONE THAT COREY WAS ASLEEP.

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:09.989 align:start position:0%
AND SHE ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS
DOING.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.824 size:84% position:42%
COREY SAID, "I'M SLEEPING."

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:15.694
&gt;&gt; Narrator: TIFFANY ALSO TOLD
FRIENDS SHE DROVE TO COREY'S

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:20.366
APARTMENT AROUND 4:00 A.M. AND
KNOCKED ON HER DOOR BUT NO ONE

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.201 align:start position:0%
ANSWERED, SO SHE LEFT.

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:27.039
&gt;&gt; HER STATEMENT THAT SHE WENT
BY COREY'S HOUSE PUTS HER AT THE

00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:30.910 align:start position:0%
CRIME SCENE DURING THE TIME THAT
COREY COULD'VE POSSIBLY BEEN

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.078 align:start position:0%
KILLED.

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:36.015 align:start position:0%
AND THAT ADDED TO THAT SUSPICION
THAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.116 align:start position:0%
INVOLVED.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.885 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WHEN
INVESTIGATORS CHECKED TIFFANY'S

00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:44.223 align:start position:0%
CELLPHONE RECORDS, THEY MADE A
STARTLING DISCOVERY.

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:49.495 align:start position:0%
TIFFANY DIDN'T CALL COREY AFTER
THEY LEFT THE RITZ BAR.

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:55.267
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, INVESTIGATORS WERE
CURIOUS AS TO WHY SHE WOULD SAY

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.572
THAT SHE HAD CALLED AND ACTUALLY
SPOKEN WITH COREY WHEN IT WASN'T

TRUE.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:03.876 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WHY WOULD
TIFFANY MAKE UP A STORY LIKE

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:05.077 align:start position:0%
THAT?

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.746
&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT
THE POSSIBILITY THAT MAYBE SHE

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.748 align:start position:0%
WAS SEXUALLY INTERESTED IN
COREY.

00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:13.586
TIFFANY MENTIONED TO ME IN JUST
A VERY CASUAL CONVERSATION THAT

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.188 size:75% position:38%
SHE HAD BEEN BI-CURIOUS.

00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:20.826 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; TIFFANY HAD A REAL, TRUE
AFFECTION FOR COREY.

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:24.263 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: IN ADDITION,
TIFFANY TOLD FRIENDS THINGS

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:28.267
ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE THAT HAD
NOT BEEN RELEASED TO THE GENERAL

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.501 align:start position:0%
PUBLIC.

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:33.105
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS DESCRIBING THE STATE
OF THE VICTIM'S BODY AND THIS

SCENE WITHOUT HAVING BEEN PRIVY
TO EITHER PHOTOGRAPHS OR A

00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:38.077 size:81% position:41%
WALK-THROUGH OF THE SCENE.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.979 align:start position:0%
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY
SUSPICIOUS.

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:42.548 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY
STRANGE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ANY

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
IDEA OF HOW COREY HAD BEEN
KILLED.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:50.055
&gt;&gt; Narrator: TIFFANY DENIED ANY
INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER BUT

00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
WHEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A DNA
SAMPLE, SHE REFUSED.

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:57.396 line:0%
&gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT SHE DID NOT
WILLINGLY GIVE UP DNA OR HAIR

00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:59.999 align:start position:0% line:0%
SAMPLES LED THE POLICE TO
BELIEVE SHE HAD SOMETHING TO

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0% line:0%
HIDE.

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:06.505 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: EVEN THOUGH
COREY PARKER'S FRIEND

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:10.643 align:start position:0%
TIFFANY SMITH INSISTED SHE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH COREY'S

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:15.514 align:start position:0%
MURDER, SHE MADE UNTRUTHFUL
STATEMENTS ABOUT HER ACTIVITIES

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:18.984 size:84% position:42%
ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:22.554 align:start position:0%
SHE ALSO REFUSED TO PROVIDE A
DNA SAMPLE.

00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:25.991 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE ACTUALLY PUT HERSELF AT
THE CRIME SCENE IN ONE OF HER

STATEMENTS.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.429 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT SCIENTISTS
FOUND A SURPRISING PIECE OF

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
INFORMATION IN THE BLOOD
EVIDENCE LEFT BY THE KILLER.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:39.505 align:start position:0%
THEY FOUND THE TELLTALE "Y"
CHROMOSOME.

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:44.543 align:start position:0%
A "Y" CHROMOSOME IS PRESENT ONLY
IN MEN.

00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:47.646 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE DID DEVELOP A MALE PROFILE
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SAMPLE,

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.616
WHICH WAS A BLOOD SAMPLE FROM A
POINT OF ENTRY OR EXIT INTO THE

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:51.817 align:start position:0%
APARTMENT.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.287 size:88% position:44% line:0%
WE WERE OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS
COULD BE FROM THE SUSPECT.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.390 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SO TIFFANY WAS
ELIMINATED AS A SUSPECT.

00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:01.794
&gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVED THAT TIFFANY
WAS SAYING THINGS TO KIND OF

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.997 align:start position:0%
INJECT HERSELF INTO THE
INVESTIGATION TO MAKE HER SEEM

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.699 size:88% position:44%
MORE IMPORTANT THAN SHE WAS.

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:10.302 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS
BELIEVED TIFFANY LEARNED DETAILS

00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:14.139 align:start position:0%
OF THE CRIME SCENE FROM A FRIEND
WHO WORKED ON THE EMERGENCY

00:11:14.172 --> 00:11:15.941 align:start position:0%
CREW.

00:11:15.974 --> 00:11:19.878
POLICE WERE FORCED TO CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY THAT COREY'S

00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:23.916 align:start position:0%
MURDER WAS A RANDOM ACT
PERPETRATED BY A MAN WITH AN

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.953
UNCONTROLLABLE HATRED FOR WOMEN.

00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:33.025
EVENTUALLY, POLICE PERFORMED DNA
TESTS ON 38 MEN -- CO-WORKERS,

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:37.329 align:start position:0%
FELLOW STUDENTS, FORMER
BOYFRIENDS -- WITH NO SUCCESS.

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:41.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT
THEY WOULD NEVER SOLVE THE CASE.

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:45.170 line:0%
WHAT I LEARNED FROM WATCHING
OTHER CRIMES IS THAT THE LONGER

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:48.941 align:start position:0% line:0%
IT GOES ON, THE LESS LIKELY IT
IS TO SOLVE A CRIME.

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:53.178
&gt;&gt; Narrator: 18 MONTHS PASSED,
AND POLICE CONTINUED TO WORK THE

00:11:53.211 --> 00:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
CASE, PORING THROUGH THE FILE,
RE-READING THE POLICE

INTERVIEWS.

00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:03.522
TO GENERATE NEW LEADS, POLICE
OFFERED A REWARD FOR ANY NEW

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:07.926
EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO A
CONVICTION, AND IT GENERATED A

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:09.027 align:start position:0%

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.765 align:start position:0%
SOME EMPLOYEES OF A LOCAL
STEAK HOUSE A FEW MILES FROM

THIS RESTAURANT ONE DAY AND TOLD
THEM THAT HIS CHILD HAD BEEN

IN TEXAS AND THAT HE NEEDED TO

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.187 align:start position:0% line:0%
GET BACK HOME.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.791

RESPONDED GENEROUSLY BY RAISING

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:42.795 size:84% position:42%
MONEY SO HE COULD RETURN TO
TEXAS TO ATTEND HIS SON'S

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.063 align:start position:0%
FUNERAL.

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:46.732
&gt;&gt; AFTER COLLECTING THAT MONEY,
THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT WENT

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:50.502
OVER TO GIVE THE MONEY TO HIS
SISTER, WHEN HE WAS TOLD THAT

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:54.873 align:start position:0%
ROBERT DENNEY DID NOT HAVE A SON
AND THAT THAT STORY WAS

00:12:54.906 --> 00:12:55.841 align:start position:0%

SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:00.846 align:start position:0%
ROBERT DENNEY.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:06.785 line:0%

OF SIGHT INTO HER APARTMENT.

LIVED IN AN APARTMENT BELOW HIM.

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:23.702 line:0%

00:13:29.207 --> 00:13:33.078 align:start position:0%

OUT OF THE HOME SHE SHARED WITH

HER HUSBAND, BECAUSE OF HIS ODD
BEHAVIOR -- STAYING UP ALL HOURS

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.559

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:53.131

THEY WERE INVESTIGATING HIS

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:33.031 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THIS PROVED TO BE
HARDER THAN INVESTIGATORS

00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:34.266 align:start position:0%

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:39.438 align:start position:0%
DENNEY SMOKED DURING HIS

SURE TO KEEP THE CIGARETTE

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:47.145

00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:52.351

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:01.927 align:start position:0%
HE REFUSED TO SEAL THE

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.395 size:78% position:39%
BASICALLY TOLD US, "LOOK.

00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:19.845 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SO INVESTIGATORS
PUT DENNEY UNDER SURVEILLANCE AT

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:24.483 align:start position:0%
HIS HOME AND AT THE COMPUTER
STORE WHERE HE WORKED.

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:29.454
HE TOOK A CIGARETTE BREAK EVERY

00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:31.656 align:start position:0%
KEEP THE EVIDENCE.

00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:34.426 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHEN HE SMOKED HIS
CIGARETTES, HE WOULD PUT OUT THE

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:37.596

HIS POCKET SO THEY COULD NOT BE

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.830 align:start position:0%

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:43.535

DENNEY CAME OUTSIDE TO SMOKE,

BUT THIS TIME HE DID SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:59.351

ALL OF A SUDDEN, BEGAN SPITTING

00:16:59.384 --> 00:17:03.488 align:start position:0%
ON THE SIDEWALK -- NOT ONCE, NOT
TWICE, BUT SIX TIMES.

00:17:03.521 --> 00:17:07.659 align:start position:0%

TOP OF THE RAINWATER, MAKING IT
EASY TO COLLECT.

00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:14.933 align:start position:0%
AND THE BARRIER HELPED REDUCE
CONTAMINATION.

00:17:14.966 --> 00:17:18.904 align:start position:0%

WHERE IT WAS.

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:22.207 line:0%

IMPLICATED DENNEY...

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:51.536 align:start position:0%
THE GOLD-PLATED LIGHTER FOUND IN

FORMER GIRLFRIEND TOLD POLICE IT

00:17:56.808 --> 00:17:58.143 align:start position:0%
WAS HIS LIGHTER.

00:17:58.176 --> 00:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE
EMBLEM ON IT.

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:04.282 align:start position:0%
SHE WAS POSITIVE THAT IT WAS HIS
LIGHTER.

00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:08.053
&gt;&gt; Narrator: PROSECUTORS BELIEVE
ROBERT DENNEY WAS OBSESSED WITH

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:11.857 align:start position:0%
HIS BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOR,
COREY PARKER...

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.793 align:start position:0%
AND MONITORED HER COMINGS AND
GOINGS.

00:18:14.826 --> 00:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
HE ALSO LOOKED INSIDE HER
APARTMENT WHENEVER HE COULD.

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:24.803
PROSECUTORS BELIEVE DENNEY SAW
COREY GET READY TO GO WITH HER

00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:29.574 align:start position:0%
FRIENDS ON THE NIGHT BEFORE
THANKSGIVING...

00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:35.647 size:88% position:44%
THEN, ARMED WITH A KNIFE AND
WEARING GLOVES, HE ENTERED

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.353 align:start position:0%
COREY'S APARTMENT THROUGH THE
KITCHEN WINDOW.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:45.790 size:88% position:44%
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HE HID
SOMEWHERE, POSSIBLY IN HER

00:18:45.823 --> 00:18:55.868 align:start position:0%
CLOSET, AND WAITED FOR HER TO
RETURN.

00:18:55.868 --> 00:19:01.373 align:start position:0%
CLOSET, AND WAITED FOR HER TO
RETURN.

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:15.053
COREY HAD NO HINT THAT ANYONE
WAS INSIDE, AND WENT TO BED.

00:19:15.086 --> 00:19:20.892 size:88% position:44%
THAT'S WHEN DENNEY ATTACKED.

00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:26.031
BUT COREY FOUGHT BACK -- MUCH
HARDER THAN HE'D ANTICIPATED.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:29.668 align:start position:0%
IN THE PROCESS, SHE PULLED OUT
SOME OF HIS HAIR, WHICH

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.770 align:start position:0%
CONTAINED HIS DNA.

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:36.741 size:88% position:44%
HIS LIGHTER SLIPPED FROM HIS
POCKET DURING THE STRUGGLE.

00:19:36.774 --> 00:19:39.511 size:81% position:41%
HE STABBED HER REPEATEDLY.

00:19:39.544 --> 00:19:47.419 align:start position:0%
AT SOME POINT, HE CUT HIMSELF
AND BLED INSIDE HIS GLOVED HAND.

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:51.923 align:start position:0%
AS HE LEFT THE APARTMENT THROUGH
THE KITCHEN WINDOW, HE LEFT A

00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:57.929 align:start position:0%
BLOOD SMEAR ON THE WINDOWSILL,
PROVIDING HIS DNA.

00:19:57.962 --> 00:20:02.601 align:start position:0%
ROBERT DENNEY WENT ON TRIAL FOR
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

THE JURY DELIBERATED FOR 45
MINUTES.

00:20:05.703 --> 00:20:08.540 align:start position:0%

THE FIRST DEGREE AS CHARGED IN
THE INDICTMENT.

00:20:11.042 --> 00:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
WE, THE JURY, FURTHER FIND THAT
THE KILLING WAS DONE WITH

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
PREMEDITATION.

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:19.351
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SINCE HE WAS ONLY
17 YEARS OLD, A MINOR, WHEN HE

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:24.222 align:start position:0%
COMMITTED THE CRIME, DENNEY WAS
SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON

00:20:24.255 --> 00:20:26.258 align:start position:0%
WITHOUT PAROLE.

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.660 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ROBERT DENNEY IS A HARD
PERSON TO UNDERSTAND.

00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:32.931 align:start position:0%
THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY SOME
DYSFUNCTION IN HIS FAMILY THAT

00:20:32.964 --> 00:20:36.201 align:start position:0%
IS FAR GREATER THAN MOST OF US
PROBABLY KNOW.

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:39.771 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; HE WAS METHODICAL IN CLEANING
UP, HE WAS CAREFUL, AND HE

00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:44.743 line:0%
ALMOST GOT AWAY WITH MURDER, BUT
FOR THAT ONE DROP OF BLOOD AND

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:48.847 align:start position:0% line:0%
HAIR THAT HE SHED THAT HE DIDN'T
EVER EXPECT TO BE DISCOVERED.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.886 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS GIRL WAS A VERY
LIKABLE, VERY INTELLIGENT, VERY

00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:59.658 line:0%
BEAUTIFUL 25-YEAR-OLD THAT HAD A
BRIGHT FUTURE IN FRONT OF HER.

SHE CAME FROM A GOOD FAMILY AND
HAD A GOOD SOCIAL NETWORK, HAD

00:21:03.661 --> 00:21:07.632 line:0%
