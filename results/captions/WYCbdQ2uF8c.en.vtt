00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.805
- Everywhere you go in Los Angeles,

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.180
you see poor people everywhere,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.850
Skid Row, Downtown,
everywhere, they're everywhere

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.470
and look, they sleep in the elevators

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.471
and yeah, you can't live outside,

00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:17.832
people are not meant to live outside.

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:20.210
- I really think that people down here

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.028
are just like you and us, I
mean, they're a paycheck away,

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:25.328
we're all a paycheck
away from being homeless.

00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:30.040
- It used to be confined to certain areas,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.740
but now pretty much
anywhere in the city you go,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.153
you'll see someone experiencing
literal homelessness.

00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:42.640
- Because all the lost moving
in and the different crowds,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.733
so we don't have a choice.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.297
(light melodic music)

00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.071
(light haunting music)

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:23.450
- Every time I see the Dow Jones

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.490
tick up another 1000 points,
I know that all these people

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.390
on the bottom rung are gonna drop off.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.720
- [Narrator] There are more
homeless people in America

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.007
today, than the populations
of Orlando and Reno combined

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:44.640
and that doesn't include people

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.080
forced to live with friends or relatives,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.130
that number could be
closer to 7.4 million.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.170
But the American economy is showing signs

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.230
it's bounced back from the 2008 recession,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.960
the GDP is up, unemployment
is down and homes are selling,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.860
yet despite all that progress,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.180
the gap in income and
equality keeps widening.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.260
Since 1980, the world's
richest 1% have taken

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.792
larger and larger shares
of the world's income,

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:13.610
while the bottom half has taken

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.610
smaller and smaller slices of the pie,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.850
this pattern is pushing
more and more people

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.800
to the financial brink,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.360
estimates show that 150 million people

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.760
worldwide may be homeless,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.650
another 1.6 billion don't
have adequate housing.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.650
So what got us here?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.400
For one, housing prices have skyrocketed,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.620
while ordinary people's incomes stagnate.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.970
To afford an average
rate apartment in the US,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.350
a person must earn at least 16.35 an hour,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.760
that's more than double
the federal minimum wage.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.332
There's no magic bullet,
but innovative solutions

00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:51.722
are being tested around the world,

00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:53.340
the most promising are designed

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.670
to tackle homelessness from all angles,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.633
housing, substance abuse,
health and social isolation.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.474
There's the Housing First Movement,

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.280
that means putting a
roof over people's heads,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.680
then tackling issues like mental illness

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.410
and addiction with support services,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.191
it's worked for Finland and Denmark,

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.640
while homelessness rises across Europe,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.530
it's declining in those countries.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.620
These new ideas are promising
and as global wealth grows,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.630
new solutions and ideas are arising

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.760
to tackle the complexity of homelessness,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.880
however if applying these solutions

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.152
aren't made a priority on a global scale,

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:33.390
then the millions of
those who are homeless

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.033
may likely continue to grow.

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:39.773
(light haunting music)

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.260
- Homelessness hasn't always
been a crisis in America,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.510
it really became a
crisis in the early '80s

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.509
with drastic cuts, that were launched

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.679
by the Reagan administration
to the safety net,

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.053
that this country had had at the time.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.002
Inequality is growing and there
are people on the lower end,

00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:11.313
on the losing end of
that growing inequality.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.250
- And then the slide, yes,
one, two or three bad things,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.040
an employer that hits a bump

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.128
and has to lay people off temporarily,

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:27.590
so you can very quickly
find yourself unemployed

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.930
and then without housing and then in a car

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.079
with your kids and there you go.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.380
- People experiencing
severe mental illness,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.130
people who are deep into addictions,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.550
those are people that a lot of times

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.200
are stereotyped as the typical person

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.460
experiencing homelessness
and that's just not the case

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.827
and it's just the most visible
person that you remember,

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:49.493
like you always remember the
person screaming on the corner,

00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:52.293
you don't really see two
people waiting at the bus stop,

00:04:53.517 --> 00:04:55.481
who are homeless and at the same level

00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:57.380
that that other person is.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.030
- I think for the substance use thing,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.690
it is kind of like the
chicken and the egg,

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.440
sometimes which came first
is really hard to determine.

00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:15.861
So the county plans to
displace over 1000 people

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:17.650
from the Santa Ana riverbed

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.100
and currently offers no
more than half a dozen beds,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.800
that are actually available
for people down here,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.883
there is no option,
there is no alternative.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.517
- I actually like ran away from
originally a children's home

00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:34.770
and I just found a place,
where I could seek refuge

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.653
and I ended up staying
in Tent City in Anaheim.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.060
It might seem kind of trashy here,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.570
but it really is trashy actually,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.631
but you know, a lot of
it is actually set up,

00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:47.083
life is how you make it.

00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:19.817
- I came out here in 2016, January.

00:06:19.817 --> 00:06:23.010
I had an apartment with my
daughter and my husband,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.673
I was doing project management
at Kinney Construction,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.060
so, it was a good job
and then he lost his job

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.710
and slowly after that, I lost my job,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.990
so I gave our daughter to my friend

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.320
and we moved out here.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.030
I built it from here
all the way to the end

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.820
to where the playground is at,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.906
this is all us, this is my
family, that moved out here.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.156
You know, everyone
deserves to live somewhere

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.730
and with other people, you know,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.810
we shouldn't have to be
finding a parking lot corner

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.500
in the dark and going
to sleep for the night

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.583
and then be woken up by the police.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.696
There's a lot of intelligent
people on this trail,

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:08.133
like they're not just
drug addicts and you know,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.640
criminals or whatever they
say about us in the paper.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.640
- There's a lot of questions in there

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.080
that are really super sensitive questions,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.710
the most sensitive questions
to me in the survey

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.150
is the questions about

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.131
whether they've experienced sexual abuse,

00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:43.190
there's a good amount
of questions like that

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.160
and I just remind them, I
didn't make up these questions,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.130
I'm just doing my best
to get through the survey

00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:53.170
and there's a lot of questions

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.610
specific to how long
they've been homeless,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.554
how they're spending their nights,

00:07:57.554 --> 00:07:59.340
whether it's in a tent

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:04.100
or a makeshift shelter like
cardboard or things like that,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.820
so it's really important every year

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.693
to get some idea on
how many are out there.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.870
- There are solutions, but it's a question

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.120
of prioritizing this as a problem,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.440
an urgent problem that
deserves our attention

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.350
and deserves government
attention at whatever level,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.570
housing first and then address the other,

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.203
any other needs after that.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.720
The problem in LA is certainly not unique,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.800
homelessness is a crisis
across the country

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800
and what you saw in LA is
just one example of that,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.631
LA has very high housing costs

00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:23.100
and that really is what is
driving homelessness there,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.020
but that's true of many other cities

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.667
and the cost of living has not caught up

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:31.740
with the cost of housing and
that's driving homelessness

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.935
and it's an national crisis
that's not being addressed.

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:40.890
Communities can still
take action on their own,

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.340
instead of sending police out

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.650
to sweep people away, for example,

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.213
they can take those funds,

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.880
that they're using to fund
the police to do that,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.530
put those funds into housing,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.070
it actually costs less to fund housing,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.120
than it costs to send police out,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.850
to engage the court system,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.380
to use a criminal justice
approach to homelessness,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.780
is more costly than to
actually solve the problem

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.797
by creating additional housing
opportunities for people.

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:19.014
(light haunting music)
