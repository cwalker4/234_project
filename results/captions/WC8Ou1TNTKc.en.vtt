00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:27.761 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.228 size:84% position:42%
JUST IN THE SENATE.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.696 size:75% position:38%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: IN YOUR OFFICE.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:38.171
OKAY, AS-- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE, BEFORE THE BREAK.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:42.409 align:end position:100%
THE BULK OF YOUR CAREER YOU HAVE
BEEN A COMEDIAN, A SATIRIST.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.877 align:start size:88% position:13%
ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE SENATE
FUN?

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.045
ARE THEY FUNNY PEOPLE?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.649
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE A
BORING THUNDERDOME.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.483 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:55.288
ACTUALLY, A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES
ARE FUNNY, AND THAT'S HOW I BOND

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.023 align:start size:88% position:13%
WITH THEM.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:01:00.560 align:start size:88% position:13%
FROM YOUR STATE, OKAY, I GET
SWORN IN.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.530 size:88% position:56%
I WAS SWORN IN A LITTLE LATE
BECAUSE MY ELECTION WAS VERY

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.730 align:start size:88% position:13%
CLOSE.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.938
IS AND JIM DEMINT, A VERY, VERY
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, A

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:19.446
COUPLE OF MINUTES AFTER I WAS
SWORN IN SAYSES, "HOW ARE THINGS

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.549 align:start size:88% position:13%
ON THE FAR LEFT?"
AND I SAID, "NINE, HOW ARE

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.354
THINGS FROM THE NUT CASE RIGHT?"
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS VERY FUNNY.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.891
REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS RUNNING 15
OUT OF 17 IN THE REPUBLICAN --

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.726
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK HE WAS 17
OUT OF 15.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:37.030
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; SO I WENT UP TO HIM IN THE

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.234
SENATE, AND I SAID TO HIM, "YOU
KNOW, LINDSEY, IF I WERE VOTING

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:44.270
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, I'D
VOTE FOR YOU."

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.408
AND WITHOUT HESITATION HE SAID,
"THAT'S MY PROBLEM."

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:52.612 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
LINDSAY IS VERY FUNNY.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.981 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT WE--
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.917 align:start size:88% position:13%
THERE ARE SOME SENATORS WHO
AREN'T VERY FUNNY.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:03.089
AND TOM COBURN FROM OKLAHOMA,
KNOWN AS "DR. NO" BECAUSE --

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.657
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE IS A PHYSICIAN.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:09.395
&gt;&gt; YES HE IS AN
OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST, AND

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.599
NO BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE ANY
FEDERAL SPENDING, SO HE WOULD

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.566
SAY NO TO EVERYTHING.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:18.872
HE WILL ADMIT THAT HE IS NOT A
VERY GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR
INTERACTIONS WE HAD, WE JUST

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.642 align:start size:88% position:13%
KIND OF MISSED.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:27.147 align:end position:100%
SO I WENT TO TOM AND I SAID,
"TOM, I CAN TAKE YOU TO LUNCH?"

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.850 size:88% position:56%
AND HE SAID, "TELL YOU WHAT.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.020
YOU CAN TAKE ME TO BREAKFAST."

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.787 align:start size:88% position:13%
I SAID OKAY.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:39.893 size:88% position:56%
SO WE MEET FOR BREAKFAST A
COUPLE OF DAYSULARITY IN THE

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.929
SENATE DINING ROOM, AND I SAID,
"TOM, LET'S JUST HAVE FUN."

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.964
AND HE SAID, "OKAY, FUN."

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.533
( LAUGHTER )
AND I SAID, "WE CAN TALK ABOUT

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
OUR FAMILIES.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.335 size:88% position:44%
TALK ABOUT POLITICS.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.005
TALK ABOUT THE CAREERS WE HAD
BEFORE THE SENATE.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.339 size:88% position:44%
BUT LET'S HAVE FUN."

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.641 size:75% position:38%
HE GOES, "OKAY."

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.744
I SAID, "OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU
THIS.

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:03.283
TO BE A DOCTOR IN OKLAHOMA, DO
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANY FORMAL

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:08.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
EDUCATION?"
( LAUGHTER )

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.424
AND HE-- AND HE SAID, "YES!

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO MEDICAL
SCHOOL!"

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.063 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:26.172
AND I SAID-- I SAID, "OKAY, TOM,
THAT WAS A JOKE."

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.075
( LAUGHTER )
"AND THAT'S WHAT I USED TO DO IN

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:29.909 align:start size:88% position:13%
MY CAREER."

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.247 align:end position:100%
AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE
BREAKFAST WE HAD A REALLY GREAT

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:34.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
TIME.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:37.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT JEEK
JOKES WERE.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.154
( LAUGHTER )
BUWHAT THE PROPER REACTION TO A

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:41.454 align:start size:88% position:13%
JOKE IS.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:46.492
AND I GOT A NOTE LATER FROM HIM
THAT DAY SAYING, "I HAD A LOT OF

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:46.693 align:start size:88% position:13%
FUN."

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.527
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S NICE.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:52.098
&gt;&gt; AND WHEN I WAS WRITING THE
BOOK-- "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.600 align:start size:88% position:13%
SENATE."

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.504
WHEN I WAS WRITING THAT, I
WANTED TO GET PERMISSION FROM MY

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:03.643 align:end position:100%
COLLEAGUES WHO I WROTE ANYTHING
THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:03.910 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEGATIVE.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.645 align:start size:88% position:13%
I CALLED HIM UP, HE'S IN
RETIREMENT.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.380 size:78% position:39%
HE'S IN OKLAHOMA.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.417
I SAID, "TOM--" "HI, AL."

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.953
I SAID, "DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
BREAKFAST WE HAD?"

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.755
AND HE SAID, "YEAH, YEAH."

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:19.492
AND I SAID, "I WANT TO USE THAT
IN THE BOOK AND I WANTED TO GET

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.059 size:78% position:39%
YOUR PERMISSION."

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.729
AND HE SAID, "WE HAVE THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU CAN WRITE ANYTHING YOU
WANT!"

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:29.535 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
SO HE HASN'T-- HE HASN'T

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:29.769 align:start size:88% position:13%
CHANGED.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.236 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.273
YOU COULD HAVE SAID, "WE ALSO
HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT AND I

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.674
KNOW YOU'VE GOT GUNS."

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:40.446
&gt;&gt; HE WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF
THE RIGHT FOR AMERICANS TO BEAR

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.147 align:start size:88% position:13%
ARMS.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE IS.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:47.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, YOU SAID, YOU
WROTE IN THE BOOK "AL FRANKEN,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.488
GIANT OF THE SENATE."

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:53.426
YOU SAY IN THE BOOK YOU'VE
LEARNED WEIRD, SOCIOPATHIC

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:53.860 size:78% position:39%
POLITICAL SKILLS.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.827 size:78% position:39%
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:58.164
WHAT IS THE WEIRDEST POLITICAL
SKILL YOU'VE HAD TO LEARN?

00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:59.432 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; PIVOTING.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.366
&gt;&gt; Stephen: PIVOTING.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.335 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; PIVOTING.

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.904 align:start size:88% position:13%
PIVOTING IS NOT ANSWERING A
QUESTION.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.172 size:81% position:41%
AND JUST PIVOTING.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:12.412
&gt;&gt; Stephen: PIVOTING IS A WAY
OF PIVOTING OFF, "I'M NOT

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.246
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION."

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:19.419
&gt;&gt; OR I'D BE ASKED, "YOU'RE 10
POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS TO NORM

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:19.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
COLEMAN.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:23.022
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONVINCE
DEMOCRATS TO NOMINATE?"

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:27.960
AND I'D GO LIKE, "YOU KNOW, WHEN
I GO AROUND MINNESOTA,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
MINNESOTANS DON'T CARE ABOUT
POLLING.

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.965
WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS HEALTH
CARE AND THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION."

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:33.766 size:75% position:38%
THAT'S PIVOTING.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.601 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND YOU WERE NOT
GOOD AT THAT?

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.236
&gt;&gt; I WAS NOT GOOD AT THAT.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:40.506
I WAS TAUGHT TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS, AND IT TOOK ME

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.741
FOREVER TO LEARN HOW TO PIVOT.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:42.875
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CAN YOU DO IT NOW?

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.110 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I'M OKAY AT IT.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.614
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU A
FEW QUESTIONS AND YOU PIVOT OFF

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:48.848 align:start size:88% position:13%
OF THEM.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:49.816 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:50.917
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TELL YOU WHAT.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:56.155
NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S "AL FRANKEN
GIANT OF THE SENATE," NO MATTER

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:59.092
WHAT I ASK YOU STAY ON MESSAGE
AND PROMOTE YOUR BOOK.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.562 size:88% position:56%
IF NORTH KOREA CONTINUES TO
ADVANCE ITS MISSILE PROGRAM,

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:05.431
SENATOR FRANKEN, SHOULD WE TAKE
MILITARY ACTION?

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:11.671
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IN MY BOOK,
STEPHEN, I WRITE A LOT ABOUT THE

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.408 align:start size:88% position:13%
IMPORTANCE OF LEVEL-HEADED
LEADERSHIP.

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:19.512
WHICH IS WHY I'M TERRIFIED OF
TRUMP.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:27.387 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SENATOR FRANKEN,

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:31.224
DO YOU PLAN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT
IN 2020?

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:40.266
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IN MY BOOK,

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.835
STEPHEN, "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF
THE SENATE,"

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:46.005
( LAUGHTER )
I TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:47.707
LEVEL-HEADED LEADERSHIP.

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:52.645
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU WIN.

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:53.045 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU WIN.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:57.750
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.751
&gt;&gt; Stephen: "AL FRANKEN, GIANT
OF THE SENATE," IS AVAILABLE
