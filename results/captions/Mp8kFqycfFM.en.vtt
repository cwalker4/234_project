00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.498 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND "AWE."
THIS IS NOT "MARRIED WITH

IF IT WELL PLEASES THE COURT --

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:22.215 align:start size:94% position:6%

HERE TODAY TO CORRECT THE RECORD
UNDER OATH.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.873 align:start size:94% position:6%
OF COURSE, THE FIRST TIME I

I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT

00:01:54.881 --> 00:02:02.355 align:start size:94% position:6%
MR. TRUMP IS A RACIST.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.556 align:start size:94% position:6%
WOW.
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GET A

REALLY MUCH BIGGER REACTION.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.363 align:start size:94% position:6%
BUT HE'S ALSO A CON MAN AND A
CHEAT.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:14.334
AND TO PROVE IT I'M PROVIDING
THE COMMITTEE TODAY WITH SEVERAL

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:19.506 align:start size:94% position:6%

CAREFULLY RESEARCHED QUESTIONS.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:50.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; CLEARLY THAT IS NOT WHAT
TODAY IS ABOUT.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:57.036 align:start size:94% position:6%
MR. COHEN, ANY FINAL WORDS?
&gt;&gt; YES, YOUR HONOR.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:02.275 align:start size:94% position:6%
LOOK, MAYBE I'M NOT A GOOD
PERSON.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:05.411 align:start size:94% position:6%
MAYBE I'M A LIAR.
MAYBE I'M A FOOL.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:08.848 align:start size:94% position:6%
MAYBE I RUINED HUNDREDS OF
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:11.817 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY.
IS THERE A BUT COMING?

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.753 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; NO, THERE ISN'T.
THANK YOU.

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:17.590 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!
