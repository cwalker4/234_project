FOX NEWS PRIME TIME HOSTS.

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:39.998
ALMOST HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.666
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE

YOUR PARTY?

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:44.997

00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:51.003
GILLIBRAND, KLOBUCHAR,

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:52.304
JUAN WILLIAMS ALL SORTS OF

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:54.740
PEOPLE ON OUR NETWORK, THE LIKES

00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:56.509
OF WHICH WOULD NOT BE

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.477
CONSERVATIVES ON PLACES LIKE CNN

00:01:58.478 --> 00:01:58.811
ANYMORE.

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:00.880
THEY BASICALLY GOT RID OF THEIR

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.482
PRO TRUMP, TRUMP FROM THE

00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:03.516
CONTRIBUTORS.

00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:04.717
WHAT’S GOING ON?

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:06.552
WHY ARE DEMOCRATS AFRAID OF

00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:07.720
FOX NEWS, AFRAID OF

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:08.388
MARTHA MacCALLUM AND

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.790
BRET BAIER, CHRIS WALLACE,

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:12.091
REALLY?

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:13.726
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I ANSWER YOUR

00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:15.528
QUESTION, I WANT TO SAY HELLO TO

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:16.062
MIKE HUCKABEE.

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:18.031
MIKE AND I SERVED AS GOVERNORS

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:19.732
TOGETHER AND COLLABORATED ON

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.434
MANY INITIATIVES WHEN WE SERVED

00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:22.302
IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS

00:02:22.303 --> 00:02:23.069
ASSOCIATION.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.370
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I DON’T

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:25.138
KNOW.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.473
I THINK IT’S A MISTAKE FOR THE

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:32.245
DNC TO DO WHAT IT DID.

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:34.647
BUT AS YOU SAID, IF I WAS DNC

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:35.615
CHAIR, I THINK TOM PEREZ IS

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:36.983
DOING A GOOD JOB.

00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:39.686

ANY WAY, ANY TIME ANY NUMBERS OF

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:47.227
AND YOU CAN HAVE THAT FOX DEBATE

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.731
ANY WAY, ANY TIME ANY NUMBERS OFTIMES.

00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:51.431
&gt;&gt; Laura:         I’M CONFIDENTI

&gt;&gt; Laura:         I’M CONFIDENT.

00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:54.635
YOU CAN PICK THE COMMENTATORS

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:55.502
AND MODERATORS, I THINK WE

00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:56.770
SHOULD HAVE THE DEBATE ON FOX.

00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:59.139
LET ME TELL YOU.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.408
EVEN IF YOU PERSUADE 3% OF FOX

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.311
VIEWERS, 3% LAST TIME OUT

00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:04.945
CARRIES MICHIGAN.

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:05.746
&gt;&gt; Laura: FAT CHANCE -- I’M

00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:06.814
JUST KIDDING.

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:08.182
YOU ARE MAKING A VERY VALID

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:08.482
POINT.

00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:10.351
GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, I WANT TO

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:11.619
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE FROM PEREZ,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.254
BECAUSE HE DOUBLED DOWN ON THIS.

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:15.889
THE BARRING OF ANY FOX NEWS

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.857
HOSTING OF A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE.

00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:19.460
LET’S WATCH.

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:22.129
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT -- IN THIS

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.331
NEW YORKER REPORT, IT’S ABOUT

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:25.499
INTERFERENCE AT THE HIGHEST

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.000
LEVEL OF FOX NEWS.

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.437
&gt;&gt; WE READ IT.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:31.739
WE WANT TO HAVE 100%

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.440
CONFIDENCE -- THE DEBATES ARE

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.242
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,

00:03:35.243 --> 00:03:36.110
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:36.477
WE CAN DO.

00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:39.280
&gt;&gt; I GET IT.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.681
I GET YOU WHAT INSURANCE.

00:03:40.682 --> 00:03:41.749
&gt;&gt; Laura: SO NO ISSUES -- I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.118
WANT TO PLAY ONE MORE THING FOR

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.420
YOU.

00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:46.821
WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT FOX

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:47.955
DOESN’T CARE ABOUT ISSUES, THE

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.924
ANCHORS ARE NOT GOING TO CARE

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.093
ABOUT ISSUES.

00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:53.528
&gt;&gt; WILL YOU PROMISE -- AND HOW

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.697
SOON WILL YOU MOVE YOUR CLOTHING

00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:56.731
COLLECTION, THE CLOTHES THAT ARE
SOON WILL YOU MOVE YOUR CLOTHING

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.865
COLLECTION, THE CLOTHES THAT ARE

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.867
MADE IN CHINA AND MEXICO?

00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:01.236
YOU SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THAT

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:03.571
DEBATE THAT WERE NOT TRUE, SIR.

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:06.174
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:06.741
ANY RESTRICTIONS?

00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:08.710
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU DEFINITIVELY SAY

00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:10.145
TONIGHT THAT YOU WILL DEFINITELY

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.080
SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:14.282
FOR PRESIDENT, EVEN IF IT’S NOT

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:15.250
YOU?

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:16.418
&gt;&gt; Laura: THOSE ARE ALL

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.553
EXAMPLES OF FOX NEWS ANCHORS

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:20.789
BEING MORE THAN TOUGH, PROBABLY

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.093
FAIR, WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.629
CANDIDATE TRUMP.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.931
&gt;&gt; LAURA, FIRST OF ALL LET ME

00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:30.565
SAY HELLO TO ED RENDELL.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:32.167
I WISH HE AND I WERE RUNNING

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:33.635
THINGS BECAUSE HE AND I GOT

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:34.336
ALONG GREAT AND GOT A LOT OF

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:35.137
THINGS DONE.

00:04:35.138 --> 00:04:37.172
BY GOLLY, WE SHOULD BE IN

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.140
CHARGE.

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:39.775
ED, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:40.776
I’VE BEEN IN THE PRESIDENT OF

00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:42.177
THE BAIT STAGE TO GO DIFFERENT

00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:44.813
TIMES -- ACTUALLY, MANY

00:04:44.814 --> 00:04:45.280
DIFFERENT TIMES.

00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:47.016
BUT ONE THING PEOPLE FORGET,

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:50.919
IT’S NOT THE VENUE FOR THE

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.755
NETWORKS, IT’S THE VENUE FOR THE

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:53.422
TWO PARTIES.

00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:55.190
I’M GOING TO BE LIKE THE

00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:56.659
CONTRARY IN HERE AND I THINK TOM

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.662
PEREZ IS MAKING A MISTAKE.

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:00.362
I DO AGREE WITH ED RENDELL,

00:05:00.363 --> 00:05:03.499
THERE OUGHT TO BE FOX ACCESS TO

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, BUT

00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:07.403
HERE’S WHAT I WOULD SAY TO BOTH

00:05:07.404 --> 00:05:08.170
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRAT AND

00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.173
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEES, RONNA

00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:13.709
McDANIEL AND TOM PEREZ, TAKE

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.778
CHARGE OF DEBATES.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.747
THESE ARE FOR YOUR CANDIDATES.

00:05:17.748 --> 00:05:20.116
I THINK THE WHOLE PROCESS IS

00:05:20.117 --> 00:05:21.083
RIDICULOUS AND OUT-OF-CONTROL

00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:23.152
AND IT IS IN NEED OF A GREAT

00:05:23.153 --> 00:05:23.753
BLOW UP.

00:05:23.754 --> 00:05:24.954
THERE SHOULD BE A COMPLETE

00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:26.689
RESTRUCTURING OF HOW THEY ARE

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.156
DONE.

00:05:27.157 --> 00:05:28.858
THE PARTIES NEED TO CONTROL THE

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:30.626
DEBATES IN TERMS OF TIME, THE

00:05:30.627 --> 00:05:30.927
PLACE.

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:32.695
THEY OUGHT TO PICK THE PEOPLE

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.098
WHO ASK THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.333
HAS TURNED INTO A TV SHOW, NOT

00:05:37.334 --> 00:05:40.036
AN HONEST FORUM.

00:05:40.037 --> 00:05:41.271
THE QUESTIONS ARE RIDICULOUS AND

00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:41.704
INSULTING.

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:43.773
I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE

00:05:43.774 --> 00:05:45.175
THE POLITICAL CHAIRMAN AND

00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:46.943
EARFUL OF WHAT THEY CAN DO

00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:49.879
OF WHAT THEY CAN DO TO GIVE THE

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.081
MESSAGE TO THEIR VOTERS.

00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:52.616
WE WENT I THINK THAT’S A

00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:53.083
BRILLIANT POINT.

00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:57.053
LOCAL REPORTERS ARE OFTEN BETTER

00:05:57.054 --> 00:05:58.355
AT DOING SOME OF THESE

00:05:58.356 --> 00:05:59.890
INTERVIEWS ON SOME OF THE BIG

00:05:59.891 --> 00:06:00.891
ISSUES, NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.058
AWAY FROM THE BIG NAMES, BUT I

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:04.928
LIKE SOME OF THE LOCAL

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:05.662
REPORTERS’ INPUT.

00:06:05.663 --> 00:06:08.799
GOVERNORS, I WANT TO GET YOUR

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.033
REACTION, THE HOUSE VOTED

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:10.834
OVERWHELMINGLY TO APPROVE A

00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:12.903
BROAD RESOLUTION CALLING UP

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:14.338
RACISM, ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.840
WITHOUT NAMING CONGRESSWOMAN

00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:17.241
ILHAN OMAR.

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:19.810
THE DEMOCRATS SEEM TO BE, I

00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:21.612
DON’T KNOW, THEY DON’T WANT TO

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.147
NAME HER DESPITE THE FACT THAT

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:24.882
THAT’S WHAT BROUGHT THIS WHOLE

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:27.851
THING UP, OBVIOUSLY, INITIALLY

00:06:27.852 --> 00:06:29.820
LINKING JEWS TO MONEY, THEN

00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:30.921
TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:31.689
HAVING A DIVIDED ALLEGIANCE TO

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.659
OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.662
SHOULD HAVE IT BEEN RESTRICTED

00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:39.230
TO THE ANTI-SEMITISM?

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.865
A LOT OF JEWISH AMERICANS, AT

00:06:45.237 --> 00:06:47.438

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.205
FOCUSED ON THE ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:50.508
IT SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:51.709
CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR MADE A

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.043
MISTAKE.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.911
BECAUSE SHE DID MAKE A MISTAKE.

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.313

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:10.161
VERY

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:11.262
CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR MADE GOOD

THERE IS NO PLACE FOR

NAME-CALLING FOR ANY OF OUR

THING FOR CONGRESS FROM AN OMAR

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:08.987
ESPECIALLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.925
OVER WITH THE LEGAL PARTY

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:14.927

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.262
ANTI-SEMITIC FLOATS AND CARNIVAL

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:19.098
PARADES IN BELGIUM I SAW TODAY

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:20.833
ALSO ONLINE FOR DISTURBING

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:24.236

EUROPE.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.807
&gt;&gt; I JUST GOT BACK FROM POLAND

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:29.108
THIS MORNING AND ONE OF THE

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:30.443
THINGS I WAS DOING THERE WAS TO

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:34.280
PARTICIPATE IN A CEREMONY FOR

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.915
THE POLISH CHRISTIANS WHO HELPED

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.683
SAVED JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST.
THE POLISH CHRISTIANS WHO HELPED

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.817
SAVED JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.651
I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:39.385
UNDERSTAND THE ANTI-SEMITISM IS

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.721
NOT JUST ABOUT RHETORIC.

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.723
THERE WAS A LONG HISTORY OF

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:44.991
PEOPLE BEING BRUTALLY AND

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:47.093
SAVAGELY MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD.

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:49.462
WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:50.463
MILITARY COMBATANTS, WE ARE

00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:51.865
TALKING ABOUT INNOCENT MEN,

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.333
WOMEN, CHILDREN, OLDER PEOPLE.

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:54.834
IT’S A HORRIBLE THING.

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.270
IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.238
I THINK NANCY PELOSI -- AND I

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:00.306
HAVE TO GIVE HER SOME CREDIT.

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:01.174
SHE’S TRYING, BUT SHE’S GOT HER

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:02.008
HANDS FULL WITH SOME OF THESE

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:05.945
YOUNG DEMOCRATS WHO REALLY DON’T

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:07.614
UNDERSTAND WHAT I CALL "BASIC

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.049
PLAYGROUND MANNERS" WHEN IT

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.817
COMES TO GETTING IN A PUBLIC

00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:12.886
OFFICE AND IT’S CREATING SOME

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:14.287
REAL PROBLEMS FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:15.856
AS A REPUBLICAN, I COULD TAKE

00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:17.724
SOME GLORY IN IT AND SOME JOY IN

00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:19.359
THAT, BUT I DON’T BECAUSE IT’S

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.660
BAD FOR THE COUNTRY.

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.496
THAT’S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY.

00:09:22.497 --> 00:09:23.196
&gt;&gt; Laura: GOVERNOR,

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:26.466
