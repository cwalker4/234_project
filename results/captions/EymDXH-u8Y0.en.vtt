00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.850
Just a note on how things are gonna
be played out tonight

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.969
Ben will be doing a speech which
will

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.779
be followed by Q

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.859
and A. The Q

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.869
and A is available for

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.739
everyone in the house.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.629
But priority will be given to the
orchestra

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.810
the parterre then the following
balconies.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.370
With that being said.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.419
If you are someone who disagrees

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.210
with Ben or wants to challenge him

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.520
we will allow you to jump the line.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200
That's how benevolent we are.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.580
So.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.519
I personally guarantee if you have a
gripe

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.430
with him you're going to get your
chance.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.539
Finally I just want to say a few

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180
words about our organization

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.769
and what we went through to make

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.749
this happen. The UBC free speech
Club

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.269
is a nonpartisan organization

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.219
and committed to cultivating an open
dialogue

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.199
on campus where arguments

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.909
are made with reason rather than
rhetoric

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.989
and personal attack.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.350
We cherish a diversity of opinions

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.969
and seek to promote an open debate

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.039
stage where political correctness no
longer

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.020
holds sway.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.550
This mantra however

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.139
is not loved by all.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.840
There are a few groups

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.120
at our school who

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.419
don't understand it.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.399
They don't understand why there
needs to be

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.500
a free speech club.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.089
They think "Well nobody wants to go
see

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.400
a conservative speaker"

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.719
And to that I say

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.400
this.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.040
The second we announced this event.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.300
We had.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.250
Radicals trying to shut it down.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.660
We had.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.589
Our Posters vandalized,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.389
smeared with anti-Semitic remarks

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.309
and we had the AMS which

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.559
is our own student union a union

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.209
which prides itself on unity

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.279
and goodwill. Officially come out

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.472
against this event.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.902
It's a good thing we aren't part of
the Union.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.129
So to those who say there is no need

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.989
for a free speech club look at the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.330
past five months.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.649
And to those who say that nobody
cares about

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.479
free speech on campus look

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.510
around. It's a full house.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.100
And. On that note.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.699
And on that note it is my great

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.850
honor to introduce Ben Shapiro!

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.010
Thank you so much.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.885
love you too.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.270
It's wonderful to be here.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.299
Really excited to be here.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.060
Thanks for spending your Halloween

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.989
with me here. I thought of dressing

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.690
up tonight as.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.370
Elizabeth Warren

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.360
but then.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.149
I realized that I didn't want it
culturally

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.289
appropriate her heritage.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.450
I'm just not white enough.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.579
And then I thought maybe I'd dress
up as a Canadian.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.830
I'm not nice enough for that.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.800
Thank you. That's nice of you.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.629
I want to begin by thanking the UBC
free speech

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.549
club and the university for what
it's worth for

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.770
making tonight possible.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.939
I also want to thank security for
ensuring that everyone

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.450
can hear different opinions in a
safe environment.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.420
No thanks however to some folks on
the left

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.469
who insist that the university
should have canceled

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.509
the speech in particular.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.443
No thanks to the UBC AMS.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.060
For apparently very concerned

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.169
that my talk will quote Stoke
intolerance

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.239
and discrimination based on race
gender

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.360
identity and sexual orientation.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.829
They say that they fear that some

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.929
students at UBC will feel threatened

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.900
and targeted by my message.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.189
And then they follow that up by
saying that

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.479
they denounce all forms of violence

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.309
and marginalization on campus

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.229
presumably not including
marginalization

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.999
of a mainstream conservative
worldview.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.850
They're okay with that sort of
marginalization.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.989
I have never.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.819
It should be noted never called

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.719
for incivility.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.360
I have never called for violence

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.739
but that doesn't stop anybody from
accusing conservatives

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.050
of doing exactly that.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.159
Stating facts stating conservative

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.770
opinions that is not threatening.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.450
And if you believe that it is
threatening.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.770
I have two words for you.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.060
Grow up.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.189
This is still a somewhat free
society

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.229
in which we all get to exchange
viewpoints

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.080
without running to the fainting
couches.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.669
Now I agree with the AMS that folks

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.619
who wish to peacefully protest
should do so be

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.029
even better if they would come
inside

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.929
and ask questions.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.789
As you heard right beforehand we

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.569
have a long Q

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.600
and A session. It's my favorite part
of the evening

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.529
and I always urge folks who disagree
to go right

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.389
to the front of the lines we can
actually have some

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.450
civil nice conversation discussion

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.800
about issues that matter

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.800
but instead the AMS is preemptively

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.819
referring people to places like

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.750
the sexual assault support center.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.269
There are a lot of black marks

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.550
on my resumÃ© probably.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.490
But I do have a fairly

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.959
clean record when it comes to
sexually assaulting

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.580
people.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.479
When i say fairly clean.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.339
I mean like spotless record when

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.250
it comes to sexually assaulting
people.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.419
So I don't think anyone's gonna need
to go to the Sexual

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.880
Assault Support Center tonight.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.989
They say that people should go to
speak easy

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.309
which I guess is for peer support

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.070
and guidance in a safe space.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.179
I've nonjudgment I admit that this

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.030
is not going to be a safe space in
the sense

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.869
that they mean it since they mean
safe

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.300
from having your feelings hurt.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.169
And I believe that safety

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.209
exists in a free country when you
are allowed to express

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.800
your opinion.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.410
There are also directing folks to
safe walk

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.309
which is a transportation service
accompanying

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.160
students walking after dark.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.779
So I don't know they think I'm doing
after

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.250
this.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.079
This might be an overreaction

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.600
but.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.710
No thanks also to Dr.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.669
Charles Menzies who's an
anthropology

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.499
professor and Board of Governors
representative who

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.590
said it was a bad choice to bring me
to campus

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.489
and mentioned the university's
policy three in

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.539
objecting to my potential speech
policy

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.192
three apparently implements the B.C.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.339
Human Rights Code which is as

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.199
foolish and overbroad a piece of
legislation

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.119
as it has been promulgated in a
purportedly

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.070
free society.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.739
For folks who don't know these human
rights

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.659
code states a person must not
publish issue

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.609
or display or cause to be published
issued

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.619
or displayed any statement
publication

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.759
notice signs symbol emblem

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.649
or other representation that
indicates

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.569
discrimination or an intention to
discriminate

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.649
against a person

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.080
or a group or class of persons

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.279
or is likely to expose a person

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.139
or a group or class of persons to
hatred

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.149
or contempt because of race color
ancestry place

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.009
of origin religion marital status
family status physical

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.860
or mental disability sex sexual
orientation

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.949
gender identity or expression

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.740
or age of the person

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.709
or that group

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.990
or class of persons.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.249
No one is in favor of hateful

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.559
speech but this policy simply
defines

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.959
as hateful anything which is quote
unquote likely

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.159
to expose people to hatred

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.739
and contempt which is utterly
subjective.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.569
Now they say that what they

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.729
really mean is anything that would
be a reasonable

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.709
person would assess as likely to
expose

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.759
people to hatred

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.560
or contempt.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.609
Unfortunately the people who are
going to interpret

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.559
that law are all members of the
political

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.479
left who will determine that it is
reasonably

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.669
likely that any sort of conservative
speech

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.769
may in fact be likely to provoke bad

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.449
action on the part of people who
agree

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.490
with the conservative.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.250
This is why in the United States

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.239
which I'm an American so I get to
say what I believe

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.090
is a superior country to your own.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.839
Making friends

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.420
and influencing people everywhere I
go.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.179
In the United States we don't have
such

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.099
laws because such laws are violative
of

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.340
basic precepts of the first
amendment

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.330
free speech precepts.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.339
We understand there's such thing as
hateful speech

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.119
in the United States

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.159
but we also understand that the
definition of something

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.989
like hate speech is endlessly
malleable

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.819
and can be used by people in power
to

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.379
simply quash people

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.570
with whom they disagree.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.279
In fact the UBC policy goes further

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.439
than the B.C. Human Rights Code it
actually bans activities

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.269
harmful to a respectful environment
which

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.460
is an amazing statement.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.959
These range from expressions of
disrespect

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.739
such as rudeness

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.112
and gossip.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.371
Have they ever been on a college
campus?

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.599
To bullying

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.570
or harassment then they define
harassment

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.479
as intentional

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.579
or unintentional which includes

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.469
ostracism or exclusion of a person

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.770
that undermines an individual's
self-esteem.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.080
It must never undermine anyone's
self-esteem

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.160
deeply imperative.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.530
Again this is

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.880
rather overbroad.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.019
Speech codes do not end well for
freedom

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.459
of speech as a general rule

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.469
and a free people are going to have
to grow a thicker

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.060
skin.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.220
This doesn't mean you should be
uncivil.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.240
It doesn't mean that you shouldn't
be a virtuous person.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.369
But when you start setting standards
like no

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.669
one must be offended no one's
self-esteem

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.780
must be damaged.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.259
You are in for a hell of a ride.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.198
So Tonight,

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:17.190
here is my plan.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.539
I'm gonna say a bunch of things that
I think

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.439
are simply facts

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.119
and then i'm gonna state some
conservative opinions

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.280
and we'll see if I get arrested.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.239
So here we go.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.678
You're ready?

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.470
This is a fact.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.459
There are two count them two

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.430
sexes two of them

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.520
not three.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.119
Not three not nine

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.409
not infinite not attack helicopter

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.020
two.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.170
I know horrifying.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.520
Women are women.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.519
Men are men.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.379
Men cannot become women because we

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.209
don't live in a magical land in

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.469
which men can become women

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.420
or vice versa.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.739
Men who believe they are women are
not biological

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.599
women. Transgender women are not

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.159
women. They are biological men

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.440
with a mental disorder.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.180
There are two sexes.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.049
People with a Y chromosome are
almost

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.359
universally male people without a Y
chromosome

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.559
are almost universally female.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.509
The only reason I say almost is
because there

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.480
do exist tiny

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.469
variations in the population

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.809
with gender disorders sexual
developmental

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.789
disorders. These folks are intersex.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.719
They may have primary

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.729
or secondary sexual characteristics

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.240
that do not match the presence of a
Y chromosome.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.340
These are called genetic
abnormalities

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.269
and this does not mean that there is
a third

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.420
phantom sex that exists somewhere
out there.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.439
Why. Because the promulgation

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.599
of our entire species is based on
sexual

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.429
dymorphism The fact

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.340
that folks are willing to completely

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.099
subsume biology under the rubric

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.989
of political correctness is complete

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.069
idiocy and anti.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.080
Objective truth.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.729
And indeed it turns out the
transgender

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.679
advocates claim that no evidence
must

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.779
actually be shown of intersex
genetics.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.819
That's just a red herring when they
say that folks

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.709
are transgender. They don't mean the
person's intersex they

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.809
mean that a person who is fully
biologically male

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.819
believes that he is female is
actually

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.739
a female in order to

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.929
achieve this particularly
nonsensical

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.489
combination both in terms of biology

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.230
and logic.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.519
Transgender civil rights advocates
create a new

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.640
category from sex in this thing
called gender

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.010
gender. In this view about maleness

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.299
or femaleness that's an entirely
subjective

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.189
category not linked to biology it's
a social

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.079
construct it's not linked in any

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.000
way to biology.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.449
So a couple of problems

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.549
with this right off the bat just in
terms of internal

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.000
logic. First off stereotyping

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.079
OK so if you believe that there

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.009
is a gendered female

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.469
and a gendered male you're assuming
there are stereotypes

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.519
that describe femininity

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.229
and masculinity feminists would
argue

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.820
with that.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.559
Second this actually presumes

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.950
that there are only two genders
maleness

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.030
and femaleness.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.019
And then there are mixes of those
various

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.090
characteristics.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.739
So if you believe that there are
actually

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.789
a bunch of different genders

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.649
or the gender exist on a spectrum
then you have

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.329
to explain why there are eighty nine
genders

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.339
and not seven point one billion
genders

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.190
because it turns out that every
human being

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.089
on planet Earth all of them have a
different

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.559
combination of feminine

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.059
and masculine characteristics.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.739
So if gender is just more feminine

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.569
or masculine characteristic then you
as an

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.879
individual have your own individual
gender

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.300
which means that the term gender has
no meaning.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.670
It's just called being a human

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.309
most obviously separating maleness

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.709
or femaleness from genetic influence
is scientifically

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.420
illiterate.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.889
To say that a biological male is a
gendered female

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.740
is a basic contradiction in terms

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.939
a biological male may have feminine

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.769
characteristics.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.309
He is still a biological male.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.189
We all know many men who are
feminine.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.119
We all know many many women are

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.980
masculine.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.609
Does not mean that the woman is a
man

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.869
or that the man is a woman.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.679
That's just silly talk.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.069
Is Transgenderism

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.169
a condition from birth that is
genetically encoded

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.055
and unchangeable?

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.989
Well the argument would be

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.750
yes people are born like this.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.799
They've lived like this all their
lives for a certain subset

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800
of the population. I'm sure that
this condition

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.210
is in fact genetic

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.140
and unchanging.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.129
But let's remember that

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.019
80 percent of all children who

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.879
supposedly have gender confusion

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.769
grow out of it by the time they hit
teenage

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.644
years Is

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:25.799
transgenderism a mental disorder?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.839
Of course it is and it was defined
as a mental disorder

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.999
by the DSM until about four years
ago

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.069
when politically correct doctors
decided to switch

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.160
the definition of mental disorder
itself.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.179
So originally a mental disorder was

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.099
just anything that was obviously

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.239
at odds with reality.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.889
And then they switched it to be
anything at odds

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.109
with reality that also causes
depression.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.939
So in other words if you are a
schizophrenic

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.940
but it doesn't cause you some sort
of

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.929
difficulty in your everyday life you
are not

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:49.820
mentally ill.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.529
It's difficulty in your everyday
life that is

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.729
that we link to mental illness.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.959
Otherwise you can believe that your
head is a toaster

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.950
and if you're living a happy fine
life

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.589
then everything is hunky dory

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.980
and you don't have mental disorder.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.799
Transgenderism gender identity

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.149
disorder gender dysphoria.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.009
This is a form of body dysmorphia
just like

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.490
anorexia or body identity integrity
disorder

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.449
when you're anorexic you are

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.279
not fat you believe you are fat.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.049
This does not mean you're a fat
person.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.630
This means you are an anorexic

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.949
your body identity integrity
disorder you have

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.079
two arms you believe that you're a
one armed person

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.510
in the body of a two armed person.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.979
This does not mean you are actually
a one armed person

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.569
in the body of a two armed person.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.510
It means that you have a mental
disorder.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.589
Now the reason that I stress all of
this is not

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.540
to be mean.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.009
It is not is to be straight in our
diagnosis.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.019
We would never treat any other

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.129
disorder this way.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.349
My grandfather suffered from
schizophrenia

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.969
and bi polarity he was treated

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.830
with lithium.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.849
If society simply decided you know
what

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.769
Nate the radio is talking to you the

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.389
curtains are trying to strangle you.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.030
He would have been worse off.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.409
Not only that when an entire society

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.269
decides it is going to redefine

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.399
basic terminology about biological

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.409
sex in order to make room

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.239
for the sensitivity of a people

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.099
of certain numbers of people

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.020
who are suffering.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.759
You are doing great damage to the
fundamental

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.919
distinctions that lay at the root of
society

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.899
plus you're confusing kids who

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.579
don't actually get to teach my four

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.430
and a half year old daughter that
she can be a boy.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.540
OK.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.169
Let's move on to some other facts
that will probably

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.310
get me arrested Ok.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.739
Fact number two radical

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.430
Islamic theology is not a fringe
proposition.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.509
A large number of Muslims across

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.369
the world believe what we in the
West would consider to be

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.220
radical propositions about
government

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.990
morality and individual rights.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.780
This is not a rip on Islam as a
religion.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.799
I am not purporting to be an expert
on Islam

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.610
as a religion.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.009
I would not purport to be an expert
on Christianity

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.869
is religion. I have no interest in
browsing

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.679
Islamic texts

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.489
or Christian texts

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.799
or any other religious texts for
evidence

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.960
of violence intent.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.459
I am much more focused on how people
think

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.650
and how people act.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.219
So let's begin

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.740
with a couple of definitional facts.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.069
If Christians in the United States

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.409
or Canada wanted to be governed by
Christian

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.719
theological law we would call them
theocrats

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.610
and radicals.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.370
If Muslims want to be governed by
Sharia law

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.539
this would make them fundamentalists

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.430
and radicals.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.689
Here are the percentages of Muslims

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.849
who want their country to be
officially governed by Sharia

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.679
law across the world according to
Pew

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.707
Global Research Russia.

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:22.019
42 percent.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.489
Indonesia 72 percent.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.410
Afghanistan. 99 percent.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.269
Pakistan 84 percent Bangladesh

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.360
82 percent. Iraq 91 percent.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.289
Palestinian territories 89 percent.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.359
Egypt 74 percent Jordan 71 percent.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.589
Niger 86 percent.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.260
Nigeria 71 percent.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.149
Those are all groups of people who
believe

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.009
that Islamic law should govern their

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.660
country.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.949
How do I know that's radical because
again if you

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.479
applied the same rule to Christians

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.609
or Jews you would believe that it
was radical

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.340
for a Christian or a Jew to believe
that.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.680
Let's take an even better indicator.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.789
Let's take a let's take an indicator
that I think we can all

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.679
agree is even more radical than just
governance

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.510
of Sharia law.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.520
How about support for ISIS.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.130
If you support ISIS. I think we can
all fairly agree.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.019
You're probably radical here

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.009
are the percentage of folks in
various territories

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.868
and countries who say they don't
know

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.249
whether they're favorable toward
ISIS

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.389
or favorable toward ISIS.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.509
By the way if you say you don't know
whether your favorable toward ISIS

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.172
your favorable toward ISIS.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.578
The Palestinian territories 16
percent

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.858
Indonesia 22 percent Turkey 27

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.719
percent Nigeria 34 percent Malaysia

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.969
36 percent and Pakistan a whopping

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.099
71 percent of people say

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.269
that they either like ISIS

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.439
or they don't know about

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.329
or they don't know which again means

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.160
you like ISIS.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.920
How about support for suicide
bombings.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.999
The vast majority of Muslims across
the world

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.019
condemn suicide bombings

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.269
but not in particular areas like the
Palestinian

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.070
territories.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.999
According to a 2011 Pew poll only

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.889
19 percent of Palestinians said

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.710
such bombings were never justified.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.789
Egypt only 38 percent said

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.139
such bombings were never justified.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.969
Now distinctions must be

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.369
drawn. Western Muslims are
significantly

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.439
more moderate than their core
religionists in other parts

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.180
of the world.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.779
That is just a fact.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.539
By every available poll still

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.549
a 2006 poll in Britain found that 40

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.529
percent of British Muslims wanted
Sharia law

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.540
in the United Kingdom.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.379
A 2011 poll from Pew found

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.239
that 19 percent of American Muslims
said

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.739
they were either favorable toward
al-Qaeda

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.750
or they didn't know.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.849
Again none of this is meant to
suggest

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.349
that every Muslim is violent.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.389
I've said specifically many times in
the past

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.159
three minutes that that is not the
case.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.169
None of this is to suggest that any
Muslim

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.269
that you know is a member of a
radical group

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.409
that of course is untrue.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.299
None of this is to suggest that
Islam is a religion

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.169
is inherently violent.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.299
Because I think you can look at a
lot of religious texts

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.459
and see violence there if you wish
to see violence there.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.319
What this is to say is that to

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.209
suggest that radical Islam is

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.129
just a fringe thing affecting only

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.169
a very small number of people is not

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.829
true.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.070
It is not true and it is anti
factual

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.550
more facts that could get me
arrested.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.419
Women are not widely discriminated

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.910
against in Western societies.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.259
Women in the United States are not
paid

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.119
77 cents for every dollar

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.220
a man makes.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.089
That's just a bunch of bullshit.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.160
It's not true.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.449
Christina Hoff Sommers the factual

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.309
feminist writes The bottom

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.289
line is that the 23 cent gender pay
gap

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.269
is simply the difference between the
average earnings

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.129
of all men and women working full

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.469
time. It does not account for
differences in occupations

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.119
positions education job tenure

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.670
or hours work per week.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.899
When you actually consider all of
the relevant factors

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.290
the wage gap narrows to the point of
managing actually

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.589
when you look at it.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.699
Young childless women

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.769
with the same amount of education in
the same

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.659
professions in America's major
cities earn

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.540
significantly more than men

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.719
according to a new analysis of two

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.779
thousand communities by a market
research company

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.969
in one hundred and forty seven out
of 150

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.670
of the biggest cities in the United
States.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.719
The median full time salaries of
young women

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.549
are 8 percent higher than those of
the

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.930
guys in their peer group.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.269
Now there are a few things that are
kind of hilarious about discussions

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.250
of the gender gap.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.049
Some as some of the facts are really

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.939
inconvenient for feminists who
suggest that

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.409
all of this is due to
discrimination.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.509
So here are a couple of really
really inconvenient

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.349
facts. First of all societies that

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.319
work to end the gender gap have
actually created

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.570
a larger gender gap.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.399
So particularly this

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.760
is true in the fields in STEM
fields.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.079
So societies that are freer for
women

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.969
actually have fewer women by
percentage

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.829
in the STEM fields than societies
that are

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.699
less free for women

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.979
and less prosperous for women
largely

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.959
because when women are free a lot of
them don't

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.300
want to be in the STEM fields.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.979
Women and men have different
preferences as to which

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.980
types of jobs they like to go into.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.159
Women tend to like jobs.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.079
A lot of other human contact men
like to play

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.780
with things right.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.649
Men are just over there like my two

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.629
and a half year old son they like to
bang on electronic

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.090
toys and shout at people.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.489
In the United States.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.499
Twenty seven percent of students who
took the AP

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.329
Computer Science exam were female

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.400
in Algeria.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.269
Not exactly known for its pro

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.280
female policies.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.119
Forty one percent of college grads
in

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.610
STEM were female.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.929
Across all countries boys had
relative

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:01.889
strengths in science

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:02.249
and math.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.280
Girls have relative strengths in
reading.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.899
Gender equality means that sometimes

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.720
women make choices feminists don't
like.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.009
And that undergird the basic reality
that men

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.959
and women are different at some
fundamental

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.999
levels Harvard psychology

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.009
professor Steven Pinker explains
differences between

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.890
the sexes are part of the human
condition.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.990
This is also true

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.979
with regard to how women

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.759
and men perform

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.869
with regard to math

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:25.730
and science.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.869
What the studies tend to show is
that men

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.380
and women on average perform nearly
identically

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.349
in math and science.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.209
But the bell curves are not equally

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:33.830
shaped.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.089
The bell curves for men tends to be
a

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.289
lot thinner in the middle

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.235
and a lot fatter at the end.

00:21:38.236 --> 00:21:40.259
What that means that means is that
men are really bad

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.900
science or really good at science.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.979
Women tend to be on average just as

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.059
good at science as men.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.279
When you get out to the tail end
those are skinnier.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.349
That means that if you actually look
at like the ninety nine

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.909
percentile performance in math

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.770
and science

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.699
or if you look at the one percent
performance in math

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.700
and science a lot more men than
women

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.260
in that particular cohort

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.719
a couple of other facts.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.429
Talk of a campus rape epidemic.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.569
This is pure fantasy.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.729
This idea that women are everyday
walking on campus

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.649
and are in danger. One in four women
will be raped

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.900
while they're on a college campus.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.079
It's just not true.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.939
And by the way women if you actually
believe that were true

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.300
What the hell are you doing here?

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.589
Honest to God if I believe that my
sisters

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.539
in college were gonna be raped I
would've gotten them the hell

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.780
out of there as fast as humanly
possible.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.089
Professor James Alan Fox of
Northeastern University

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.219
and Richard Miranda Mount Holyoke
College points out

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.229
the estimated 19 percent sexual
assault

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.119
rate among college women is based on

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.369
a survey a large four year
universities

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.109
which doesn't reflect colleges
overall.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.329
Also the survey had a large
non-response

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.339
rate with the clear possibility that
people who are more

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.970
victimized were more apt to actually
respond.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.109
Also a lot of these studies tend

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.969
to include things that are not
actually rape in

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.479
the statistics they'll say sexual
assault

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.419
or what they actually say in the
survey data

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.219
are things like did a man try to
kiss you

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.230
and you turned away.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:55.870
Where.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.509
Frankly I'm shocked that the numbers
is 100 percent

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.130
for women.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.260
Other inconvenient facts.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.160
When men

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.449
or anyone else talks about

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.840
the right to life for unborn
children

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.709
it's not because they're sexist it's
because they

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.860
care about babies.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.129
Biological fact is that human life
begins

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.620
at conception.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.600
End of story. When human life
begins.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.399
They can make a lot of excuses to
why you

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.469
think that human life should be
snuffed out a particular times

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.339
in the pregnancy.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.169
But you cannot overcome that basic
fact

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.029
that a new human life is created at

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.069
the point of fertilization that is
just a basic

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.199
biological truth available in any
biology

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.870
textbook for the last hundred years.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.310
Everybody knows this

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.509
and yet we all ignore it in favor of

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.789
ridiculous moral stupidities

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.739
like the notion that you get to
choose

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.599
subjectively whether you think that
a child

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.700
is a child or not.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.349
Which is the same sort of logic by
the way that was used

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.449
with slaves you get to choose that

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.049
or black person is a person

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.170
or not for purposes of holding them
as property

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.799
or what Nazis used to say about
Jews.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.999
You get to decide whether there's a
human

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.820
or a cockroach for purposes of
killing them.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.929
You don't get to do that with other
human beings.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.819
You don't get to do that human life
at least face up

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.349
to what it is that you're talking
about

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.770
and stop using euphemisms when you
talk about abortion.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.639
More facts. Capitalism does not harm

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.350
the poor.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.404
Capitalism makes.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.149
Capitalism makes the poor the

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.459
richest poor people in the history
of humanity

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.310
by a long long shot.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.599
As Pew Research points out looking

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.159
at the United States the U.S. stands
head

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.139
and shoulders above the rest of the
world more than half

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.969
of Americans 56 percent were high

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.370
income by the global standard.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.449
Another 32 percent were upper middle
income.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.369
In other words almost nine in 10
Americans

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.259
had a standard of living those above
the global middle

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.189
income standard.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.259
Only 7 percent of people in the
United States

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.099
were middle income.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.419
3 percent were low income.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.720
Only 2 percent of Americans 2
percent

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.400
were poor by global standards.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.019
And how about the idea that

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.059
the rich people in Western societies
aren't paying

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.100
their fair share.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.519
Obviously that is untrue.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.379
That is particularly untrue in the
United States

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.779
where the highest income quintile is
financing 96

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.360
percent of all net costs

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.289
all the talk about the divisions
between the 1 percent

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.630
and the 99 percent.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.829
All of this is based on a couple

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.179
of bad notions.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.129
One is that you should be deeply
worried about

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.080
what your neighbor makes.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.669
If you're if your neighbor isn't
stealing your silverware

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.499
you have no business caring about
what your neighbor

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.000
makes.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.069
It actually violates one of the Ten
Commandments

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.959
are not supposed to do that even God
says

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.502
so You're

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.429
not supposed to covet your neighbors
ass which would be a good

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.659
lesson for Bill Clinton.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.190
Or maybe.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.750
To be bipartisan Donald Trump.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.029
It is also true that when we talk
about the 1 percent

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.379
and the divisions between the 1
percent

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.489
and the 99 percent.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.449
Lots of people move in

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.799
and out of the 1 percent.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.629
It is not a group of people who are
born in the 1

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.279
percent and stay in the 1 percent.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.289
There are times in your life when
you will probably be

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.369
in the upper 1 percent.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.259
There are times in your life when
you will not be in the upper 1

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.209
percent. People tend to get richer
as they get

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.099
older they have more savings as they
get older they

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.959
tend to have more earning power at
certain times

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.670
in their life.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.109
There is this weird notion that if
you're in the 1 percent

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.789
you're screwing everyone in the 99
percent.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.839
Again no evidence of that

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.699
and also no evidence that once you
get in the 1

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.649
percent you stay in the 1 percent
there is tremendous

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.629
economic mobility in capitalist

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.340
countries

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.280
also.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.259
The root of poverty in the

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.299
end in free western societies has

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.880
to do with personal decision making.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.199
And now that doesn't mean that where

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.119
you're born doesn't have some impact
on where you

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.460
end up. Obviously it does.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.419
It doesn't mean that it has no
impact on the challenges

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.580
you face in your life.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.689
But in a free capitalist society

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.549
you basically have to do three
things in

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.439
order to succeed to the point where
you're not poor

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.120
anymore.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.139
These are very all everyone in this
room is capable

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.060
of these three things.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.290
You have to finish high school.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.910
You have to get a full time job.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.680
You have to wait till you're married
to have kids.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.690
Those three things you won't be
poor.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.870
According to the Brookings Institute

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.769
of American adults who follow these
three simple

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.439
rules only 2 percent are in poverty.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.399
Nearly 75 percent have joined

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.379
the middle class we are all capable

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.530
of these three things. I mean when
people say that

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.849
societal discrimination prevents you
from

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.769
making good decisions I'm confused

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.290
how societal discrimination

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.679
forced you to have sex

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.519
with that girl

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.359
and then take off

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.229
or forced you to have sex

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.089
with that guy out of wedlock

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.010
and unprotected.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.599
Nobody was there with the gun to
your head if you did that that's

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.220
on you.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.400
And that's not societal
discrimination

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.059
the entire world would be better off
if we all started.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.109
Take a little more personal
responsibility about

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.150
the decisions that we have within
our own control.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.829
A couple more facts.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.869
The vast majority of disparities in
the United

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.939
States are not due to ongoing

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.799
discrimination they are due to the

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.689
after effects of historical
discrimination

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.350
and to invidious choices made by
individuals.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.879
So when you see statistics about in
the United States

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.739
the racial breakdown of people who
are

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.300
in prison for example.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.399
That's because there is a
differential

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.920
racial rate of crime

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.179
that does not mean that you're
inherently more

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.069
likely to commit crime because your
skin

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.590
color is a certain color

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.060
or because of anything else.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.039
It does mean that different people

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.860
commit crimes at different rates

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.569
individuals within certain groups
commit crimes

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.399
differently. If we broke down this
auditorium

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.259
into quadrants presumably it would
not

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.149
be an equal number of people who
score the same

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.039
on all the tests they'd

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.809
actually be disparities in those
groups.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.230
Disparities does not mean
discrimination

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.440
the Justice Department under Bill
Clinton

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.459
found that black

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.799
folks in the United States had a
lower chance of prosecution

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.749
than whites in seventy five major
American

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.014
cities as of 1994 as early as 1994

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.109
for certain

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.939
study from Siu NY found that
adjusted for

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.799
the homicide rate in United States
white folks are

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.629
actually one point seven times more
likely

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.570
than blacks to die at the hands of
the police.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.769
In July 2016 Harvard professor

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.779
Roland flyer who happens to be black
surveyed

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.870
over a thousand police shootings
found black suspects

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.150
are actually shot less often than
white suspects

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.620
in comparable situations

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.839
so a lot of the disparities that you
see in

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.849
American society are again caused by
folks

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.559
making bad decisions at differential
rates

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.560
and some of that is due to
historical after effect.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.639
Some of that is due to yes a legacy

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.719
of slavery and Jim Crow

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.549
and a lot of that can only be

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.589
broken out of thanks to personal
decision

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.560
making like don't commit a crime

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.609
don't have babies out of wedlock

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.950
finish high school.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.979
These are all things that are within
people's control

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.880
and to attribute them to societal
failings

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.049
is to ignore the fact that in a free
country

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.990
your life is under your own control.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.090
So here's the conclusion.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.169
Virtually everything that I just
said there are a lot

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.710
of facts and a lot of figures there.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.829
Virtually all of those things were
objective facts.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.779
I then drew conclusions from

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.240
those objective facts.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.560
They can argue

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.480
with the conclusions that I draw.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.589
And you can argue with the facts if
you can bring a set of

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.729
competing facts to argue

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.560
with those facts.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.460
That is fine

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.869
but if you are going to label

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.249
my viewpoint racist

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.469
or bigoted if you're going to label
conservatism

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.710
racist or bigoted you're going to
label fact

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.669
inappropriate for a broad audience

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.500
to hear.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.609
Well then you are quashing

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.136
free debate. You are quashing free
speech.

00:30:27.137 --> 00:30:27.387
This basic

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.839
Idea is too much for some folks some
folks

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.699
are already so deeply offended they
feel

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.259
no need to actually offer an
argument.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.530
Instead they just suggest that I'm
being offensive

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.699
that I'm somehow making light of
their

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.440
truth.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.359
One of the most invidious phrases

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.289
in human history.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.149
Your truth there is no

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.079
thing as your truth.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.129
There is just that truth

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.100
and your opinion.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.949
We can't have a common conversation
without

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.149
a common basis of fact.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.120
And that's why I at least try to
show my work here.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.049
So here's what I hope for for the
rest

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.020
of the night and for our debates in
general

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.099
that the other side of the aisle
shows its work.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.070
The other side of the aisle brings
its own facts.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.999
The other side of the aisle explains
why the facts that I've cited

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.919
are insufficient to support the
conclusions that

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.049
I've made that we argue from common

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.999
premises that we don't attack each
other's character

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.169
simply over disagreement

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.269
or suggest that hate speech means

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.360
that I can't express my opinion

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.390
if facts offend you tough

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.760
in a free society you're going to
have to hear them

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.779
because of course facts don't care
about

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.210
your feelings. Thanks so much.

00:31:39.903 --> 00:31:41.729
You know I actually I'm having on
Stephen Harper

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.130
on the Sunday special next week.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.440
I should be.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.599
I have to admit that the first time
I met Prime Minister

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.249
Harper I was I went up to Ontario.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.109
We were doing Sun news hit

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.939
back on Sun news a thing for

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.670
the 2012 election.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.689
And so I went I met

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.090
Prime Minister Harper

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.229
and when Barack Obama was president

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.999
and I will admit that I went up to
him

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.902
and I said "So when can you guys
invade?"

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.729
And he said "doesn't that make you a
traitor" And

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.692
I said "Not if you win"

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.030
Alright Mr. Shapiro We have our
first question over here.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.700
Hi Ben. Big fan of your work.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.870
My name is Fiona.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.889
Just a little concerned about

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.779
what you said regarding people

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.609
having individual choice which I
believe is

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.350
very important.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.849
But I think in today's society I

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:39.869
see a lot of men

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.089
and what they go through is a lot of
injustice

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.919
from the legal system especially in
family

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.320
law because it's very

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.510
disadvantages for men.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.399
So I was wondering would you
consider

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.610
that as a structural issues

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.899
especially today when you see there

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.029
are women who make false allegations

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:57.929
against men

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.230
and then the legal system just kind
of believe woman.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.039
What do you say about that?

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.869
Sure. I mean whenever there is a
violation

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.569
of due process so the basic
philosophy

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.609
that I espoused that was espoused by

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.370
the founders of the United States

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.379
again we should have annexed you

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:12.800
guys.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.510
But.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.059
The basic philosophy that I espouse
individual

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.949
rights given by God protected by

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.840
limited government

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.919
and those individual rights extends
to due process

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.929
of law. The fact that we have
overturned due process

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.759
of law in certain areas of the
Western

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.859
canon and instead suggested that the
burden

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.779
of proof lies with the accused
rather than

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.790
with the accuser

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.770
and that we can simply

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.069
adjudicate whether somebody is
guilty

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.899
or innocent based on their group
identity which is the most

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.999
nefarious idea of all the idea of
social justice

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.099
is deeply nefarious at least the
model of social

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.379
justice. This idea that I can
determine

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.279
whether somebody is guilty

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.190
or innocent based on their group
identity

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.089
does the same excuse that folks used
to use when they

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.249
were stringing up black folks
Because they're

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.470
racist and evil.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.519
So it's you know it is

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.439
deeply disturbing to see folks

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.380
embrace a group identity that

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.120
that is supposed to substitute for
justice.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.989
And it's also deeply disturbing

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.209
when folks decide to railroad

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.039
somebody based on a lack of evidence

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.869
specifically because they have more
sympathy

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.850
for one side

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.209
or the other in a particular debate.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.159
You don't get to do that.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.908
So would just say that is a
structural issue

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.119
though.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.039
Sure. I mean I'm not gonna pretend
that every

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.079
law that's ever been passed in the
West is great.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.908
I mean there are lots of crappy laws
that I

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.799
hate and I will say that I think
there

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.140
are some structural issues

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.638
that cut against justice

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.996
as an individual rights

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.470
and basic human fairness.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.519
Hi Ben I'm feeling the dragon

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.890
energy in this room.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.790
I have a question

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.019
as a Jewish person as well.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.059
I wanted to ask you something that
we can relate

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.948
to one of the questions

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.809
I have is yesterday today I had

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.909
a vigil for the Pittsburgh

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.799
massacre that happened recently

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.629
which was really sad for me

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.489
and of course you also

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.500
felt as well.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.819
But I noticed that at the vigil a
lot

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.649
of the Jewish people were speaking

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.359
up about intersectionality

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.829
and being compassionate

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:14.819
and being nice

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.180
and that's how we're going to
resolve all these issues.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.379
And I've noticed that a lot of like
young

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.359
American Jews also kind of abide

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.379
by this saying

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.629
and kind of avoid Israel

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.270
and that kind of topic.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.319
So how do we get more Jewish

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.239
young Americans young Canadians

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.249
to be interested in Israel

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.109
and knowing that that's the only way
we can

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.879
defend ourselves.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.959
And yeah

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.579
and one more quick question.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.709
If the Democrats

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.629
win the House in the midterms

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.261
do you think Trump will be
impeached?

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.910
Well I mean as far as the
impeachment question

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.989
I think they'd be foolish to do it
because they don't

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.189
really have good grounds to do it

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.169
and so it probably backfire against
them in the same

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.399
way in the same way.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.289
That was bad for Republicans when
they tried to impeach

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.209
President Clinton back in 1998 when

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.300
they did have pretty solid grounds
for such impeachment.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.289
As far as talking about Israel I
think

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.329
the first step to understanding
Israel is

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.429
to say that not every criticism

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.790
of Israel or Israeli policy is
anti-Semitic

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.010
but every anti-Semite that you know
hate Israel

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.649
they're not not all squares right

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.099
and not all rectangles are squares

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.230
but all squares are rectangles.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.399
So the fact is that if

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.499
you believe that Israel should be
held to a different standard

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.209
than any other nation you're an
anti-Semite.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.159
If you believe that Israel is

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.109
the serious problem in the Middle
East

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.609
then you're either ignorant

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.499
or an anti-Semite. Those are the
only two available

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.060
options.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.989
If you believe that Israel deserves
the same sort of

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.819
criticism or more criticism than

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.899
Iran or Saudi Arabia

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.799
or Egypt or Turkey

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.999
or Jordan or Lebanon

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.859
or Egypt or Sudan

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.879
or Yemen

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.709
or any of the countless other
countries in the

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.719
region you don't know what the hell
you're talking

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.699
about as far as Israel's

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.670
role in protecting

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.450
Jews.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.679
And it does make a difference

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.130
that the Jews have a country

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.449
where they know that they will be
protected.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.369
And also it does mean that the

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.060
rest of the world cannot necessarily

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.379
target Jews without those Jews
having a safe haven

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.209
to go to. I mean one of the big
problems during World War Two

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.069
obviously is the Jews literally had
no place to go.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.260
All the borders were shut to them.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.669
That is not true in Europe where
Jews have been leaving

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.529
here pretty rapidly for Israel.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.479
So Israel is deeply important to
Jews it should remain

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.970
deeply important to Jews obviously.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:17.709
And by the way

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.589
and by the way it should Israel
should remain

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.449
important to non Jews because it is
a canary in the coal

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.189
mine in the fight against Islamic
extremism.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.199
It's the only democracy in the
region it's the only true

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.450
ally that we have in the region.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.316
Can I follow up really quick too?.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.469
Just like I asked like as well like

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.569
how do we get more young American
Jews

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:35.609
and young Canadian Jews energized

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.989
about Israel? Well I mean I think
there's a decline.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.830
Well I think that

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.729
to be frank the the

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.709
care about Israel is

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.539
very much connected to a certain
level of

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.349
religious observance.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.239
I mean this is just what the polls
tend to show the more religious

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.330
you get the more you tend to care
about the state of Israel

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.589
and the more irreligious you get

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.499
the more you treat

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.800
Israel is most secular leftists
would.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.159
And so if you actually want to get
the question about Jews

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.049
if you wanna get Jews interested in
Israel you first have to get them

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.090
interested in Judaism.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.650
Happy Halloween Ben.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.840
Thank you.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.569
So I have an issue

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.160
with your stance on abortion.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.610
OK.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.739
So you defined life as starting

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.290
at conception

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.640
through biology.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:20.039
Right.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.959
Pretty much. But I think you took

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.149
the stance that life is
intrinsically valuable

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.130
because it's life

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.810
and that's where I disagree.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.309
I think there's two things that make
life valuable.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.199
I think consciousness the ability to

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.238
experience pain senses

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.360
and stuff like that and personal
identity

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.919
in particular psychological
continuity

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.659
identity.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.839
So the fact that we have memories we
have relationship

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.809
to of relationships to us I think

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:42.933
what's.

00:38:42.934 --> 00:38:44.551
Do you mean both of those who is an
either or?

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.541
I just want to clarify your
position.
1121
00:38:45,542 --&gt; 00:38:45,541
Either or

00:38:45.542 --> 00:38:47.219
Okay so if it's either

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.059
or than people

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.039
with Alzheimer's have real
continuity problems you can't

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:50.459
kill them.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.439
No because people still have
relationships

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.810
with them. All right so you just
love.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.109
I mean you have relationship

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:55.910
with them but

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.839
with people that advanced stage
Alzheimer's they really

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.674
don't have a relationship

00:38:58.675 --> 00:38:58.925
with you.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.400
for The sake of example let's say
someone dies right.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.789
The family gets to decide what you
do

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.679
with the body because I know what
you say when

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.514
you say someone says consciousness

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:08.009
and then they're brain dead.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.410
You say well can you stab them.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.579
No you can't because it's the
family's decision

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.509
what's it with the body.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.099
It's a person's decision what they
want.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.269
So if the family decides to stab
them it's okay to stab the.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.291
When they're brain dead.?

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:17.966
Yeah. They want.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.049
No not not not brain dead.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.089
Let's say that you're comatose for a
for

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.439
a specifically

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.380
and predictably

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.574
short period of time say nine
months.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.778
What does the person.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.459
I would say on the legal grounds

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.079
would depend if the person put it in
their will.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.969
If the person has made clear
statements like

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.949
Hey don't pull the plug on nine
months then

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.049
don't do that because I think the
first choice

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.379
is right.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.449
Let's say the person has not made
such clear statements say the person

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.300
can't make such clear statements so
that

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.740
he's just in a complete coma.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.944
Let's say the person has not done a
Living Will

00:39:53.945 --> 00:39:55.849
or had conversations like this they
in

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.869
a car crash you know that in 9

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.249
months they're going to come out of
the coma

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.269
and they're going to be fine. are
you allowed stab-

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:05.535
can the family say "hey you know
what it's been 9 months, lets do

00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:01.520
this thing"

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.200
If they're going to get their
memories back.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.420
Let's say they don't get the
memories back.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.940
I would say that that person is dead

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.070
and if the family wants to pull the
plug that's fine.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.089
I'd have no problem

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.039
with that. Yeah I would have no

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:17.870
problem with that.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.740
Because I don't like because that
like

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.543
that person is dead.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.689
You're getting into some dicey
territory dude

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.170
Right.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.109
And that's the best way to define
life his

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.069
personal identity

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:29.819
and consciousness.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.579
That's what makes life valuable.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.429
Right so I think that again if you
were to

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.869
say both that's too much

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.699
and if you would even say either I
don't think either one

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.190
of those legs stands on its own

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.109
because what you really mean that
this is a thing

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.459
about having a baby.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.070
It's a process of development

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.780
and this is the point that I'm
making.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.649
There's a period in this

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.509
human life when that child does not

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.379
have or fetus

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.500
or embryo whatever you call it when
this

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.639
living thing does not have

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.479
consciousness

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.180
and does not have a sense of
identity

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.129
but in nine months it will

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.260
have consciousness.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.459
Well babies babies don't

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.490
have a sense of identity for at
least

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.680
a certain number of months after
they're born.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:07.769
Babies.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.589
Babies can recognize their parents

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.627
as voices after they're born.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.130
Thats not a sense of identity. Rats
can identify.

00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:13.970
It is because they

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.870
know it's a form of memory though
right.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.060
That's what I was-

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.912
are you a Jainist?

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.219
Because animals also have a
conscience.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.139
Yes. I would say that killing
animals is wrong.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.149
You have no problem with that.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.670
So just to get the straight.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.260
Killing.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.949
Killing Fluffy the hamster.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.080
Deeply wrong.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:37.059
Killing a dude who wakes up from

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.919
a coma who is going to wake up from
a coma in

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.810
nine months

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.379
with memory problems.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.410
Totally cool.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:49.710
And.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.209
I mean that's fine you can have that
position I'm just not gonna

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.760
put you in charge of the NHS.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:56.950
Alright Thank

00:41:59.130 --> 00:41:59.939
you very much for a question.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.867
But we have to move on.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.324
I was listening to Peter Boghossian

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.099
on Joe Rogan today

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.049
and it just made me think of you
because

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.660
you were bringing some

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.979
you brought that up on your podcast

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:14.590
before.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.660
I just think like the West is eating
itself

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.039
I'm part of the Iranian diaspora

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:20.999
and your own people

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.079
and my people go back

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.609
and I sympathize

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.389
with the Jewish people.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.160
I really do.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.839
I just think like I've been I've
been fortunate

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.859
to travel around the world.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.959
I've. I haven't seen this

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.949
kind of nonsense

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.900
and idiocy

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:35.429
anywhere else around the world.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.619
I mean if you go to Thailand they're
not worrying

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.260
about 73 gender pronouns

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.559
or Japan

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.366
or even

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:42.850
Buenos Aires.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.779
Like do you think that this is a
problem

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.769
of just the West

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:47.999
and Western Europe.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.069
I mean luxury breeds people creating

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.999
new problems for themselves.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.800
No question.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.990
Well we are very bored people

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.979
and we we can create problems out of
Halloween

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.750
costumes.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.340
So. If.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.809
So do you think clinging to

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.820
a historical canon is the

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.279
answer to this kind of.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.659
For sure.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.749
I mean I think that that pursuit of

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.580
of virtue meaning

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.629
kind of traditional Judeo-Christian

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.519
values and a

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.539
sense of objective truth

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.300
and reason are necessary.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.349
It makes for a lot of hard
conversations

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:21.429
as we've seen a little bit tonight

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.289
but I think that if we don't cling
to a sense

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.149
that truth is not merely

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:26.700
a subjective construct.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.259
If we don't if we don't cling to the
idea that there's such a thing as

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.829
objective truth we can't have
conversations

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.070
and we tend to eat ourselves.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.089
And it's also a navel gazing is as

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.919
I say navel gazing which is
basically what we've

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.749
decided to do as a society navel

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.759
gazing and moral preening is

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.589
a luxury that extraordinarily rich
countries have

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:42.858
but everybody else still has to eat.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.100
My questions about climate change.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.630
So if I remember correctly.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.030
I heard you once in a video that

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.109
you do believe that human activity
does

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.209
have some sort of effect

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.040
on the climate.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.089
So one I would just like

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.979
you to explain a little bit of your

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.350
understanding of climate change.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:07.699
Sure.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.420
And another question is

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:11.529
are there any government policies
that

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:13.860
you would support in terms to
mitigate

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:14.910
carbon emissions.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.490
Yes.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.360
OK so.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.049
So my perspective on climate change

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.369
is number one I'm not a
climatologist

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.199
but excepting the

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.119
IPCC reports you

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.249
have to take into account the fact
that modelling

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.109
has been wrong for 20 to 30 years
it's

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.029
always been overestimating the
amount of climate change

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.190
that's actually taking place.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.089
But virtually every reputable
scientist

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.510
including folks who are who are
called Skeptics

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.469
believe that the climate is warming.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.320
There's an argument about as to how
much.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.189
And that over 50 percent of that
warming is

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.130
probably attributable to human
activity.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.380
Now that raises other questions
which is

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.009
OK so let's say the Earth is
warming.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.169
What kind of damage is that actually
going do.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:51.529
And this is a serious question.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.019
Right. Let's say that the Earth is
warming

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.000
and we're causing it.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.409
Does that mean that it's the day
after tomorrow

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:57.609
and massive floods in New York

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.589
and Dennis Quaid running around Jake
Gyllenhaal trying

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:00.216
to avoid the freeze.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.599
No it doesn't.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.519
Right it means that over the course
of the next hundred years

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.349
that the water level is going to
rise a

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.089
rather predictable number of inches

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.099
or feet and then humans will migrate

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.280
based on those weather patterns as
humans have

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.269
done since human beings became human
beings

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:14.730
and started walking on two feet.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.199
So you know I'm a little more
sanguine

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.530
about the possibility of long term
climate change

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.205
than a lot of catastrophists.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.409
You seem to assume that there's
going to be tremendous damage

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.289
done all the talk for example about

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.679
the storms are becoming more severe

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.590
and they're they're they're doing
that much more damage.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.399
The statistics really don't back
that up.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.289
What they really back up is that
we're just building more stuff

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.219
in the path of hurricanes.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.370
We're building more expensive stuff
in the path of hurricanes.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.689
So when the storms break that stuff

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.630
then it's more expensive for us to
fix that stuff.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.930
Because the number of hurricanes
actually hasn't changed

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.100
markedly over time.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.509
And when folks say the intensity of
hurricanes is changed

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.759
what they really mean is that the
amount of cost

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.130
associate with hurricanes changed

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.539
as far as what should

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.640
be done about that.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.809
Well the biggest problem that you
have is a serious

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.699
collective action from let's assume
that you really think

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.559
there there's a huge problem you
still have to decide whether

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.509
you believe what was put this way
what

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.429
level of climate change requires

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.679
what level of cutbacks

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.200
in terms of the global economy.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.159
So there's a

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.019
fellow whose name escapes me right
now who

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.810
just won the Nobel Prize in
economics

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.829
who legitimately made his entire

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.569
career out of studying the economics
of climate change.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.609
What does he think that intervention

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:19.599
economically is called for.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.429
He says that until he believes that

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.469
over the next century there's three
point five degrees

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.410
centigrade of climate change.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.489
That intervention actually would be
counterproductive

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.529
and cost more to intervene

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.389
than it would to actually allow the
damage take place

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.519
and just cope with it because the
economy is going to continue

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.440
to grow over time.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.490
So.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.500
I don't see any reason why

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.450
I think that I would know better
than he does.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.249
It's also a basic fact that the only

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.229
countries that have really been
abiding by any of the

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.059
the attempts to reduce climate
change have

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.189
an extraordinarily developed
countries developing countries

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:50.460
have no interest in sacrificing
their own people

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.940
at the altar of climate change.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.979
And the number one reducer in
emissions

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.130
over the past year was actually the
United States.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.871
The United States pulls out of the
Paris Accords,

00:46:57.872 --> 00:46:59.739
the Paris Accords of course

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.710
by the way did nothing. They were
completely useless.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.969
It was basically signed a piece of
paper saying you what

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.319
you don't like climate change.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.960
Okay fine. I signed it yay.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:08.289
And then it was gone.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:10.020
We saw it's climate change now no
you didn't.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.349
What does solve climate change is
technological

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:15.090
progress

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.529
and technological progress has led

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.419
to a reduction in carbon emissions

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.319
in the United States.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.479
It will not lead to a reduction in
carbon emissions in developing

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.369
countries for another 10 to 15 years
including

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.320
places like China.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.159
So it's a it's a complex issue

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.760
and other folks are basically like
let's just kill capitalism

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:30.060
good luck with that.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.300
Thank you.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.260
Hi Ben My name is JJ.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.629
I just wanted to ask you a question
on a topic

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.660
that I've never heard you address
before

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.589
and it's an issue that's kind of big
in Canada

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:47.334
as well as the U.S.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.399
and that's the issue of Indian
reservations.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.679
I was just kind of curious as to
what your general perspective

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.589
is on them at a philosophical level.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.069
Do you think there are good or bad
things.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.149
Do you think there's not more power

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.300
or less power. What's your just
general take on them.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.169
So I mean this has been an issue a
little bit

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.029
the United States obviously not to
the same extent as it

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.009
has been in Canada. Little know
little bit about Canada

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.470
but not a tremendous amount.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.660
So I'll speak in the U.S. context
which I know a little bit better.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:10.619
You know when you sign a treaty

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.749
with a with a group of folks who you
forcibly

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.579
expelled from their land it seems to
me

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.529
only fair to allow them to govern
their land

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:17.159
as they see fit.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.019
With that said I think that we

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.269
should make it a lot easier for
folks to leave

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.159
Native American reservations if they
want to.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.319
I don't think that we should be
forcibly taking children

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.179
out of non reservation areas

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.039
and returning them to reservations
as has happened

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.010
a couple of times in the United
States.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:32.849
And you know I think

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.130
with freedom of movement

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:35.990
and the

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.339
freedom of movement in trying to
offer more opportunity

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.010
to folks inside reservations

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.209
I think that a lot of those folks to
be better off leaving

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.039
those reservations but that's an
individual choice for

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.780
them to make.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.019
I think that you know delegating
that authority

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.839
down to local levels is probably the
best

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.850
available solution.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.310
Ben I have two questions.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.280
I guess one of my questions pertains
to

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.770
the conservative movement in Canada.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.539
What do you think of Andrew Scheer

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.030
and Bernier ?

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.820
I guess my second question is

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.950
any thoughts on

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:17.020
religious freedom.

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.089
I guess in terms of its direction
how do you think it's

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.949
going and not just the states

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:23.650
and Canada but North America in
general.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.759
Well I mean in the United States is
going to garbage

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.790
religious freedom that's because.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.929
There's been an overt attempts to
quash

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:31.799
religious freedom in the name
particularly

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.220
of anti-discrimination law.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.239
And that's mainly a generalized
attempt

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.129
to quash broader freedoms like in
the United

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.650
States freedom of association

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.270
freedom of speech.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.319
So the idea there is that I

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.149
can tell your religious school how
to operate I can

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.069
tell your your synagogue how to
operate

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.440
or your church how to operate.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.639
And that is a basic violation

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.479
of religious freedom.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.829
I can tell your business how to
operate

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.809
and tell you how to operate your
business in violation

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:55.090
of your own religious precepts.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.169
I think that violates certain
fundamental

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.050
principles of being free

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.090
and that holds

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.289
what freedom really is about is

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.110
your freedom to do stuff I don't
like.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.339
It's not really called freedom if
you're just doing a bunch

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.189
of stuff that I like because

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.660
then it's just called stuff I like.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.979
And then if I'm the dictator then I
get to tell you exactly

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.939
what it is you should do.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.679
And then we all agree on what you
should do because you all agree

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.080
with me. So everybody's happy.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.420
dictatorships usually aren't happy
because freedom

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:21.379
is premised on the idea you're gonna
do a bunch of stuff I'm not

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.300
real fond of.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.239
And then I have to just deal

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.800
with it.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.389
Unfortunately that is a perspective

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.690
that seems to be going by the
wayside in a lot of areas.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.000
Your first question was about what
Bernie Sanders.

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.560
No of course not.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.610
I'm sorry.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.219
My question is about the
Conservatives in Canada.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:37.914
Andrew Scheer Maxime Bernier.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.750
Oh sorry.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.129
Yeah when you say Bernie we
Americans

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.360
we automatically go to the Larry
David looking fella.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:48.310
Any thoughts on them.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:50.230
No I haven't studied enough.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:52.480
I wish I knew more. I don't.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.619
I have a question about Rwanda for
you

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.170
today.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.799
In Rwanda less 25 years ago eight

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.929
hundred thousand mostly ethnic
Tutsis

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.369
were murdered not by the government

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:08.320
but by their neighbors.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.699
Since then Rwanda has improved
remarkably.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.132
But the process has favored

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:13.939
forgiveness over justice

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.060
and safety over journalistic
freedom.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.709
How does Rwanda recover while still

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.269
moving towards Western liberalism.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.359
And what should the U.S. have done
during the buildup

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.800
in combination with the genocide.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.810
OK so again i'm going to plead

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.129
a certain level of ignorance because
I'm certainly not an

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.190
expert on Rwandan politics.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.959
Suffice it to say that the

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.999
the government of Rwanda remains

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.940
a tyrannical dictatorship.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.469
It's there are a couple of very good

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:40.180
books on this.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.619
One was recommended to me my friend
Jane

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.320
Kostin who's of the left.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.830
The basic

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.879
problem in Rwanda is that

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.919
the genocide is used very often

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.749
as a club by the dictatorship in
order

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.009
to curb journalistic freedom.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:56.839
If we let you look around

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.709
and perform journalism then you

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:00.769
are going to reopen all of these old
wounds

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:02.689
or you're can undermine the
government which leads to chaos

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.870
which leads to renewed genocide

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:07.480
that is obviously a serious problem.

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:09.619
I would suggest the problems run
extraordinarily

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.659
deep in a society where neighbors
literally picked up machetes

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.699
and murdered eight hundred thousand
of each other within the course

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.160
of what two months three months.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.899
So that's that's you know I

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.519
don't know how to solve that
overnight.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.090
I don't have solutions for
everything.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.769
You know all I would all I would say
is

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.629
that you know freedom

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.429
obviously comes with
responsibilities

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.769
and a culture that is not
necessarily

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:32.890
ready for freedom may not be best
governed

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.939
by a by freedom

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.979
I don't think democracy is an
automatic draft.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.779
I don't think that you can take
democracy plunked down in

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.609
Afghanistan and boom it works I
don't think that's the

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.019
way it works.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.850
It's an overly optimistic view of
human nature.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.740
What should have the United States
have done during that period.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.119
Well I mean the United States always

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.039
has to determine its

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.439
own interests in these areas how
much of a sacrifice

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.920
would it have had to make in order
to prevent

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.910
that genocide.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.280
I was 10 when that happened I
remembered all that well

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.389
but the you know the idea

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.219
that the United States could have
done

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.740
more in order to

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.179
intervene is probably

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.279
the case the United States did do
more to intervene during the

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.770
during the Kosovo war

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.900
by using airpower to.

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.129
Prevent a furthering of the genocide

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:15.780
in Kosovo.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:16.590
So.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:18.190
I'm sorry.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.780
That's what I said.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:22.370
But the.

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.059
The the situation

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.690
in Rwanda it seems to me that

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.189
you know again I wasn't the decision
maker seat

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.329
and I wouldn't want to speak out of
turn

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:33.189
but the use of American airpower
might have

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.009
been more necessary than than it

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:37.211
was than what it was used at the
time.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.770
Do you think extreme partisanship

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.729
and political

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.640
polarization between the Democrats

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.899
and Republicans are detrimental to

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:52.830
the democracy.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.259
In your opinion what is the best way

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.240
for Congress

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.460
and society to reach consensus

00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:59.759
on controversial issues.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.739
In terms of gun control same sex

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.170
marriage and abortion.

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.699
So number one I don't actually

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.529
think that I don't

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.479
think that consensus is what the
American

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.549
government was built for was built
for competing interests

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:12.449
fighting against each other

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.150
and creating a certain level of
gridlock

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.379
as far as gun control.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.440
That's not a national issue nor
should it be one

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.579
localism in government is in

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.649
my view always significantly

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:24.719
better than control from the top
down.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.639
I don't think Congress should really
be involved in those issues.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.430
It seems to me that local
governments are best.

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.689
Situated to analyze

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:32.039
whether gun control is necessary.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.869
I don't believe in gun control as
general

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.819
principle when it comes to

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.830
same sex marriage.

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.279
I've been libertarian on this.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.310
I think the government should be
involved in marriage at all.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.809
I think that the government has no
business

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:44.669
in how people behave in their
personal

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:45.140
life.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:47.489
And as a religious person well I
religiously

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.770
opposed same sex marriage.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.509
Who cares right.

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.019
Go to if you want to go to a church

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.360
and get same sex married.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.250
More power to you. You have to care
what I think

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.709
and I ndon't have to care what you
think.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:57.950
Welcome to a free society.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:58.810
So.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.603
Abortion I think is a little bit of
a different issue because

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:09.919
I believe that the Constitution was
constructed

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.789
to protect life liberty

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:12.709
and property life is one thing life

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:13.720
liberty and property.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:17.609
I respect your answer

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.769
and I think we all respect

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:20.549
the Constitution.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.720
We respect the law.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.679
The horror.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.719
I also want to point out that there
are some aspects

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.699
of law that may not be good for

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.710
people in general.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:29.829
And the reason why I say this

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.919
is because law are enacted by people

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.999
and people make the law.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.409
And you're only so eloquent.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:35.519
People who break the law.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.229
For example if you have a debate

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.389
with Piers Morgan then I believe

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:41.349
that you can write

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:43.289
other conclusion which everybody
believes.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:45.050
So my question is we all recognize

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:47.600
the importance of free speech.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.679
Wouldn't it be unfair if one side

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.539
of the political spectrum has a

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.000
lot of eloquent debaters

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.490
and persuasive persuasive speakers

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.319
for example Republicans are better
off

00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.359
with people like Jordan Peterson,

00:55:59.360 --> 00:55:59.614
Ben yourself

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.369
and Piers Morgan.

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.539
So do you agree

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.100
with that.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.669
Do I think that Jordan

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:06.989
and I are better debaters than
peers.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:08.489
Yeah I mean I.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.050
Wouldn't say that's a

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.300
sarcastic.

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.369
But I mean I will say this about the
United

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.550
States Constitution it's not just to
me

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.779
a form of you

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.780
know legal creation.

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:22.679
It's based on certain underlying
principles every law

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.059
is based on certain underlying
principles.

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:25.679
I think that the underlying
principles that were meant to be

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.830
preserved by the Constitution of the
United States

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:29.639
are eternal truths.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.739
I think that the ambition of human
beings is an internal

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.659
truth. I think the fact that we

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.759
are better governed locally than we
are nationally

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.010
is any eternal truth.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.059
I think that the idea that you have

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.009
individual rights that were given to
you by

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:42.830
nature or God in the view of the
founders

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.309
those are eternal truths.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.379
And so designing a system based on
those fundamental

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.519
premises is more likely to arrive

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.849
at a proper conclusion than basing

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:52.889
a system on the idea

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.079
that the community's rights outweigh
the individual's

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.209
rights for example which is sort of
the French declaration

00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:59.369
of rights and then the South African
constitution

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:00.200
by contrast.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:07.530
Hello Ben.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.059
Tonight I want to ask you about
emotionalism

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.550
and in particular fear.

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.089
I believe in freedom

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.679
and I believe fear is the antithesis

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.839
and can be compared to a panopticon

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.850
of the mind.

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.039
For example my father Barry Neufeld

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.879
has taken a stand against SOGI 1

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.580
2 3.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.370
Rather than debate his stance
rational.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.619
Rather than debate his stance
rationally

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.939
the B.C. Teachers Federation

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.919
and Canadian Union of Public
Employees

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.640
have opted for the fast track to
section 318

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.720
hate speech code

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.430
and sue him into silence.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.599
A move I believe is motivated by
fear

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.840
and goes far beyond casual
conversation.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:48.469
What can individuals

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:50.359
and communities do to combat

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.880
creeping emotionalism

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:54.319
and restore conscientious reason to
discourse

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.330
in this country.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.649
Well I mean I think that the first
thing that has

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.310
to be done.

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.729
Is there does have to be a mass
movement

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.769
against the use of the government
gun to silence

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.560
people that you don't like talking
to.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.150
That has to stop.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.109
And it's why I opened the speech by
ripping into

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.570
the B.C. Human Rights Code.

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.989
I don't like hateful speech any more

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.789
than anybody else does.

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.799
But I am not willing to give the
government the power

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.719
to shut down speech that I find
offensive

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.609
or hateful simply because I don't
like

00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:20.960
it.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.729
The other thing we have to do is we
have

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.610
to we have to announce which speech

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:31.639
is linked with action.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.469
Otherwise no one care what anybody
else had to

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:35.449
say. But to equate speech

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.369
with violence which is really what
so many

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:38.649
members of the left have done these
days.

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.549
I make an argument that means that
you now have to go

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.559
running to the sexual assault center
because

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.780
somehow I've assaulted you.

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:45.340
It's nonsense

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.519
and it's counterproductive

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.469
and it leads specifically to the
argument that because

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:50.539
my speech is violence you can use
violence to silence

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.889
my speech speech

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.040
and violence are completely
different.

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.149
And unless you are openly inciting
violence

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:57.880
against somebody your speeches

00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:58.930
ought to be legal.

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:09.740
last night you mentioned the
Cartesian duality

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:11.399
and that piqued my interest.

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.680
And it has me thinking.

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:15.089
How much do you think this is a
problem.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.039
How do you how much do you think
that's linked to actual

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.870
mental illness.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.369
so I mean the argument that I was
making last night

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:22.439
I spoke last night at Vancouver
Hebrew Academy

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.179
and I was talking about somebody
asked a question about

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.130
transgenderism.

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:27.200
Even that speech that anti-Semitism

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.240
and the I

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.349
and I was talking about this this

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:33.479
bizarre idea that you have a female

00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.270
mind inside of a male body.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.340
And I suggested that this was a

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:39.269
kind of reversion to Cartesian
duality.

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:41.339
This idea of the ghost in the
machine that your mind

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.740
exists separate from your body

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:43.829
and that your body has nothing to do

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:44.879
with your mind and your genetics

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.739
and your and your brain workings

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.519
have nothing to do

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.109
with who you are as a person

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:50.939
and therefore you know you can

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.799
create weird TV shows about people
switching

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.380
minds everything is freaky friday

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.639
and it seems

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.649
to me that a lot of what is being

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.599
argued right now which is that the
mind is

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.639
completely separate from like
completely

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.700
separate from the body

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:06.629
and therefore all you have to do is
change the body to meet

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:07.820
with the mind wants it to be

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:11.339
is rooted in certain illogical

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.469
precepts about what Biology

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:14.840
is and what reality is.

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:17.249
And again it's its gut

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.139
churning to talk about these sorts
of topics

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.029
publicly particularly when you

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.550
know you're hurting people's
feelings.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.449
I actually as much as I don't care
about people's

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:26.420
feelings I actually kind of do.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.319
I don't spend a lot of time talking
about people's

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.149
feelings because I feel like people
use their feelings as

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.969
a way to shut down debate

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:32.939
but the last thing that I want to do
is to have people

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.970
walking out really upset about
things.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.409
I think that that's why I prefer a
society

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.810
in which we all grow a thicker skin.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.829
But it is true that that a

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:42.749
movement back to a sort

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.390
of nearly pagan

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:45.689
association

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.609
with subjective truth is not good

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.589
for anybody including folks who are
suffering from mental

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:50.260
disorders.

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.799
I want to preface this with i run
about 50/50

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.589
with your opinions

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.479
and what I agree with

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.369
and disagree with but I've heard a
good statement that says

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:04.689
that there's rarely black

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:07.170
or white new situations of broad
policy

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:09.249
whether it involves a body count

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.109
or not. So what I want to ask

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:13.479
you is that you've stated that it's
our generation

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.270
that tends to have these extreme
views

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.259
and how it forms

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.479
the sub-adult Culture

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.589
in terms of maturity

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:22.809
and whatnot. And I want to ask you
why

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.759
in particular do you think it's the
West Coast because

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.679
there's a blue red divide all over
the United

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.569
States. Why in particular do you
think it's on

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:30.380
this coast that

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.319
this hotbed of extremists

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.179
left. diaspora for

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:35.729
lack of a better word has formed.

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.839
Well I mean I think that as it's a
lifelong resident

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.020
of California there's an echo
chamber that's formed

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.159
and the only acceptable opinions

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.989
are the ones that are to the left of
the echo chamber.

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.999
So I think that America as a broad
whole

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.839
has moved to the left.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.720
I think that's true in most

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.910
other Westernised countries as well.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.999
And that's most extreme

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.889
and most pronounced in areas where
you basically have one

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:55.719
party rule which is what you have in
places like

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.550
California

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.749
and where kids are essentially
indoctrinated

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.600
in certain principles of leftism

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:01.980
in public schools

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:04.260
and by the entertainment complex
that exists

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:05.700
in Hollywood.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:06.780
So.

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.869
You know I do think that you know

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.312
the society is moving ever further
to the left.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.689
No I wouldn't say that our
generation

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.429
is particularly disconnected from
reality.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.730
I think the baby boomers are pretty
disconnected from reality.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.800
I mean the baby boomers I think

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:21.750
pretty much ruined America.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.669
I mean they they they basically
bankrupted

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.589
the country and then made all of us
pay for

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.930
it and my kids pay for it

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.949
and then suggested that they've
saved the country

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:32.019
by creating all these social
programs

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.939
that are going to never be paid for
under any

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.109
circumstance then screaming

01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:37.239
and yelling whenever we talk about
the necessary

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.160
measures to cut them.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.509
So I'm not particularly fond of

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:42.459
the generation that brought us the
1960s.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.199
Basically there are a couple of
things that were good about the

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.009
1960s

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.959
and they were very good at the civil
rights movement was a wonderful

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.180
thing about the 1960s.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.109
The first wave feminist movement was
really earlier

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:51.129
than 1960s.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:53.220
There are some good things about the
1960s

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:55.179
as an overall thing aside

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.210
from the civil rights movement they
really sucked.

01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:58.569
They're not good for the country.

01:02:58.570 --> 01:02:59.799
As a follow up in red

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.869
or blue in the government what
actions do you think

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:03.879
that the ruling party could take to
avoid

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.829
this delay in adulthood that's
present

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:06.310
among the current generation.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.049
I mean I think the first thing is
you have to make people not

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.960
dependent on the government into
adulthood.

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.259
We are not demanding anything of
anybody

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.319
until the point there 28 29

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.099
30 years old

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.959
and then we're acting like they're
victims up till the point that

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.750
they're 28 29 30 years old.

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:20.469
Oh my God you graduated from college

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:21.519
with a gender studies degree

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.250
and you can't get a hundred thousand
dollar job.

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:24.870
No shit Sherlock.

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:31.360
We're teaching.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.989
We're teaching folks

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:34.849
and this is true for politicians are
in

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:35.929
the business of lying to you

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:37.849
and the common lie that they're fond
of telling

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.159
you is that they're going to solve
all of your problems.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.539
No politician has ever

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.219
or will ever solve all of your
problems

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.100
or even to my new fraction of your
problems.

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.099
And you're seeing this from left

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.100
and right. It drives me up a wall.

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.149
People say well you know you're
living in a town

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:51.679
your economy is dying in this town.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.410
I'm coming home to save your town.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.429
Nonsense. That person is not going
to save your

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:56.980
town. They just want your vote

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:59.200
and they're going to lie to you
until they get your vote.

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.339
Okay. The only way that

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.409
your town is going to be saved is if
you become

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:04.309
an entrepreneur

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:06.550
and you create jobs you not the
government.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:07.180
Again the.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.129
Only way that you are going to the
only

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:14.959
way that you're going to have a nice

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.059
family is if you make good decisions
about dating

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.529
and marriage and having children.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:20.449
The only way that you're going to
have a nice

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:22.419
career is if you make solid decision
after solid

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.409
to in a chain of solid decisions
about

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.299
what you decide to major in what job
you decide to take

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.129
whether to quit that job for an
apprenticeship in a

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.130
different field whether you're
willing to move

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:30.870
right.

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:33.649
We spend so much time in politics
talking

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.779
about the society in which we bathe

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.709
in which we simmer how the society

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.180
is unjust and how it's done.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.789
It's not good and it's crushing us

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:41.890
and all of these things.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.749
The reality again for the 1000

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.639
time is that if you want to have

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.979
a good life look in the mirror first

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.500
then start worrying about everybody
else.

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:58.260
Hey Ben big fan

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.539
I just want to say quickly I really
appreciate

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.439
your approach to politics

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.329
and it means a lot more about

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:05.400
discussion.

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:07.869
Makes it better especially for
people

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.879
who the left hate especially why
straight

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.709
Christian male conservatives like

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:12.330
myself.

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:17.130
A question on your stance of
evolution.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.029
I was just wondering as a Christian
obviously I

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:20.049
was raised a lot.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.050
Evolution Christianity was the big
debates.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.769
My social circles

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.710
and I was just wondering if

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.609
you spent a lot of

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.589
time looking at younger creationist

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.419
theories like from Christian
Christian

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:31.839
ministry.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.699
I've been in the States sometime
because there's some of

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.429
that in the Orthodox Jewish
community as well.

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.420
I don't believe any of it.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.290
All right.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:40.029
I believe that the earth is

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.409
billions of years old

01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.569
and that it human

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.489
and that life is hundreds of
millions

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:46.410
of years old

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.699
and that human beings have been
around for hundreds

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.610
of thousands of years in modern
form.

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.569
And you know I

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:54.399
believe in the generalized theory

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.619
of evolution although I believe in
punctuated equilibrium

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.549
which tends to fit better

01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:59.439
with the sort of fossil record than

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.200
the idea of a continuous evolution

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.339
that occurred at a constant rate
across

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.319
time which even Darwin didn't really
argue

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:05.760
for.

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:07.969
And by the way I think all of this
is square

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:09.849
with the Bible. I don't actually
think that you

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:11.859
have to think that God

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.350
speaks the language of people.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.459
And so if you're a Bible believer as
I

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.409
am and as many Christians are I
don't see why

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:19.329
you would think that for example
young

01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:21.219
earth creationism assumes that when
it says six

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.109
days in the Bible I mean six literal
24

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.449
hour days. I don't know why you have
to read it that way considering

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.380
that the sun is not created on day
one.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.219
It says it says the first day.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.379
Well what what's a day in a world
where there's no sun

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.350
and where the earth doesn't revolve
around that sun.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.769
There are some good books on this.

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:37.599
There's one by Gerald Schroeder that
I'm particularly

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.459
fond of called Genesis in the big

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.890
bang. That's kind of fun to read.

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.879
I don't think you have to leave
science at the door because

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.716
you're a Bible believer.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.928
I'm a believer as Maimonedes was

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.550
as Thomas Aquinas was that

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.959
God speaks in a couple of different
languages.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.429
He speaks the language of scientific
truth

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:52.779
and he speaks the language of the
Bible.

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.699
And if you're not scoring them
properly that's your fault not

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.170
his.

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:02.149
Would you would you ever debate

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.009
someone like someone like Ken Ham
who believes

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.079
that young earth theory say on a
sunday special or somethibg like

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.329
that?

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.389
I mean I'd be happy to have mine.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.360
I'm always happy to have
conversations

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.320
with anybody.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.609
You know if I if I felt I didn't
have the proper expertise

01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:15.439
to argue that point I'd probably
want to bring on somebody

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.299
who's more of an expert in
evolutionary theory to

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.929
talk to Ken Ham I think to be a
better debate.

01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:20.839
If if if now like the Sunday

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.759
specials are really for me to ask
questions like

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.620
an ignoramus

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.689
that's what's fun for me is there a
place for

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:27.340
me to learn.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.569
But if it were to be a debate

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:31.429
on those things what I'd really want
do is have back to back

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.839
Sunday specials with like him

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.230
and then Richard Dawkins for
example.

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:36.730
Really I was just a fun one.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.780
Do you not.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.145
We gotta move on.

01:07:38.146 --> 01:07:40.210
With a yarmulke.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.302
I'm sorry.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:42.637
do you sleep with the yamulka on
your head?

01:07:42.638 --> 01:07:43.462
No no. Jews don't sleep

01:07:43.463 --> 01:07:43.713
with the yamulka on their head

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.789
Hi Ben.

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:50.039
I'm a big fan of yours

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:50.865
and at the meeting

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:53.049
and greet. I told you I watched all
your shows

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:53.289
and.

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:54.510
Well thank you appreciate it.

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.439
So this question I know no one's
asked you

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.299
yet because it's a relatively new

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.190
phenomenon

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.269
but to your face before we get

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:03.129
onto the question you've mentioned

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:05.220
before to which I agree too

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.269
that the women back in

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.679
the days more

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.849
with the Christian values

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.030
and Judeo Judeo Christian values

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.379
that they realized men

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.750
act a certain way.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:18.068
Therefore we should take preemptive
measures

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:19.989
so that men don't act that way
because

01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:21.360
we know how they act.

01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:23.349
Where is the new third wave

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.358
feminist movement sees men

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:27.330
and says well if men act that way.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:29.610
Therefore women can act that way as
well.

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.529
So what this is leading to

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.669
is the new phenomenon as the
SlutWalk

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:35.568
movement. I don't know if you've
known about

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:36.029
that

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:37.509
with Ambrose.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.580
Yes so

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:41.499
I'm just wondering what do you think

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.539
are the ramifications of women

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.858
saying well if men can go out

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.299
and dress however they want

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.480
and women can do the exact same
thing.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.580
Do you think that leads to

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:52.719
a loosening of the fabric of society

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.660
or a shame is a necessary

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.209
determinant in society.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:56.560
Yeah.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.389
and that it leads to like sexual
assault

01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.850
and increase in things

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.150
Well I mean things.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.228
OK. So I think that first

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:04.329
of all if somebody commits a sexual
assault the only person

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.289
to blame is the person who commits
the sexual assault.

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:07.319
That right off the bat.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.849
Victims are not to blame for their
own sexual assault.

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:09.160
Yeah.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.728
I also think that if you put

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:15.619
yourself in a risky situation then
you've put

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.539
yourself in a risky situation right.

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.728
We do this everyday everyday we make
decisions

01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:22.000
about what sort of situations to put
ourselves in.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.159
If I walk through a high crime
neighborhood waving

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.549
a hundred dollar bills above my head

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:27.559
and then I am robbed then is

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.389
the fault of the person who robs me
it is not my

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.249
fault. But I also made a bad

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.419
decision to do that.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:32.909
Yes.

01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:34.700
I said two things can be true at
once

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.978
and it is not blaming the victim to
say

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:39.019
that it's a bad decision to walk
through a high crime

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.110
neighborhood at night waving a
wallet over your head.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.499
Yeah.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.459
Right. It is it is also not a good

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.679
idea to go to parties

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.789
where drinking

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:48.699
and drugs are commonplace

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:50.329
with a bunch of guys who are pigs.

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:50.728
Yes.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:52.469
Right. That's just not a good idea.

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:54.439
Now does that relieve responsibility

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.389
from the guys 100 percent not if a
guy rapes

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:57.439
you or sexually assaults you.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.549
He should be castrated

01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:59.539
or killed. Yeah.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.685
I'm very strict on this.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:02.920
One more question.

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.299
One of the things that I hate so
much about this conversation

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.039
is that people assume two things
can't be true.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.789
that if I think that rape is bad

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:10.759
and I also think that you shouldn't
make decisions that heighten

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.619
your own risk factor that I'm
somehow blaming

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.479
the person who heightened the risk
factor

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.799
for the bad thing that happened to
them.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.449
No two things can always be true at
once

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:18.407
and normally they are.

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.630
I just think the slut walks
increasing the sexual

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.000
liberation society.

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.179
As as far as far as you can walk

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.429
again I don't know why anybody would
be prideful

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.809
about their own promiscuity man

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:28.639
or woman. Yeah it's confusing to

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.169
me as somebody who is a virgin until
marriage

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:31.510
and very proudly so

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.439
and believe the that has made

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.930
my relationship with my wife better

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.040
and stronger

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:36.940
and holier.

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.229
I am I am I am perfectly

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:40.039
consistent on this.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.259
I hold women to a particular
standard I hold mental a particular

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.260
standard that standard is being
classy.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:44.529
Yeah.

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:46.369
I know that word is kind of lost on
its meaning these

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:48.190
days but being classy.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.193
On one thing Cenky Uygur

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:52.750
from the young Turks he says that

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.550
the Politicon Debate that you're
with.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.599
You said that it wasn't a real
debate because

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.979
debating who was like debating

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.080
with a robot

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.609
and he preferred Tucker Carlson's
debate.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:02.649
How do you respond to Cenk

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.529
I mean he he preferred Tucker
Carlson's debate

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.220
make he Tucker agree on more things.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.546
I mean really thats not a rip on
Tucker again He

01:11:08.547 --> 01:11:10.699
and Tucker agree on all this stuff
about corporations

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.629
need to be restricted

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.849
and Tucker's more of an economic
populist

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:15.439
and cut out campaign spending

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.390
and all this kind of stuff.

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:18.559
I mean if he doesn't like debating
me

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.549
that's his prerogative.

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:20.450
He agreed to it.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.230
I mean it.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.669
And as far as debate

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:24.529
and as far as debating debating

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.659
a robot like I'm sorry

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.910
I'm good at my job.

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:38.080
Ben I am a liberal

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.649
but I'm a big fan of yours.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:41.179
I really appreciate the way that you
talk

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.400
and articulate yourself.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.739
The reason I bring that up being one

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.719
thing that I've noticed that I'm not
a huge

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.819
fan of just in the political

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.450
world is the sort of increased
divisiveness

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.419
between the left

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:53.989
and right.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.358
Yep.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.379
So I'm wondering what are in the
spirit

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.410
of that what are some things about

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.529
liberalism

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.830
and liberals that you would admire.

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.820
So I would.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:06.739
OK so a couple of things one I make
a very strong

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.329
distinction between people who are
leftists

01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:10.510
and people who are liberals when it
comes to issues of free speech.

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:12.529
So I admire folks like you who are
willing to come

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:14.479
out and actually listen to the other

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.769
side and have conversations

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:17.669
and debate and use a hand for that

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:18.190
and.

01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.160
By the way. So does it.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.989
This is why.

01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:26.969
You know it upsets me when folks
walk out.

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:28.829
So does the. So does the person

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:31.130
who came in and asked about the
transgenderism question.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.969
Anybody who comes in disagrees
deserves enormous

01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:34.859
credit for coming to a room where
they know

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.650
they're going to be in the minority
viewpoint wise

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.850
that person.

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:39.959
I feel that persons not here to
receive a hand that

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.060
person should receive a hand.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.859
So that's number one. Number two you
know

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.929
I think that the liberal

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:48.029
concern with fairness is coming

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.889
from a good place although I think
the policy

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:51.839
ramifications of that concern are
very

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.730
often wrong.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.869
And I think that if you don't have
that

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.819
conversation constantly being had
then

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.679
it could be easy to lose

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.629
yourself in sort of the in

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.990
sort of the the realm of

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.430
an anarcho libertarianism.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.779
I think it's

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.960
it's a reminder that look my view is

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.859
when it comes to my own family I'm

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:11.540
a liberal.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.069
Why. Because my own family we have
income

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:15.080
redistribution.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.700
I have a joint bank account with My
wife

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.949
and I'm it's a patriarch

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:21.839
it's a paternalistic society

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.999
because I'm literally the petro

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.240
familia. I literally am the head of
my family.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.460
And so that means that

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.719
you know I admire some of the
sentiments

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.459
that backed this. I don't think
they're applicable to government.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.700
I don't think they're applicable to
broader social

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:36.629
strata but they're a reminder that

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:38.669
if you don't actually do the hard
work

01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:40.610
of building up a social fabric at
home

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.329
and being kind to the people around
you

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.159
and your community then there will
be a

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.310
call for that to be crammed down on
you from above.

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:55.810
Ben I'm a huge fan.

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:57.340
Thank you for coming here.

01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:58.909
So I kind of wanted to.

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:00.739
I was thinking about this question
on the way

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.689
in and I knew is going to be a
contentious one

01:14:02.690 --> 01:14:05.020
for you i just wanted to ask you a
question about your best friend

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.130
Milo Yiannopolous

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.600
I know you guys have a lot

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.809
of history.

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:12.979
I'll say bluntly

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.839
but I was thinking about this a

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.819
lot and I know that I

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.139
pay a lot of attention to Milo.

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.059
I'm kind of a big fan of his too so

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.370
I mean I'm sorry about that.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.070
You're.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.349
Really even like the tooth caps

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.970
and all that.

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:26.909
I mean I wasn't I wasn't down

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:28.759
on the veneers and the butt
injections.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.739
I thought who I thought is beautiful
before then.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.750
So I mean

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:35.110
but no I really I'll get to my
question.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.200
So I know you guys are really really
split.

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:40.219
And he said some horrible

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.400
things about you and vice versa
maybe.

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:43.600
Not quite.

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:47.059
But I was kind

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:47.719
of wondering.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.799
I said he's not a conservative.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.719
He sent me a picture of a black
child on the day of my

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.309
son's birth.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.829
I know.

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:52.509
Not quite the same.

01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:53.539
You know I know I know

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.480
but my point my point is that

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.469
like conservative speakers like
yourself

01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:59.479
like there's the intellectual dark
web there's a group

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.489
of you guys that kind of you know
help bolster

01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:02.230
each other up.

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:04.099
And I know that he's not necessarily
a

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.830
part of that but I was wondering if
like

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.149
if people in general could see

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:10.099
that someone like yourself is
willing to

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.319
extend an olive branch of some sort.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.369
And this is like totally.

01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:15.550
Well here's the olive branch that I
extended to Milo

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.749
and I will say this I don't feel the
need to extend

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:20.209
an olive branch to somebody

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.129
who sends me pictures of black
children on the day

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.870
my son was born.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.779
But the olive branch that I extend
to Milo is

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.109
the same olive branch that I extend
to anyone

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:29.029
with whom I have significant
disagreement when he was banned

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:30.260
from Twitter I said he shouldn't
been.

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:32.239
And that's even though a lot of the
Twitter

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.189
trolls I was receiving who sent me
anti-Semitic

01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:36.490
memes on a fairly frequent basis for
Milo fans.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.989
So you know I'm so I think that

01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:40.680
you know if Milo

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.769
you know I don't believe

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:44.779
that people should generally be
banned from social

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:45.639
media platforms.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.749
I think Milo said a lot of really
terrible

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:48.280
things.

01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:51.529
I think that he has been

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.359
a detriment to the conservative
movement by

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.499
linking the conservative movement

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.930
with a lot of very bad ideas.

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:57.889
Now does that mean everything that
he's ever said is bad.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:58.849
No. I mean when he.

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:00.670
There are some things that he has
said

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.939
about political correctness

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.490
with which I generally agree.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.689
My biggest problem Milo and this was
my problem before

01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.579
he imploded right. My biggest
problem Milo we

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.639
had this argument even before he
went into full.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.529
Alt-right or alt-lite Or whatever

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.519
wants to call himself My biggest

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.349
problem with him was in

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:18.040
like early March 2016

01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:19.909
when he suggested that the future of
America

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:21.769
was not conservatism not
constitutional

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.629
conservatism it was a new big

01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:25.639
government populism that was going
to take over

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.830
where that left off.

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:29.209
And I fundamentally disagree

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.249
with that. And he added that

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.190
he thought the political that that

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:35.380
basically being politically
incorrect.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.160
Was.

01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:38.350
The same thing as being an asshole.

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.600
I don't think those two things are
the same.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.469
I think he can be politically
incorrect which is to

01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:44.329
say you say valuable things that
people find

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:46.159
unpalatable but they are actually
valuable

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.769
they are arguments that need to be
made

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.609
and be politically incorrect that's
not the same thing

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:50.779
as somebody dropping the N-word

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.210
or somebody dropping a slur

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.199
or somebody you know doing

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.279
what Milo was doing

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.379
and showing pictures of actual
transgender

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.219
people on screens

01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.650
and mocking them for the crowd.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.889
I don't think that's necessary.

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.130
I think you can make a fully cogent
argument about

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.969
what transgenderism is

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:07.009
or what we ought to do as a society
about

01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:08.959
sexual differentiation without

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:09.889
doing that sort of thing.

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:11.779
I think that it actually lends a lot
of credence

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.789
to the other side which is
politically correct

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:15.490
in cracking down on free speech.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.419
When you conflate those

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.309
two things when you conflate
incivility

01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:20.260
or being a jerk

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.469
with being politically incorrect.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.339
So those are my main problems

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.680
with Milo as far as like.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.819
Having a conversation again I don't
really see

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.040
the need cause i dont see The
productivityi don't have

01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:27.380
conversations

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.690
with a lot of folks

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.489
but I also don't think Milo

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:33.319
should be banned. And I've never
called for him to be

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.449
so in fact I've openly called even
when we were

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.279
you know but even when this was at
its worst I

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.250
said that he shouldn't he should not
be down from Twitter.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.839
Ben a big fan of yours

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.789
first of all. And the question that
I have for

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:50.859
you is you're kind of guilty

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.699
of it a little bit

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.310
and most of the Americans are.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.479
My background is originally came
from

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.160
Russia

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.449
and my stances for

01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:00.309
example in the debate that you
brought up was

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:02.529
Rwanda. Why does America

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:04.389
have to have a stance on everything

01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:06.339
and why does America have to
actually go

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.289
into a country and potentially

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:09.570
prevent the genocide

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.569
or something like that.

01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:12.399
Why does America have to be involved

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.569
in all the world's affairs.

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:15.489
So America doesn't the answer is
America

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:16.230
does not.

01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:18.339
But there is a good argument made

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.379
that if you can help you do so

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.299
if it's very little cost to the
United

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:24.519
States to send a few bombers over a
particular

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.649
area to stop a million

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:27.950
people from being killed.

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:30.210
Then is that worth the sacrifice.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.259
I believe yes because I believe that
the United States

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.309
is an empire of liberty

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:35.429
and that when you show that liberty
the world

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:37.359
that that is a good force for the
United States

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.709
that we should be involved
interminably in every conflict

01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:41.649
no every single conflict you have to
make a cost

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.710
benefit analysis about what is
worthwhile

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.879
and what is not but does morality
play a role in American

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.770
foreign policy.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.319
Sure.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.450
I mean I think that it does

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.469
but again it has to be done on

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:52.359
a case by case basis which is why
foreign policy

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.219
is so murky

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.329
and why you see a lot of folks who
are isolationists before

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.339
they take office suddenly becoming
non isolationist

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.229
as soon as they're in office you see
Barack

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.119
Obama arguing the war in Iraq is
something we totally

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.090
shouldn't get involved in and
suddenly we're bombing Libya.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.379
You see Donald Trump saying the war
in Iraq is the biggest

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.179
disaster in American foreign policy
history

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.370
and suddenly we're bombing Syria
right.

01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:11.469
It's easy to be isolationist

01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:13.539
in a vacuum or to be interventionist
in a vacuum.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.100
It's a very different thing when the
chips are down.

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:25.309
Ben My name's Mitch.

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:27.379
I was just wondering gonna ask you a
question

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.359
about this whole media issue going

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.369
on today where you see easily

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.610
people on Fox News like Lauren
Graham

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.839
get called out for saying Lebron

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.269
has shut up and dribble when yet on

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.129
what I call the left wing even
though they claim their

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.169
objective CNN where you have guys

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:44.329
like Don Lemon saying you know this

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:45.319
is kind of what happens

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.329
with with Kanye when black folk

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:48.769
don't read and write.

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:49.759
Blaming Trump

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.730
and Trump supporters for

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.749
even possibly this bomb bombing

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:55.579
packages and the synagogue

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.009
shooting and yet everyone

01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.449
kind of sees it hears it

01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:00.310
and kind of goes

01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:03.239
you know. But as soon as someone
like on the right like

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.059
Laura Ingram would say something
like

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.309
that it's like oh she should be
boycotted

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.589
protested stepped down fired.

01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:11.700
All right so this stuff I was just
wondering like

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:13.909
Is is there any way for

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:15.829
people to maybe call out people on

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:16.549
the left media.

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:17.589
I mean. Yeah.

01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:19.429
I mean I think we do it on a regular
basis in

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:20.410
the right wing media.

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.579
The left is constantly looking for
excuses to

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:23.359
silence.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.369
And they've been on Laura's trail
for a long

01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:26.779
time. Done the same thing to Mark
Levin.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.189
They've done something Sean Hannity

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.049
and Rush Limbaugh and everybody else
I'm sure they'll

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.760
do it to me.

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:33.310
It's it comes for everybody.

01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:35.599
And then the question is whether
it's legit

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.429
or not. Almost universally it

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:39.319
is not one of the one of the great

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.120
irritants.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.379
I mean I did my entire episode today
on my show

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.299
about this. One of the great
irritants that I see

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.189
right now and something that is
making people

01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:48.169
crazy is the gaslighting where you
where

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.119
you see that they'll call out
rhetoric on one

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.919
side but they won't call out
rhetoric on the other side.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.489
And this this cropped up its ugly
head

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.180
with regard to anti-Semitism

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:58.069
or violent rhetoric where they'll
say well President

01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.809
Trump is responsible for violent
rhetoric

01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:01.839
and that's what caused what happened
in

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.830
in Pittsburgh

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:04.249
and then they'll turn around as
well.

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:05.779
And Don Lemon will literally get on
TV

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.540
and say on national television

01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:09.520
you've never seen a Democrat shoot
anybody.

01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:12.030
And Steve Scalise is over here going
Hello.

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:12.760
Right.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.439
The fact is that the

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.689
inability to objectively measure

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:19.729
the facts because you don't want to
look your own side

01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:21.679
in the face is not good

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.779
for politics. It does happen on both
sides I think

01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:25.699
these days it happens a lot more
frequently on the left

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:26.430
than on the right.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.019
Hi Ben, i just want to say how

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.870
much I appreciate what you do

01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:39.979
and you're the main reason that I
got into

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:40.689
politics.

01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:41.059
I thank you.

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.910
For your thug life compilations.

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:47.739
My question is to do

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.449
with the Conservative Party of
Canada

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:51.279
and just conservatives in general
kind

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.259
of caving in on a lot of views

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.600
such as abortion.

01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:57.990
I don't know other ones

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.989
kind of saying that we need to get
votes

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:04.029
and I'm kind

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:05.949
of caving in on views just just to
get

01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:08.400
votes and cater to to society.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.629
For example it's like get Justin
Trudeau

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:11.610
out of power.

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:13.770
So I just want to know what your
thoughts on

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:14.460
that is.

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.269
I mean we had similar problems in
the United States.

01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:18.630
I'll speak to the analog quick note
on Justin Trudeau

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.189
handsome Bernie Sanders does not
qualify

01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:22.630
to be prime minister of a country.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.889
As I said last night like I'm real
happy

01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:34.669
he's got a six pack

01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:35.260
and all

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.369
but I do not understand what that

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.379
has to do with knowing a single
thing

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.210
about governance.

01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:42.010
As far as.

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:44.530
As far as political parties

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.239
as far as political parties caving
on

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.480
on particular hot button issues

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:52.309
you know I'm never in favor

01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:54.319
of abandoning internal truth for
temporary

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.270
political gain.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.679
And it doesn't seem to work out well
because all that happens

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.969
that the country continues to move
left

01:22:58.970 --> 01:23:00.229
and sooner abandoning more ground

01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:01.360
and more ground and more ground.

01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:03.640
That's particularly true on the life
issue.

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:06.250
There are certain issues where I
feel like.

01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:07.999
A consensus can sort of be reached.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.529
I'll take an example same sex
marriage.

01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:11.689
So as I said I was an advocate.

01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:13.369
So I'm an advocate of traditional
marriage.

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:15.289
I don't believe that same sex

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.269
marriage has the same societal
benefit as

01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:19.270
heterosexual marriage because of
biology

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:21.319
and it's not to say that I don't
think that

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.939
gay people can't live together in
happiness.

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.390
That's fine. But if you're talking
about what benefits society.

01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:27.469
Well marriage was always built
around bearing

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.299
and rearing of children which
obviously is going be a

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.159
lot more common in heterosexual
couples than

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.290
homosexual couples.

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.299
With that said it appeared

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:35.389
to.

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:37.429
Me that what was happening in the
United States that the ground

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:38.170
was shifting

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.069
and folks wanted the government to

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.149
become the great imprimatur for a
virtue.

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.999
And now the government was going to
grant

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.940
same sex marriage. My response to
that was

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.869
here's a better idea Why don't we
just all get out

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:48.700
of this business.

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.469
That's something that I think can
make everybody

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:53.509
happy because when the government
gets out of everybody's

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:55.150
business we all tend to be a little
bit happier.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.460
And then if you want to do what you
want to do at your church.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.279
Totally fine.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.989
Is that me abandoning the
traditional marriage issue.

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:01.879
No it's me acknowledging that the
government is not

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.379
good in a particular area

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.269
and that the social fabric has to be
rebuilt

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:06.610
in a particular area

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.959
and that the social fabric has to be
protected by getting

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960
government out of that realm
entirely.

01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:13.669
I've said the same thing with regard
to things like marijuana

01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:14.590
legalization

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.760
or decriminalization.

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.929
I've never smoked pot in my life I
find it irritating it smells

01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:18.550
terrible.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.410
But.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.069
But with that said the government
sucks at regulating

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:23.530
it at least in the United States.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.449
So that means that maybe the
solution

01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:27.589
is deregulation

01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:29.449
or decriminalization of marijuana

01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:31.780
specifically with the goal of

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.189
allowing folk allowing to find

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:35.260
a certain market level

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:37.159
and then allowing the social fabric
to

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.019
be built around the idea that maybe
smoking

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.140
pot is bad as opposed to just being

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:42.400
basically here's my view.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.749
If the government is last repository
of virtue

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:46.429
there is no last repository of
virtue.

01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:48.769
The government is never going to be
the great guarantor

01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:49.699
of decency or virtue.

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.619
There has to be something under
undergirding

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.740
it or the government has nothing to
stand on.

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.069
Hi Ben. I actually did come dressed

01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:02.480
as Elizabeth Warren today.

01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:08.989
I'm a divorced mom of four

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:11.209
children and because of personal
tragedies

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:13.480
in my life I'm raising two boys

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:15.790
who have a distinct lack of positive

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:17.750
male role models in their life.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.609
And I'm wondering what can women in

01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:21.469
my situation do to

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:23.569
foster a sense of positive male

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:24.400
identity.

01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:26.359
In this climate of

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.009
toxic anti man hate.

01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:29.900
I mean. I do think it's a great
question.

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:36.489
Good good for you for we're number
one.

01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:38.439
Good for you for worrying about that
issue because there are too many

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:38.902
people who don't. I

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:42.210
Think that you have to make an
active

01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:44.409
attempt to find people who you think
are good positive

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.560
male role models and put them in
your son's life.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.539
And I think this is true by the way
even if it were

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.109
a two parent family you want to
surround your kids

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:52.089
with good people who can have a good
influence

01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:54.039
on them. There is a fascinating
study

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.629
about single motherhood in the
United States

01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:57.549
and what actually showed is that the
single best

01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:59.379
predictor of whether somebody was

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:00.219
going to succeed

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.409
or fail was not single

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:04.689
motherhood per say it was actually

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:06.789
the number of single moms in a
particular

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:07.440
area.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.819
Meaning that if you can find a
surrogate father figures

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:10.890
then you did OK.

01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:12.619
If you're living in a heavily
married area

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.739
with a lot of men around to model
particular behavior

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.899
you OK. So there's certain areas

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.999
of life that men male father

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.349
figures still predominate.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:22.440
Sports is obviously a big one.

01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:23.820
Religious Institute.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.899
Excuse me religious institutions are

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:26.980
obviously another big one.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.239
But I don't know whether

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.700
grandparents are in the picture.

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:35.565
or grandfather in the picture, you
can give her back the mic for a

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:35.570
second.

01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:37.610
My father recently passed away.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.148
oh i'm sorry to hear that.

01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:40.259
Her paternal grandfather lives six

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.180
hours away.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.869
would he be- moving is not a
possibility

01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:47.279
and he's not like that.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.469
Dad's side of the family name calls

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.589
a lot. They call the kids retards

01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:52.679
stupid.

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.450
Yeah that's not good.

01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:58.360
But what I would suggest is

01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:00.379
I mean are there men in your life
who you feel

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.200
are would make for good role models.

01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:04.609
Well in my church

01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:06.529
we don't at the ages my kids are out

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.530
they're not around a lot of men.

01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:10.399
But we have male missionaries

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.289
they're 19 to like in their

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:14.419
early 20s. So I have them over for
dinner

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.400
twice a month

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.070
and I try my best.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.079
can your sons be involved in any of
these groups where they're around

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.059
other men who

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.640
can provide a good example for them.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.929
I have been trying to get men

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:29.230
into the children's organization

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.039
that they currently go to activities
for

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.049
and it looks like we will be getting
some male

01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.479
leaders.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.319
And that's great. Well so I mean I
think that the fact

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.339
you're even thinking about it means
that your sons will be OK

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.289
because if you continue to seek this
out you will find

01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:39.670
it.

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.590
So it's big.

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.690
I think the bottom line is good for
you.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.280
I mean because again if.

01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:55.379
Being proactive in seeking good male
role models

01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.669
is absolutely vital for them.

01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:57.509
So again I have nothing

01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:58.709
but praise for you. Thank you for
doing that.

01:27:58.710 --> 01:27:59.400
Thank you.

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.379
So my question is I've seen a lot of
conversations

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.479
break down because of differences in
the importance

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.439
placed on action

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.359
and intent.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.139
focusing on what someone has said

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.330
and know what they mean.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.499
My question is the following When is
it necessary

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.530
to take someone's intentions into
account

01:28:15.570 --> 01:28:16.529
and what are their actions.

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:17.979
All that needs to be considered.

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.979
Okay so my general rule

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.839
and this is something I've tried to
work on also I think we all

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.540
should try and work on it so I'm not
going to

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.019
exempt myself from this category.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.480
I've made mistakes along these
lines.

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.440
There's a there's a Jewish principle
called "Donafkaskus" what

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.839
it means is that you're supposed to
try

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.669
and see everybody in the most
favorable possible

01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:34.490
light. So when somebody says
something

01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:36.419
and it has two possible
interpretations do

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.949
you see it in the worst available
light.

01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:39.899
The one that makes them look the
most racist the most

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.960
terrible the most sexist the most
bigoted.

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.989
Or do you try to read it in the
light where

01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:45.740
you know maybe that's not what they
actually meant

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.939
and when you when you try to view
people

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.069
like that you're likely to have
better conversations

01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:51.989
than when you immediately go to the
character attack which

01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:53.450
is the easier place to go

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.010
and more cynical place to go.

01:28:55.690 --> 01:28:57.800
You know that that I think is is

01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:59.849
the place where intent matters where
intent does not

01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:01.769
matter is when somebody actually
takes an

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:03.629
action to hurt another human being
then

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:05.660
intent does not matter at that
point.

01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:07.979
And if a person does it repeatedly

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.839
then intent certainly doesn't matter
if

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.749
it's an accident as one thing.

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:14.129
But if you're pursuing a policy
publicly

01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:15.419
that has the same impact over

01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.120
and over and over and over you keep

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.019
going for this policy over

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.029
and over and over and over to a
certain point I can't grant

01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:22.460
you that sort of.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.079
License of good of good intent

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.939
as at a certain point your intent
doesn't matter anymore

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.090
to certain point negligence becomes
purpose.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.979
And you know that that I think
requires

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:33.809
repeated action also require we have

01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:36.230
to discuss the severity of the
action being taken.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.249
So first rule of thumb try to treat

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.059
people you know

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.190
with the best of intent.

01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:42.410
Second rule of thumb it's not always
possible.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.649
Well thank you so much.

01:29:44.650 --> 01:29:45.960
I really appreciate your time.

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.543
Ladies and gentlemen Ben Shapiro!
