MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.960
to one more Talks
at Google event.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.880
Today's guest needs no
introduction, virtually.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.720
Today's guest is Yanis
Varoufakis, the former finance

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.860
minister of Greece during one
of the most tumultuous periods

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.310
of its financial history,
if not history overall.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.130
He's a professor
of economic theory

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.730
at the University of
Athens and a former member

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.950
of the parliament.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.100
He is author of "The Global
Minotaur," among other books,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.990
and his newest book
is "And the Weak

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.070
Must Suffer What They Must."

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.380
I would like to
ask Mr. Varoufakis

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.160
to come to the podium here
and share with us thoughts.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.845
Thank you.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.950
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.450
It's a very rare occasion
for a politician,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.170
academic, confused person like
me, to be in a place like this.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.160
I've done it before in
similar organizations,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.460
even though Google
is unique for reasons

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.340
you do not need me to explain.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.470
And I have excellent memories
of trying to bring together

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.940
a techie audience
with my concerns

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.150
about the ways of the world--
in other words, politics.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm going to talk
to you today and try

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.020
to encourage you to participate,
to start a dialogue with me,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.820
on the concept of money.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.480
The purpose is not academic.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.670
It's not to have a philosophical
discussion about money.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.310
It's my view that we live
in a very troubled world--

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.350
that Europe, and that's what
this is about, is, if you want,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.820
the part of the
global economy where

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.000
the troubles of
global capitalism

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.100
manifest themselves in the most
poignant and magnified manner.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.890
And Europe is perfectly capable
of destabilizing the United

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.600
States.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.430
It already has
destabilized China.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
And through China it has
destabilized Latin America.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.950
And if my analysis holds
water, the next generation

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.440
is going to face
challenges that have not

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.494
been faced since the 1930s.

00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:32.660
I hope I'm completely wrong.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.710
But I very much
fear that I'm not.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.590
And money is a very
good starting point

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.700
of a conversation,
especially with an audience

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.040
like your good selves.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.490
The reason is that money is
the most quantifiable variable

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.210
of an economy.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.090
Love, beauty, value-- they're
all supremely important.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.750
But their qualities, any attempt
that we make to quantify them,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.010
devalues them in a sense.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.680
But money comes in as a
result of commodification

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.250
and marketization to turn
values into quantities,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.070
to quantify that which is
considered by the market

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.800
to be valuable.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.010
Now, the reason why I'm
beginning with money

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.280
to tell a story about the
troubles of global capitalism

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.670
and the challenges of
the next generation,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.920
is because if you think of
money as a good, what is a good?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.390
Something people want.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.970
So tomatoes are
good, potatoes are

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.340
good if people want to eat
them, and money is good

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.140
if people want money.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.230
If it is a good, then in a
commodified, capitalist world,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.770
it must also be a commodity.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.650
And of course it is a commodity.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.990
You just look at the
foreign exchange market--

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.920
huge trades every day, money
being exchanged for money.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.150
So money is a good,
and it is a commodity.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.050
So why is its price negative
in more than 40% of the world?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.649
The price of money is
the rate of interest.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:26.050
It's the price one is prepared
to accept for not using money,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.160
for giving it to somebody else.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.250
And we live in a
world, especially

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.530
in Europe, where
the price of money

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.500
is either 0 or extremely,
very low, or indeed,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.360
in places like Japan, in Europe,
and in certain bond markets

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.300
here in the United
States, it is negative.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.110
Now, how can a good
have a negative price?

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.880
It must be a bad by definition.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.300
Negative prices are
associated with bads.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.380
So you have toxic
waste in your backyard,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.890
you're prepared to pay
someone to get rid of it.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.700
That's what negative
price means.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.410
So how can it be that money
could have a negative price?

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.290
Well, the reason is that
money is not just a quantity.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.940
It is not just a commodity.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.410
It is a lot more than that.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.680
A 19th century
revolutionary referred to it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.540
as the alienated
ability of humankind.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.340
That was Karl Marx, by the way.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.470
But forget Marx, since
we are in California.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.406
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:35.910
And not in Vermont,
which I believe

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.950
is the people's
republic of this era,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.420
or New Hampshire or
something like that.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:52.570
Let's think of the reason why
the price of money in Europe

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.890
today is negative, and why
it is almost 0 if you look

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.050
at the Fed's overnight rates.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:07.520
If you are an entrepreneur,
and you're tossing and turning

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.130
in bed at night, mulling
over and wondering

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.340
as to whether you should
invest in a new production

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.890
line, a new company, a
new product, a new line

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.430
of products, what
is it that you are

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.420
worried about at that moment?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.760
You're worried about
whether that investment will

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.610
turn a proper return out.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.970
And what will this depend on?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.180
It will depend on two things.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.030
It will depend on
your costs, and it

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.690
will depend on the
demand for the commodity

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.680
that your production
line will be churning out

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.244
six months, eight months,
a year from the moment you

00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:48.660
make the investment, if you
choose to make the investment.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.860
So the price of money,
the rate of interest,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.400
is an input into the costs.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.760
So the higher the price of
money, the more costly money

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.150
is to borrow or to utilize for
the purpose of your investment.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.930
So you think, OK,
so this is where

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.619
it works like a commodity.

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:08.160
When its price comes
down, you think,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.260
OK, my costs are coming down,
so my propensity to invest

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.560
increases.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.670
But that is not what keeps
entrepreneurs awake at night,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.240
and potential investors.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.920
What really keeps
them awake at night

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.310
is the prospect of sufficient
demand for the commodity

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.800
six months, one year later.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.840
And what does this depend on?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.850
That depends on whether
others like herself

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.670
or himself who are also turning
and tossing in bed at night

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.150
will make the
decision to invest,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.300
because the aggregate
level of demand

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.720
is driven by the aggregate
level of investment.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.740
So this is a problem
that suddenly moves out

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.370
of the standard
conception of money

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.150
as a commodity that has a
price like potatoes that

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.340
have a price, because
with potatoes, if you have

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.045
excess supply of potatoes,
you are selling potatoes,

00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:06.420
and you want to get rid of
them before the end of the day

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.670
because you don't want to
sell the same stale potatoes

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.880
tomorrow, what do you
do to get rid of them?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.860
You reduce the price,
and at some point

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.610
you will hit a
level of price that

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.730
will clear the market--
the market, your stalls.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.950
People will just buy it.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.920
If you drop it at
$0.02 a ton, people

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.030
will just-- so there is a
price which clears the market.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:31.190
But the investment game
that I just described

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.980
is precisely that.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.679
It is a game.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.950
And what is a game?

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.250
It is a situation where
the outcome does not

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.059
depend on what you do, but
it depends on what others do,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.850
and what you think that
they think that you

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.260
think that they will do.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.130
That's what a game
is, like in chess,

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.910
like in the stock exchange.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.640
So suddenly, whether
you invest or not

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.450
depends on your
belief or optimism

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.800
that the level of
aggregate investment

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.850
will exceed a certain threshold,
because only if it exceeds

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.220
a certain threshold,
only then will there

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.400
be enough demand to make
your investment profitable.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.180
So the way I-- when I
was still a professor,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.600
the way I tried to explain this
to students, especially MBA

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.220
students who are
cutthroat and try

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.940
to undermine each
other like there's

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.730
no tomorrow-- I remember
I used to love doing that.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.630
It was great fun for
me, not for them.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:31.760
I used to say to them, you know
what, I hate marking scripts,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.450
so I'm going to give
you your grade now,

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.744
day one, first lecture.

00:09:35.744 --> 00:09:37.660
I'm going to give you
this semester grade now,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.330
and then we can meet for the
purposes of your education

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.570
and mine.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.810
Just take a piece of paper
out, write your student number,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:51.200
and I want you to add a number,
a digit between 1 and 9,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.850
including 1 and 9.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.340
And your grade
will be as follows.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.010
I will pick up this
piece of paper.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.600
I would find the piece of paper
with the lowest integer choice.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.475
That will be the common
factor of all of you.

00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:04.860
I will multiply this by 11.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.760
And for each one of you, I will
subtract from that 11 times

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.960
the minimum your own choice.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.680
And that will be
your grade, which

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.020
means that if everybody chose
9, the minimum would be 9,

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.260
99, 9 times 11, would be the
common factor for everyone,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.650
minus 9, their own
choice-- 90% everyone.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.230
If everybody chose
eight, 80% everyone.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.509
If everybody chose
one, 10% everyone, OK.

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:29.550
Now I can tell you, every
single time I did this,

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:36.220
the vast majority chose
1 and everybody failed.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.281
And this is not the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:40.530
It's not a free rider problem.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.990
It's not a situation
where you want to cheat,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.740
you want others to
choose a high number

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.800
and for you to
choose a low number.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.749
Why?

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:49.290
Because if you choose
the low number,

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.350
then the minimum goes
low, and you lose, too.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:58.640
Here is a typical
coordination problem.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.372
Everybody's trying
to do the following--

00:11:01.372 --> 00:11:03.330
the optimal strategy, by
the way, in this game,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.160
is to choose what you
think the minimum will

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.337
be amongst the rest
and choose that.

00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:11.420
So if you think that
everybody else will choose 9,

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.420
you're best off choosing
9, because if you choose 8,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.030
the minimum becomes
8 and you lose, too.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.650
If you choose the minimum
will be 8, you choose 8.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.094
So it's a guessing game.

00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:22.760
Everybody's trying
to guess the minimum.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:31.410
And what they in the end do
depends on the average degree

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.600
of optimism.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.450
If the class is optimistic
that people will be optimistic,

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.600
that everybody else
will be optimistic,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.460
then they all choose 9,
confirming the optimism

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.090
that they imagined
would be prevalent.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.660
But if they're pessimistic,
they will all--

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.680
I remember, I would pick
out one of those students,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.520
and I would say to
them, OK, you chose 1.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.536
Why did you choose 1?

00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:58.340
Don't you realize by choosing
1, you fail and everybody fails?

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.550
And the answer is,
yes, but you know what?

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.910
It is a rational
belief, prediction,

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.410
to think that there will be at
least one person in this room

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.720
who fears that there is another
person in this room who fears

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.680
that there is someone in
this room who will choose 1,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.090
because then, 1 will
be the minimum choice,

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.984
and then I'm best off, given
that 1 will be the best

00:12:20.984 --> 00:12:22.900
choice, to choose 1,
because if I choose more,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.566
than you will be
subtracting more than 1

00:12:24.566 --> 00:12:27.000
from the common factor.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.240
Now that is the
conundrum of investment.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.260
If investors fear that the
level of investment will be low,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.760
then the level of
investment will be low.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.190
And their pessimistic
expectations

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.870
are going to be confirmed.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.960
And they will turn
around and say, see?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.600
I was right.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.240
But that doesn't
mean they were right.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.020
It means that we live in a
world of multiple equilibria--

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.480
some good-- 9, 8,
7, in the example

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.460
that I gave you,
some awful-- 1, 2, 3.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:00.400
And courtesy of
being equilibria,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.645
there is no one outcome
which is more equilibrium

00:13:03.645 --> 00:13:04.270
than the other.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.040
They are all equilibria.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.180
Some are better.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.174
Some are worse.

00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:09.590
What determines
whether we go from

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:15.760
the good to the bad, or vice
versa-- average optimism.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.630
This is a problem with
recessions that turn

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.160
into permanent depressions.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.130
This is a problem when
investment is completely stuck.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.410
Have you noticed that in
the United States today,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.840
we have the following very
interesting phenomenon,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.406
and very worrying phenomenon.

00:13:34.406 --> 00:13:39.120
We have extremely low rates of
interest, extremely high profit

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.950
rates, and very low
levels of investment.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.690
How is this possible?

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.480
There rate of interest should
be in equilibrium, more or less

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.630
the same, as the rate of profit.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.716
The rate of profit
should reflect the rate

00:13:54.716 --> 00:13:55.840
of interest and vice versa.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.180
If the two are out
of kilter, it means

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.710
we have a major incongruity.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.100
Something is broken
in our economy.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.410
And if profit rates are
high, why don't people

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.740
invest to make more profit?

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.230
And yet they don't.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.950
The example I gave you with
the failure of optimism I think

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.834
offers an answer.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:20.250
At the moment, we
have a situation

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:26.940
where if you take the United
States, Europe, and Britain--

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.390
the British, some of
them like to be thought

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.690
of as outside of Europe--
so effectively, Europe

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.460
and the United States, we
have, the last time I looked,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.970
around $6 trillion
doing nothing--

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.950
sloshing around in the financial
sector, not being invested,

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.021
refusing to be invested.

00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:46.520
Why?

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.160
It's not that those who own that
money do not want to invest it.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.700
And by the way, by investment,
I mean real investment.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.150
I don't mean buying
houses and buying shares.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.310
That's not investment.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.940
Investment is when
your company says,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.887
OK, we're going to expand
this particular sector,

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:06.470
we're going to invest
in people, we're

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.928
going to invest in
machinery, we're

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:09.530
going to invest
in new technology.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.280
That's investment.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.540
So one thinks of capitalism as
a system where you have savings.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.890
You have financial
intermediaries

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.670
that take those savings
and lend them to companies

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.940
that then invest it.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.380
Those investments
produce the incomes that

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.450
then replenish the savings.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.220
And this recycling
process continues.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.240
But at the moment, savings
in the developed world,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.340
let's put it this way, exceeds
investment by 7 trillion.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.150
Never before in the
history of capitalism

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.330
have we had such high
levels of savings

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.710
and such low levels
of investment.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.540
If you think of the
rate of interest

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.080
as the price of money that
must equilibrate savings

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.610
and investment, when there is
excess supply of money, when

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.020
savings is there and investment
is there, there must--

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.030
what happens is
the price of money

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.840
must drop so that this happens.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.230
Except the price of
money drops to below 0,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.580
and this gap is not
ameliorated, doesn't go away.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.630
And why doesn't it go away?

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.290
Let's go back to the bedroom
of the entrepreneur who is

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.870
tossing and turning at night.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.690
And let's say that this is a
very old-fashioned entrepreneur

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.220
like me.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.640
I'm not an entrepreneur,
but I'm old-fashioned

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.640
because I listen to
the radio at night

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.710
when I can't sleep, to
the BBC World Service

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.580
since I was a kid,
for some reason.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.980
And 3 in the morning, tossing
and turning, wondering, shall

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.320
I invest, shall I not invest?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.410
And suddenly the
news comes through,

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.060
Janet Yellen is
reversing the tapering.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.900
Instead of increasing
interest rates

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.700
as she has announced
that she will do,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.670
she's going to reduce it even
further, because of China,

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.740
because of sluggish growth,
blah, blah, blah, blah-- things

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.630
you read in the Wall Street
Journal and Financial Times

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.330
on a daily basis.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.920
What do you think at that point?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.030
Oh, good, the price of
money is going further

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.900
into negative territory
and we'll invest,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.660
or do you think
what I think you'll

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.520
think-- oh my goodness,
for Janet to be doing this,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.880
things must be really bad.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:21.190
And then the drop in the price
of money makes you do what?

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.621
Stop investing.

00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:24.579
So it does exactly the
opposite of what happens

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.704
in the market for potatoes.

00:17:25.704 --> 00:17:27.770
In the market for potatoes,
the price comes down

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.560
and the excess
supply disappears.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.710
In the money market, when we're
caught in a crisis like this,

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.190
the price of money comes down,
and the problem gets worse.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.860
And the excess supply
of money gets worse.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.810
And this is why we are caught
up in this never-ending crisis

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.780
after 2008.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.250
The United States
has stabilized itself

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.260
through the
activities of the Fed,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.870
but this incongruity between
savings and investment

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.720
has not gone away.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.450
This is why you have stagnant
wages, and this is why,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.710
after a whole generation
in the United States after

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.900
the mid-'70s-- so for the
first time in the history

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.080
of the United States,
the end of the escalator,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.200
between federation, between
independence of the United

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.640
States and 1974, wages
constantly increased.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.240
Every generation knew
that the next generation

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.440
will be better off.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.310
From 1973 onwards, median
wages have been declining,

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.520
and they have not stopped
declining ever since.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.610
Consumerism was boosted
in the '80s '90s and 2000s

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.000
because of debt.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.270
Increases in wages that
stopped were replaced

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.210
by increases in indebtedness.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.750
In 2008, our comeuppance came.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.440
The nemesis followed for
the hubris-- foreclosures,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.360
since then stagnant wages,
skyrocketing inequality.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.620
And the result is
Donald Trump in America.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.050
In Europe we have
even worse phenomena.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.040
We have the Nazis in
the Greek parliament.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.880
We have the Alternative
for Deutschland in Germany.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.510
We have the Popular
Front in France.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.950
We have UKIP in Britain.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.530
The list is endless.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.010
But these are just, in my view,
symptoms of this conundrum

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.384
that we're facing.

00:19:23.384 --> 00:19:26.420
Now, many people, especially
here in the United States,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.610
tend to think that,
ah, problem is the Fed.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.260
The problem is too
much easy money.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:40.980
The problem is that we have lost
control of the money supply,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.000
that we ended the gold standard.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.880
Instead of having a real
commodity whose supply

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.030
is controlled by
nature, we allowed

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.070
the Fed to be creating easy
money before the crisis,

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.890
easy money after the
crisis, and there

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.430
is a loss of credibility
of the money markets.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.120
This is all nonsense,
allow me to say.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.000
There reason is very simple.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.720
There can be no such
thing as a gold standard.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.020
There can be no such
thing as apolitical money.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.520
And I've already
explained, I think,

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.750
why-- the story about
optimism, because the moment

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.950
pessimism prevails-- and it
can be prevail for any reason,

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.840
for any reason.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.930
There can be some earthquake.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.920
There can be a bubble bursting
in some subprime market,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.030
or in some particular
money market.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.780
There are all sorts of
different candidates

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.980
to spearhead a
degree of pessimism

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.500
in a boisterous, dynamic,
capitalist economy.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.040
But the moment the
seeds of pessimism

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.730
begin to grow and turn
into an ugly plant,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.930
at that moment, the
only thing you can do

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.300
is not reduce interest rates.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.450
It's not go through
a deflationary spasm

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.440
by reducing prices, price
of money, price of labor,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.672
cheapening things that you
want to increase the supply of.

00:21:07.672 --> 00:21:09.380
The only thing you
could do at that point

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.580
is to intervene politically
through a political mechanism

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.370
of effectively creating--
expanding the money supply,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.251
on the one hand, and
expanding public investment

00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:20.000
on the other hand.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.435
This is a New Deal idea.

00:21:21.435 --> 00:21:23.020
It's a very simple idea.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.660
It didn't work
perfectly in the 1930s,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.006
but I can assure
you-- assure you.

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:29.660
I would like to convince
you, if I had another lecture

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.690
to talk about that,
that it prevented

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.410
the slide of the United
States into fascism.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.840
If it wasn't for the New
Deal, "The Grapes of Wrath,"

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.670
Steinbeck, would have
led to the emergence

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.850
of extremely nasty political
forces in this country.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.350
It's even debatable
whether the United States

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:52.330
would side with the Allies
against Nazism in Europe.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:58.466
So the idea that our criticism,
very justifiable criticism

00:21:58.466 --> 00:22:00.215
of the authorities,
of the establishment--

00:22:00.215 --> 00:22:04.300
and remember, I'm a left
winger, so I'm the last person

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.380
to defend the established
way of doing things.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.490
But the idea that
somehow we will

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.420
find a technical fix, whether
you call this bitcoin,

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.920
or some technological
evolution of money that

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.400
will replace the fiat money
that the European Central

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.850
Bank, and so on, print--
this is simple fantasy.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.990
And let me just make
the simple point

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.220
that if you imagine that you
take the bitcoin story, which

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.450
is a digital version
of the gold standard,

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.620
you tie the quantity of money
to some apolitical process--

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.940
in the case of gold, to
how much gold you can find

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.300
under the surface of the earth.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.900
In the case of bitcoin,
to some algorithm

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.871
invented by somebody with
a Japanese pseudonym.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.930
If you do that, then you
ensure two things-- firstly,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.680
that economic
development is going

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.000
to be slower than it would
be otherwise long term,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.840
simply because at some point,
development will exceed--

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.270
or growth, the rate of growth,
will exceed the rate of growth

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.380
of the money supply.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.920
When that happens,
this is immediately

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.930
going to have a
deflationary effect.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.590
So there will be
less money chasing

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.070
after more goods, so the
prices are going to have

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.260
a natural tendency to fall.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.430
And the moment you introduce
deflationary expectations

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.860
in the mindset of consumers,
investors, producers

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.440
and so on and so
forth, suddenly you

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.291
have a diminution in investment.

00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:40.790
Why?

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.310
Because if you
know that something

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.840
that today costs 10
tomorrow will cost 9,

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.780
you will have a natural
tendency to delay consumption.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.650
And therefore, if
investors think

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.220
that you will have a natural
tendency to reduce consumption,

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.970
they will have a natural
tendency to reduce investment.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.500
So that starts a downward
deflationary spiral,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.155
even if it isn't very acute.

00:24:03.155 --> 00:24:04.030
So that's one reason.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.410
The second reason is,
when there is a crisis--

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.100
and crises will always happen.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.550
They are to capitalism that
which hell is to Christianity--

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.170
unpleasant but essential.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.054
The system doesn't
work otherwise.

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:17.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:23.110
You're going to end up with
a crisis and no capacity

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.140
to boost money supply in
order to create liquidity

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.940
by which to fight
the insolvencies that

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.210
are as a result of the crisis.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.660
Of course, what we
have been doing,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.145
the quantitative easing
of the central banks,

00:24:41.145 --> 00:24:44.376
which began in Japan
in the 1990s, then

00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:47.240
was transferred here
in the United States,

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.810
with Ben Bernanke
responding aggressively

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.750
by increasing the money supply
for the purposes of what

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.340
I suggested.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:00.670
And now, Europe always comes
four years too late-- doing it

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.782
in Europe now.

00:25:01.782 --> 00:25:03.240
The problem with
this is that, yes,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.490
it is a palliative for
the crashing economy,

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:13.110
the global crashing economy,
but it's only a palliative.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.680
It's like giving aspirin
to somebody who's suffering

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.280
from a far worse disease.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.280
It helps, but this
doesn't cure it.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.490
And the central
bankers know that.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.280
So there's been a failure of
the politicians to get together

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.950
and to support the central
banks with the only thing that

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.610
can be the silver bullet that
kills the pessimism-- the New

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:35.920
Deal idea.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:41.760
So the point I'm trying to raise
here in the heart of the tech

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.890
industry, here in
Google, is that money

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.770
seems like a quantity.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.820
People like you think, OK,
quantity, technical solutions,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.920
mathematics.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.680
Anything that is quantified
must be a mathematical problem

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.220
which we can solve without
the messiness of politics.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.570
But my message to you is that
money is not just a quantity.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.850
It's also a quality that has
to do with human sentiment--

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.320
the optimism that I was
referring to, which cannot be

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.950
quantified.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.120
You remember the game that I
was playing with my students,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.770
or I was forcing
upon my students,

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.800
doesn't have a solution.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.520
It has multiple solutions.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.122
And when you don't have--
when everything is possible,

00:26:27.122 --> 00:26:30.590
when every outcome is
a potential solution

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.010
to the mathematical
model, then effectively

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.270
it is as if you don't know.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.290
Imagine a meteorological
model, which

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.520
reports that tomorrow there is
an equal probability of rain,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.740
hail, or shine.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.800
It may be
mathematically accurate,

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.760
but it is useless for the
purposes of prediction.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.000
So the technology and the
mathematics cannot substitute

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.990
for the political process
which is necessary in order

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:59.760
to stabilize a debt deflationary
global economy or national

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.680
economy or economic bloc like
that of the European Union.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.390
Of course, I am a great advocate
of technological solutions

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.120
as long as we do not replace
politics with technology,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.430
as long as we fuse the
politics, progressive politics,

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.340
with good technologies.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.980
And let me just give you
one example of something

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.940
that I was planning to do in the
ministry of finance in Greece,

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.170
and maybe get some
feedback from you.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:37.590
In Europe, the reason Europe
is such a basket case--

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.700
think about it.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.310
2008 happened, unemployment
rose both in Europe in America

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.760
to 12%.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.860
You're down to 5
and 1/2 percent.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.650
In Europe we're at 12%.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.150
We still have deflation.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.680
Investment is the
lowest it's ever been.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.800
Why is this?

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.710
Well, if you look
at the eurozone,

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.400
the collection of
countries, of 19 countries

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.880
using the same currency
but without having

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.420
even a confederacy,
let alone a federation,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.900
we created an astonishing
economic system.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.010
We have a large central
bank, like the Fed,

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.840
but no state next to it
or behind it, no treasury.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.980
And we have lots and
lots, 19 governments,

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.570
without central banks.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:32.330
So you can imagine why, when
the force, the full blast

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:37.220
of the 2008 financial disaster,
hit both America and Europe,

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.150
America had the
automatic stabilizers--

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.150
not clever politicians.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.850
Politicians could all
be asleep, or they

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.490
could have all been on holiday.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.800
The beauty of the federal system
is in automatic stabilizers.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.640
It goes into operation
without anyone knowing it.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.600
So for instance, when Nevada
went under, the banks of Nevada

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.526
were salvaged
immediately by the FDIC,

00:28:58.526 --> 00:29:00.580
not by the state
government of Nevada

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.730
going to Paris and to
Berlin and to Washington cap

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.310
in hand begging for
funds to save its banks.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.190
Similarly, when the
level of unemployment

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.880
increased in Nevada because
construction workers were

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.410
unemployed following the
collapse of the real estate

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.070
market, it was Social
Security that immediately,

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.070
from the federal budget,
supplemented that.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.360
So the state of
Nevada did not die.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.510
If it was operating
as Europe does,

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.320
it would have been a
Greece-- insolvent,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.070
with insolvent banks,
constantly cap in hand

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:38.250
seeking more extend and
pretending Ponzi loans.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.450
So in Europe we
have this situation.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.830
Given that we had
this situation,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.790
we needed, and I think
every eurozone member

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.770
state, except perhaps Germany,
needs more degrees of freedom,

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.500
more fiscal space.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.800
So here is an idea
that I had on how

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.760
to create more
fiscal space, even

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.260
though we don't
have a central bank,

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.680
and we were locked
out of money markets

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.110
because our state was bankrupt.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.740
So this is how we did it.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.930
This was an idea I had, and then
we reached the implementation

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.750
to the level where
we were almost ready,

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.190
three or four days away
from pressing the button

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:24.360
and actually starting
the system up.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.091
The tax office,
the IRS, our IRS,

00:30:29.091 --> 00:30:31.720
has of course a website
where you go in there,

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.380
you have your tax file number,
your Social Security number,

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.380
you go in there, you see
how much money you owe,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.260
and you do transfer using web
banking from your bank account

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.450
to the state, like everywhere.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:48.000
The idea was to create a reserve
account per tax file number.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.870
And when the state-- the
state owes a lot of money

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.620
to a lot of people,
because it's bankrupt,

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.080
including its own citizens.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.070
So companies that sell
drugs, pharmaceuticals,

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.534
or general suppliers
of the state,

00:31:00.534 --> 00:31:01.950
it takes 18 months
before they get

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.560
paid because of the lack of
liquidity of the Greek state.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.390
So I was thinking,
OK, imagine we

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.650
can say to the
entrepreneurs, we owe you

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.850
a million dollars from drugs
you sold to the hospital.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.060
You can wait for 18 months,
or I can put this money

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.330
in your reserve account now.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.790
Just type it.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:25.120
It's just 0s and 1s that go
into this reserve account.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.640
And I give you a PIN number.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.890
Of course, you can't
take this money out,

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.350
because I don't
have a central bank

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.790
and I don't have the right
to monetize anything.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:37.430
But I can give you a PIN
number, and you may owe money

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:41.337
to another of your suppliers,
and using that PIN number,

00:31:41.337 --> 00:31:43.170
you can transfer it to
that tax file number,

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.780
and then the third
party can use this money

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.810
to repay its taxes to me.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.350
Or you can give it
to your workers.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.230
It can be an alternative.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.580
It's euro denominated,
or dollar denominated

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.520
if this happened here,
it's euro denominated,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.700
so it's not another
currency, but it

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:10.160
uses-- it's tax-backed liquidity
that is created through the tax

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:10.660
system.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.050
And the idea here was
to take it further.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.500
Even in good times, when the
state doesn't have a liquidity

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:23.740
problem, to use the same
system, but differently, to say

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.150
to people, the state
doesn't owe you any money,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.890
but if you want us to put some
money in that reserve account,

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.600
we will do it.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.600
Give me $1,000, or
euros, and I'll do it.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.580
Now, why would you want
to give me 1,000 euros?

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.710
You wouldn't.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.001
Why entrust the state
with 1,000 euros when

00:32:43.001 --> 00:32:45.250
you don't owe the state
anything and the state doesn't

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.083
owe anything to you?

00:32:46.083 --> 00:32:49.510
Well, you will have to pay
tax next year, won't you?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.190
You have a car.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.090
You have a house.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.280
You have sales tax,
or you may have

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.420
to pay income tax-- all sorts
of different taxes and charges.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.970
Well, what if I were to say
to you that, because this

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.810
is digital, it can
be time stamped,

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.570
and the system knows that
if you've kept this money,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.730
you purchased it from me,
you transferred real euros

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.600
to the state and I put these
numbers in your reserve

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.490
account, time stamped,
in a year's time

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.870
I'll give you 10%
off for extinguishing

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:22.090
taxes-- 10% of an
interest rate in this day

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.412
and age is humongous.

00:33:24.412 --> 00:33:28.247
And this is a way
that the state-- this

00:33:28.247 --> 00:33:29.830
is peer to peer
lending for the state,

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.960
between the citizens
and the state,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.460
bypassing the bond markets.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.980
And then you could
develop it further.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.820
You could have an
app that allows

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.920
you to go to the supermarket
and use this to pay for things

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.630
given that the
supermarket will be

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.080
able to use this for
its own suppliers

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.526
and to repay its own taxes.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.630
So this is, if you want, a
parallel payment system, which

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.990
is purely digital, and which
gives more degrees of freedom

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.330
to a fiscally stressed
entity, whether this

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.990
is a municipality, a
country in the eurozone,

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.850
whatever, or even
a community that

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.260
wants to develop its own
payment system, parallel payment

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.690
system, that is denominated in
the same currency as the nation

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.370
or the bloc.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:20.260
Now I had, of course,
an additional incentive

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.280
for doing this.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.480
When a guy called Alexis
Tsipras, who then became

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.130
my prime minister, started
talking to me years

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:34.810
ago about-- at that time I
had no intention, no interest,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.469
no inkling that I would ever
get involved in politics.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.639
I was just talking
to him because he

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:44.604
wanted to try out some ideas.

00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:48.250
He asked me, I remember,
back in 2012, 2013,

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:52.320
because at that time the little
political party that he led

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.380
had 4%, and it was three
years later that we went up

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.250
from 4 to 40% and won government
on the 25th of January

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.020
last year, 2015.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.137
He said to me, if we
challenge the creditors

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:07.970
and we say to them that
the policies they're

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:11.600
imposing upon us are killing the
cow that is supposed to produce

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.740
the milk that they want, so it's
in their interest not to kill

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.260
the cow, our country, our
economy, our taxpayers,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.230
our private sector, and
to reboot this agreement,

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.540
what do you think the first
challenge we will face

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.410
is going to be?

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.420
And I was very clear on this.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.975
I told him-- I wrote him
a memo back in 2012, 2013.

00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:33.600
I said the first
thing that will happen

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.740
is they will close our banks
down, or they will try to,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.900
in order to throttle us,
in order to asphyxiate us,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.490
to force us to retreat.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:48.370
By the way, let me just
now go to the future,

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.290
or to the more recent past.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.110
I became the minister
of finance on the 27th.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.500
We won the election on
the 25th of January.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.300
I became minister
of finance the 27th.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.920
On the 30th, three long
days afterwards-- oh,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.510
by the way, another
embedded story.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.550
The first day I
moved in on the 27th,

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.750
I convened a meeting of the
treasury officials to ask them

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.130
the pressing question,
what's our funding like?

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:17.190
The answer was, minister,
we're not doing very badly.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.410
And I said, OK,
define not very badly.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.712
We have 11 days
before we default.

00:36:22.712 --> 00:36:24.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.140
Now, that is a very
inauspicious beginning

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.640
to a ministerial career
for a minister of finance.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.930
So that happened the 27th.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:38.450
Two days later, I had the
president of the Eurogroup--

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:43.400
the Eurogroup is the
body of finance ministers

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.954
of the eurozone, as well as
what we call the troika--

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:48.370
Christine Lagarde, representing
the International Monetary

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.860
Fund, Mario Draghi, the
president of the European

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:56.270
Central Bank, our Fed, and the
representatives of the European

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.770
Commission.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.420
The president of this
body, a gentleman

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.470
called Jeroen
Dijsselbloem, the finance

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:06.060
minister of the Netherlands,
came to see me in my office.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:10.370
And lo and behold,
it was as if on cue.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:14.750
We had several meetings
with minders and assistants

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.370
and all that bureaucratic,
boring stuff,

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.220
and then the fun was when we
met together in my office, just

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.730
the two of us, tete-a-tete
to get to know each other.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.100
Instead of nice to meet
you, let's work together,

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.050
I got the following--
what do you

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.050
intend to do with the program.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.860
That's almost science
fiction, the program.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.870
The program is all
the economic policies

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.720
that were being applied
between 2000 and 2015, which

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.550
led to the loss of 1/3--
1/3-- of GDP, of nominal GDP

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.430
in Greece.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:52.780
That's worse than the
1930s in the United States.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.400
So this program
is the reason why

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.030
we were elected, because the
Greek people had enough of it,

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:01.070
and we were elected
to renegotiate it.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.480
And I tried to be as moderate
as I could, and I said to him,

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.500
look, we were elected to
challenge this program.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.390
But, of course,
this is a program

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:16.582
that the rest of the European
Union is committed to.

00:38:16.582 --> 00:38:18.040
So what happens in
a democracy when

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.850
you have two principles that
clash, two programs that clash?

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.580
You sit down and you
find a compromise.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.670
So why don't we sit down
and start with a clean sheet

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.620
and ask ourselves a very
simple question-- how

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.280
can we help the Greek
economy recover in such a way

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:38.450
as to allow the Greek people to
regain hope and the creditors

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.210
to get some of their money back,
because the way we're going,

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.140
there will be no
money for you guys,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.350
simply because the
country will be dead.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.590
We will have created
a desert and called it

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.895
peace-- Tacitus, Roman Empire.

00:38:51.895 --> 00:38:56.440
And the answer
was, if you insist

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.170
on renegotiating the
program, your banks will be

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.410
closed by the 28th of February.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.950
That was on the 30th of January.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.930
So what I had said
to Tsipras in 2012,

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.406
'13 happened on the third day.

00:39:11.406 --> 00:39:13.030
In the end, they
closed the banks down,

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.660
and they overthrew
our government,

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.620
but this is not for
you Googlers here.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:23.770
But I'm trying to explain,
remember the payment system,

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.180
the digital parallel payment
system that I was planning?

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.900
This was also a way of
creating a system that

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.640
would be functional and
operative if they close

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.450
the banks down,
giving us a capacity

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.960
to maintain a
semblance of normality

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.510
in the economy, a
system of transactions

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.870
that would survive.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.270
So the only reason
I'm mentioning this

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.660
is not only because
it's, I think, topical,

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:56.240
but because it speaks to
what I was saying before,

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.380
that I believe that
technological solutions,

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.420
digitization of money,
is the way to go,

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.050
but calling upon
you not to fall prey

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.260
to the fantasy of apolitical
money, to the fantasy

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:13.186
that technology can take
the politics out of money.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:23.920
In this book, I mention
a scene from the House

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.730
of Commons,
Britain's parliament,

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:30.270
where a woman that I
spent my youth despising

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.110
and demonstrating
again and again

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:36.960
and again against,
Mrs. Margaret Thatcher,

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:44.880
a very right-wing politician--
nevertheless, a politician who

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.610
on the last day of her
prime ministership,

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.550
the day she was fired
by her own cabinet--

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:56.350
there was a coup d'etat within
the cabinet orchestrated

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.100
by ministers who wanted
Britain to join the euro.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:04.322
And Thatcher was opposing
them tooth and nail,

00:41:04.322 --> 00:41:05.280
and they overthrew her.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.260
So it became clear to her during
the cabinet meeting of that day

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.660
that she was out.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.190
People who were in
the room, I have

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.640
friends-- one friend
who was in the room

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.640
told me that it was the first
time ever that she shed a tear.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.840
She was visibly-- the
Iron Lady cracked.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.024
But then she regained her
poise and went to the House.

00:41:28.024 --> 00:41:29.190
She was still prime minster.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:34.380
And there was a scheduled
prime minister's question time.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.295
But of course, the
news had spread

00:41:36.295 --> 00:41:37.420
that this was her last one.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.930
And she let rip.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:45.110
She allowed herself to enjoy
her last appearance in the House

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.160
of Commons as a prime minister.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.500
And a question from
the opposition,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.250
a very silly question
from the opposition,

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:56.640
who tried to undermine her and
to split the Conservative party

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.520
between those who wanted
to go into the euro

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.790
and who didn't,
like Thatcher, was

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:05.590
what did she think
about-- why was she

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:09.070
opposed to the idea of
a central bank which

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.370
is outside the political
process, the European Central

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.250
Bank, depoliticizes
Europe's money,

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:19.110
and allows Europe to
unite in a monetary union

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.980
without money being in
the hands of politicians?

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.720
And this right-wing
politician at moment

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.070
said something that really
appealed to me, and still does.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.480
I think it was probably the most
prescient and correct statement

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.930
on money by any European
politician of the last 30

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.160
years.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.930
That doesn't mean that I agree
with everything else she did.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.410
I still am proud that I
opposed her government,

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.340
that I joined every
demonstration I

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.650
could find against her.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:52.190
She said, who controls
interest rates, who

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.020
controls monetary
policy in Europe,

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.550
controls the politics of Europe.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.300
That cannot be changed
with technology.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:04.550
But a new form of
progressive politics,

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:09.900
together with a new
technological, innovative

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.990
approach to digitizing money
and creating parallel systems

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:19.200
for payment, that give
maximum degrees of freedom

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.150
to regional governments, to
municipalities, to communities,

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.940
is, I think, the way to go.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:34.470
And allow me to finish up
by saying that this idea has

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.000
to have a global manifestation.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.730
In 1944, somewhere in New
Hampshire, Bretton Woods,

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:51.860
there was this conference
of 150 delegates that

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:57.170
designed the postwar
global plan, as I call it,

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.990
the Bretton Woods system,
as it has come to be known,

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:03.890
to which I devote a couple
of chapters in the book.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:10.900
The idea there was to create a
monetary system that is global,

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.820
with a surplus
recycling mechanism very

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.610
similar to the idea
of the New Deal,

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:23.110
but applied at a global level--
a system which would find ways

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:27.780
of taking the surpluses from
the regions in which they are

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.400
produced and recycling them
as productive investments

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.100
in the regions that
are in deficit.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.850
This is what happens
in the United States.

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:39.840
When Boeing gets a contract
to build a new fighter jet,

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.100
the stipulation is
that, yes, but we

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.710
have to have a
greenfield factory built

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.170
in Arizona or in
Missouri, in a state which

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.130
is depressed-- not out of
philanthropy towards Missouri,

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:55.930
but that is the only way
of ensuring that California

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.960
and Washington state will
continue to have their surplus,

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.400
if incomes are being
produced in Missouri

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.690
through technologically
advanced work that produces

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:09.230
both skills and income, so
that the income of Missouri

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.940
can continue to produce the
net exports within the dollar

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.550
zone of California
and Washington state.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:18.450
Now, unless we find
a way of returning

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:24.000
to the spirit of Bretton Woods,
hopefully using technologies

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.180
for a digital accounting
system, a digital payments

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.670
mechanism that would penalize
both surpluses and deficits

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.410
and redistribute
surpluses in order

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.850
to ameliorate for the gross
imbalances between savings

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.470
and investment at
the global scale,

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.920
we are not going to be
facing the challenges

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.070
that the next
generation is facing,

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.650
both here and in Europe.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.816
Thank you.

00:45:47.816 --> 00:45:50.754
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.000
AUDIENCE: The growth
of the economy overall

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.430
seems to be based on
population growth.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.290
Japan's GDP per
capita is actually

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.270
continuing to
increase, and yet you

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:06.646
don't see optimism in Japan.

00:46:06.646 --> 00:46:08.520
And it seems like the
reason is that the size

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.550
of the economy as a whole
is not continuing to grow.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:15.870
YANIS VAROUFAKIS:
Japan is not in strife

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.890
because of population decline.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:22.460
Population decline and
aging is not helping.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.500
It is not helping.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.585
But that's not the reason.

00:46:24.585 --> 00:46:28.570
The reason why Japan fell
into this trap in the 1990s

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:34.000
was because there was a
huge bubble in real estate,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.480
that bubble was burst
after the Plaza accords,

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.880
when effectively the
United States forced

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.700
Japan to overvalue-- to revalue
an already overvalued yen.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:49.380
That created a massive
wave of insolvencies,

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.060
both in real estate
and in banking.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.590
Then the government
for years tried

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.390
to cover up the
insolvency of the banks

00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:00.100
by turning them
effectively into zombies.

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.960
And by the time we reached 2008,
when the rest of the economy

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.370
fell off a cliff, the
rest of the global economy

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:13.220
fell off a cliff, a net
exporting-oriented economy

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:20.590
like Japan simply managed
to stay still, to stagnate.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:21.570
Take Germany.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.400
Germany is also
shrinking, and also

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.063
in the same demographic
trap as Japan.

00:47:29.063 --> 00:47:32.610
Its growth rate has been quite
positive and quite optimistic.

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:34.780
Now of course, Germany
itself is caught up

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.430
in the trap of the eurozone.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:40.680
But my view is that
we should simply

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:46.070
be looking at GDP
per capita, and there

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.760
is nothing to stop us from
remaining perfectly optimistic

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.619
as long as savings and
investment are balanced.

00:47:53.619 --> 00:47:54.660
Take Japan, for instance.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.590
Remember I was talking about
the gap between savings

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.220
and investment.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.420
It's huge in Japan.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:02.060
There is so much saving
compared to investment

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.490
that this gap-- this,
for me, this gap

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.617
is the solvent of optimism.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.200
It feeds on optimism negatively
by creating pessimism,

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.700
and then the
pessimism feeds back

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:22.590
into maintaining the gap
between savings and investment.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.090
What Japan needs is to open
its borders to migrants.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.000
AUDIENCE: So why
wasn't the system

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.070
that you developed for
payments finally deployed,

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.480
even after the referendum
rejecting the terms

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.405
of the European Union?

00:48:36.405 --> 00:48:38.196
And do you think Greece
would be better off

00:48:38.196 --> 00:48:40.949
if it had been deployed?

00:48:40.949 --> 00:48:43.240
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Well, it
was only one of the projects

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.880
that I had in train.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:49.520
The five months I
was in government

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.290
were a period of
conflict between us

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.265
and the troika of lenders.

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:57.030
It was a war that we lost.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.610
And we lost it because
our side was divided.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.790
With Alexis Tsipras
we had an agreement

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:05.770
that if they closed down our
banks, we would retaliate.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:06.960
And we had the leverage.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.110
We had $30 billion
of debt to the ECB,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.500
which, if we restructured--
and we were perfectly

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.010
within our legal
rights to do so,

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:18.150
because it was Greek
law, not American law,

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.770
not British law-- then
it would bring down

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.150
the whole QE program of Draghi.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.990
Draghi knew that.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.180
He would not have
shut down our banks

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.590
if our threat to restructure
the debt was credible.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.670
That threat stopped
being credible

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:35.060
when Alexis and
I were disunited,

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.590
and when parts of
the government--

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.139
the deputy prime minister,
to be precise-- signaled

00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:41.930
to Draghi that, don't
listen to Varoufakis.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.870
We won't let him
haircut those bonds.

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:46.790
So the moment the
other side realized

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.650
that I would not be allowed to
use the leverage that I had,

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:53.116
it was just a matter of
waiting until our surrender.

00:49:53.116 --> 00:49:54.940
And I hoped that
the referendum would

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.480
energize the prime minister
to say, press the button.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.059
It didn't.

00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:01.100
That night he said to me,
it's time to surrender.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.016
And I said, no, it's
time for you to surrender

00:50:03.016 --> 00:50:05.360
and for me to resign.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.260
And of course, none
of the other projects

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.990
went through, because
from that moment onwards,

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.707
we have a troika government.

00:50:12.707 --> 00:50:15.040
My colleagues, my good friends
who remain in government,

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.520
are not in power.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.860
They simply rule on
the basis of the emails

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.620
that they receive from Brussels.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.930
MALE SPEAKER: So we have
a few online questions,

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:25.640
because we have an
audience around the world.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.760
You have been a strong
advocate of trying

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.130
to fix the European
Union experiment

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:34.020
instead of letting it
collapse under its poor design

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:38.430
and decisions of the
nondemocratic Eurogroup.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:43.570
How many countries will have to
be sacrificed in this process?

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:45.050
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: I hope none.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.940
You see, this
question has embedded

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.345
in it a false assumption.

00:50:51.345 --> 00:50:52.720
The false assumption
is that I am

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.020
advocating that we should
sacrifice some countries

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.600
to save the rest.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.670
I have an organic view
of the European Union.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.390
The European Union either
survives as a whole or it

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:02.370
collapses as a whole.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.730
And if it collapses as a
whole, if it disintegrates,

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.860
we are going to have a
repetition of the 1930s.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.280
There is going to be a
rupture along the river Rhine

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:17.240
and across the Alps between
the northeast of Europe,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.380
that will become a new
Deutschmark zone that

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.500
will be highly deflationary
as the new Deutschmark goes

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.102
through the roof, and the rest,
the Latin areas, plus Greece,

00:51:27.102 --> 00:51:28.560
they're going to
go through a shock

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.290
of high inflation
and high unemployment

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.650
as their currency is devalued.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:35.980
And no one is going to come
throughout well out of that.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:39.210
Political monsters
will emerge when

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:42.130
this happens, because the
conflicts will be great.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:46.030
The depression is going to
spread from Greece everywhere

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.530
else.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.920
Bad things begin in Greece
and spread throughout Europe.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.280
The Cold War began in Greece.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.090
The euro crisis began in Greece.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.760
The disintegration
of the European Union

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.718
is beginning in Greece.

00:51:55.718 --> 00:51:58.540
I don't know why we
are sort of fated

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:03.240
to be the harbinger of
terrible things to come.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:09.510
And therefore, to conclude
my answer to this question,

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:13.420
at the moment, we are
sacrificing one nation

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.890
after the other.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:18.540
We are pushing them off the
cliff of competitive austerity

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.520
in order to preserve something
that is disintegrating

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.470
and cannot be preserved.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.250
My suggestion is this--
we have a choice.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.250
Either do away with
the European Union

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.900
or try to fix it for everyone.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.850
The doing away with it is going
to throw us off that cliff

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.870
that I was referring,
to the other cliff,

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:38.400
into the vortex of the 1930s.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.410
This is my estimation.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.870
I may be wrong.

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:44.830
The alternative is
to-- and you know,

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:48.200
technically, it's very simple
to stabilize the European

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.130
Union economically in a way
that no one gets sacrificed.

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.070
The problem is the
political will.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:58.200
This is the irreducibility
of politics.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.390
MALE SPEAKER: And one
more question, which is,

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:07.140
in hindsight, what was the best
and what was the worst measure

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.870
that you implemented
as a minister?

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.540
Well, the thing is, you
see, I didn't get the chance

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.440
to implement almost anything.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.970
One of the reasons was
that I had had the lenders

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.230
on the other side
doing this and saying,

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:25.010
if you dare put anything
through Parliament, any bill

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:28.960
without our approval, this
will be casus belli and the end

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.850
of the negotiations.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:31.770
Do you believe that?

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:40.560
So the only two bills that I
pushed through Parliament, one

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.320
had to do with what we
called emergency measures

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.610
against extreme poverty.

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.810
So effectively, we gave a credit
card, a pre-paid credit card,

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:55.510
to 350,000 families who
were below the lowest

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:58.330
of the low of low levels
of extreme poverty.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:01.360
And with it, they could-- it's
the equivalent of food stamps,

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.820
plus provisions of minimum
supplies of energy,

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.600
because their houses
were disconnected

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:10.210
from the electricity grid,
and some help with their rent.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.327
This was the one thing
that I tried to do.

00:54:13.327 --> 00:54:15.910
And the second thing, which is,
I think much more significant,

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:18.670
it didn't go to
Parliament because we were

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.230
waiting for the negotiation.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:25.470
It was a plan for ending
the Greek crisis, which

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:30.580
was compiled together
with very able people

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.390
from this country and elsewhere.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:35.810
So my team comprised people like
Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia,

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.670
Larry Summers-- you've
heard of Larry Summers,

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:44.420
I think-- a former
Conservative finance minister

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.920
from England, Norman
Lamont, Lord Lamont,

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.690
the former chief economist
of Deutsche Bank.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:53.400
We killed ourselves
for three, four months,

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:58.320
to come up with a plan for
Greece's recovery, ending

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:04.310
the Greek crisis, that had a
fiscal plan, a plan for debt

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.680
restructuring, that
would alleviate

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.790
the pressures of
unsustainable debt,

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:10.780
but in a way that would
not be politically

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:16.180
unfathomable for the creditors,
and reforms for product

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.469
markets, for the pension
fund industry, and so on

00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:21.010
and so forth.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.420
This, I'm very proud
of that document.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.040
The fact that that was not
even discussed with the lenders

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.750
because the lenders were simply
dragging us through the mud

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:33.170
until we were overthrown,
that is another matter.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:37.330
But I'm still confident that
that document will go down

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:42.020
in history as a
missed opportunity.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.450
AUDIENCE: I'm from Athens,
and we have some other Greeks,

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.150
so thanks for being here.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:51.110
I just wanted to ask about this
payment system you mentioned.

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:53.820
How would you encourage people
to transact in the system

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.210
if they lack faith in what
backs the system-- the Greek tax

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.684
system and the Greek government?

00:55:58.684 --> 00:56:01.100
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Well, to
begin with, in the first phase,

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.540
they would have no
choice in the sense

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.760
that you're owed a million,
I don't have the money

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.660
to give it to you in cash,
so I'm saying to you,

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.862
here is a million, and
you can use it to pay her.

00:56:13.862 --> 00:56:15.195
AUDIENCE: Why would she accept--

00:56:15.195 --> 00:56:16.720
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: And
if she owes money to me,

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.110
if she owes money to
the state-- and she

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:19.725
does, because I'm
the state and she

00:56:19.725 --> 00:56:25.200
is a citizen or an entrepreneur,
and you can extinguish

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.642
that debt, and she can
extinguish her tax debt to me,

00:56:29.642 --> 00:56:31.600
that's all the incentive
you need in the world.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.370
It's a very efficient
way of multilateral tax

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.540
extinguishment, extinction.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.240
Extinguishment, yes.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.540
So it sounds like the no
vote from the referendum

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.060
became a yes in large part,
as you were talking about,

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:55.960
with Tsipras feeling like, you
could say forced to surrender.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.470
You might phrase
that differently.

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:00.490
But I'm wondering,
what is, at this point,

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.230
is really the next realistic
steps for Greece specifically?

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.530
As having family there, I'm
less concerned about the rest

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.230
of the eurozone, and
more specifically--

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.105
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Yeah,
but you afford to be,

00:57:11.105 --> 00:57:13.030
because there can never
be a Greek solution

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.480
without a European solution.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.590
AUDIENCE: So is it,
though, is it to take it

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:22.120
to the next step of sort
of allowing it to get

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.640
to a forcing function point?

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.470
Or is there something that can
be more readily established

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.680
in near term that could
avoid that forcing function

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.190
point as you move
forward in time?

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:33.150
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: This is a
very painful question for me,

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:34.770
and I'll tell you
why it's painful,

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:38.720
because we had an opportunity
in 2015 to reboot the loan

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.220
agreement.

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.320
And we missed it
because we were divided.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.130
And now we signed
a new agreement.

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.890
Well, we-- the government
has signed a new agreement.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.960
You only have to read the
first page to despair.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:55.850
And it is clear--
recently WikiLeaks

00:57:55.850 --> 00:58:00.490
published a dialogue between
two functionaries, Thomsen

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:04.290
and [INAUDIBLE] of the IMF, and
they are saying to one another

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:07.870
what I'm telling you, that
this can't work, it won't work.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.027
Poor Greeks, they're being
squeezed to the ground

00:58:10.027 --> 00:58:12.110
by the Europeans, and the
Europeans are making us,

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:14.290
the IMF, squeeze
them to the ground.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.850
And this is just terrible and
we want to get out of this.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.710
This is the IMF,
speaking, right,

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:22.190
so you don't have to
take my word for it.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:23.700
So what do we do now?

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.390
You see, that was
the very big question

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.360
that I was asked
after I resigned.

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.640
People were coming to me,
and they're supporters,

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.850
and they were pressing me,
pressurizing me quite a lot

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.890
to start a new political party.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:36.917
And I just couldn't do it.

00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:38.500
What would I have
promised the people?

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.410
That I would do
that which I failed

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:41.990
to do the first time around?

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:46.720
And anyway, it's too late now.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.240
The crisis has spread
out beyond Greece.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.720
Now we have a massive fight
between the German finance

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.370
minister and the
European Central Bank

00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.620
on negative interest rates.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.620
I don't know whether
you've been following this.

00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.990
My hope-- and this
is what I'm doing,

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:01.630
and this is what
I why I'm applying

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:05.800
all my efforts in the
democracy in Europe movement.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.170
My hope is that what
we started in Greece

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:10.640
we can take to the
rest of Europe,

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.560
because unless we reboot
European policy at the center,

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.260
with French participation,
German participation, Italians,

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.030
the Spaniards, the
Irish and so on,

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:24.110
then it is impossible
to reboot Greece.

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:26.490
It sounds quite
desperate, I know,

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.600
but it's a desperate
situation, and there's

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:35.050
no sense in stopping our
pragmatism from dominating.

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:35.909
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:35.909 --> 00:59:36.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:39.330
Thank you for coming.

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:42.170
I have a more sort of personal
question for you about--

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:43.536
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Not my shirts.

00:59:43.536 --> 00:59:44.160
AUDIENCE: What?

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:50.890
How did you, during this time
of probably insane stress

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:52.950
and pressure and
deadlines and difficulty,

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:58.000
sort of manage your process
and be productive given

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.370
what was going on around you?

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.078
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: It's
called adrenaline.

01:00:01.078 --> 01:00:02.502
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:02.502 --> 01:00:05.540
It's adrenaline.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.930
The phone kept
ringing constantly,

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.150
and every phone
call was a crisis

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:16.560
that I had not predicted--
funding crisis, usually.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.370
Something that-- because when
the system is collapsing,

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:24.290
it is chaos.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.970
You know, non-linear
mathematics.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:26.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so how do you--

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.790
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: It's
completely unpredictable what's

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:30.164
going to hit you
the next second.

01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:34.240
So it's adrenaline, and a
sense of responsibility.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.270
Look, my therapy was walking
everywhere in Athens.

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:43.166
So I had no guards or
anything like that.

01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:44.290
I would walk to Parliament.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:48.220
I would walk to the prime
minister's house or office,

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.150
residence.

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.680
I would walk home or
go on my motorcycle.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.740
But usually I would
walk only because

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:57.420
of blending with people
who would come and disagree

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.680
with you, but
getting their energy.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.820
Seriously, this is
what kept me alive.

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.980
And it's because of that
that I could not not

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.370
resign on the 5th of July.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.360
I thought, why,
to keep the chair?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.470
I don't like this chair.

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:11.920
Take it away from it.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.870
I was only happy
in it when I felt

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:19.090
that it was a prospect
for doing something good,

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:22.030
for rebooting the situation.

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:23.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming, first of all.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.720
At the beginning
of last year, when

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.740
you started as a
finance minister,

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.800
I had the impression that you
were a team with Mr. Tsipras.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.050
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: That I was--

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:37.720
AUDIENCE: You were
a team together.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.070
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Yes.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:39.477
That's the impression
I had, too.

01:01:39.477 --> 01:01:40.060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.386
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:41.386 --> 01:01:49.570
So when you resigned and
Mr. Tsipras remained there

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:52.690
as a prime minister,
I had the impression

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.040
that he gave up on you.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.250
And I had the impression
that he used you as a bluff

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.350
against the creditors.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:07.470
So my question to you is,
why did he give up on you?

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:08.790
Do you have an answer for that?

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.040
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: No, I don't.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:10.571
I don't.

01:02:10.571 --> 01:02:11.320
And you know what?

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.810
I have a policy of not
projecting my prejudice

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:21.190
on somebody else's
mind-- the other mind

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:22.200
problem in philosophy.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.390
Especially in politics,
it's wrong to do it.

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.970
What I can do is I
can tell you what

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:34.480
he has said to me, because
I think that's legitimate.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.610
But trying to project my
views about him on him

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:39.900
and then telling you what
I think he was thinking,

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.010
I will not do that.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:42.690
I will never do that.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.330
It's not productive,
I don't think,

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:47.030
and I don't trust myself
to be able to do it.

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:53.067
But, look, Alexis
allowed the troika,

01:02:53.067 --> 01:02:55.650
in particular Dijsselbloem, the
guy who had come to my office,

01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.270
and Merkel, to drive a wedge
between us-- slowly at first,

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:04.500
and then they kept hammering it
in until we were very distant.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.080
There was a moment--
there were many moments.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.760
I won't give you the precise
details, but sometime late

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.420
March, early April, I
started feeling that.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:18.710
By the end of April, I was in
open confrontation with him.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:24.250
There was a moment when-- for
me, the unsustainable debt,

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:28.140
and our determination
when we were still a team

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.690
not to accept
another euro of debt

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:33.860
unless we had stabilized
the Greek debt,

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.160
rendered it sustainable, and
rebooted the economic program

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.930
for Greece, that
was our agreement.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:44.830
And technically speaking,
a very important part

01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:47.110
of this agreement had to do
with the primary surplus.

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:48.890
The primary surplus,
I remind you,

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:53.240
is the difference between
the government's tax take

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.060
and government expenditure,
excluding debt repayments.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.190
That's the primary surplus.

01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:01.650
Now, the troika had
imposed on Greece

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:06.800
a crazy, insane target of
3 and 1/2, 4, 4 and 1/2%

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.320
of GDP in a broken economy.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.920
That's just-- any
investor who sees

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.170
this thinks, OK, leave Greece
alone, because for them,

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:20.340
with no credit, no investment,
and a debt deflationary crisis,

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.970
they can only try to
achieve that primary surplus

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:28.190
by increasing taxes
year in, year out.

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:30.020
So for me, that
number was important.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:34.820
It was both substantially
important and psychologically

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.890
important for creating
a shock of optimism,

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:40.330
to reduce it to 1%,
1 and 1/2% at most.

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:42.980
And Tsipras and I
had agreed on that.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.032
At some point, end of
April, I'm in his office.

01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:48.990
I entered his office to
discuss various things.

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:51.740
I could feel since
the end of March

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.130
there were problems
between us, the way

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:57.450
he was negotiating without
me with Merkel and so on.

01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:02.700
What Merkel had said to him was,
look, ditch Varoufakis and I'll

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.520
give you a deal.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.250
It's very simple.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.370
And they reason why they needed
to ditch me was very simple.

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:13.180
I had made it abundantly clear
I am not signing a new bailout

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:19.130
loan until and unless I could
see that the numbers added up.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:24.540
And make my day.

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.420
Just shoot me.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.430
I'm not doing it.

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:29.467
And I had credibly
committed to this.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.300
So they knew that they
had to get rid of me.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:31.800
Why?

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.010
Because all these
agreements are signed

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:37.550
not by the prime minister,
but by the finance ministers.

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.170
So I was an obstacle.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:41.420
So they drove this
wedge between us.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.520
And I remember
walking to his office.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.510
It was 27th of April
or something like that.

01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:48.360
At that time,
there was a barrage

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.470
of attacks in the press, both
international and national

01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:52.100
against me.

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.810
And he went to the restroom.

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:58.390
And there was a piece of
paper on the coffee table.

01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.890
And so I picked it
up and I read it.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:03.770
And I could see that he
had given them 3 and 1/2%

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:06.210
of the primary surplus.

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:10.097
And he comes back,
and I say, Alexis,

01:06:10.097 --> 01:06:12.680
do I take it that you gave this
without telling me because you

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.555
knew I would veto it?

01:06:13.555 --> 01:06:16.910
He said, yeah.

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:21.780
At that point, I said to
him, why did you do that?

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.270
You know that I can't
possibly support that.

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:27.620
He said, Yanis, you've
got to become pragmatic.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.642
You have to give something
to take something.

01:06:29.642 --> 01:06:30.350
I said, OK, fine.

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.620
What did we take?

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:33.655
What did we take?

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:35.530
He said, they promised
that they will give us

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.627
something on the debt.

01:06:36.627 --> 01:06:38.460
Something on the debt--
what does that mean?

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.251
A debt restructure.

01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:44.390
I said, Alexis, you're
driving-- I used words

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.120
that I can't use now.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.380
We're friends, right.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:51.070
This is complete idiocy.

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:56.170
If you accept that you can
reach a 3.5% primary surplus,

01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:58.770
you're accepting that
your debt is sustainable,

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.486
because you take the surplus and
you give it to the creditors.

01:07:02.486 --> 01:07:04.110
And then why would
they give you a debt

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:08.540
restructure if you promise
to give them that money?

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.590
So these are complements.

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.544
They are not competing.

01:07:12.544 --> 01:07:14.210
So if you give this,
you give that, it's

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:17.670
like giving a shark a little
bit of blood to convince

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:19.620
him to go away.

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.610
No way.

01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:22.500
And we had a major clash.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.720
So the question is, why did
I not resign that night?

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.020
Well, I wrote my
letter of resignation.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.650
It was the first
one-- second one.

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.410
I wrote five.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:32.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:34.070
I submitted the fifth.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:35.910
The reason was
because-- I'll tell you

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:40.570
why-- because I felt that even
though he was bending over

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:44.110
backwards to please
the creditors,

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:47.620
they would not give him
an agreement whatever

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.730
he gave them.

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:51.340
They wanted to
drag our government

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.850
through the mud
as a demonstration

01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:57.230
effect for the Spaniards,
the Irish, the Portuguese--

01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:59.310
if you dare elect a
government like these people,

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:01.500
this is what you get.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.110
And I felt that when the degree
of humiliation for Alexis

01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:08.709
reached a certain threshold,
then he would come back

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:10.500
and he would say, come
on, let's do it now.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.690
It didn't happen.

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.840
MALE SPEAKER: And I think
this is the perfect time

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:22.770
to thank our guest today with
this intimate story of how

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:23.430
it went on.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.439
So please give a hand
to Mr. Yanis Varoufakis.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.239
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:28.239 --> 01:08:30.690
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: Thank you.
