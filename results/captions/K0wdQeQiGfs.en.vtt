[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.620
Before the election, Donald
Trump encouraged his supporters

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.100
to monitor the polls for fraud.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.060
Or, as Republicans call
it, black people voting.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.050
I traveled to the all important
swing state of Pennsylvania

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.510
to find out just
what was going on.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.620
They even want to try and rig
the election at the polling

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.920
booths, where so many
cities are corrupt

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.170
and voter fraud
is all too common.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.390
If nothing else,
people are going

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.300
to be watching on November 8th.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.970
Watch Philadelphia.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.180
We're here in
Philadelphia, keeping an eye

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.530
on the white people, keeping
an eye on the black people,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.850
who are here to vote.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.650
OK.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.920
I believe we finally spotted
an intimidating poll watcher.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.730
There he is.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.530
Douchie Howser.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.904
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:56.160
No, I didn't say it that way.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.440
-Yo, I don't know who you are.
-That's good.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.628
I don't know who you are.

00:00:58.628 --> 00:00:59.536
You need to chill out.

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:00.444
I didn't say it that way.

00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:01.890
I don't get [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.690
I'm chill.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.120
You're the one pointing
your finger at me.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.280
I'm chill.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.920
I work for the city
Republican Party,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.170
and our job is to
ensure that we have

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.040
fair elections in this
democratic-dominated city.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.840
OK.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.340
So the first thing they do
when they sense voter fraud,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.475
they call a local teenager.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:20.050
We call a local 25-year-old,
and I call the DA.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.310
So tell us.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.010
What I see here is
what you've uncovered

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.920
a widespread massive
single case of voter fraud.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.960
Well, I can tell
you that over 30

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.860
of our court-appointed minority
inspectors across the city

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.360
have been kicked out of
their polling places.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.930
Minority inspector?

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.800
Minority party.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.190
You're playing the race card.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.430
Triumph, don't play
the race card on me.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.320
As a black entertainer,
I'm obligated.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.630
But no, seriously, is
voter fraud that bad?

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.140
Is it any worse
than the fraud you

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.630
commit when you fill
out your OkCupid

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.301
profile without revealing that
you live with your mother.

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.480
[LAUGHTER]
He'll be home by 6:00.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.610
Don't let this election
day stuff scare you, mama.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.510
Going to vote today?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.310
I am.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.240
Are you here to vote?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.130
Well, I think you might need
some help getting through.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.040
No, you see the Republican
Geek Squad is whining

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.430
about voter fraud,
so that they can keep

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.979
your neighborhood from voting.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.060
You here to vote.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.990
Yeah.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.380
OK, well.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.740
As you can see, it's
not the easiest thing.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.070
A lot of voter
intimidation going on here.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.910
Look at this poor lady.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.936
30 minutes ago, she
was five foot seven.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:28.198
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:30.878
She's 23 years old.

00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:31.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.590
See that guy.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.860
He's trying to keep
black people from voting.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.600
You guys need my help.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.640
You need my help.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.210
What are you
going to do for us?

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.750
Just come with me, OK?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.450
Come here, come here, guys.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.510
I want you to meet someone.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.460
Come on out, Rebecca.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.260
Hi.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.060
Hi.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.350
This is Rebecca.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.498
Rebecca is makeup artist.

00:02:48.498 --> 00:02:49.732
-How's it going?
-Hi.

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:50.594
Pleasure to meet you.

00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:52.060
What are the movies
you're most famous for?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.290
I worked on a little movie
called "White Chicks."

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.240
Yeah.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.040
Wayans brothers.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.770
You guys getting the idea?

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.670
Oh, yes.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.570
Yes.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.960
Do want to vote in
Donald Trump's America?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.730
Do you want a chance to vote?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.530
Yeah.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.650
Just get in the van.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.650
Just do it.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.650
Just get in the van.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.030
Look at you.
Yes.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.830
By the time we're done with
you, you're going to be

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.861
hailing cabs in your sleep.

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.390
Very nice.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.190
Look at you.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.748
Roger Ailes would grope
you without batting an eye.

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:39.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.770
No whiter.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.130
I want him to look like
Tilda Swinton saw a ghost.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.520
OK, come on out.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.620
All right.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.488
Let's go.

00:03:56.488 --> 00:03:58.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.780
Walk proudly, like you've never
been bothered by the police.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.570
We just wanted to come here
in our district as Republicans

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.800
and exercise our rights.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.180
Well, I've been
feeling for my safety,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.770
because when I leave here,
I live in a gated community.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.700
My house is gated.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.490
We need the wall built. I'm
ready to put up a million

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.200
dollars of my own money.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.660
For Trump, yes, because
that's a man with vision.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.820
If you don't know what
Donald Trump stands for,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.360
you wait and see, because
I'm confident this election

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.660
will be a success for all of--

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.520
-Totally.
-Our people.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.320
We're psyched.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.285
I'm psyched.

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:35.380
I'm super excited to
vote for the man that

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.190
is going to fix this nation.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.525
Donald Trump, motherfucker.

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:41.570
That last line was OK.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.970
You sounded like a white
person who wants to be Black.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.770
Get in there.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.570
Go ahead.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.630
You can do it.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.840
America is depending on you.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.220
Remember, act white.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.700
Warby Parker.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.470

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.270
Citi Bike.

00:04:58.988 --> 00:05:01.053
The suspense is killing me.

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:06.240
Yes, yes!

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.386
You did it.

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:11.484
You tricked the Republican scum.

00:05:11.484 --> 00:05:13.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.780
Yes, sure.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.510
Let's take a selfie.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.650
You're a great poll watcher.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.900
Nothing gets by you, except
the parade of women who

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.350
ignore you on a daily basis.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.840
I think we all learned
something today.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.330
That in America white
people and black people

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.550
can indeed get along, as
long as the black people

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.801
are white people.

00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:37.783
