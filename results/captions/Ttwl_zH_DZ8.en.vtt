00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.950
 A century of Earth's
radio transmissions

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.460
has now washed over thousands
of other star systems,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.460
carrying with it some of
our greatest broadcast

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.660
masterpieces, as well
as our worst reality TV.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
What are the chances that alien
civilizations have detected

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.231
and even decoded these signals?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.210
We are a young
technological civilization.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.110
An advanced alien race
monitoring our planet,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.250
even from the nearest
neighboring star,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.740
would have seen nothing, radio
quietness until only around

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.390
a century ago.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.760
Then, beginning with
the faint sporadic buzz

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
of the first experiments
with wireless transmission,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.530
the radio brightness
of this small planet

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.170
would have bloomed into
a continuous planet-wide

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.830
cacophony of TV and radio
broadcasts, satellite relays,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.810
and radar pulses.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.290
This bubble of chatter
is, as I speak,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.290
spreading out into the
galaxy at the speed of light,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.330
the unmistakable signature of
an emerging technological power.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
The outer edge of this bubble is
now over a hundred light years

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.170
away.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.630
And it carries with it the
first transatlantic radio

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.140
transmission of Marconi himself.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.120
That edge may be
hopelessly diffused,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.620
but it's followed closely
by the much brighter

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.140
80-light-year shell, on which
rides the footage of the 1936

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.560
Berlin Olympics, episodes
of the "Lone Ranger,"

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
and Orson Welles' ill-fated
radio adaptation of "War

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.240
of the Worlds."

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.130
That shell has washed over
several thousand star systems.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.500
Based on Kepler Space
Telescope observations,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.210
that also means thousands of
potentially habitable planets,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.600
lots of chances for
hypothetical civilizations

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120
to have learned
of our existence.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.240
So the question is,
who could have seen us?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.610
What manner of civilization
would be powerful enough

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.290
to sense this bubble?

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.050
What tech level would be
needed to actually decode

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.910
the signal it carries?

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.360
If aliens arrive on our doorstep
tomorrow, would they have been

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.570
alerted to our presence
by Nikola Tesla's

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.770
first experiments, broadcast
footage of the Moon landing,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.260
the "Phantom Menace?"

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.620
To answer the question
of who can see us,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.950
it's helpful to first
ask who could we see?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.080
After all, humanity
remains the one example

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.680
of a technological
civilization, for now.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.540
Our best astronomers
have been engaged

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.450
in the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.860
SETI, in earnest since the
'60s, when Frank Drake first

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.820
peeked at the stars Tau
Ceti and Epsilon Eridani.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.510
Drake peered into the so-called
water hole, a narrow frequency

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.990
range in the radio spectrum
between a pair of H and OH

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.470
emission spikes, which
itself is within the broader

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.380
window from 1 to 10 gigahertz.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.060
There, the natural universe
is especially quiet.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.910
Surely, this is the
window where aliens

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.910
would choose to broadcast
their messages welcoming us

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.760
into the galactic community.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.140
And, of course,
Drake saw nothing.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.660
Decades of SETI
programs followed,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.020
utilizing several of the
world's great radio telescopes,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.620
like Arecibo in Puerto Rico
and the Parkes radio telescope

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.940
in Australia.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.010
These searches often
focused on the water hole

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.420
or the surrounding
quiet frequency window.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.240
But with the exception
of some one-off oddities,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.190
the search was not successful.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.920
The 1977 Wow! signal
is the most compelling,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.080
a narrow-frequency
radio blast detected

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.320
in the water hole, that
still has no broadly accepted

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.240
natural explanation.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.760
But no one ever saw it again.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.650
Apparently, no one
has tried particularly

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.780
hard to get our attention.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.260
And it's important to understand
that these searches could only

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.960
have been successful
if there were

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.050
deliberate powerful
beacons emitted

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.150
by an alien civilization.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.990
The radio leakage produced by
their own internal broadcasts

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.920
would be much harder to detect.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.140
Our best-targeted search so far,
the SETI Institute's Project

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.300
Phoenix, scanned 800 stars
within 200 light years.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.660
At that range, it could have
picked up a gigawatt beacon

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.120
beamed directly at us.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.150
But it would only have picked
up leakage from a civilization's

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.840
internal broadcasts from
within a couple of light years,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.140
if those broadcasts with the
same strength as our own.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.820
In that range, there is
exactly one star, ours.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.240
An alien civilization at
exactly our current tech level

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960
would never have
seen our TV bubble.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.060
We have sent out more
powerful beacons,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.580
like the stream of 10,000
tweets and celebrity

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.240
videos that Arecibo blasted
in the direction of the Wow!

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.570
signal.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.260
But that's a long shot,
and perhaps for the best.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.020
I'm not sure we want
our first contact

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.440
to be a typical slice
of the twitterverse.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.230
One of the reasons it's hard
to spot unintentional radio

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.010
leakage is that a distant
civilization's radio bubble

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.140
is likely to
overlap in frequency

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.460
with our own transmissions.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.630
This is another advantage for
searching for alien signals

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.060
in and around the water hole.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.470
At around 1500 megahertz, it's
in the ultrahigh frequency

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.510
(UHF) band.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.330
Most TV broadcasts
air at the tens

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.860
to hundreds of megahertz of
the merely very-high frequency

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.780
(VHF) band.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.247
VHF works better for
over-air broadcasts

00:05:42.247 --> 00:05:43.830
because it carries
further and is less

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.810
blocked by buildings and such.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.650
So we often search the UHF
to avoid the thick soup

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.440
of our own VHF chatter.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.960
But surely aliens are
working with the same physics

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.070
that we are.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.660
Perhaps we miss each other
because we can't easily

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.760
peer through our
own local VHF soups.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.730
But there is a way to peer
straight through our own radio

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.070
noise as though it wasn't there.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.520
The answer is interferometry.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.620
Two radio telescopes separated
by a large enough distance

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.320
can filter out
local transmissions.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.690
A signal that appears in
one, but not the other,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.160
must be an earthly transmission.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.270
Now, that's not the main
purpose of interferometry.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.490
That is to increase
the spatial resolution

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.050
of your observations.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.120
You get the resolution
of a telescope

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.850
as large as the separation
of the component

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.330
telescopes, also super-useful.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.890
Interferometry has been
around for a while.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.000
But we're only now building
an interferometer facility

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.210
with the sensitivity to
potentially see an alien TV

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.380
bubble to many light years
and that is large enough

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.660
to filter out local noise.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.790
It's the Square
Kilometer Array or SKA.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.060
The SKA is actually
many, many telescopes.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.980
Arrays of thousands
of radio dishes

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.860
will be built in Africa
and hundreds of thousands

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.530
of antenna installed
in Australia.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.360
When connected up,
it'll effectively

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.230
form a giant radio telescope,
with over a square kilometer

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.670
surface area.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.970
But as an interferometer, it has
the resolution of a telescope

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.440
thousands of kilometers across.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.200
Its sensitivity and
pinpoint resolving power

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.010
will be vastly greater than
any telescope of any type

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.690
that we have ever built.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.070
The SKA is not being built
to search for aliens.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.780
One of its primary
purposes will be

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.560
to catch the radio emission from
hydrogen gas in the extremely

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.090
early universe.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.410
That emission, produced at 21
centimeters wavelength, or 1420

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.810
megahertz frequency,
is, by definition,

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.150
one of the boundaries
of the waterhole.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.700
But if such radio
waves travel to us

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.980
from the earliest
of times, then they

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.620
become stretched out as they
travel through an expanding

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.000
universe.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.380
That redshifted early hydrogen
emission is now found slap

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.080
in the middle of the noisy lower
frequency part of our own TV

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.940
broadcast spectrum.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.330
To spot these radio photons,
we need a truly gigantic

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.570
interferometer, both
for extreme sensitivity

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.240
and to eliminate
our own radio buzz.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.360
That's the SKA.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.630
Such a machine also just happens
to be perfect for spotting

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.490
alien television bubbles.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.640
According to the calculations
of Harvard University's Avi Loeb

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.570
and Matias Zaldarriaga, the
SKA should be sensitive enough

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.080
to spot our own TV bubble
from a hundred or more

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.880
light years away.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.049
So will we soon be picking
up extra terrestrial sitcoms?

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.880
Not quite.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.360
Loeb and Zaldarriga's
numbers assume

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.020
pointing SKA at a target star
system for an entire month

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.950
and adding up all of the
radio emission over that time.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.600
For an artificial
radio source, that

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.230
would look like emission
over a narrow-frequency range

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.710
that doesn't correspond
to any natural process.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.260
These emission spikes may
also shift back and forth

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.360
in frequency due
to Doppler shift,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.290
as the distant technologically
advanced planet

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.290
orbits its star.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.430
So that's enough to identify
a technological source,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.890
but not to actually
decode the signal.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.040
An alien civilization
with their own SKA

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.920
certainly couldn't
watch Earth TV.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.660
To do that, they
would need to achieve

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.160
SKA's one-month sensitivity in
a tiny fraction of a second.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.470
That means compensating for
the difference in exposure

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:37.090
or integration time with the
sheer size of the telescope.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.620
Let's figure it out.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.400
What would be
needed to, say, tune

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.470
in to the first season of the
original "Star Trek" series?

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.560
That signal is now
50 light years away.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.130
Assume a bit rate of
10 million per second,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.240
for a miserable 30 frames
per second, at 200 by 200

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.240
resolution, and
only 8-bit color.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.020
Forget audio, which is a shame
because the original series

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.780
dialog is awesome.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.110
The aliens would need a
radio telescope trillions

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:13.330
of times the SKA's surface
area and equivalent to a dish

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.870
around three times the
radius of the Moon's orbit.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.680
This is perhaps conceivable
for a Type II civilization.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.660
Although it's
exceedingly unlikely

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.810
that there's one of those
within our radio bubble.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.730
We may even be a
little optimistic

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.930
in thinking that the SKA
will detect alien TV.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.910
As the SETI Institute's
John Billingham,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.220
along with James
Bedford, point out,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.460
that one month integration
time requires a very consistent

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.190
narrow frequency
signal, which may not

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.160
be consistent with
typical broadcasts.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:50.320
But remember, humanity is young
as a radio-noisy civilization.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.020
Simple probability says
that any other civilization

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.450
is likely to be ahead
of us on the curve.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.440
It's not hard to imagine them
building a much larger SKA,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.180
without going full-Type II.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.975
Our SKA will cost a
few billion dollars

00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:07.870
by the time it's done in 2030.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.870
That's a significant investment,
but only a tiny fraction

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.700
of the global GDP.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.040
For a slightly more
advanced civilization,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.860
that's several Moore's
law doublings ahead of us

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.890
in various technologies, and
accounting for moderate GDP

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.100
growth over a century
or two, a super-SKA,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.010
with several hundred square
kilometers of collecting area,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.680
would constitute the
same degree of investment

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.010
as our own
one-square-kilometer array.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.890
In that case, Earth's
TV bubble would

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.830
be spotted within
hours, or even minutes,

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.410
of aliens pointing the
facility to our solar system,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.200
even if they weren't
looking for us.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.790
Surely, any advanced
civilization

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.400
is curious about
its own origins.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.310
That redshifted 21-centimeter
hydrogen emission

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.130
really is one of the most
important keys to understanding

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.380
the very early universe.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.050
It's pretty natural to
want to scan the heavens

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:04.030
at exactly the frequencies where
we earthlings are the noisiest.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.340
If there's a slightly more
technologically advanced

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.190
civilization within
our radio bubble,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.050
they've probably seen us.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.960
However, our steady
broadcasts have only

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.300
washed over a few
hundred solar-type star

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.650
systems and only a few
thousand stars total.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.570
Technological
civilizations would

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.870
need to be extremely common
throughout our galaxy--

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.590
and I mean tens of millions
of them across the Milky Way--

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.510
for there to be any
chance that there's

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.920
another one so close to
us, But we just don't know.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.830
If anyone else inhabits
this very local region

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.380
of the galaxy, then
they may have been

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.900
aware of us for some time now.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.290
Any civilization within
40 to 50 light years

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.520
could have sent a return signal
that will reach us any day.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.460
Their fleets of
welcome ships will

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.710
be a little further
behind, but no doubt

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.490
carry only the best wishes
for their noisiest neighbors

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.740
in nearby spacetime.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.520
Hey, everyone.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.260
I just wanted to
say thanks again

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.110
for those of you
sponsoring us on Patreon.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.690
I want to give a very
special shout-out

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.960
to Luna IT Solutions,
who are sponsoring us

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.640
at the quasar level.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.240
Thanks a ton.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.820
It really is a huge help.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.220
A couple of weeks ago, we
looked back into black holes

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.160
and studied the nature
of the event horizon.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.830
You guys had some excellent
and quite tricky questions.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.030
Luca$sino asks what we would
really see if we followed

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.770
the monkey directly
through the event horizon?

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.060
Would it appear ahead of us
despite previously appearing

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.460
frozen on the event horizon?

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.710
Well, sort of, yes.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.470
The light from the instant
of the monkey's crossing

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.260
of the event horizon
is eternally trapped

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.790
at that horizon.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.480
It's trying to walk upwards
on a downward escalator

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.340
of spacetime.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.670
But you're traveling
down that same escalator

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.010
and so you pass this light.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.220
And so you see the instant
of the monkey's crossing.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.710
The escalator speeds
up as you descend.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.210
And so light that the monkey
emitted from below that point

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.330
is trying to go up, but is
actually going downwards.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.210
And yet, you're traveling
downwards faster.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.760
So you overtake
some of that light,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.540
which means you see the
monkey ahead of you.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.350
Douglas Oak asks
a great question

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.210
that I've heard asked before.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.670
If time dilation
approaches infinity,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.250
do you reach the singularity
before the black hole

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.850
evaporates?

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:32.350
OK.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.610
So a distant immortal observer,
with a ridiculously good

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.550
telescope, will detect
photons from the falling

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.580
monkey at all future times.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.760
Eventually, those photons will
come billions, even trillions,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.720
of years apart from each other
and be hugely redshifted.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.180
For an eternal non-leaking black
hole, there is no last photon.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.290
But real black holes decay.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.590
And so the final burst
of Hawking radiation

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.620
as a black hole evaporates
will be accompanied

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.260
by all of the
remaining light emitted

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.200
by everything that fell into
it as it crossed the event

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.750
horizon.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.670
But the infalling
stuff isn't saved.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.520
Although we never saw the
moment of its crossing,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.910
that did happen.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.590
Its matter became part of
the black hole and re-emerges

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.960
as that Hawking radiation.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.020
Grim Reaper Of Trolls is
curious about taking their warp

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.800
drive into a black hole.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.530
Well, I would encourage it.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.510
You can escape a black
hole by traveling faster

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.860
than the speed of light.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.440
In principle, you can do
that with a warp drive.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.290
The probably impossible
technology of the warp drive

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.510
allows you to cause
a patch of space

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.530
to move at really any speed
you have the energy to reach.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.800
So you could resist the
faster-than-light flow of space

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.480
within the black hole.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.670
The event horizon
itself just wouldn't

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.430
apply within your warp bubble.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.550
You know, there's probably
a Penrose diagram for this.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.500
I'll look into it.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.259
Some people complained about
my use of the expression

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:04.300
"escape velocity greater
than the speed of light"

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.050
at the beginning of the episode.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.110
First, let me note that
I gave that statement

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:12.010
in a list of popular examples
of oversimplifications

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.750
about black holes.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.470
Second, it's not actually
an incorrect statement.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.080
Despite the derision it
receives in nerd circles,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.990
it's accepted to
talk about the escape

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.240
velocity at the
surface of the Earth

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.890
because we're used to
Newtonian approximations there.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.630
But it's no less accurate
near a black hole.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.420
At the event horizon, you need
to travel at the speed of light

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.640
relative to the black
hole's stationary frame

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.970
of reference as recorded
by a distant observer.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.330
That's the velocity
you need to escape.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.640
The reason that people
poo-poo the expression "escape

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.810
velocity" is that it reminds
us of a strange coincidence.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.090
You happen to get exactly
the right size for the event

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.870
horizon if you use Newtonian
gravity to calculate

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.210
the distance at which the
escape velocity reaches

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.614
the speed of light.

00:16:59.614 --> 00:17:01.030
The correct way
to get this number

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.850
is by using general relativity
to find the point where

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.500
the flow of spacetime
reaches the speed of light.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.300
But the concept of escape
velocity at the event horizon

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.200
is still as meaningful as it is
from the surface of the Earth.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.520
It's a useful classical
simplification in both cases.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.210
Cornerrecord asks
about that thing when

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.950
you're in a black
hole and time becomes

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.260
space and space becomes time?

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.720
Well, that's probably a
topic for an entire video.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.960
So for now, I'll just
quote what's his name.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.740
The inward direction acts
like the future direction.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.890
So once inside the horizon,
avoiding a singularity

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.900
is like avoiding next Tuesday.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.350
