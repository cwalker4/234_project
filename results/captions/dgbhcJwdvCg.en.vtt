00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.471
The President: Well thank you  very much we love West Virginia.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.840
This was just handed to me. Make Counties great again.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.878
Youre right, youre right. Hold that for me, Ill take this. 

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:12.879
Well, thank you, everybody.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.980
We appreciate
you being here.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.782
Thank you very much.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.017
First of all, I want to
congratulate Scott Pruitt,

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.486
who's here someplace. Where's Scott?

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:24.290
(Applause.)

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.392
So important.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.394
We're going to free up our
country, and it's going be

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.530
done in a very
environmental and positive

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.466
environmental way, I will
tell you that, but create

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.901
millions of jobs.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.303
So many jobs are delayed
for so many years, and

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.705
it's unfair to everybody.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.840
So I want
congratulate Scott.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.575
I want to thank everyone
for being here today.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.678
We have a great group of
farmers, homebuilders, and

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.580
county commissioners.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.349
They're all represented.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.884
They're standing
alongside of me.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.554
I'd also like to thank
Jim Inhofe, who's been so

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.723
terrific in so many
different ways,

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.158
beyond even this.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.394
So I want thank Jim and
also the leadership in the

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.463
Senate on the issue, a
friend of mine -- a great

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.665
friend of mine
-- John Barrasso.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.501
The EPA's so-called
"Waters of the United

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.505
States" rule is one of the
worst examples of federal

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:16.142
regulation, and it has
truly run amok, and is one

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.746
of the rules most strongly
opposed by farmers,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.515
ranchers and agricultural
workers all

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.184
across our land.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:28.121
It's prohibiting them from
being allowed to do what

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.456
they're supposed
to be doing.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.658
It's been a disaster.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.427
The Clean Water Act says
that the EPA can regulate

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.163
"navigable waters" --
meaning waters that truly

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.699
affect interstate
commerce.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.835
But a few years ago,
the EPA decided that

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:46.372
"navigable waters" can
mean nearly every puddle

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:50.276
or every ditch on a
farmer's land, or anyplace

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.446
else that they
decide -- right?

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.914
It was a massive
power grab.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:59.252
The EPA's regulators were
putting people out of jobs

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:03.056
by the hundreds of
thousands, and regulations

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.492
and permits started
treating our wonderful

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.361
small farmers and small
businesses as if they were

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:12.198
a major industrial
polluter.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.767
They treated
them horribly. Horribly.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.537
If you want to build a new
home, for example, you

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.006
have to worry about
getting hit with a huge

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.677
fine if you fill in as
much as a puddle -- just a

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:25.712
puddle -- on your lot.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.513
I've seen it.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.681
In fact, when it was first
shown to me, I said, no,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.283
you're kidding aren't you?

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.951
But they weren't kidding.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.088
In one case in a Wyoming,
a rancher was fined

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.491
$37,000 a day by the
EPA for digging a small

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.027
watering hole
for his cattle.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.896
His land.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:46.432
These abuses were, and
are, why such incredible

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.536
opposition to this rule
from the hundreds of

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:53.773
organizations took
place in all 50 states.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.709
It's a horrible,
horrible rule.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.246
Has sort of a nice name,
but everything else is bad.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.347
(Laughter.)

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.315
I've been hearing about it for

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.249
years and years.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.918
I didn't know I'd
necessarily be in this

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.587
position to do something
about it, but we've been

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.255
hearing about
it for years.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.758
With today's executive
order, I'm directing the

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.193
EPA to take action,
paving the way for the

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:18.164
elimination of this very
destructive

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:21.301
and horrible rule.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.202
So I want to thank
everybody for being here.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.506
And I will sign wherever
I'm supposed to sign.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:27.807
There we are.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:30.710
Thank you very much.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:40.086
(Applause.)

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.158
Lets start hiring this group of fellas. Right?

00:03:46.426 --> 00:04:01.808
So how important is this?

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.810
And Ill tel you John you have the right man in Scott Pruitt.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.513
Watch the job he does.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:14.754
Congradulations.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:18.791
(applause)

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.796
Well thank you the home builders didnt know it would go this fast

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.399
they thought maybe by the end of the fourth year.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:36.175
(laughter)

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.980
Thank you.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:05:03.770
