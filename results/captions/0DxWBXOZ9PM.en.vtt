00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's say there's another issue that we have we can't contend with and

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.580
one of those might be

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.620
Well imagine that in order for society to progress you have to allow the individual to compete in a relatively untrammeled space

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.499
So that they can innovate and then imagine that one of the consequences of that innovation is that you get these pareto

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.779
distributions developing because the innovator or

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.420
The one who's second in line to the innovator whatever ends up with them with the bulk of the spoils?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.920
So you might say there's a cost to be paid in inequality

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.739
for innovation and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.320
Then you could also say well too much inequality

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.769
destabilizes things which seems to be quite quite clear

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.429
So there's room for an intelligent conversation about that right because the lefties say Oh too much inequality

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.399
And they need to be listened to because the evidence is quite clear if you let the inequality ramp up enough the whole system

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.309
Destabilizes because the people at the bottom think fuck it. We'll just

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.919
We'll just flip the system upside down right no one wants that like right-wing conservatives

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.309
don't want that so because you could make a Republican argument say don't let the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.000
Inequality in your neighborhood get out of hand because the crime rate will skyrocket and the empirical evidence on that is overwhelmingly strong

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.290
inequality drives crime

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.540
Now you can say you can argue about why but the fact that it does is that's not disputable

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.309
So we could have an intelligent discussion between the left and the right and the discussion would go something like this

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.409
You need innovation you pay for innovation with inequality, but you need to bind inequality because if it's too intense then things destabilize

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.970
It's like okay. We could agree on that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.210
We've got the parameters set

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.259
now we have to now we have to start thinking very carefully through how to do the redistribution issue and we don't know how to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.670
Do that so you might say well

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.750
We have a guaranteed annual income for people which I think is a horrible solution by the way

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.549
But it addresses the right problem the problem is is that we're hyper productive

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.938
But the spoils go to those at the top and some of those resources need to be funneled down to the people who have zero

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.930
so that they have an

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.199
opportunity to at least get to the point where they can innovate and so the bloody whole bloody thing doesn't wobble and fall and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.300
We could we and I would say in some sense. That's what the political discussion is about but we

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.389
We've skittered off into these radical

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.889
oversimplifications, which something like well if if you have more than another person you're an oppressor and you're evil and if you have less

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.680
It's because you're virtuous and victimized and that's just a non-starter

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900
So you think that there's a real problem with like something like a universal basic income

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.020
Well I think the idea that the solution is a basic income is not a good idea because I think the problem is deeper than

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.810
That I don't think the fundamental problem is that people don't have enough money.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.560
I think the fundamental problem

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.800
Is that human beings in some sense are beasts of burden

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.680
And if they're not given if they're not provided with a place where they can accept social

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.129
responsibility social and individual responsibility in an honourable manner they degenerate and die

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.299
But that's the opiate crisis in West right now like men need

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.869
Men, who are men, don't need money

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.050
They need function and we've got a problem one of the problems is for example here. Here's an ugly stat

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.950
I think I told you this once before

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.829
it's illegal to induct anyone into the Armed Forces if they have an IQ of less than 83 and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.980
The reason for that is the the Armed Forces

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.100
despite having every reason to draw the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.280
contradictory

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.030
conclusion

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.420
Has decided that there isn't a single thing that you can be trained to do in the military if you have an IQ of less

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.819
Than 83 that isn't positively counterproductive

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.709
that's 10% of the population and we're producing a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500
Culture that's very cognitively complex

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380
Like what the hell are you going to do if you can't use a computer?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.109
Like if you can use a computer you're at least in the game if you can really use one you're hyper powerful if you're not

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.079
Literate enough to use a computer you're at zero

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.409
Ten percent of the population the Conservatives say well, there's a job for everyone if they just worked hard enough. It's like

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.789
No and increasingly no and the Liberals say well, everyone's basically the same you can train anyone to do anything

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.669
It's like no you can't yeah

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.059
I want to go back to the inequality point here because if you look at this biologically actually I think it reveals a lot

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.449
Why are we I mean we know from from careful study that people are

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.309
motivated by the degree of inequality more than they are the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.419
The absolute level of well-being that they have and there's a very good

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.579
It's tragic but a very good evolutionary reason for this which is if you are

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.229
Working on some piece of land and your neighbor has the adjacent piece of land

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.189
And they're doing twice as well as you it's because they know something you don't

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.769
right and so becoming focused on what they're doing that you're not doing is a

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.500
Rational thing to spend your time on so you can figure out what it is that they know that you don't in the modern environment

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.580
This is a catastrophe

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.250
Because who are your neighbors well

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.630
You've got some box sitting on the wall of your living room that has a totally artificial portrait of other people who may be much

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.179
Wealthier than you and it's broadcasting in as if you're looking in their window right in the adjacent house

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.400
And so you think you you being triggered to

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.450
think that you're doing something wrong that you might fix when in fact the solution may not be

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.979
First of all the person on the other side of that screen may not be for real

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.929
But even if they are they're not living in the same environment to see you the technology is interfacing with with our brains

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.740
badly

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.150
But so we have the perception of massive inequality

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.820
economically we do have massive inequality you're arguing that the solution to this involves some sort of

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.430
massive redistribution

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.289
But nonetheless

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.639
redistribution is wildly unpopular for various reasons, and so what we've got now is a

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.720
situation

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.849
This is speculative

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.549
But what's really happening is that austerity is being used as a threat to keep people who would otherwise?

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.310
rebel against the inequality in line and

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:11.189
My fear about this is that this is exactly the conditions that are going to trigger that?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.729
Tribal

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:23.219
population against population mayhem that we were talking about at the beginning of this conversation that when people have the sense that the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.589
the bursts of growth that they were

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.240
experiencing is now over the natural response is to turn on those who are not as powerful and take their stuff that this is a

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.939
totally indefensible, but nonetheless

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.899
biological pattern of history and that if we want to avoid that

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.740
We have to stop sending the signals that trigger us to imagine that we've just run

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.699
to the limit of the

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.519
Opportunity that we had discovered and it is now time to look and see who can't defend their positions

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.520
How are we sending these signals?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.979
Well by

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.330
Basically

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.020
failing to provide enough well being that people's perception of the

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.499
Inequality is reduced to a tolerable level

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.929
Well the argument for universal basic income

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.150
certainly certainly a strong one

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:18.530
And I you know it's also an it's also a good argument for equality of opportunity right because people are people are actually not as

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.459
Resentful about the success of others as you might expect

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.809
They're resentful about it if they feel that the game is fixed (hmm)

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.449
But they're also willing to consider the game long term so lots of people will say look like I'm stuck in not zero

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.169
I'm stuck at one but my kids might make it to four and that's good enough

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.370
And that's been the American dream right and that's and that's a really high power

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:44.899
Antidote to inequality, it's like well. Yeah, there's some inequality

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.549
We need it to keep the generative mechanism going, but the game is fair, and you can play it, too

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.930
And there's some reasonable probability that either you or someone you love will be successful so

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.690
That so it has to be a straight game

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:03.409
And that's why ethics is so important to keep this landscape stable people can't play crooked games and the rich shouldn't be fixing the game

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:06.229
If they want to hold on to their money and the problem is is that

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.580
some of them

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.699
Although not all some of them are fixing the game

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:15.169
and no one's happy about that and no wonder you know and and I

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:20.718
guess that was evidenced to some degree by the 2008 collapse because it seemed and

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:30.079
And I'm just as uninformed as the next person, so I'm I'm what I'm capable of commenting on this it seems from the outside

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.550
That the rich

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:38.599
Disproportionately benefited from the restabilization of the economic system and people are not happy about that

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:44.359
And they shouldn't be happy about that because it indicates that there's something fundamentally rotten about the game, so you could say well

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.720
Maybe people can tolerate

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.350
necessary

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.150
inequality if the game isn't rigged and

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.659
So that's why everybody has to act in a manner that indicates that the game isn't rigged and that means they can't rig it

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.170
That's really what it means

00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:02.330
so and so we're also being driven into this inequality corner by I would say by the post modernists and the

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:09.650
neo-marxists because they say this is the pernicious thing they say well the reason that some people have more than others is because

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.259
Every hierarchy is based on arbitrary power

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:18.169
and they're all oppressors and the reason they have the money is because they stole it from you and

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.919
There's some truth in that because there are some criminals

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.960
But when you get to the point where you fail to distinguish the productive people from the criminals

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.560
Which is exactly what happened in the 1920s in the Soviet Union you better bloody well watch out because when you radically

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.840
Make things egalitarian you're gonna

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.499
Wipe out all your productive people and then you're gonna starve and so that's that's one of the doomed

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:50.090
End scenarios that awaits us if this idiot process of polarization continues and what I find reprehensible about the universities

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.319
And you're tangled up right up to your neck in this is that the universities are

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.919
actively agitating to produce people who believe that all inequality is due to oppression and power and

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.184
That's just well first of all it's technically wrong, but it's dangerous

00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:08.599
Why is that so you guys both operate in that system?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.600
So well

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.660
Here's the problem

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:20.510
No as far as I know nobody has properly studied the question of what fraction of the economy is actually

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.349
crooked rent-seeking right not productive

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:31.370
And I fear that the answer to that question is that it's an awful large fraction of the economy, not because of some

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.940
Conspiracy but because

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.620
Opportunity is finite

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:44.210
But con games aren't and so anybody who can find a mechanism for transferring wealth from somebody else for doing nothing

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.150
Finds that mechanism and that thing is is ever-present. Where as discovering the next big thing

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.969
that's actually productive is you know something that goes along and fits and starts and so if we were I

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.909
Mean really you've described it very well. We've got a

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.730
battle between two

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:09.500
Caricatures of what's true right are the either the market is wonderful and its produced great stuff with very little

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.370
corruption or

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.130
Everything that makes people unequal is the result of corruption both of these things are wrong, right?

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.510
markets are

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.910
Marvelous engines for figuring out how to do something really well

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:28.730
They're brilliant at this right and so people who see that fall in love with it understandably because they're so good at it

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:35.629
But what they're terrible at is telling you what you should want or what you should do right if people tell markets

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.319
Here's what we would like to accomplish, and then the markets tell us well

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.290
How do we accomplish that best that would be a very viable?

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.929
System that would not result in massive

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.500
rent-seeking

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.480
Resulting in everybody feeling that all of their misfortunes are the result of a rigged game

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.559
Which is so massively rigged that when they check they see yes, that is actually a large large to large extent what we're suffering from

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.069
But they want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and so they want to throw out markets entirely which you know it would

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.070
Be a terrible mistake

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.100
It's a it's a

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:18.709
You asked you why this has happened in the universities and like that I think it's one of these runaway positive feedback processes

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:24.200
You know the universities start to tilt hard to the left in the 60s and that just went out of control

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.500
And now we're at the point where

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.700
that's the dominant force and

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.520
Why is probably another manifestation of one of these pareto principles? It was like well at some point there's enough left

00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:43.120
He's hired so that the probability that they're only going to hire people equally as left or greater starts to reach 100%

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.930
And then you iterate that across a couple of generations, and you get no conservatives

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:54.109
Which is more or less the situation say in the humanities and most of the social sciences and it sort of looks like a conspiracy

00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:00.379
But it doesn't mean that anyone is actually planning it although. There are conscious attempts also to silence conservative voices

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.130
Let's say and then that's also driven by this postmodern ethos

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.949
No neo-marxist ethos. I would say that says that all of the right the moral right is on the side of the left

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:17.359
You know and so it's the combination of those two things there's more things. I think I often often think comically that if you paid

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.730
sociology professors

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.829
Three times as much the probability that they would be anti-capitalist would decline

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:32.508
Precipitously like I think a lot of it's driven because there's a lot of smart people in academia, and they're underpaid relative to their intelligence

00:13:33.209 --> 00:13:39.679
Mmm, so and that doesn't make them happy so they get bitter and resentful about that and they think well there's these goddamn bankers who

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.439
Are hauling in twenty million dollars a year and Here I am

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:46.818
Hardly struggling, but here I am struggling comparatively

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:51.859
And that's the issue is comparatively on a hundred thousand dollars a year one hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.889
You know I look at that, and I think well whatever

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.819
It doesn't matter, but there's a like my colleagues are often angry with me because I do work with the business school

00:14:02.339 --> 00:14:04.398
You know and I also have a business are not

00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:06.839
anti-capitalist in the least

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:10.669
But I it's just dumbfounding to me because they'll come up to me and say well

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.569
Are you so sure that you should be working with the business school, and I think what bloody planet?

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:19.759
Are you from too positive question like that's all businessmen are evil it's like really

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:21.863
That's the level of your sophistication.

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:25.420
This is really an argument, that's been presented to you that businessmen are evil?

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.419
well

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.969
they don't come out and say that but they certainly question my

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.560
Motivations for example in in in forming ties with the business school like what do they say about it?

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:38.359
They say exactly that they questioned my ethics about forming ties with the business school

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.980
So anyway they don't give you any reasons?

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.300
You're supposed to the reason supposed to be self-evident joke

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.050
You know, so let's give this argument. It's due I mean

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:54.199
I don't buy this argument, but but nonetheless let's let's not let's not caricature. Yes, that's good

00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:58.999
In an absolutely free market, which is not what we have

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.569
But we have something that tends in that direction in an absolutely free market if you compete two

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:08.009
individuals one of whom is

00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:10.219
completely amoral will embrace any

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.469
Opportunity if it makes a profit no matter what it is and the other individual has some limit to what they will do

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:23.959
Well, then there's no question who wins if we give this experiment long enough period the individual who will do anything will out-compete

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.240
the individual with moral limits because

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:31.879
Depend on what the game is though because no people find out that you have no moral limits then they're going to

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.300
Remove themselves from your market

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.280
Unfortunately not and no here's the I know it seems like that and in any given round

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:45.900
That's true. Okay, but to the extent that what you're saying is to the extent that people police

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.300
Their purchasing and they will you know they will stop using uber if uber is ethically

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.820
compromised for example

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.190
Well, then the point is well

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.150
What's the game the game is to figure out?

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.629
Which things are being monitored and not do any of the unethical things that are being monitored

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.369
But to do all of the unethical things that aren't being monitored and so the individual who is perceiving

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.340
Which things they can get away with has an advantage that's and a psychopath advantage well

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.859
I don't even want to call it the psychopath advantage right what this is is that a market will

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:25.040
Train you to do this if it is unregulated and the best that the ethically that the ethically

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.279
restrained person can do is

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.880
Compete dead even they have no way of getting ahead because the person that is completely free the the amoral

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.609
Business actor has the ability to do anything that the constrained actor has

00:16:40.609 --> 00:16:43.129
Does this depend entirely upon what the battlefield is?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:49.579
not really there's there's sort of one exception and that exception is people who have done something

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.390
that

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.999
Has suddenly put them in a powerful position right so

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.700
Tech people

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.440
Right, tech people who have skyrocketed as a result of having innovated the next big thing have not been through

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:08.089
the markets training them to discover the the

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.899
Landscape of what isn't being monitored that you can make a profit

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:17.509
That's one of the fascinating things about tech people in general is that these gigantic tech corporations almost all lean left

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.820
Well the gigantic tech corporations lean left. That's true on the other hand I mean I

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.310
Hate to say it, but think about how Google started right don't don't be evil right

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:35.149
I think they actually meant that right right and the thing is don't be evil is what it sounds like when you haven't been trained

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.869
By the market to have to do whatever you have to do to beat your competition

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.680
You've just come up with the great circuit engine and suddenly you're on top of the world

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.760
But over time what happens

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.610
That entity is now exposed competition from a bunch of other entities that

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.940
Increasingly will find an advantage in being freer to do

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.160
ethicly questionable stuff and so what it does is it forces an

00:18:01.529 --> 00:18:08.269
Entity like Google to evolve in the direction of a morality, so now don't kind of handle with China Google

00:18:08.429 --> 00:18:10.939
Yeah, Google wanted to expand into China

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:16.520
And so you know they had to make a deal with the devil so to speak right and they had except censorship

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:20.209
They will find ways to rationalize everything because to not

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:27.289
Rationalize that which their competitors can avail themselves of would be to perish and issues was there was all sorts of fake

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.829
Google going on just like they have fake Apple stores in China

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.730
They don't have the same sort of copyright laws that we have and you can essentially

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.360
Plagiarize anything you want on Brett you you also said that I shouldn't make a straw man of the anti-business

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.819
Argument of my peers and there's another way that

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.919
I shouldn't make a straw man of it like despite the fact that I'm not anti-capitalist

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:55.939
I don't believe that every entity is a business either and one of the things that has happened to universities that has actually they

00:18:56.279 --> 00:19:01.429
pathologized in a number of dimensions, but they've also pathologized along the business dimension as the

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:09.020
Administrators have become increasingly trained or drawn from the ranks of business managers because a university is actually not a business

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.629
It's a like a church isn't a business there are?

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.549
organizations that aren't businesses that you can't just cram into the free market structure willy-nilly and so my colleagues also object to the

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:25.490
To the transformation of the university into a business entity run by profit seeking MBAs

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.309
and they should object to that because that's not what the

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:35.179
institution is for so there are reasons for them to be skeptical say of my association with the business school that aren't merely a

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:42.140
Reflection of a simplistic anti-capitalist ideology. Oh there are lots of there are lots of things that are not

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.380
They have no immunity to contact with the market right what has happened to the university system

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.200
Is that markets have pushed it in all kinds of directions that are not healthy for the mission of the Academy

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.669
And this is also true

00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:58.669
You know journalism isn't well done in a market either, right?

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.299
Journalism done in the market ends up telling you what you want to hear not what you need to know

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.659
so anyway

00:20:04.659 --> 00:20:06.778
Markets are wonderful, but there's certain things

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:12.299
They shouldn't be allowed to touch and there are certain things that they shouldn't do like tell us what to want right?

00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:15.479
They're not there's no magic principle by which a market knows

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:22.349
What's healthy, and what you know you might crayon sir, then well that also then brings us back to another part of the conservative

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.929
Liberal left dilemma, which is well you know

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:34.979
To direct the market means to impose the heavy hand of the state and its potential

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.779
pathologies on the market but to leave it alone completely means that it

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:46.979
Wanders randomly through through an indeterminate landscape, and and I guess part of the issue there, too is it's sort of like

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:49.529
Well, how do we how do we?

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:57.689
How do we properly balance for foresight and planning which you'd think would have some role in in the construction of large-scale states

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:03.480
It's like well. What do we want the landscape to look like how do we balance that with the sort of comprehensive?

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:08.399
computations that the market allows and of course the answer to that is we have political

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:15.749
Discussions about it all the time that are untrammeled so that we can adjust the ratio between those two things as necessary so again

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.049
That's a that's a read. That's a argument on the side of free speech

00:21:19.049 --> 00:21:25.589
Yeah, I mean you know really it couldn't be more important the real answer is that both failures are frightening, right?

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.079
I mean you really don't want a state

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.509
Nannying you and over regulating the market and taking the magic out of it

00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:35.969
And you don't want the completely unregulated

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.960
Landscape where the market you know

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.659
Starts probing the minds of your children and figuring out how to sell them things that they don't have any

00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:48.209
Ability to resist right you need to figure out what that path is and it's not easy

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.480
but you can't do it in a landscape where you can't talk about the
