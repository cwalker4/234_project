00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:01.237
- Yeah.

00:00:01.237 --> 00:00:05.444
People always dump on,
what do you call it?

00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:07.916
The fast food industry.

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:12.083
If I had to do it again,
I'd go work for McDonald's.

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:17.049
You don't like to live
below your means, do you?

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:17.882
- No.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.732
- No, and I think when
you say to somebody,

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:21.951
"Live below your means,"
you wipe their spirit out.

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.430
Look, I have an unfair advantage.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.216
I went to war.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:31.385
And at war, I'm alive because
other guys died for me.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:32.218
- He's the author

00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:35.053
of one of the bestselling
business books of all time,

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:36.557
Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.556
He has challenged and changed the way

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:40.398
that millions of people around the world

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:42.431
think about real estate and money.

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:44.187
He's also an investor who's put his money

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:45.945
into several business ventures.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.002
He's Robert Kiyosaki, and here is my take

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.462
on his top 10 rules for
success, volume two.

00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:53.270
Rule number four is my personal favorite,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.701
and I'd love to know which
one you guys like best.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:56.970
Also, as you're watching the clips,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.208
if you hear something that
really resonates with you,

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.757
please leave it down in the comments below

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:03.531
and put quotes around it so
other people can be inspired.

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.284
As well, when you write something down,

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:08.741
it's much more likely
to stick with you, too.

00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:09.574
Enjoy.

00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:12.474
(loud whoosh)

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:15.391
(orchestral music)

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:27.445
- You wake up tomorrow morning,
and you're on the street.

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:29.310
And you have nothing.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.310
You don't have a single
contact in your network.

00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:37.863
All you have is the knowledge

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:41.960
and experience that you've
had throughout your career.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.754
How do you build up from there?

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:46.237
- Well, I've been there, many times.

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:47.713
So it's no big deal.

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:49.508
You just figure out
what's needed and wanted

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.688
and you go do it.

00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:56.004
People always dump on,
what do you call it?

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.238
The fast food industry.

00:01:58.238 --> 00:02:01.950
If I had to do it again,
I'd go work for McDonald's.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.756
And the reason I'd go work for McDonald's,

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:07.680
whether it's seven bucks an
hour or 15, I don't really care.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.933
(coughs)

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.994
I don't really like McDonald's food,

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:13.798
but they have the best
business systems in the world.

00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:16.279
How else can a company take

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.042
virtually non-college educated people

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:22.744
and build a fast food
industry across the world?

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:23.979
And they have the best system.

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.763
So right inside a little McDonald's,

00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:28.521
you can learn everything you
need to learn about business

00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:31.041
except for the management side of it.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.782
So, I'd just go work at McDonald's

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:34.449
so I could learn even more.

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.750
So I look at life as learning.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.544
I'm constantly learning.

00:02:39.544 --> 00:02:43.527
I'm reading constantly,
studying constantly.

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:46.586
I spend most of my time
with entrepreneurs.

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:48.239
I don't spend my time with people

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.241
who complain about the economy.

00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.162
So nothing would really change.

00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:56.488
I'd just go back to being an entrepreneur.

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:59.502
Entrepreneurs have one thing in common.

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:00.747
They keep going.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:01.801
They'll change the rules.

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:03.459
They'll reinvent the rules.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.947
They don't just take one answer.

00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:07.270
So a real entrepreneur,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.270
really it makes no difference
which country you're in.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.147
That's my belief.

00:03:12.147 --> 00:03:12.980
- I love that.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.813
- You know what I mean?

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:15.669
It's just a mindset.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.586
It's F you.

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:21.161
You mess with me, I'll
find a way around it.

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.328
I have a friend, he's
multi-multi-multi family rich

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:30.435
guy from France, and France
is as communistic as it gets.

00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:33.715
- 75 percent top line for
million dollar earners.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:35.267
- Yeah, but that's why he lives here.

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:38.017
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:43.013
- He started buying
vineyards in Napa and Sonoma,

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:46.257
so he went back to the
French government and says,

00:03:46.257 --> 00:03:50.450
it's his wine, he says,
"I want to ship my wine

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.450
"in bulk to California."

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:56.937
And the government says,
"You can't do that."

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.985
- This is the French government
saying you can't ship--

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:00.552
- Yeah, and here's a guy who's,

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:05.000
I think its five
generations, French wine guy.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.670
This guy is an entrepreneur entrepreneur.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.724
He says, "Okay, I can't
ship it in barrels."

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:10.557
The guy goes, "Yeah.

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:12.549
He says, "Okay, I'll ship it in bottles."

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.485
(laughing)

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:17.485
So he bottled all of this stuff.

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:19.313
It cost him more money,

00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:20.998
but he still figured out how to do it.

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:21.831
- Creativity.

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:22.664
- Do you know what I mean?

00:04:22.664 --> 00:04:24.495
And now he has his wine

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.029
with his California wine and all this,

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.471
and so he went back to the
French government and said,

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.486
"Here, try this.

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:32.200
"See if it's not better."

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.776
And so now they're all confused,

00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:36.433
because he didn't break any rules.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:38.037
So I'll say it again.

00:04:38.037 --> 00:04:42.204
Entrepreneur is a mindset
first, a skillset, and rules,

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:46.040
and depending upon
whether you're an employee

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.010
or a small business,
the rules are different.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.236
The mindsets are different.

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:52.569
The skillsets are different.

00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:05.482
'Cause I'm one of those kids
that didn't like school.

00:07:05.482 --> 00:07:09.511
School is good for people who like school.

00:07:09.511 --> 00:07:13.968
But here was my poor dad,
head of education, PhD,

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.244
on the governor's board of
Hawaii and all this stuff.

00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:19.704
And as a kid, me, I'm
flunking out of school

00:07:19.704 --> 00:07:21.893
'cause I can't read, I can't write.

00:07:21.893 --> 00:07:23.232
It's not that I couldn't
read, I couldn't write.

00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:25.416
I was bored out of my mind.

00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:27.698
I was just, "Hey."

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:31.710
So what I did instead was,
that's when I met my rich dad,

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.228
who was my best friend's father,
and he used these things.

00:07:34.228 --> 00:07:35.987
It's called a game.

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:39.241
You see, games are the
best teaching tools.

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.531
See, when I'm playing this game,

00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:44.021
this is how the rich taught
their kids battle strategies.

00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:45.481
It's called chess.

00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:48.929
My rich dad taught me to be
a rich man playing Monopoly.

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:52.762
We played Monopoly hour
after hour after hour.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.708
The formula for great wealth in Monopoly

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:59.334
is four green houses, one red hotel.

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:03.084
So today in Arizona, I
own 8,000 green houses

00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:07.184
and several red hotels.

00:08:07.184 --> 00:08:09.633
I just play Monopoly for real.

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:11.313
So that's the power of a game,

00:08:11.313 --> 00:08:14.230
because a game engages me mentally,

00:08:15.402 --> 00:08:17.766
physically, 'cause I
actually have to move things,

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:22.053
emotionally, 'cause when
somebody knocks me out, (coughs)

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:23.905
I better wake up.

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:25.457
I made a mistake.

00:08:25.457 --> 00:08:28.238
And spiritually, 'cause
it's spirit that wins.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:31.253
Now if you just saw
Golden State play the--

00:08:31.253 --> 00:08:32.211
- [Interviewer] Wasn't that something?

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.044
- Oh.

00:08:34.438 --> 00:08:38.746
I mean, I love Lebron
James, I love Cleveland,

00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:42.244
but one guy cannot take on a team.

00:08:42.244 --> 00:08:46.217
And I think Lebron scored
60 percent of all the points

00:08:46.217 --> 00:08:49.753
and assists and all that,
but a better team beat 'em.

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:53.920
So when you look at business,
business is the same thing.

00:08:54.754 --> 00:08:56.456
Business is a team sport.

00:08:56.456 --> 00:08:58.542
I have to have good
accountants, good attorneys,

00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:02.415
good marketing guys, good tech
guys, (coughs) great staff.

00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:05.186
I have to have great leaders.

00:09:05.186 --> 00:09:07.045
The trouble with most entrepreneurs,

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:10.524
they're self employed,
so they quit their job.

00:09:10.524 --> 00:09:11.747
And in America today,

00:09:11.747 --> 00:09:14.053
the SBA, the Small
Business Administration,

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:18.220
says there's 28 million small
business owners, 28 million.

00:09:20.022 --> 00:09:24.118
24 million are classified
as non-employers.

00:09:24.118 --> 00:09:26.599
They're a one man team.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.595
They'd be like this guy saying,

00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:29.970
"Okay, I'm going to take you on."

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.279
Are you crazy?

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.018
But that's what most
entrepreneurs are trying to do.

00:09:34.018 --> 00:09:36.281
'Cause that's what they're
taught to do in school,

00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:39.255
to be the rugged individual.

00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:41.268
In school, I was very successful

00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:44.553
as long as I could cooperate at test time,

00:09:44.553 --> 00:09:48.416
but in school, cooperation at
test time is called cheating.

00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:52.954
In the real world, the guys
that have the biggest team win.

00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:57.024
So all I focus on is putting
the best team together.

00:09:57.024 --> 00:09:59.243
Meanwhile, a lot of time,
the A students in school,

00:09:59.243 --> 00:10:00.447
they're the doctors and lawyers,

00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:01.656
they're sitting there all by themselves.

00:10:01.656 --> 00:10:03.274
They're sitting ducks.

00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:04.992
But they're entrepreneurs.

00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:05.825
Do you know what I mean?

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:08.101
It's just a mindset, tactics, strategy.

00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:09.251
I went to military school.

00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:10.740
I'm a former marine.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.721
So I think like a military
operation, which I love chess.

00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:17.525
So most entrepreneurs, they have this job.

00:10:17.525 --> 00:10:19.744
They're, "Okay, I'm going
to be an entrepreneur."

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:23.238
And these guys just massacre 'em.

00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:25.329
'Cause they went to school,
they learned to get a job,

00:10:25.329 --> 00:10:27.233
and they take tests on their own.

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:29.415
They have to be the smartest.

00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:31.693
That's like the Lebron James.

00:10:31.693 --> 00:10:34.267
I don't want to be the
smartest guy in my team,

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.271
but I want to have the best team.

00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:39.031
And that's why I win most of my games.

00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.286
- That's great.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:43.469
- I think like this, and
the doctors think like this.

00:10:43.469 --> 00:10:46.525
I'm going, "Yeah, I
got you, man." (laughs)

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:51.195
For some reason, I get this
sense I'm going to win. (laughs)

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:53.599
So the other thing with when people say,

00:10:53.599 --> 00:10:55.599
"Live below your means,"

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.788
you don't like to live
below your means, do you?

00:10:58.788 --> 00:10:59.621
- No.

00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:01.505
- No, and I think when
you say to somebody,

00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:04.040
"Live below your means,"
you wipe their spirit out.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.346
It's like saying to somebody,

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:08.719
"If you want to lose weight,
go on a starvation diet."

00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:11.686
It doesn't make you
healthier to starve yourself.

00:11:11.686 --> 00:11:13.927
So I would rather get
financially educated.

00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:15.793
That's why I read your books,

00:11:15.793 --> 00:11:17.755
'cause this is my greatest asset.

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:21.946
I want to feed my brain so
that I can expand my means

00:11:21.946 --> 00:11:24.037
without getting into excessive debt

00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:25.673
or where I start to lose,

00:11:25.673 --> 00:11:28.237
because debt, you could
say, is a two edged sword.

00:11:28.237 --> 00:11:29.547
But telling somebody

00:11:29.547 --> 00:11:33.543
to live below your means
is almost inhumane.

00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:35.475
I never felt good doing it.

00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:38.229
I wanted to strive to do better.

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:40.510
Every day, I want to do better every day.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.703
I liked a good life.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:43.703
Like I tell the story of

00:11:45.447 --> 00:11:48.464
taxiing underneath your jet.

00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:52.437
I was in my jet, but it
was a little Learjet.

00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:55.948
I look up and there's a
727, and I taxi under it.

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:57.948
I said, "Holy mackerel."

00:12:00.263 --> 00:12:01.937
It's big boys and their toys,

00:12:01.937 --> 00:12:03.466
but nonetheless, it inspired me.

00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:05.477
I said, "Okay, I'm in a Learjet now.

00:12:05.477 --> 00:12:07.174
"It's time to step up."

00:12:07.174 --> 00:12:10.057
And it doesn't mean the
jet will make me happier.

00:12:10.057 --> 00:12:13.007
What makes me happier is
the wanting to get better,

00:12:13.007 --> 00:12:15.618
to get smarter, to do better.

00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:16.576
- [Interviewer] If you did not have

00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:19.725
the rich dad in your life,
what would you be doing today?

00:12:19.725 --> 00:12:23.864
- It's hard to say if I didn't
have my rich dad, because

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:26.508
as a young kid, starting at probably about

00:12:26.508 --> 00:12:29.277
the age of five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:31.317
I really wanted to be rich.

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:34.713
So I think number one is desire,

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:38.754
and then you naturally seek
your role models and teachers.

00:12:38.754 --> 00:12:41.988
And in my lifetime, I've
had multiple rich dads.

00:12:41.988 --> 00:12:43.953
My rich dad was my best friend's father

00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:46.477
starting the age of nine, and then today,

00:12:46.477 --> 00:12:50.390
I still seek mentors and
wise men and wise women

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.014
because that's how you get wiser,

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:55.513
is by hanging out with smart people.

00:12:55.513 --> 00:12:58.771
- Everyone says finding
good real estate is hard

00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:00.729
when you're getting started.

00:13:00.729 --> 00:13:04.896
What's the value of a good
network and good partnerships?

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:06.572
- Well, I'll say it again.

00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:09.360
In 1973, I came back from Vietnam,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.994
and I was a pilot out there.

00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:14.200
And I took a real estate course.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.617
It was $385, three days long.

00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:19.568
And that was a lot of money back then.

00:13:19.568 --> 00:13:23.735
I was only making $500 a
month, so 385 was all I had.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.240
And the instructor at the end
of the program said to me,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.027
he said, well to the whole class
of about 30 of us, he says,

00:13:32.027 --> 00:13:35.787
"Your education begins now
that you leave the class.

00:13:35.787 --> 00:13:37.965
"You didn't get educated
while in the class."

00:13:37.965 --> 00:13:41.599
So his assignment was that
everybody, or 30 of us,

00:13:41.599 --> 00:13:43.545
we had to pair up in
team, get up in teams,

00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:44.928
two or three to a team,

00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:49.180
and we're to look at 100
properties in 90 days.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.550
And he says, "Don't buy anything.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.473
"Just look at 100 properties.

00:13:52.473 --> 00:13:54.225
"Do your evaluation of each property.

00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:57.467
"Write a short blurb about it,
why it's good, why it's bad."

00:13:57.467 --> 00:14:00.937
And he said, "At the end of
90 days and 100 properties,

00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:02.372
"then you make up your mind

00:14:02.372 --> 00:14:04.710
"if you're going to buy something."

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.877
He says, "If you haven't found
one property in 100 deals,

00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:11.890
"you start again."

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.475
You start again with another 100.

00:14:14.475 --> 00:14:17.945
And that's why most people are not rich,

00:14:17.945 --> 00:14:21.483
is they're not willing to
go through that process

00:14:21.483 --> 00:14:24.221
of looking at 100 deals to find one deal.

00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:26.512
And there's sometimes, and you and I know,

00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:30.190
you look at a lot of frogs
to find one princess,

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.033
but when you find that one
princess, everybody goes,

00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:35.497
"Oh, well how did you get so lucky?"

00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:39.001
Well, I looked at a dirt
dogs out there, you know?

00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:41.270
And that's like anything in life.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.213
You don't marry the first
man or woman you meet.

00:14:44.213 --> 00:14:47.025
Hopefully you kiss a couple
of 'em before you do.

00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:50.419
My last paycheck, I still
remember it clearly,

00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:53.317
it was one of the worst and
the best days of my life.

00:14:53.317 --> 00:14:57.225
And I was in Puerto Rico,
I was working for Xerox,

00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:59.530
and my boss gave me my
last, it wasn't a paycheck,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.517
it was a bonus check.

00:15:00.517 --> 00:15:02.574
I think it was about 30,000 bucks.

00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:04.696
Taxable is the only problem with that.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:08.053
So I get this check, and
I went, "Holy mackerel."

00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:08.886
You know what I mean?

00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:12.534
So I was excited, but
I was also disturbed.

00:15:12.534 --> 00:15:15.287
And so this other guy comes
up to me, his name was John,

00:15:15.287 --> 00:15:17.639
and John says to me, he says,
"You're going to be back."

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:18.696
I said, "Why?"

00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:20.736
He says, "'Cause you're going to fail."

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:25.225
I looked at him and said,
"Look," a few expletive words,

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:26.369
because that's what he did.

00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:29.216
He left Xerox, failed, and he came back.

00:15:29.216 --> 00:15:34.014
I said, "Look, duh-duh-duh,
you failed and you came back,

00:15:34.014 --> 00:15:36.688
"but I'm going to fail,
and I'm never coming back,"

00:15:36.688 --> 00:15:38.548
and that's the attitude.

00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:39.990
Do you know what I mean?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.198
If you say, "Well if I fail,

00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:42.986
"I'll go back to Mommy and Daddy,"

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:44.523
then that's what you'll do.

00:15:44.523 --> 00:15:47.290
So if you fail, that's when
I became an entrepreneur,

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.516
because I had no money.

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:50.693
I had no money for years.

00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:52.721
I didn't have a paycheck.

00:15:52.721 --> 00:15:54.701
But that's what my rich
dad encouraged me to do.

00:15:54.701 --> 00:15:57.425
He says, "When you don't
have this paycheck,

00:15:57.425 --> 00:15:59.196
"you get hungrier, smarter,

00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:01.286
"and it's a test of your character."

00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:02.440
Will you become a crook?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.958
Will you become dishonest?

00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.286
Will you cheat and steal?

00:16:05.286 --> 00:16:08.023
Or will you become a better human being?

00:16:08.023 --> 00:16:11.247
So really, that's the benefit
of becoming an entrepreneur,

00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:13.300
is you really find out who you are

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.770
when you don't have anything.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.040
If you're an entrepreneur

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.467
and you're going to be a big entrepreneur,

00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:21.304
leadership skills and communication skills

00:16:21.304 --> 00:16:24.387
are more important than a law degree.

00:16:25.263 --> 00:16:26.725
I have another book that just came out.

00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:29.952
It's called The Eight Lessons
in Military Leadership.

00:16:29.952 --> 00:16:33.986
In the military, I went to
military academy and all that.

00:16:33.986 --> 00:16:36.504
From day one, you're learning leadership.

00:16:36.504 --> 00:16:38.971
Day one at the academy, I have to stand

00:16:38.971 --> 00:16:43.771
in front of 20 18 year old kids
and go, "Section, ten-hut."

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:46.478
And naturally, they're
going to say, "Screw you."

00:16:46.478 --> 00:16:48.927
So that's when you learn to be a leader.

00:16:48.927 --> 00:16:50.804
Now as you said to me when we first met,

00:16:50.804 --> 00:16:53.021
the trouble with the military,
you get a little rough.

00:16:53.021 --> 00:16:55.471
(laughing)

00:16:55.471 --> 00:16:57.467
I had a hard time when
I came back from Vietnam

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.002
and I went to work for Xerox.

00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:01.480
People didn't like that I'd call 'em

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.448
an asshole and a
fuckhead, stuff like that.

00:17:03.448 --> 00:17:04.964
- Every other word is a
curse word in the military.

00:17:04.964 --> 00:17:06.172
- Yeah.

00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:08.290
"Hey fuckhead, do this."

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.502
(interviewer laughs)

00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:11.989
But the don't... (gasps)

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.779
"I'm going to call in the HR person."

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:16.528
I better make some changes here.

00:17:16.528 --> 00:17:17.487
You know what I'm talking about?

00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:18.320
- Of course I do.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.001
- You can't talk straight
in corporate America.

00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:22.699
- In the military you can.

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:23.532
- You have to.

00:17:23.532 --> 00:17:24.365
- Yeah.

00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:25.198
- And they love it.

00:17:25.198 --> 00:17:26.031
- Yeah.

00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:27.702
You actually get promotions
if you do it in the military.

00:17:27.702 --> 00:17:29.969
- When I got called names, I
said, "Oh, the guy likes me."

00:17:29.969 --> 00:17:32.647
(laughs)

00:17:32.647 --> 00:17:36.011
So that's why if all you guys
who are military veterans,

00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:38.720
you have probably the number one skill

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.309
to be an entrepreneur,
which is leadership,

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:44.292
the ability to listen, to
not take it personally,

00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:46.026
and still get the job done.

00:17:46.026 --> 00:17:49.003
It is the best training in the world.

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:51.548
The saddest thing about
leaving the military

00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:52.990
was leaving the guys behind there.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.489
They were some of the best in the world.

00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:57.034
They weren't all college graduates.

00:17:57.034 --> 00:18:00.275
They were just my gunners, my
mechanics, and all this stuff.

00:18:00.275 --> 00:18:01.231
- Comradery is priceless.

00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:02.514
- Oh, jeez, it's priceless.

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:04.015
- Comradery is priceless.

00:18:04.015 --> 00:18:07.183
- And so all I did when I
started at the Rich Dad company

00:18:07.183 --> 00:18:10.944
was to have that same sense
of teamwork inside Rich Dad.

00:18:10.944 --> 00:18:12.193
That's why there's no ranks

00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:13.981
and all of that stuff in this company.

00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:16.253
Everybody gets to say
what they want to say.

00:18:16.253 --> 00:18:17.754
People are free to do what they want.

00:18:17.754 --> 00:18:20.929
I stay out of their way,
and we get the job done.

00:18:20.929 --> 00:18:23.939
Well, the Midas Touch is five
things you must remember.

00:18:23.939 --> 00:18:26.991
Number one is the thumb, which
is strength of character.

00:18:26.991 --> 00:18:28.206
You fail, stand up.

00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:29.686
Don't lie, don't cheat, don't.

00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:31.995
Just stand up, own it, keep going on.

00:18:31.995 --> 00:18:32.987
Strength.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.685
This is focus, the index finger.

00:18:35.685 --> 00:18:37.294
This is where I'm going.

00:18:37.294 --> 00:18:39.283
And I talk about how I
went to flight school

00:18:39.283 --> 00:18:42.428
and was preparing to fly in Vietnam.

00:18:42.428 --> 00:18:43.566
People are shooting at you.

00:18:43.566 --> 00:18:45.744
You still got to stay
focused on your target,

00:18:45.744 --> 00:18:47.793
even if you get killed in the process.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.270
This one everybody knows.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.786
This is what you stand for.

00:18:51.786 --> 00:18:54.945
So Donald stands for the absolute wealth,

00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:58.757
and what I stand for is very
simple, financial education.

00:18:58.757 --> 00:19:00.093
Keep it simple.

00:19:00.093 --> 00:19:02.004
Teach people to manage their money.

00:19:02.004 --> 00:19:05.215
So I stand for that, and I
don't ever get off that track.

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:08.171
The ring finger is for relationships.

00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:10.495
If somebody is struggling financially,

00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:13.270
be it a company, a country, or a marriage,

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.785
it's because you have a bad relationship.

00:19:15.785 --> 00:19:17.565
The thing that Donald
and I always say is that

00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:19.926
you can't do a good
deal with a bad partner.

00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:22.740
And God knows I've had some bad partners.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.252
And they're just incompetent,

00:19:24.252 --> 00:19:25.980
but they want to pretend they're smart.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.436
And then the little one
is the little finger.

00:19:28.436 --> 00:19:32.032
Every entrepreneur must do
something that nobody else does.

00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:33.533
For example, in the United States,

00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:37.968
Walmart, their whole system
of business is designed

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.807
to give you the lowest
price possible, everything,

00:19:40.807 --> 00:19:42.425
whereas a little mom and pop store,

00:19:42.425 --> 00:19:44.057
they'll say, "Well, they
put things on sale."

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:45.806
That's not the same thing.

00:19:45.806 --> 00:19:47.237
FedEx does overnight.

00:19:47.237 --> 00:19:48.546
That was their whole thing.

00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:51.676
They built the company
around that little promise.

00:19:51.676 --> 00:19:55.018
Domino's Pizza in America was
pizza in less than 30 minutes.

00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.817
So the entire business was built around

00:19:57.817 --> 00:20:00.270
one simple, little promise.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.236
And those are the things

00:20:01.236 --> 00:20:04.374
that make entrepreneurs extremely rich

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:07.183
or extremely poor if they
don't have those five.

00:20:07.183 --> 00:20:08.016
- [Interviewer] Is there a time

00:20:08.016 --> 00:20:10.512
to bail out on a project,
though, I mean when--

00:20:10.512 --> 00:20:12.448
- That's not in my vocabulary.

00:20:12.448 --> 00:20:15.886
Look, I have an unfair advantage.

00:20:15.886 --> 00:20:17.793
I went to war.

00:20:17.793 --> 00:20:21.936
And at war, I'm alive because
other guys died for me.

00:20:21.936 --> 00:20:25.464
When you see stuff like
that, how can I quit?

00:20:25.464 --> 00:20:28.693
Most guys are just
wimps, pussies, cowards.

00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:32.443
They don't have it, so
they should get a job.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.749
- Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:20:35.749 --> 00:20:36.825
I hope you enjoyed it,

00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:38.408
and if you haven't checked out Volume One,

00:20:38.408 --> 00:20:40.012
I think you'll enjoy that as well.

00:20:40.012 --> 00:20:41.974
I'd love to know, what
did you learn from Robert

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:44.453
today in this video that's
going to have the biggest impact

00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:46.468
on you, on your life, or your business?

00:20:46.468 --> 00:20:48.476
What immediate change
are you going to make

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:49.959
after watching this video?

00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:51.240
I'd love to hear from you.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.444
Please leave it down
in the comments below.

00:20:53.444 --> 00:20:55.721
I also want to give a quick
shoutout to M.D. McGill.

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.955
Thank you so much for
picking up a copy of my book,

00:20:57.955 --> 00:21:00.039
Your One Word, and taking that picture

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:01.548
and posting it on Twitter.

00:21:01.548 --> 00:21:03.008
I really appreciate the support,

00:21:03.008 --> 00:21:05.478
and I hope you enjoy the read by the pool.

00:21:05.478 --> 00:21:07.267
So thank you guys again for watching.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.264
I believe in you.

00:21:08.264 --> 00:21:10.510
I hope you continue to believe in yourself

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.518
and whatever your one word is.

00:21:12.518 --> 00:21:13.476
Much love.

00:21:13.476 --> 00:21:14.740
I'll see you soon.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.240
(loud whoosh)

00:21:20.653 --> 00:21:22.746
- Very important diagram
my rich dad showed me

00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:24.441
when I was a little boy

00:21:24.441 --> 00:21:27.764
was a diagram known as
the cash flow quadrant.

00:21:27.764 --> 00:21:31.266
And the quadrant is made up
of the four different people

00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:33.071
who make up the world of business.

00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:35.499
So my rich dad said, "In
the world of business,

00:21:35.499 --> 00:21:38.759
there's Es, and Es stand for employees."

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:40.819
"An employee," he says,
"You can always tell

00:21:40.819 --> 00:21:43.109
"who they are by their core values."

00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:44.450
And what what the employee,

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.728
whether the president or
the janitor of the company,

00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:48.487
will always say the same words.

00:21:48.487 --> 00:21:50.017
The words are, "I'm looking for

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.251
"a safe, secure job with benefits."

00:21:52.251 --> 00:21:53.495
That's what makes them an employee,

00:21:53.495 --> 00:21:56.527
'cause their core values are security.

00:21:56.527 --> 00:21:59.301
The other one of the four is the S,

00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:02.188
or the small business
owner or the self employed.

00:22:02.188 --> 00:22:04.275
And again, their core
values will 'cause them

00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:06.301
to use the same words, which are,

00:22:06.301 --> 00:22:09.546
"If you want it done
right, do it by yourself."

00:22:09.546 --> 00:22:11.114
S means they're also solo.

00:22:11.114 --> 00:22:15.423
They're generally a one person
act or operate by themselves.

00:22:15.423 --> 00:22:18.482
On the right side of
the quadrant are the Bs,

00:22:18.482 --> 00:22:21.277
and what rich dad said the B
stood for was big business,

00:22:21.277 --> 00:22:22.732
or like Bill Gates.

00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:26.492
Forbes defines big business
as 500 employees or more,

00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:28.220
and their words are different.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.533
They say, "I'm looking for a
good system, a good network,

00:22:31.533 --> 00:22:35.318
"and the smartest people I
know to help run my business."

00:22:35.318 --> 00:22:36.424
They're unlike the S.

00:22:36.424 --> 00:22:38.510
They don't want to run
the company by themselves.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.436
They want smart people to
run their companies for them.

00:22:41.436 --> 00:22:44.292
And then the fourth of
the quadrant is the I,

00:22:44.292 --> 00:22:46.779
and I stands for investor.

00:22:46.779 --> 00:22:49.723
These are people who have
money work hard for them.

00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:52.843
These people are people who
have people work hard for them.

00:22:52.843 --> 00:22:55.552
And these are the people that
work hard for the rich here.

00:22:55.552 --> 00:22:57.743
And the thing of note here is that

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.525
most people who go to school

00:22:59.525 --> 00:23:01.727
are programmed for the E and the S side.

00:23:01.727 --> 00:23:04.955
For example was my poor
dad, who always said to me,

00:23:04.955 --> 00:23:08.968
"Son, go to school so you can
get a nice, safe, secure job."

00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:12.737
And so my poor dad wanted
me to be an employee,

00:23:12.737 --> 00:23:14.259
and since the time I was a kid.

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:18.362
"Get a safe, secure job,
steady paycheck, and benefits."

00:23:18.362 --> 00:23:19.771
I didn't want to be an employee.

00:23:19.771 --> 00:23:23.016
And I said, "Mom and Dad,
I want to be a rich man."

00:23:23.016 --> 00:23:24.523
And I'd fight with my dad.

00:23:24.523 --> 00:23:27.681
So mother finally said, "Son,
if you want to be rich,"

00:23:27.681 --> 00:23:29.287
my mother was a registered
nurse, she said,

00:23:29.287 --> 00:23:30.546
"If you want to be rich,

00:23:30.546 --> 00:23:32.540
"the richest people I know are doctors."

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.185
So my mom wanted me to come over here,

00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:37.474
be a specialist or a
small business person.

00:23:37.474 --> 00:23:39.792
I said, "There's only one
problem with that, Mom.

00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:41.131
"Doctors are really smart."

00:23:41.131 --> 00:23:42.455
And she says, "You got a good point there.

00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:45.639
"You're not going to be a doctor."

00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:46.722
So I went to school.

00:23:46.722 --> 00:23:48.558
I have a bachelor of science degree.

00:23:48.558 --> 00:23:50.525
I can drive ships and I can fly planes.

00:23:50.525 --> 00:23:52.317
I flew for the Marine Corps.

00:23:52.317 --> 00:23:55.279
But I've never used any of that education

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:57.296
because I wanted to
become a business owner.

00:23:57.296 --> 00:24:00.529
So it was rich dad who
basically said to me,

00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:02.298
"Become a business owner

00:24:02.298 --> 00:24:04.753
"and learn to be a professional investor."

00:24:04.753 --> 00:24:06.984
So, one of the big differences here

00:24:06.984 --> 00:24:10.067
between these people is called taxes.

00:24:11.746 --> 00:24:16.271
See, in 1943, the US, the
federal government passed a law

00:24:16.271 --> 00:24:20.272
that said employees had to
pay tax before they got paid.

00:24:20.272 --> 00:24:23.466
So when you get your
paycheck from your employer,

00:24:23.466 --> 00:24:25.682
you open it up, and voila.

00:24:25.682 --> 00:24:29.219
The government has already
taken a sizeable chunk of it.

00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:32.218
And the harder you work and
the more money you make,

00:24:32.218 --> 00:24:34.221
the more money they take from you.

00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:37.018
So that's why it's not that
good to be an employee,

00:24:37.018 --> 00:24:38.056
'cause you can never get ahead,

00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:39.293
'cause the more you work,
more money you make,

00:24:39.293 --> 00:24:41.326
the greater they pay in taxes.

00:24:41.326 --> 00:24:44.726
Now the doctors and lawyers
and attorneys, accountants,

00:24:44.726 --> 00:24:45.752
would all laugh and say,

00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:48.958
"These guys, they're going
to pay a lot of taxes,"

00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:52.453
so naturally, the federal
government changed the laws again.

00:24:52.453 --> 00:24:56.620
So in 1986 in the US, a thing
called the '86 Tax Reform Act,

00:24:57.726 --> 00:25:01.058
and it basically took
a lot of the benefits

00:25:01.058 --> 00:25:03.275
away from people who are self employed,

00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:05.297
small business, doctors, and lawyers.

00:25:05.297 --> 00:25:07.814
So today in America, unfortunately,

00:25:07.814 --> 00:25:11.209
these guys pay the highest
percentage in taxes.

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:12.554
It is tragic.

00:25:12.554 --> 00:25:14.542
And a lot of people
think they're investors,

00:25:14.542 --> 00:25:16.464
but what they're really doing

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:18.101
is they're just giving their money

00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:20.806
to people like mutual fund
companies and all that,

00:25:20.806 --> 00:25:24.296
so they're investing, but
they're not really investors.

00:25:24.296 --> 00:25:27.706
See, the big tax breaks are on this side.

00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:29.321
The laws are pretty tight here,

00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:32.407
but this area is very, very gray.

00:25:32.407 --> 00:25:34.259
So by being a business owner

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:36.084
on the right hand side of the quadrant,

00:25:36.084 --> 00:25:37.808
you can make a lot more money

00:25:37.808 --> 00:25:40.705
and pay a smaller
percentage of taxes legally,

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:43.213
and the key word is legally.

00:25:43.213 --> 00:25:44.841
In the investor quadrant,

00:25:44.841 --> 00:25:46.579
it is possible to make millions of dollars

00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:49.482
and pay zero percent taxes legally.

00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:52.080
And so it was my rich
dad who said to, he says,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.732
"Robert, if you really want to be rich,

00:25:54.732 --> 00:25:56.236
"learn to build businesses."

00:25:56.236 --> 00:25:59.759
It made more sense to him to
work hard to build a business,

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:02.262
something you owned and
something you'd pass on

00:26:02.262 --> 00:26:05.026
for generation to generation to your kids,

00:26:05.026 --> 00:26:07.755
whereas my poor dad said, "Work hard."

00:26:07.755 --> 00:26:09.703
But my rich dad said,
"Why would you work hard

00:26:09.703 --> 00:26:11.025
"for something you'll never own

00:26:11.025 --> 00:26:12.799
"and you can get fired from right away?"

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:15.280
Again, that was a difference in values.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.527
So, my rich dad suggested I
learn how to be a business owner

00:26:19.527 --> 00:26:22.722
and learn how to be an investor.

00:26:22.722 --> 00:26:24.722
And that's one of the big differences.

00:26:24.722 --> 00:26:26.093
On this side of the quadrant,

00:26:26.093 --> 00:26:28.189
these people here work for security.

00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:30.287
They work for money, also.

00:26:30.287 --> 00:26:31.783
On this side of it here,

00:26:31.783 --> 00:26:35.950
their key value that they
want is they want freedom.

00:26:37.212 --> 00:26:39.494
They don't want to have
to work at a job anymore.

00:26:39.494 --> 00:26:41.976
They don't want to have to work
for the rest of their lives.

00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:45.043
So one of the beauties of
business for the 21st century,

00:26:45.043 --> 00:26:46.987
it allows people to make the transition

00:26:46.987 --> 00:26:51.224
from the E and the S side
to the B side, especially.

00:26:51.224 --> 00:26:53.757
And so you can become
a big business owner.

00:26:53.757 --> 00:26:55.754
And the difference between an S and a B,

00:26:55.754 --> 00:26:57.335
small business and big business,

00:26:57.335 --> 00:26:59.701
is most of these guys can't quit working.

00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.004
Most small business owners,

00:27:01.004 --> 00:27:03.053
if they stop working
for more than a month,

00:27:03.053 --> 00:27:04.958
the business collapses.

00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.759
They don't really have a business.

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:09.276
Most of these people own a job.

00:27:09.276 --> 00:27:11.984
So the beauty of business
for the 21st century,

00:27:11.984 --> 00:27:15.043
it allows these people
to make the transition

00:27:15.043 --> 00:27:17.253
to the B side so that you don't have to

00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:19.080
keep working hard for money

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.495
and money can actually come in passively.

00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:25.663
Then once you have your
business up and running,

00:27:25.663 --> 00:27:29.720
then I always recommend
you then begin investing

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.561
with your excess cash, paying
less and less in taxes.

00:27:33.561 --> 00:27:35.695
And that's the reason the
rich are getting richer.
