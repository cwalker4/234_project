00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.190
They haven't told me anything.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.820
I want to know about my child.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.309
I've never seen a case that really fits this
complexity.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.870
In terms of decline from their peak, I don't
think I've seen anything quite like this.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.280
I don't have any information on him, I don't
know anything.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.739
We need to get people eating.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.390
Fundamentally, we need to get people eating.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.280
That comes, actually, before the politics.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440
Of course, it does.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.430
The state's a disaster.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.619
This is not a functioning place of sort.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.570
Cops just shoot people in the street, because
they don't trust the penal system.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:37.170
It's not clear if Maduro falls what would
replace him.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.840
In order to learn how Venezuela went from
being the richest nation in Latin America

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.640
to becoming a disaster state, we went directly
to the impoverished nation to speak with the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.740
people living, working, and surviving there
every day.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.570
The minimum wage is five million Bolivares.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.300
You have 3 million in salary, and a two million
food voucher.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.929
But it's not enough, because the basic shopping
basket is well above that amount.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.340
In order to make ends meet, Luis quit school
to find work, so he could buy food for him

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.340
and his mother.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.730
Well they're many people who have two or three
jobs and earn a little bit more and it's enough

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.230
at least to buy bread on a daily basis.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.870
But in my case, I only have one job and one
wage.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.580
This morning, I only had arepas for breakfast
because I didn't have anything to fill them

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.580
with.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.930
I don't know what I'm going to have for lunch
at noon.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.670
I haven't seen what's in the fridge.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.920
In a normal country people don't talk like
this.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.770
I talk to my family members who live abroad
and who live a normal life.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.660
They send me photos.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:05.020
Honestly, their lifestyle is what every youngster
in Venezuela dreams for.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.200
The story Luis shares is heartbreaking, but
it's not unique to him.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.700
This is the day-to-day life in Venezuela.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.060
People can't buy food, because the cost continues
to rise by over 50% each month.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.060
That's the hyperinflation.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.750
Paper money is essentially worthless.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.060
That's the broken economy.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.020
And the shelves at stores are bare, because
the government keeps reducing imports in order

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.160
to try to balance the budget.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.830
That's the corruption.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.269
For clarity on these factors, Real Vision
is fortunate to be working with Jay Newman,

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.799
who came to us with this project in mind.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.290
Nobody knows the geopolitical world better
than Jay does.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.690
He's been an investor in developing countries
for over 30 years and was recently profiled

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.820
in the Wall Street Journal, saying that the
situation in Venezuela has captured his focus

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.730
for a variety of reasons.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.220
Jay and I got to talking, and we realized
stories like Luis' need to be told.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.970
Venezuela is one of those slow-motion train
wreck.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.409
People have seen it coming through years.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.790
They've been part of it for years.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.200
They've watched Chavez and now Maduro for
years.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.900
And for at least a decade, probably even more,
people have said things cannot get any worse

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900
in Venezuela.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.570
And then they get worse every single day,
every week.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.410
So what interested me is the question of how
a wealthy country so close to the US can be

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.120
in such dire circumstances to try to understand
what can be done to fix it.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.690
Talk to me a little bit about the emotions
that the leadership of Venezuela elicits when

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.090
you consider what's happened?

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.409
JN: Venezuela is a country that has tremendous
wealth-- human capital, weather, land, and

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.450
it's been destroyed.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.529
And how does bad government take root and
really thrive?

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:59.260
Because in a perverse way, that's what's happened
over the last 20 years, with Chavez and Maduro.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.890
Bad ideas, bad government, and corruption
have thrived.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:12.789
There has been no more complex situation from
the perspective of geopolitics and debt and

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.750
the intersection of geopolitics, economics,
and debt than Venezuela.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.480
And it's important to think about how a country
that has been isolated so dramatically can

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.029
be brought back into the Western world, which
is where it belongs.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.660
Being an isolated nation means limited trade
and, therefore, limited resources.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.140
That helps explain why 90% of Venezuelans
are living in poverty.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.890
In fact, the average Venezuelan lost over
20 pounds in 2017.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.930
They're starving.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.970
They're dying.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.750
And the leadership has failed to address the
crisis.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.210
We spoke with leading experts to better understand
the devastating impact of hyperinflation,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.120
which continues to cripple the nation's economy
amid rising rates, low wages, and a failing

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120
currency.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.260
People treat the bolivar like an ice cube.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.950
The minute you get paid, it's an ice cube
that you've taken out of the freezer.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.590
And you better have something to do with that
ice cube, because the longer you wait, the

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.060
less of it there's going to be.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.000
Whatever you can get for that ice cube-- ideally,
dollars, because those will preserve their

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.270
value much better.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.310
But if you can't find dollars, you buy bottles
of Tide.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.570
You buy cans of soup.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.620
You buy toothpaste.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.930
You buy whatever is on hand, because that's
going to preserve value, either through barter

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.479
or resell, much more than the currency is.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.809
That means that money is, for all intents
and purposes, worthless.

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:40.490
Back in 2012, the minimum wage was $192.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.080
Today, the minimum wage is $20.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.570
Furthermore, a cup of coffee cost just under
450 bolivars back in 2016.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.710
Today, the same cup costs over 7 million bolivars,
which is equivalent to about $0.50.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.589
To combat inflation, President Maduro simply
cut five zeros off the currency in August

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:02.589
of 2018.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:09.169
So those 7 million bolivars are 70 today,
but still represent a 155,000% increase in

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.260
the cost over the last year.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.810
And if you purchased $1 million worth of Venezuela's
local currency when President Nicolas Maduro

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.800
came to power in 2013, it would now be worth
$2.50 today.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.310
But these are just the numbers.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.469
What does that actually mean in practical
terms?

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:36.750
To find out more, we spoke with Fatima, who
works at her family's bakery in Caracas.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:47.220
I remember when I was a little girl all the
shelves were full of goods, there were a lot

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.220
of products.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.620
And now, we don't even have half of what was
there when I was around 15 or 16 years old.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.490
It's complicated, it's uphill.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.810
We really have to do a thousand things to
be able to subsist, and lend a service to

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.810
people.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:09.550
Because it is more than continuing a business,
it is about the love that we have for everybody.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.810
My dad has been here for more than 23 years,
I'm 24 years old.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.019
Can you believe it?

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:20.032
I have been here since I was a little girl,
and I have known all of our neighbors.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:31.950
It is very difficult to stop providing a service
or to stop what we have been doing forever.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:38.330
Part of how you get into hyperinflation is
a government that makes promises that it cannot

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.330
keep.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.180
This is an economy that has been devastated,
not just by, I think, autocratic populist

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:51.089
policies, but by a legacy of corruption, and
these are hard things to overcome.

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:56.810
If you're going to print money, and the curve
looks like that, and it's going up thousands

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:04.870
of percent every month, year, whatever compared
to, say, 6% annually in the US, of course,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.062
you're going to get hyperinflation.

00:09:06.062 --> 00:09:07.650
Of course, you are.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.960
Another drawback of hyperinflation is a failing
healthcare system.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.280
Venezuelan hospitals are broke, and doctors
are unable to provide patients with proper

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280
care.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280
It's horrible.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.470
We've had to deal with up to four days without
water here.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:36.700
We've had to carry water from the floor below,
from the ground floor up here, and well, sometimes

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.600
it comes and lasts half a day, or if we're
lucky it lasts all day.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.839
But the lack of water is horrible.

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:47.590
Medical professionals are nervous about speaking
to the press for fear of government retribution.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.530
Carlos Leone, a doctor at the Caracas University
Hospital, agreed to speak with us only from

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.210
the safety of his car.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.440
We cannot provide them anything, because there
is no medicine.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.310
There is no running water mostly.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.090
There's no electricity.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.090
Sometimes we do tell the patients you have
to bring your own light bulb to be able to

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:18.200
have light in your room, because the hospital
cannot provide them because of how fast they

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.830
sell them.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:27.330
To know that you could have helped them and
you didn't, because you didn't have a cast

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:34.551
padding, or you didn't have rubbing alcohol,
or you didn't have just the basic, they're

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:39.330
probably going to die.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:46.360
If you go on Twitter, you can find anxiety-driven
parents whose sick children need some medication

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.950
that they can't get hold of, which would be
essentially free to them if it were available.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.940
It's been incredible to watch this unfold
from a country that was relatively normal

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.900
when I got there to this, which is worse than
refugee camps I've seen across the world.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.840
It's a real crisis now.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:12.000
Venezuela, even when I lived there in the
late 2000s or earlier 2010s, politically was

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
a disaster.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.550
The human rights situation was increasingly
grave, but it was livable.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.920
That is no longer the case.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.990
It's very dangerous.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.780
Nobody goes out at night.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.320
And that's something that has created a siege
mentality that permeates both among the government,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.170
who are worried about what happens if they
ever lose power, and among the population.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:38.410
To understand what's going on in Venezuela,
let's dive deeper into its past.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.520
Since oil was discovered 100 years ago, Venezuela
has sometimes lived well on wealth derived

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:49.930
from natural resources.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:12:01.810
But more often, that wealth has been squandered
or stolen by incompetent or corrupt leadership.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.980
Therefore, Venezuelans saw some benefits when
oil prices were high, but suffered disproportionately

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.750
when revenues fell.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.470
In the '90s, funds dwindled, and inflation
and poverty rates rose.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.810
People were restless.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.810
Abuser!

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.810
Animal!

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.450
And turned to a leader who had served in the
military, attempted multiple coups, and was

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.560
seen as a champion of the working man-- Hugo
Chavez.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:38.470
They just loved seeing somebody on TV or in
person and was talking their language.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.360
It was a very smart move say, hey, let's give
a voice to these people.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.900
And it was phenomenal to see him.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.970
Drawing on Fidel Castro's playbook, Chavez
championed his own brand of socialism, which

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.620
became known as Chavismo.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:58.490
Eventually, oil prices rose, and the state
oil company, Petrovesa, became more profitable.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.540
From there, Chavez was able to dribble out
money into social programs.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.760
But from the very beginning, Chavez and his
cronies used government funds to line their

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.880
own pockets.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.260
In addition, social programs often took a
backseat to distributing wealth to Cuba and

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.880
other Caribbean nations in order to buy influence
and recognition.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.520
What might have become a nest egg for the
nation to buffer bad times became a money

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.990
sink, as Chavez spent well beyond his nation's
means.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:29.840
In the end, Chavez's policies led to more
debt and even more inflation.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.420
We Venezuelans, we like colorful metaphors.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:40.620
But it's that for a long time, corrupt politicians
all peed in the pool.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.920
But the Chavez administration was the first
time you could pee off the diving board.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.430
There's no secrets in Caracas.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:53.660
You could wear Rolexes on a government salary
for all your life, and you were essentially

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.560
untouchable unless you crossed some political
boundary.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.490
And then, regardless of whether you'd done
something wrong or not, you were a target.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:08.990
He had the residual loyalty of having launched
these two coups in 1992 from both the army

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.220
and a lot of the population.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:17.700
And he also had a lot of money, so he was
able to promise much, deliver less, but use,

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.839
basically, patronage networks and personality
that resonated to bridge that gap.

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:28.050
Temir Porras: He was somebody who had no schedule.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:35.570
He could be working between 3:00 AM and 6:00
AM and then be exhausted, sleep, and wake

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.530
up and start working on something else.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.640
And it's also extremely challenging for his
opponents.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:50.490
Because he would basically exhaust his opponents
by always being on the attack.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:57.029
He was always on execution mode.

00:14:57.029 --> 00:15:05.770
As time went on, likely with Castro's encouragement,
Chavez drew more and more inspiration from

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:11.839
disreputable neighbors, like Evo Morales of
Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:16.900
These men dealt with their political rivals
through unconventional means.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.200
Chavez took note and became increasingly authoritarian
and went after adversaries who were seen as

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.490
a threat to his rule.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.630
Chavez, at times, seems to have also been
working hand in glove with the Colombian terror

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:33.790
group, FARC, to move drugs and to kill rivals.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.510
He had purged most of his lieutenants at that
point.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:43.570
Most of the most capable members of the United
Socialist Party, if they flew too high, he

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:49.790
would clip their wings, which can be a good
system to make sure you remain in power.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.470
But if you're suddenly gone, it leaves very
much of a vacuum.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.670
The system starts falling apart when Chavez
dies much younger than anybody would've expected.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.529
He was a compulsive coffee drinker.

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.410
He smoked.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.720
He gets cancer at a relatively young age,
dies.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:16.990
He was replaced by Nicolas Maduro, who was,
essentially, a surprise to many of us, in

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.060
part, because he was seen as a bit of a comic
figure.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:27.040
Claudius survived Caligula, killing everybody
by pretending to be mentally disadvantaged.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040
He was a clown.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.399
Nobody took him seriously.

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:32.250
And for a while, I could could've sworn that
Nicolas Maduro had been Claudius.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:41.080
That he had been pretending to be completely
inept to survive in the high-risk world of

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.630
United Socialist politics in Venezuela.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.970
And that now that Chavez was gone and he had
gotten the nod, he was going to leap into

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.970
action.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.250
That never happened.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.290
Machiavelli tells us it's better to be feared
than loved, because fear you can control.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.690
And Chavez was loved.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.470
Maduro has never really been loved, but he
has learned to use fear quite well.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:06.220
And what the government has done more and
more is use violence to bridge that gap and

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.589
to keep the Venezuelan opposition and the
Venezuelan people in check.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.500
So you have sort of an unpopular post-Populism.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:23.640
Maduro's sole claim to legitimacy, given how
unpopular he is, is that Chavez said this

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.890
is the guy.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:31.240
This is the person, this is the rock on which
my movement is going to continue without me.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.030
And the more he departs from the way which
Chavez did business, even though the world

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.490
has changed, the less secure he feels.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:46.260
But he remains in place, because while unpopular
and broke, the levers of power, his ability

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.640
to keep certain key constituencies, including
some of the wealthy or people who have close

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.790
relationships to the government and certain
military interests, he's managed to keep them

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.790
happy.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.870
A regime change is scary to many leaders within
the military.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.520
Because if a new government were ever come
to power, regardless of how bad this government

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:12.620
gets, a new government might investigate what
happened to history's biggest oil bonanza,

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.800
which has disappeared, leaving less than $10
billion in the national reserves.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.030
In recent years, Venezuelan oil production
has fallen off a cliff thanks to statewide

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.030
corruption.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:27.390
Venezuela is estimated to have over $300 billion
barrels of oil-- 20% of the world's proven

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.390
reserves.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.040
And in 2008, it produced 2 and 1/2 million
barrels a day.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:39.050
However, this year, it's estimated that production
may drop by 75% to 600,000 barrels a day.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.460
But the fundamental mistake was made decades
ago when Venezuela chose to focus on the oil

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.510
sector to the exclusion of everything else
from agriculture to minerals to tourism.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:53.890
According to OPEC, Venezuela's oil revenues
account for 98% of export earnings.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:59.090
So periodically, when oil prices drop, Venezuela
has no other exports to rely on.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.180
That's the one drawback of being a one-dimensional
economy.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.960
Coupled with the degradation of the oil production
infrastructure, it will now take billions

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.610
of dollars to revive production.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:18.920
It would take, I think, conservatively, probably
$15 to $20 billion a year for maybe 10 years

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.540
to get it back to where it was pre-Chavez.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.429
Hans Humes: You've got $800 billion of oil
minimum under the ground.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:29.710
It's a huge economic financial incentive for
people to figure out a way to stabilize things

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.710
and increase it.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:36.040
RK: In oil, they are falling at a rate of
50,000 barrels a month.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.860
Some of that has to be used domestically.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.290
Some of it goes to countries, like China and
Russia, who don't pay cash for it.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.660
Because it's being used either in barter or
to pay off previous debts.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.740
So the actual cash they get from that is collapsing
even more dramatically.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.140
HH: If the central government collapses, then
people are going to be smart enough to cross

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.750
the borders, set up an oil field, and start
selling oil.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.780
It's going to happen.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.900
RK: I'd like to see a more diverse economy,
one which is more democratized as an economic

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.900
point of view.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.200
That's going to take time.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.210
Every leader of Venezuela, including Chavez
and Maduro, has talked about how important

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.230
it is to diversify economically.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:18.050
The best time to diversify economically is
when you have a lot of extra capital that

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:23.230
you can use to buttress fledgling industries,
and try and find a way to make them competitive

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.220
in an ever-more international marketplace.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.380
Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves,
yet the cheapest gasoline.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.549
In the '80s, Venezuela attempted to raise
the price of gas to stay in line with global

00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:35.549
standards.

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:39.440
However, the people revolted, and it's since
been an untouchable aspect of the economy.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:46.830
Right now, in dollar terms, one buck can buy
you nearly a million gallons of gas in Venezuela.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.930
HH: Oh, my God-- gasoline.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.930
You pull up.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.640
They don't even want to take money at the
gas stations.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.679
Gas is so cheap that the gas station attendants
are like, just give me a couple of eggs or

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:59.170
give me whatever you feel like.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.000
Essentially, gasoline is given away domestically.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.290
We pay, I think, a third of what the Kuwaitis
pay.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.500
HH: With the inflation, you can't have something
like that function, especially if you cross

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.640
the border, and gas is normal prices.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.830
You could fill up a tanker truck with gasoline
for $7.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.750
You could sell that 100 meters across the
border for $25,000.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:26.490
HH: I mean, that's just one illustration of
an entire economy that's totally silly.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:36.530
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Oh, they pay me with
a cookie or a banana; maybe a cigarette.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.940
But I don't smoke, so I give it to someone
else.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.180
The cookie is more expensive, the cigarette
is more expensive, everything is worth much

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.180
more.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:51.880
It can't be possible that a bottle of water
costs more than a liter of gasoline.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.730
Amid the misused resources and the corruption,
crime has become endemic in the country.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.670
73 Venezuelans died in violent deaths every
day during 2017.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.560
That's over 26,000 murders in one year.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.370
And while official stats aren't kept in regard
to abductions, many believe a key driver of

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.120
the violence is kidnapping.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:21.310
To use a personal example, I met my wife during
a kidnapping in Venezuela.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.210
And this was in 2010 when things were a little
bit easier.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:31.440
And we ended up getting kidnapped by a bunch
of off-duty cops, who then tried to ransom

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:39.059
us off, and beat us up a little, and took
pictures of us to send to our family members

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:41.390
to try and extract as much money as they could.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:47.370
Not only did they spend time trying to find
out what they could get for us and interrogating

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.429
us, which is something cops are trained to
do, one of them took the time to explain to

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:52.700
me why what he was doing was OK.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.510
And that made the facts whatever they might
do to us was justifiable.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:04.830
They were, in a sense, sort of modern day
Jean Valjean figures, not criminal cops, who

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:11.860
were not killing people in exchange for money.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.420
Cops just shoot people in the street, because
they don't trust the penal system.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.250
And they don't have time to deal with it.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:24.030
You have opposition or even protesters who
get taken into dark cells with names like

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:31.050
the tomb and then get tortured as a routine
bureaucratic measure.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.400
Violent crime and ongoing corruption remain
a constant across Venezuela.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.400
And as the Venezuelan government refuses to
work with the rest of the world to reach a

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.130
solution, the US has turned to sanctions as
a means for encouraging change and punishing

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.290
those who remain in power.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:51.049
Donald Trump: The strong one and the less-than-strong
ones-- and you know what I mean by strong--

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:55.400
every option is on the table, with respect
to Venezuela.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.450
RK: Sanctions have become the Swiss army knife
of American foreign policy.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.600
It's become kind of the go-to tool.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:08.520
And so you see that when they feel frustration
or anger with what's going on there, there

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.490
is this tendency to turn to sanctions and
think what you can do more.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.840
Among the sanctions are a prohibition against
US purchases of Venezuelan bonds.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.450
However, with anticipation of the restriction
one day being lifted, people like Hans Humes

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.160
and Jay Newman have considered the investment
opportunities that could emerge.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.360
Yet even Newman, who had a multi-year, multi-billion
dollar negotiation with the Argentinean government,

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.630
acknowledges that this is an unusually sensitive
situation.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:43.500
JN: Creditors are going to be faced with the
need to consider not just their own parochial

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.450
self- interest in getting paid, but how to
help Venezuela get back on track.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.510
There are lots of creative ways to do that.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.200
Venezuela has mineral resources.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.299
It has oil resources.

00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:57.419
It has agriculture resources.

00:24:57.419 --> 00:25:03.429
All of these can be currencies that investors
can be encouraged to invest in in order to

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:04.950
make a bigger pie.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:09.470
But I think that's something that creditors
are not used to thinking about, and they'll

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.620
have to in the case of Venezuela.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.070
HH: There's no way they can manage the economy
worse than they have.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:23.350
But I think that in order for my investors
to make money, I don't need Venezuela to become

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.350
Germany.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:29.179
I just need Venezuela to become kind of like
Venezuela was before.

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:34.910
RK: If you say, in or out now, I'd say, I'd
rather be in than out, because I do think

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.830
there is a recovery story in which you'd do
quite well.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:46.960
Just losing Maduro and putting someone who
maybe speaks English and hasn't had a lot

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.440
of crazy talk about how his dead predecessor
came to him in the form of a bird and told

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.440
him what to do—
If you whistle, I whistle.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440
So I whistled.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.700
The bird looked st me strangely, whistled
a little circled me, and left.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.700
I felt his spirit.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:11.919
The bar is so low that, really, anything could
see him or be marketed actively as this is

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:13.450
a step up, and now, we're getting serious.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.000
And now, we're going to reform.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.500
TP: I don't think there will be a sustainable
solution if there is no dialogue inside the

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:28.419
country and some sort of political deal that
forces everybody there to respect whatever

00:26:28.419 --> 00:26:33.549
decision or arrangement is agreed upon between
the different political forces.

00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:39.500
Of course, with participation from the international
community, but it must be solutions from within.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:46.550
RK: The role that China, Russia, Cuba, India,
perhaps, even too, play in a post-Maduro regime

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.440
will be absolutely critical.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.890
I do think the ambition should be to bring
as many of those countries onside in saying,

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.450
look, you have an interest in the country.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.690
Leaders change.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:04.870
And we will embrace a restructuring process
that allows, in a sense, the national community

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.240
to be broadly engaged.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.751
As Venezuela becomes increasingly unlivable,
an exodus out of the nation continues, as

00:27:11.751 --> 00:27:17.470
hundreds of thousands flee for safety to destinations,
including Colombia, Brazil, the US, and the

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.470
Caribbean.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:24.080
However, in order for recovery to take hold,
the experts believe more must be done to encourage

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.370
native Venezuelans to come back home.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:33.970
If those international skill sets, international
capital, international contact, and international

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:38.170
ethic standards can be brought back into the
government, I think that the chances that

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.110
you could have a paradigm shift becomes much
higher.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:46.299
But the question is, how do you incentivize
people to do so?

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:51.070
Venezuela, for a long time, even after Chavismo
had been there for a while-- and assuming

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.110
you weren't working in politics-- was a great
place to live.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.110
Venezuela has a lot to give.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.160
The tourism industry should be huge.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.320
It's got some of the best beaches in the world,
the world's tallest waterfall.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.000
There's amazing jungles and mountains.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.400
It's got everything-- agriculture, and it's
got the oil.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.620
HH: So there's ample opportunity and ample
natural wealth for the country to come back

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.030
to what it has been historically.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.640
JN: I think we have to be hopeful.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.780
And I think that it's a place where international
institutions and international relationships

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.200
can be brought to bear.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.419
So the IMF, the World Bank, the International
Finance Corporation, all those Bretton Woods

00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:34.780
institutions that help countries develop strong
institutions can all play a role.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.929
I think the United States can play a role.

00:28:36.929 --> 00:28:42.520
Trade and international relationships are
much more productive than isolationism.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:52.010
The ultimate goal is to invest in a way that's
productive, that provides jobs, that makes

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.059
money for investors.

00:28:54.059 --> 00:28:58.560
Because making money for investors is going
to make money for Venezuelans.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.230
The incredible thing is even amid the carnage,
investors see opportunity.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.130
They see a country blessed with incredible
resources and a vibrant culture.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.500
They see a dramatic turnaround happening in
Venezuela.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.309
They see an end to Venezuela's tortuous road
of hyperinflation and starvation.

00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:22.780
But the tragedy of it is the situation threatens
to get even worse before it gets better.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.120
And with Maduro, it's like a wall built around
a state of disaster.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.870
Hopefully, one day, true leaders will be able
to go in and help effectively address the

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:33.870
crisis.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.540
For Real Vision, I'm Brian Price.
