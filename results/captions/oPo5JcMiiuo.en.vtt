00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.002
The President: Thank you
very much, everybody.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.270
Thank you very much.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.073
This is an incredible
time for our country.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.542
I would say that our economy 
-- and many of you know that

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.612
very well -- is doing better 
than it ever has done.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:16.716
Our employment numbers
are the best that they've been,

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:21.020
perhaps ever, but
certainly in recorded history.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.524
Reports just came out
-- best in 44 years.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.893
Black unemployment is the
lowest level in history.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:30.697
Hispanic unemployment,
lowest level in history.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:34.167
Women unemployment,
lowest level in 21 years.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:38.171
It started at 19, went up
to 20; now it's up to 21.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.040
Very soon it's going
to be in history.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.809
We're doing numbers like
we've never seen,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.312
and we have some of the great
industry leaders here today

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.649
who I'm going to be introducing 
in a little while, quickly.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.385
And they're going to do so
much with NASA and so many

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.753
of the great
things we're doing.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.623
But they understand full
well what's happening.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.425
We've never seen a period
of time like this.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.294
The whole world is looking
up to the United States,

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.396
and the United States
is respected again.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.933
There was a period of time
we were not so respected,

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:07.901
not so long ago.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.904
The United States
is respected again.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.306
If I might, I just wanted
to make a brief statement

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:17.477
on immigration and
what's happening.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:23.249
And I'll say it very honestly 
and I'll say it very straight:

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.152
Immigration
is the fault,

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.855
and all of the problems 
that we're having --

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.724
because we cannot get them 
to sign legislation;

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.462
we cannot get them even to the
negotiating table.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:40.033
And I say it's, very strongly, 
the Democrats' fault.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.034
They're obstructing.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.236
They're really
obstructionists.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.438
And they are obstructing.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:51.344
The United States will not
be a migrant camp and it

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:55.482
will not be a refugee
holding facility.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.250
It won't be.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.551
If you look at what's
happening in Europe,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.453
if you look at what's
happening in other places,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.356
we can't allow that to
happen to the United States --

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.825
not on my watch.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.995
For the rest of the world,
you look at everything

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.498
that's taking place --
pick up your newspapers

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.300
this morning and you see.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.805
We want safety and we want
security for our country.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:23.142
If the Democrats would sit down 
instead of obstructing,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:27.714
we could have something 
done very quickly --

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.349
good for
the children,

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.619
good for country, good
for the world.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.487
It could take
place quickly.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.923
We could have an
immigration bill.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.091
We could have --

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.562
child separation -- we're stuck 
with these horrible laws.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:43.429
They're horrible laws.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:50.103
What's happening is
so sad -- is so sad.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:54.707
And it can be taken care
of quickly, beautifully,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.143
and we'll have safety.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.947
This could really be
something very special.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:04.284
It could be something maybe 
even for the world to watch --

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.085
just like they're watching 
our great economy,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.321
how it's soaring.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.289
They could watch this.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.792
We have the worst
immigration laws

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.694
in the entire world.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:18.731
Nobody has such sad, such
bad, and actually,

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.634
in many cases, such
horrible and tough.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.705
You see about child separation; 
you see what's going on there.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:31.277
But just remember, a
country without borders

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.513
is not a country at all.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:34.314
We need borders.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.481
We need security.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:36.316
We need safety.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.651
We have to take
care of our people.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:43.356
You take a look at the
death and destruction

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:47.994
that's been caused by
people coming into this country,

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.964
without going
through a process.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:56.169
We want a merit-based
immigration system

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.540
so that Boeing and Lockheed and
all of the people -- Grumman --

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.308
all of the people 
that are here today,

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.010
the heads of every company,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.913
so that you can hire people on a
merit-based --

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:12.418
you know they're coming in --
they're people that came on merit,

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.454
not based on a
lottery, or not people

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.723
that snuck across
the border.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:19.859
And they could be
murderers and thieves

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.494
and so much else.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:25.732
So, we want a safe
country, and it starts

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.734
with the borders.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.736
And that's the way it is.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.772
Now I'd like to --

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.875
(Applause.)

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.144
-- thank you.

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:39.846
Thank you.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.381
And again, we can do
this very quickly

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.650
if the Democrats come
to the table.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.851
Everybody wants to do it.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.387
We want to do it
more than they do.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.889
If they come to the table, 
instead of playing politics,

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.058
we can do it
very, very quickly.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:58.164
So welcome to the third meeting 
of the National Space Council.

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:00.767
I want to begin by
recognizing our great

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:04.404
Vice President, Mike Pence,
who's been so involved.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.040
And, Mike, I want to thank you 
for the incredible commitment

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.110
to American
leadership in space.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.081
I also want to thank
Secretary Wilbur Ross,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:19.285
Secretary Elaine Chao,
Director Mulvaney,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.621
Director Coats,
Administrator Bridenstine --

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.157
and congratulations,
wherever you are.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.191
Where is he?

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.526
Where is he?

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.727
Congratulations.

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:28.795
You better do a good job.

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.329
(Laughter.)

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.631
I'll say you're fired 
in two minutes.

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:39.505
(Applause.)

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:40.873
You have a
lot of support,

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.742
and you've loved this right
from the beginning.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:43.943
Administrator Bridenstine: 
Yes, sir.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.111
The President: He
was in Congress.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.013
He did an awfully good job, 
but this was his love, right?

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.114
Administrator Bridenstine: 
Yes, sir.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.315
The President:
So, good luck.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.751
Secretary Wilson, General Dunford,

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.354
Undersecretary Thompson, 
Deputy Secretary Shanahan,

00:05:55.354 --> 00:06:01.327
and Acting Deputy Secretary Grady 
for being here today.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:05.665
We're honored to be joined
by Congressmen Robert Aderholt,

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.801
Brian Babin,
and Dana Rohrabacher.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.269
Stand up, Congressmen.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.237
Please.

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.305
Please.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.206
Thank you.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.173
Thank you.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.241
Thank you.

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:18.578
(Applause.)

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:23.249
And a special welcome to a 
strong, powerful, wonderful woman.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.020
Does a great job as governor 
of one of my favorite places

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.922
in the world, Alabama --

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.057
Kay Ivey.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.358
Kay.

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:38.064
(Applause.)

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.732
Am I doing
okay in Alabama?

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:40.967
Participant: Yes, sir.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.401
Governor Ivey: I better
do okay in Alabama.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.303
We love Alabama.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:47.974
I also want to recognize
three true American heroes.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:52.445
The first woman to command
a Space Shuttle,

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.380
the great Eileen Collins.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.149
Stand up, Eileen.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:00.019
(Applause.)

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.087
Great job.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.722
Great job.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.224
That's a lot of
time in space.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.760
Along with legendary 
Apollo astronauts

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.896
Jack Schmitt and Buzz Aldrin.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.831
Buzz has been a friend
of mine for a long time.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.267
Jack, thank you very much.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.302
Thank you, great.

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:20.139
(Applause.)

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.277
And I also have a list of 
some of the CEOs and chairmen

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.445
and presidents of these 
incredible companies.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.615
Wes Bush, CEO of
Northrup Grumman.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.383
Where's Wes?

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.584
Wes, thank you.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:33.419
Thank you very much.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.288
Thank you, Wes.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.324
Gwynne Shotwell, Gwynne?

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.359
Stand up, Gwynne.

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.662
She'll end up running
for office, right?

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:45.398
(Applause.)

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:48.801
Bob Smith, CEO of Blue Origin, 
who's very active.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.502
Thank you, Bob.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.070
I hear you're
doing a great job.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.406
(Applause.)

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.475
President and CEO, 
United Launch Alliance.

00:07:56.475 --> 00:08:00.346
That's a combination of
Boeing and Lockheed

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:03.683
on the Space Launch System, SLS.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:06.586
I don't like when Boeing
and Lockheed get together

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:10.256
because the pricing only 
goes up, but that's okay

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.490
in this case.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.491
(Laughter.)

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:13.492
I don't know.

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:14.627
I don't love that stuff.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:15.761
We're going to have to
talk about that,

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.730
your joining those two
companies, oh.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.931
(Laughter and applause.)

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:19.966
Oh, boy.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.400
Look at Dennis.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.170
Dennis is so happy.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.339
I don't like
that stuff, Mike.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.875
(Laughter.)

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:32.912
Marillyn Hewson, who has 
done a fantastic job

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:35.581
at Lockheed Martin, Marillyn?

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.950
Marillyn -- you have done.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.253
(Applause.)

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.821
What do you
think of that merger

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.524
for the space -- what
do you think?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.025
Look at them; they're
sitting together.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.460
Oh, Boeing.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.061
(Laughter.)

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:50.463
Oh, it's --
no wonder we don't get

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:52.665
the pricing we want, huh?

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.300
Dennis Muilenburg,
friend of mine.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.067
A great guy.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:55.935
The head of Boeing.

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:58.170
And, boy, have you done a
good job on all fronts --

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.939
commercial, military.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:00.606
Both of you.

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:01.674
What a job
you've both done.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:02.341
Thank you.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.009
(Applause.)

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:03.676
Stay apart.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:04.810
Stay apart.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.745
Don't get together.

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.079
Stay apart.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.950
And, you know, just a
great group of other executives

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.551
are here
from the top companies.

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:14.654
And it's patriots like you
that are the reason

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:18.858
why America was first in
flight, first to the moon,

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:22.995
and why America will
always be first in space.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.665
You know, before I got
here, it wasn't looking so good.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.332
(Applause.)

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:31.337
Before we
came in, I will tell you,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.908
they didn't have such
big plans for space.

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.176
Now they have plans.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.346
And it's great, not only in 
terms of jobs and everything else;

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:43.616
it's great for the 
psyche of our country.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:46.118
This morning it came out
that small business

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:49.055
is the most optimistic it's ever
been in the history

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:49.722
of our country.

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.057
That's pretty good.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.426
Now, I don't know if
they go back to 1776.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.994
I don't know if they go
back to, you know,

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:58.831
areas of a little bit earlier,
slightly, like by 100 years

00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.699
or 200 years.

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:03.336
But I will tell you, I
have never seen optimism

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:05.671
like we have right now.

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.940
So, it's a very
exciting time.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.345
I want to also say that
when it comes to space,

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.246
too often, for too many years,

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:18.651
our dreams of exploration and 
discovery were really squandered

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:22.588
by politics and bureaucracy,
and we knocked that out.

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:25.524
So important for our psyche, 
what's you're doing.

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:29.662
It's going to be important
monetarily and militarily.

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:32.765
But so important for right
up here -- the psyche.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:38.070
We don't want China and Russia 
and other countries leading us.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:43.209
We've always led -- we've gone 
way far afield for decades now,

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.544
having to do
with our subject today.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:46.946
We're going to be
the leader by far.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:50.383
We're behind you a
thousand percent.

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:53.953
America's vital interest
in space lost out

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:57.723
to special interests in
Washington, except, of course,

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:00.126
for the senators
and congressmen here.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:00.960
They would never do it.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.627
Right, Dana?

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:04.263
But all of that
is changing.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.564
We know that.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:09.001
My administration is
reclaiming America's heritage

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:14.006
as the world's
greatest space-faring nation.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.108
The essence of the
American character

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:21.680
is to explore new horizons and
to tame new frontiers.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.084
But our destiny, beyond
the Earth, is not only

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:30.456
a matter of national identity, 
but a matter of national security.

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.525
So important for
our military.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.492
So important.

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:35.861
And people don't
talk about it.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.532
When it comes to defending
America, it is not enough

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:43.235
to merely have an American
presence in space.

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:47.540
We must have American
dominance in space.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.708
So important.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:53.079
Very importantly, I'm
here by directing

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.683
the Department of Defense and
Pentagon to immediately begin

00:11:57.683 --> 00:12:01.287
the process
necessary to establish

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:07.026
a space force as the sixth
branch of the armed forces.

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.994
That's a big statement.

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:12.064
We are going to have the
Air Force and we are going

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:17.903
to have the Space Force
-- separate but equal.

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.405
It is going to
be something.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.573
So important.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:24.110
General Dunford, if you would 
carry that assignment out,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.178
I would be very 
greatly honored, also.

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.114
Where's General Dunford?

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:29.849
General?

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:30.850
Got it?

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.184
General Dunford:
We got it.

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.619
The President: Let's
go get it, General.

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:42.495
(Applause.)

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.364
But that's the importance 
that we give it.

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:48.367
We're going to have
the Space Force.

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:53.005
One year ago, I revived
the National Space Council

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:55.641
and put exactly the right
man in charge,

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.309
and that's our friend, Mike Pence.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:59.411
He feels very
strongly about this.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.982
And in December, I signed
a historic directive

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:06.752
that will return Americans to
the moon for the first time

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:10.689
since 1972, if
you can believe that.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:16.662
(Applause.)

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:20.533
Always remembering 
it's about that,

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:23.402
but it's also about
jobs and the economy.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:26.305
This is a great
thing we're doing.

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:28.874
This time, we will do more
than plant our flag

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:30.342
and leave our footprints.

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:33.312
We will establish a
long-term presence,

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:39.251
expand our economy, and build
the foundation for the eventual

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.786
mission to Mars --

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:44.223
which is actually going 
to happen very quickly.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.058
And, you know, I've always
said that rich guys

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.860
seem to like rockets.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.096
So all of those rich guys that 
are dying for our real estate

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.398
to launch
their rockets,

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:53.566
we won't charge you too much.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:54.567
Just go ahead.

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.902
If you beat us to Mars,
we'll be very happy

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:59.471
and you'll be even
more famous.

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:01.273
But they do like
-- explain that.

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.074
Where's Eric?

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.810
They do like rockets,
for some reason, huh?

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.844
They like those rockets.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:06.579
But you know what?

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.782
If -- as long as he's
-- as long as it's

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:13.252
an American rich person,
that's good, okay?

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.220
(Laughter.)

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.821
They can beat us.

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:19.291
(Applause.)

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.559
We'll save a
little money,

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.561
and they can beat us and we're 
taking full credit for it.

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:23.762
Don't worry about it.

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:25.097
(Laughter.)

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.865
But we'll be setting 
aggressive timelines,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.867
challenging old
ways of doing business,

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:31.570
and we will be
expecting real results.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.874
And we are making our
incredible facilities -- okay

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:38.777
-- available to these
people that have been

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:42.748
doing so incredibly by
themselves on rocketry.

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:45.317
So, you're invited.

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:47.052
The rent won't be high.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:49.855
I am instructing my
administration to embrace

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:53.459
the budding commercial
space industry.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:58.163
We are modernizing
out-of-date space regulations.

00:14:58.163 --> 00:14:59.498
They're way out of date.

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:02.901
They haven't been changed
in many, many years.

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:05.537
And today we're taking one
more step to unleash

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:08.507
the power of American
ingenuity.

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:11.410
In a few moments, I will
sign a new directive

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.679
to federal departments
and agencies.

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.849
They will work together
with American industry

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.752
to implement a
state-of-the-art framework

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:23.522
for space traffic
management.

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:26.759
But don't let it get too
out of control, please.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.029
We know about what's going
on with a lot of other

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.163
rules and regulations.

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:34.366
By the way, we've set the
all-time record in history

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:37.836
of this country in
cutting regulation.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:40.339
So, when I hear about
that, I get a little bit --

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:43.409
(Applause.)

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.377
-- a little bit tenuous.

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:46.578
Be careful.

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:48.514
Don't get too
carried away.

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:49.815
But we have.

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:51.784
We've cut more regulations
than any administration,

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.119
whether it's four years,
eight years, or sixteen years,

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:55.254
in one case.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.423
We've cut more regulations
than any other President

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:58.891
in history.

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:02.561
And I actually think that,
along with the massive tax cuts,

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.763
I think that the
regulation cutting

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:07.933
may have even had more of an
impact on the economy.

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:09.068
It's been incredible.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.636
We have regulation.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.637
We have a lot
of regulation.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.272
We have good regulation.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.574
But you don't need 20 years 
to get rejected

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.076
from building a highway.

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.111
We can reject you in
two years or one year.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.847
We have it down from
seventeen years,

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:22.514
down to two.

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:24.249
We expect to get
it down to one.

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.918
And if it's not good,
we're going to reject.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.286
But it's going to
be a fast rejection.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:29.521
You're not going to go an
entire lifetime

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:32.958
only to find it's not
going to be built.

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.561
Two previous administrations 
tried and failed

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:40.599
to develop a system to deal 
with congested conditions in orbit.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.768
We are finally going
to get it done.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:43.936
It's going to happen fast.

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:46.772
One year from now, our
nation will mark

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:49.341
an important milestone in
human history:

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:53.946
half a century since Americans
first stepped off the Eagle

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.114
and onto the moon.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:59.685
That was a big -- that
was a big day, right?

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.820
In that magnificent moment,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.959
the American astronaut embodied 
the incredible spirit of America:

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:10.929
the confidence of a cowboy, 
the skill of a fighter pilot,

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.531
the ambition of a scientist,

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:18.370
and the courage of a true,
true, brilliant, tough warrior.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:23.675
They bounded fearlessly into 
the unknown to be there first.

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.978
They did the impossible
because they knew that,

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:29.681
together, there is
absolutely nothing

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:31.483
Americans can't do.

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:36.922
When we get together,
there's nobody even close.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:40.592
Now we are ready to begin
the next great chapter

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:44.129
of American space
exploration.

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.731
This is a very
important day.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:49.435
This is a very
important gathering.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:54.039
A new generation of young
people seeks to challenge --

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:57.509
really challenge hard
-- to get their talent

00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:00.245
and their skill to work.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.248
And now we're giving them
a forum and a platform

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:07.052
from which they can put
that genius to work.

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:09.288
Legions of welders and metalworkers,

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:13.125
scientists and engineers stand 
ready to build a powerful

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.695
new rocket and gleaming
new spaceships.

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.464
And that goes with all
of the other things

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:21.133
that we're building
in our country.

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:26.038
Our nation of pioneers still 
yearns to conquer the unknown,

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.307
because we are Americans

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:32.678
and the future belongs
totally to us.

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:36.682
Once more, we will launch
intrepid souls blazing through

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.384
the sky and
soaring into the heavens.

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:42.120
Once more, we will summon
the American spirit

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.225
to tame the next great
American frontier.

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:50.229
And once more, we will
proudly lead humanity --

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.865
and that's what it is,
it's humanity --

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:57.369
beyond the Earth and into those
forbidden skies,

00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:00.506
but they will not be
forbidden for long.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.110
You're very
important people.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.313
You have a great,
great contribution.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:14.286
What you're doing has been
incredible, but it will be

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:18.323
even more incredible --
far more incredible --

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.925
because we are giving you
a platform,

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:25.197
the likes of which nobody 
has ever been given before.

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.466
I am a big believer.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:30.435
You will go out there
and you will take that frontier,

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:35.841
which is largely
unknown by man or woman,

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:41.680
and you will learn everything 
there is to know about it.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.682
And what you're doing is
so important --

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:49.922
remember -- economically,
militarily, scientifically.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:54.993
In every way, there is
no place like space.

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:58.997
Good luck, General Dunford
and the Joint Chiefs.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:03.335
I want to wish you a lot
of luck with Space Force.

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.337
But that shows how
important it is.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.673
Congratulations on your
tremendous success,

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.976
but you're going to have far
more success right now.

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:11.910
Thank you very much.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.911
Thank you.

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:13.879
Thank you.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.047
Thank you, Mike.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:37.803
(Applause.)

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:39.471
Okay, everybody.

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:41.573
Here's a big one, right?

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:44.076
Would anybody like
me not to sign this?

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.444
(Laughter.)

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:46.845
Is there
anybody in this room?

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.981
They would be in big
trouble, I think.

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.983
(The directive is signed.)

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:18.944
(Applause.)

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.046
Thank you, everybody.

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.648
I have a few pens.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.349
Pass them around, okay.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:25.584
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:26.752
Congratulations.

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:27.886
Great day.

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:29.221
Thank you.
