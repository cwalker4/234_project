00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.480
1.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.090
Pepper
A woman named Pepper was kidnapped at the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.940
age of four and raised by a woman named Shirley
Berthelot along with another girl, a little

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.880
older, named Renee.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.940
She remembered a few details from her previous
life.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.510
Her name was Rhonda (before Shirley changed
it to Pepper) and her parents named Barbara

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.790
and Bob.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.019
Barbara had a big blonde bouffant hairstyle
and she had a yellow canopy bed.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.510
Pepper always knew Berthelot was not her grandmother,
and begged her to tell her who her real family

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.930
was.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.299
But even up until her last gasp Berthelot
continued to torture them and repaid their

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.980
kindness by refusing to put the girls out
of their misery and she took her secret to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.160
her grave.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.390
Which left pepper without a social security
number or birth certificate.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.940
So pepper began her search for her real family
at the hall of records in Los Angeles.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.770
Frustratingly, wherever she looked, she discovered
that she simply did not feature in any official

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.240
records.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.440
Pepper had all but given up hope of finding
her birth parents before a fluke breakthrough

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.520
in 2009 when a church friend offered to adopt
her in order to get her an official identity.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.130
During the adoption process a government official
came across her original adoptive birth certificate.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.510
On it, her name was Rhonda Patricia Christie,
with Barbara and Bob Christie listed as her

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.220
parents
She found Barbara and Bob , who were elderly

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.220
by that point.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.110
As it turns out, Bob and Bobby were her adoptive
parents and it was Shirley, the woman who

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.950
kidnapped her, who initially brought Pepper
to their doorstep when she was 3 months old.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.540
According to her adoptive parents, Shirley
told them the child's mother was a drug addicted

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.349
prostitute who couldn't care for the child.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.200
Bob and Bobby legally adopted the child and
had her for four years when Shirley showed

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.360
up with Renee and suggested the girls have
a sleepover.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.099
The girls had played together before, so they
agreed.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.370
As it turns out, Renee was actually the biological
sister to Pepper.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.450
At some point, Renee told Shirley she wished
she had a sister...so Shirley made it happen.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.099
She left town with Pepper in the middle of
the night.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.520
Their story was covered by NBC in a Dateline
episode called The Girl Who Didn’t Exist,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.220
which aired in March 2011.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.380
In it Pepper and Renee are seen reuniting
with the Christies.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.050
After seeing the episode, the biological mother
for Pepper and Renee named Jehri Coleman came

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.030
forward with another crazy claim: the children
were kidnapped not once, but twice.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.070
And she has more news: they have a brother
too.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.120
Jehri claims that she had employed a babysitter
named Shirley Berthelot to look after Pepper

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.040
and Renee in a motel in nearby Gardena, while
she was in hospital with complications following

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.810
the birth of their little brother Raymond.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.960
According to Jehri when she was discharged,
her children, and their babysitter, had simply

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.290
vanished.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.110
Berthelot, for reasons that are not all together
clear and their mother cannot even today fully

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.260
explain - had given Pepper to Bob and Bobby
.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.990
Berthelot then handed Ray to another couple,
but kept Renee to herself.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.099
Again, why she did this, nobody has ever been
able to answer.

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.830
Eventually that couple couldn't care for Ray
and he ended up in foster care.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.750
Dateline tracked him down and everyone was
reunited.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.550
Pepper, Renee, the adult brother, and their
biological mother.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.970
Now this is where things start to get fuzzy.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.070
Pepper really was kidnapped from Bob and Barbara,
That much seems to add up.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.340
But the claims that whole brood was kidnapped
from jehri by Shirley right after the son's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.400
birth is problematic.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.490
You see pepper was adopted by Bob and Bobby
when she was 3 months old and jehri claimed

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.660
the brother is a couple years younger than
pepper.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:32.210
So how is it possible then that pepper was legally adopted by bob and barbara at age 3 months if raymond was few years younger than her.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:41.780
It possible that jehri was a drug addict and willingly gave the children to Shirley.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:52.770
Nonetheless, the family 
has now reconciled and, Pepper (who changed

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.940
her name back to Rhonique, her birth name),
had been legally adopted by her birth mother.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.250
2.The murder of Dorothy Donovan

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.919
At around midnight on June 22, 1991, factory
worker Charles Holden was leaving a fast food

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.880
restaurant when a stranger came to his truck,
asking for a ride.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.630
The stranger said that his sister was having
a baby and that he needed to get to the hospital.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.430
Charles first said he couldn't because he
lived just a few blocks away but eventually

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.110
changed his mind and took the man .

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.979
But a few minutes after being picking up the
stranger, Charles stopped at an intersection

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.800
where he would normally turn to drive home,
and the stranger attacked him, demanding his

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.490
money as well as his truck.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.960
Charles ran to a store to get help, but the
stranger, armed with a screwdriver, raced

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.020
after him, at which point Charles said he
would take the violent man wherever wanted

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.040
to go.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.550
However, as the stranger went around to enter
the passenger side of the truck, Charles sped

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.150
off and the stranger tried to run after him
but gave up quickly.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.960
Charles then began to drive around a bit trying
to shake off his experience at almost being

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.350
car-jacked . When Charles finally started
to return home, he noticed the stranger was

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:21.520
lurking around his house and he promptly drove
away again to call the police from a pay phone.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.910
A police officer went with him to his home

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.020
and that of his mother, Dorothy Donovan, who
lived in the main house behind his.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.979
They found that the back door window had been
broken and there was blood inside the house.

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:39.710
They then went up the stairs to her bedroom
and found her dead.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.930
She had been stabbed to death.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.789
Nothing had been stolen from the house, and
authorities suspected that Charles was the

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:45.789
one who was responsible, until physical evidence
was found that did not belong to him.

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:47.090
The stranger remained unidentified.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:53.760
At first, the police suspected Charles of
the murder given the complexity of the crime,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.259
but they soon found witnesses at the fast
food restaurant who confirmed that the stranger

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:04.819
asking for a ride did exist, and Police also
found a bloody palm print on a banister and

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:09.819
DNA evidence that did not match Charles and
he was cleared.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:17.130
The stranger is described as being in his
late 20s or early 30s, 5'8", with a slender

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:24.569
build and pock-marked complexion, he was also
described as having worn plastic framed glasses

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.199
with over-sized lenses.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:31.259
Authorities believe that he may have been
on drugs at the time of the murder.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:38.829
In February 2006, DNA evidence at the scene
along with the bloody palm print on the banister

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:45.190
identified Dorothy's killer as Gilbert E.
Cannon of Delmar, Maryland, who was arrested

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.000
and charged with first degree murder.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.329
He told authorities that he was on drugs at
the time of the murder and was looking for

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:55.120
a place to stay.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.779
Furthermore, the killer said he chose Dorothy's
house because it was the first one he could

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:05.339
find that didn't have any lights on, and not
because of any connection to man he had just

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.259
attempted to car-jack.

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:12.649
He pled guilty to the murder and was sentenced
to life in prison without the possibility

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:14.720
of parole.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:25.339
3.Murder of Elise Makdessi
Shortly before 10pm on May 14, 1996, emergency

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:31.040
services in Virginia Beach receive a call
from Eddie Makdessi, screaming that his wife

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.819
Elise is being raped and stabbed by an intruder.

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:41.920
The paramedics arrive at their house to find
Elise tied to the bed in critical condition

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.670
and another man lying dead on the floor having
been shot.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.510
At the hospital, Elise dies of her injuries.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:55.009
Elise’s husband told the police that he
and his wife were entering their apartment

00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:57.339
when he was struck from behind.

00:09:57.339 --> 00:10:04.720
He lost consciousness, and when he came to,
he saw a man raping his wife.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.679
Makdessi claims that the man then stabbed
his wife before attacking him.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:14.239
Makdessi claimed he shot him dead in self-defense.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.709
Eddie's injuries seem to back up his story.

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:22.550
The dead man is identified as Quincy Brown,
a man who worked with Elise in the air traffic

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.529
control base in the navy.

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:30.239
The police searched the apartment and found
a videotape of Elise in which she tearfully

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:35.100
recounts that she was sexually assaulted and
raped multiple times while serving in the

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.170
Navy.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.939
She claimed that these assaults happened when
she was on duty at the Naval Air Station,

00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:42.959
Oceana.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:49.100
Elise kept a list of the people who assaulted
her, and Quincy Brown’s name was included.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.259
Though the police say that they felt something
was wrong, they checked the scene of the crime

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:59.070
and seemed to believe Eddie Makdessi’s version
of events.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:06.269
One month before this double homicide, Makdessi
took out a $500,000 life insurance policy

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:08.019
on his wife.

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:14.989
Makdessi also collected Elise’s $200,000
Navy life insurance policy, and then left

00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:16.839
the United States.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:22.550
He went to Russia, remarried, and settled
down into a new life.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:29.149
Makdessi thought the case was closed, but
the police continued to investigate it.

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:36.019
Police begin to doubt Eddie's story-it seems
odd that he just came back into consciousness,

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:41.720
then had the presence of mind to get his gun
and accurately shoot Quincy.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.529
Friends begin to report that he was controlling
of Elise.

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:50.230
Blood spatter analysts find that Quincy had
been on his knees when he was shot.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:56.749
Also, it is found that on the night of the
murder, Eddie and Elise had gone out for dinner.

00:11:56.749 --> 00:12:01.749
That night, Elise had made a lengthy phone
call to Quincy from a pay phone.

00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:08.069
Also, although Eddie insists that Quincy was
in their house when they got home, Quincy

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:15.350
was found to have made a cell phone call to
the Makdessis' house that evening, so they

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.600
must have been at the house before he was.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.489
There is no evidence of forced entry.

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:28.709
They finally reached the conclusion that Makdessi
and his wife conspired to extract money from

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:32.970
the Navy and murdered Brown as part of their
plan.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:38.540
According to police, Makdessi and Elise lured
Brown to their apartment to have sex with

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.759
Elise.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:45.899
Brown tied Elise up and without Brown realizing,
Makdessi shot him dead.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:50.489
Then Makdessi double-crossed his own wife
and stabbed her to death.

00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:56.230
Elise made this videotape of false accusations
as part of their plan to defraud the Navy.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:02.510
He hurt himself to make it appear that Quincy
invaded the house, knocked him out, raped

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:08.019
and killed Elise, and then he awoke from unconsciousness
and shot the intruder.

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:12.560
Eddie staged the crime scene and he almost
got away with it.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.359
But investigators figured out this was a ‘set
up’ based on the crime scene evidence, interviews

00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:24.109
with Elise’s co-workers, the video tape,
and the large insurance policy.

00:13:24.109 --> 00:13:32.790
They also Found that Elise’s sexual harassment
and sexual assault claims were in fact fabricated.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:38.759
All the men she accused of sex crimes in the
video passed a polygraph examination and her

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:44.949
supervisors testified that Elise never reported
sexual harassment or sexual assault like she

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.259
claimed in her video testimony.

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:54.699
Eddie Makdessi was arrested when he landed
in the States, and in 2006 was convicted of

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:59.389
the double murder of Elise Makdessi and Quincy
Brown.

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:07.600
4.The Murder Of Baby Hope
On July 23, 1991, construction workers found

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.389
what looked to be a normal cooler, the kind
people use to carry food, ice and cold drinks

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:16.019
for camping or picnicking.

00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:20.879
When they opened the cooler, they found the
decomposing body of a child.

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:28.629
The child would go unrecognized for 22 years,
though her headstone bore the name "Baby Hope".

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:33.839
Baby Hope was malnourished and after being
examined and tested, it was shown that she

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:38.639
had suffered sexual abuse and her cause of
death was asphyxia.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:44.109
No claims of missing children had been filed
and her body was so badly decomposed that

00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:46.959
it was hard to make out her facial features.

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:52.769
Baby Hope was naked except for a hair tie
with yellow baubles attached to it.

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:58.129
Over a week before the discovery, a witness
had seen a Hispanic couple walking alongside

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.929
the Parkway with a cooler.

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:07.269
Since the child’s identity was unknown,
authorities appealed to the public for information.

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:13.209
Police made every effort to find out who this
little Angel was and their attempts failed.

00:15:13.209 --> 00:15:18.679
Baby Hope was buried two years later with
the Police of the 34th Precinct coming together

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:22.119
to raise the money to give her a proper burial.

00:15:22.119 --> 00:15:27.230
Baby Hope was wearing a white communion dress
when she was buried and her gravestone bore

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.160
the name she had been given by those who seemed
to have cared about her more than anyone who

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.100
actually knew her.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.649
Complete strangers gave her a headstone with
the inscription: "Because We Care"

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:45.749
During the summer of 2013, the Baby Hope case
was reopened and re-publicized.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:52.170
Shortly thereafter, authorities received information
leading them to a woman named Margarita Castillo,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:58.959
who claimed that her four-year-old daughter,
Anjelica, had gone missing two decades earlier.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:04.709
According to Margarita, Anjelica’s father
had taken off with the child in 1991, but

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:06.729
she was never reported missing.

00:16:06.729 --> 00:16:12.839
DNA samples extracted from Baby Hope’s body
were compared with Margarita’s DNA, and

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:19.709
they proved to be a perfect match.In October,
the investigation led to Margarita’s cousin,

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:24.889
Conrado Juarez, a 52-year-old dishwasher from
Manhattan.

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:31.059
After being questioned by police, Juarez confessed
to sexually abusing Anjelica before smothering

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:32.089
her to death.

00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:37.319
With the help of one of his sisters, he then
placed the child’s body in a cooler and

00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:40.089
left it alongside the Parkway.

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:44.999
Juarez was indicted for the murder and is
currently awaiting trial.

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:53.870
After 22 years, Baby Hope was finally laid
to rest under her real name, Anjelica Castillo.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:17:00.209
5.Benjaman Kyle
One of the most mysterious amnesia cases of

00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:05.620
all time involved an individual known as “Benjaman
Kyle.”

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:13.630
On August 31, 2004 at 5:00 am a beaten naked
man was found unconscious behind the dumpster

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.959
of a Burger King.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:20.449
The man had no driver’s license, wallet
or any other identification.

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:25.160
After waking up at the hospital from being
unconscious, the hospital staff asked for

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.610
his name.

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.510
He could not remember his name or social security
number.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.009
The man suffered from cataracts on both eyes
which he was able to operate 9 months after

00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:38.130
a charity raised the money.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:44.490
Upon seeing himself in the mirror, he was
surprised to see he was 20 years older he

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.160
thought he was.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.970
Doctors determined that he was suffering from
retrograde amnesia.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:58.850
He took the name ‘Benjaman Kyle’ due to
it having the same initials as Burger King

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.980
and he believed ‘Benjaman’ might be his
first name.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:09.220
He was certain that he had lived in Indianapolis,
Indiana, and in Boulder, Colorado.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:15.800
He had memories of a state fair in Indianapolis,
a cemetery, and the downtown area as it had

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.830
looked years before.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:23.429
He also remembered the University of Colorado
library and a specific seat he used there,

00:18:23.429 --> 00:18:26.600
and a restaurant he frequently visited.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.190
Benjaman spent many years between shelters
and hospitals.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:37.039
With no identification or social security
he was unable to obtain legal employment or

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:38.710
a place to stay.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.120
He was the only person on the missing database
that was not missing.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:51.659
In 2007 he was diagnosed with dissociative
amnesia which he suffered since 2004.

00:18:51.659 --> 00:18:57.580
Benjaman was featured in Dr.Phil, Jeff Probst
and even on a segment of News4Jax.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:04.429
In 2011 he caught a big break when he was
asked to be featured in a short documentary

00:19:04.429 --> 00:19:07.299
named “Finding Benjaman”.

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:14.289
The purpose was meant to help his situation
from a legal standpoint and perhaps even find

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:15.809
his family.

00:19:15.809 --> 00:19:20.480
Despite the many efforts to get the word out
nobody came forward.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.711
DNA testing and fingerprint checks turned
up empty, and even though Benjaman’s story

00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:31.850
received a lot of media coverage, no one seemed
to recognize him.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:40.690
Finally, in September 2015, Benjaman publicly
announced that CeCe Moore of theDNAdetectives.com

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.870
had used his DNA samples to match him with
his biological family.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:52.210
He was originally from Indiana and had apparently
broken off all contact with his family, who

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.170
had not seen him since 1976.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:01.700
The former Benjaman Kyle has since tracked
down his original birth certificate and Social

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:08.820
Security records and used them to obtain a
new identification card under his real name.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.840
He did not release any further details at
this time for privacy reasons.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:22.900
On November 21, 2016 Benjaman Kyle’s true
name was revealed to be William Burgess Powell.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.580
It was also reported that he found his family.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:38.910
The case of benjamin kyle was finally solved
after 11 years.
