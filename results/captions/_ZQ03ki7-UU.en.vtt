00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.500
in 1945 some workers in Egypt
accidentally dug into an early Christian

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.230
tomb inside they found a large jar
containing 13 leather-bound manuscripts

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.680
which were composed of 48 separate works
practically all of these works are

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.290
Gnostic meaning they teach salvation
through mystical knowledge and one of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.020
these manuscripts contains the Gospel of
Thomas in Gnosticism people are believed

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.390
to be souls and material bodies only
through true knowledge can they ascend

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.180
and according to this religion Jesus is
the Redeemer who came to communicate

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.000
that knowledge and liberate man he
communicated this knowledge to selected

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.650
disciples one of them being Thomas in
almost all spiritual paths or traditions

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
that are followed eventually that which
is discovered

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.800
leads to this same ascension and if
these teachings have been placed in the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.810
modern Bible the message may possibly
have been clearer and more focused on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.630
the power that is held within each
person the Gospel according to Thomas

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.810
doesn't tell a story it's a compilation
of approximately 114 sayings attributed

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.530
to Jesus the opening words of the
document read these are the secret words

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.070
which Jesus the Living one spoke and
didymus Judas Thomas wrote down and he

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.690
said whosoever finds the interpretation
of these sayings shall never taste death

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.950
let not him who seeks desist until he
finds when he finds he will be troubled

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.239
when he is troubled he will marvel and
he will reign over the universe the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.690
sayings themselves are not the secret
the secret lies in their interpretation

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.019
when you find the true answers it will
trouble you because it goes against most

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.569
of what you've been taught and when the
truth of it sets in it will marvel you

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.769
and then you will know your power that
you have supreme reign over your life

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.560
and everything in it that you truly can
experience heaven on earth the Gospel of

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.269
Thomas has been eliminated from the
Bible and there are many explanations as

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.030
to the reasoning some religious leaders
express that if you read it and compare

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.069
it to what you see in the New Testament
it's a very different kind of book

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.100
presenting a quite different Jesus they
claim that these particular teachings

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.689
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.530
about Jesus meshed with certain
philosophical principles that only grew

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:20.609
in popularity but that they aren't
necessary to the work of the Bible how

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.879
many have heard of the lost gospel of
thomas the lost gospel of thomas some of

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.060
you have heard of that text very very
powerful text the lost gospel of thomas

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.620
is powerful because it is believed to be
the actual words of jesus as he was

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.159
teaching those around him how to use the
power of human emotion in his life and

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:54.150
if the indigenous people know it and if
the ancient people know it why don't we

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.709
know it what happened to our knowledge
well this is a very good question and

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:07.799
the answer is this in our Western
tradition and I'm when I say Western I'm

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.810
assuming that we are of the
judeo-christian tradition is what I'm

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.669
talking about here there was a time when
this field and the language of emotion

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.800
was part of our tradition it was in our
texts until the fourth century the year

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.539
325 AD in the year 325 something
happened

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:44.110
our texts were edited and we lost
tremendous amounts of information

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.860
the emperor constantine in the early
christian church with the early

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.550
Christian Bible had to make decisions
what information do we include what

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:07.139
information do we exclude and what we
know now is that at least at least 45

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:17.650
books were either completely taken away
or tremendously edited into what we call

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.879
today our Western biblical tradition and
when those edits were made we lost the

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.120
information that tells us everything is
connected

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.729
we lost the information that tells us
the language that speaks to this field

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:41.009
we know the information was lost because
we are now recovering the information in

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:48.200
the Dead Sea Scrolls in the NAG Hammadi
library in the Coptic texts this is how

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.789
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.289
we know this information was lost

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.220
when we find writings belonging to Jesus
that are not recorded in our primary

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.650
sources but are consistent with the ones
that are we are inclined to believe that

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.080
they do indeed come from him however
when the saying seemed to be a bit

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.790
inconsistent with other teachings we are
told they have been edited out due to

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.530
validity rather than the fact that they
are the sacred truths intended to be

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.580
passed into the hands of all people but
they have only been reserved for a few

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.240
any spotlight on the belief that each
person is filled with the same higher

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.210
power as Jesus rather than it being an
outside force to be feared would have

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.630
changed everything we know about life in
our entire history because we are each

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.130
different does not make us separate we
are all a part of the same one

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.650
consciousness simply taking different
forms here are some of the sayings of

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.070
Jesus from the Gospel according to
Thomas and their possible

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:04.950
interpretations verse number 3 if those
who lead you say to you see the kingdom

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:12.360
is in the sky then the birds of the sky
will precede you if they say to you it

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.410
is in the sea then the fish will precede
you rather the kingdom is inside of you

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:26.310
and it is outside of you when you come
to know yourselves then you will become

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.450
known and you will realize that it is
you who are the sons of the Living

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:37.410
father but if you will not know
yourselves you dwell in poverty and it

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:43.830
is you who are that poverty this
teaching refers to the consequences of

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.110
believing that power is outside of the
individual if you believe that this

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.730
ruling power belongs to someone or
something else then that thing will hold

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.150
dominion over your life
however when the realization is made of

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.380
who we each truly are the one
consciousness that moves through

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.440
everything and that all power comes from
within we can live in an ascended and

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.560
rich way the kingdom is inside of you
and it is outside of you you literally

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.740
manifest your outside circumstances from
within if you will not know yourselves

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.100
you dwell in poverty and it is you who
are that poverty the belief that outside

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.480
events and people have control over a
person's life keeps them from living the

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:40.419
richness that is rightfully theirs they
manifest as they believe verse 27 if you

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:47.050
do not fast from the world you will not
find the father's domain if we do not

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.490
turn away from the things that disturb
us and believe in the power within to

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.810
change all things we will continue to
experience that reality in our lives

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:07.000
verse 50 if they say to you where did
you come from say to them we came from

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.570
"hidden teachings" of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden "Jesus" law of attraction

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.720
the light the place where the light came
into being on its own accord and

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.120
established itself and became manifest
through their image if they say to you

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:29.050
is it you say we are its children we are
the elect of the living father if they

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:36.010
ask you what is the sign of your father
in you say to them it is movement and

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:43.960
repose the word light is used to portray
the origin of humans the light is the

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.930
consciousness of each person manifested
as a physical being it is the all in all

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.060
that exists as each individual
consciousness lives through us as

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:04.620
activity and awareness
verse 77 Jesus said it is I who am the

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:11.819
light which is above them all it is I
who am the all from me did they all come

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:20.060
forth and unto me did they all extend
split a piece of wood and I am there

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.069
lift up the stone and you will find me
there

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:31.110
this explains that the one consciousness
lives within everything what lives in

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:41.819
him also lives within all other things
first 113 his disciples said to him when

00:10:41.819 --> 00:10:49.980
will the kingdom come jesus said it will
not come by waiting for it it will not

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:55.410
be a matter of saying here it is or
there it is rather the kingdom of the

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:02.129
Father is spread out upon the earth and
men do not see it we have always had the

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:07.290
power within ourselves but we have lost
sight of it it is not something that we

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.910
have to wait to experience this
consciousness is already a part of all

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.920
things including each person

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:30.680
to unleash the force of the divine
matrix in our lives first we have to

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.710
understand how it works and the science
tells us how it works

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:43.370
secondly we must speak the language that
the divine matrix recognizes and science

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:49.750
cannot tell us that that comes from our
past from our culture from our history

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.610
from those who have learned and used
this language for thousands of years so

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.500
this is what we're doing right now we're
learning what did Jesus and what did the

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:06.140
great masters say about this this
language because it's the same whether

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:11.300
you're talking Buddhist or Hindu or
Christian pre-christian traditions

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.580
they're all telling us that there is a
field of energy and that we have the

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:22.930
language to use that field this is an
actual page out of the Gospel of Thomas

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:29.480
so we know that this this ancient gospel
actually existed and you can you can see

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.410
some of the letters these are Greek
letters you can actually read some of if

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.780
you know Greek you can see some of the
Greek letters right here in the Gospel

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:46.160
of Thomas two very important keys this
was written that right around 300 years

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.880
after the time of Jesus in this gospel
okay so here's what we're doing we've

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.620
been in the Buddhist monasteries in
Tibet and they're telling us that we

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:06.110
must that feeling is the prayer one two
that we must feel as if our prayers have

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:12.970
already been answered okay and now we're
in an Egyptian monastery with the texts

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.470
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.970
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.470
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.740
that used to be our tradition before
they were edited and we're going to look

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:25.810
at the instructions that tell us how to
do that okay if we do that it's a good

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.520
okay
Gospel of Thomas if you have a copy of

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:37.710
the Gospel of Thomas this is verse 106
translated from the NAG Hammadi library

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:43.090
and if you do not have a copy it's in
our books and you can you can go to any

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:48.690
library and pick this up verse 106 look
at what the Lost Gospel of Thomas says

00:13:48.690 --> 00:14:00.220
it says when you make the to thought and
emotion 1 so the Gospel of Thomas is

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.290
talking about thought and emotion it's
saying when you make your thought and

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:12.370
your emotion one look at what happens
you will say to the mountain mountain

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:19.660
move away and the mountain will move
away saying that when you can marry your

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:28.030
thought in your emotion into one single
potent force that is when you have the

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:36.160
power to speak to the world secondly
when you make the two one what are they

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.680
talking about what are the two let's go
back to our image the two thought and

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:49.900
emotion when the two become one in our
hearts we create the feelings in our

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:56.830
bodies when thought and emotion become
one you'll see how to do that in just a

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:04.540
minute let's go back to the Gospel of
Thomas another verse now this is verse

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.640
48
it says almost the same thing this was

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.770
so important that it was recorded at
least three different times in the same

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:25.030
Gospel look at what this says if the two
make peace with each other in this one

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.920
house when Jesus is talking about the
house or the temple what is he talking

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.340
about what is he talking about precisely
you you are the house you are the temple

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.350
if the two make peace with each other in
this house if

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:46.600
thought and emotion become one if they
make peace with each other in this house

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.640
look what happens they will say to the
mountain move away and it will move away

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.250
he's telling us again in a completely
different verse how powerful it is to

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:03.660
marry thought in emotion but they still
haven't told us how how do you do this

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:11.440
that's the next piece in the early
Christian Bible your Bible today there

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.520
is a passage how many have heard ask and
ye shall receive have you heard that

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.250
before
ask and you shall receive you heard that

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:29.080
I know people that asked and asked and
asked and nothing happens because the

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:36.370
asking is not done with the voice the
asking is not done please please bring

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:43.510
this to my world that's not asking to
ask we must speak to the field to the

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:50.110
divine matrix in the language that the
field recognizes and a language that's

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:54.790
meaningful the field doesn't recognize
our voice it recognizes the power of our

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.730
heart remember this morning our heart we
have a feeling creates electrical waves

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:06.310
magnetic waves that's the language the
field recognizes so when you create the

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:14.290
feeling in your heart as if your prayer
is already answered that creates the

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:20.200
electrical and the Magnetic waves that
bring that answer to you in the Bible

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:20.710
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus "law of attraction"

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:30.040
that you have today the King James
Version John 16 23 24 what you have is

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:37.120
the condensed version you have the
edited version the edited version looks

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:44.230
like this this is the edited version
whatsoever he ask the Father in my name

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:53.040
he will give it to you hitherto
have ye asked nothing in my name

00:17:54.309 --> 00:18:02.669
okay ask and ye shall receive that your
joy may be full

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:09.219
okay this is the edited version this is
so amazing to me because they took out

00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:18.940
the two sentences that tell us how to
ask in the fourth century when the edits

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.179
happened they took those two sentences
out would you like to see those two

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:31.899
original sentences okay we'll go back
into the original Aramaic and we'll look

00:18:31.899 --> 00:18:38.440
at a new translation this is the
original Aramaic it begins it looks very

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:45.039
similar so this is the retranslated
version with the missing pieces all

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:51.279
things that you asked straightly
directly from inside my name you will be

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:59.769
given it says so far you've not done
this because if we ask with our voice we

00:18:59.769 --> 00:19:05.200
have not done this now here's the piece
that was edited here is what was lost

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:12.580
look at these two very powerful
sentences ask without hidden motive and

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:21.669
be surrounded by your answer be
enveloped by what you desire that your

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:27.159
gladness be full look at what it's
saying it's not saying the speak a word

00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:34.809
it's saying to be surrounded to feel as
if if you are surrounded you are feeling

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:43.529
as if your answer has already happened
be enveloped if you want the perfect

00:19:43.529 --> 00:19:49.299
relationship in your life if you want
the healing in the body of your loved

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:56.229
ones feel the feeling of what it is like
as if that has already happened be

00:19:56.229 --> 00:20:01.179
enveloped by what you desire because
that is when your thought in your

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:07.970
emotion become one you think the thought
of the healing in your loved ones

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:13.970
and you feel the love of that thought
they become one and that is the language

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.429
that this field recognizes does that
make sense are you okay with that you're

00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:22.000
going to see an example of this another
example here in just a moment

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.570
hidden teachings of the bible that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:31.179
ask without hidden motive what does that
mean hidden motive ask without judgment

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:38.320
this is precisely what the Buddhists are
telling us ask without the judgment of

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:46.070
the right or the wrong or the good or
the bad ask without the ego ask from the

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:53.179
heart is this meaningful to you is this
helpful at all let me give you an

00:20:53.179 --> 00:21:01.549
example then because to be if it says be
surrounded that means to feel as if to

00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:09.500
feel as if now if that sounds too
religious because it's from the Bible we

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:16.429
smoked spoke this morning about Nevel
the the philosopher Nevel early in the

00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:21.259
20th century his book the power of
awareness look at what he says it's the

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:25.490
same thing
Nevel says you must make your future

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:35.509
dream a present fact now by assuming the
feeling of your wish fulfilled to come

00:21:35.509 --> 00:21:40.909
from the place that that's already
happened now this is what those

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:46.039
practitioners did with that cancerous
tumour I want to just elaborate on this

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:54.799
a little bit when those practitioners
healed the woman with her tumor this

00:21:54.799 --> 00:22:03.230
morning they did not judge the cancer is
wrong or bad or right or good there was

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:11.110
no judgment they accept that tumor as a
possibility one of many possibilities

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:17.840
because in the quantum world all things
are possible so they didn't say bad

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:24.110
cancer you must go away
or we're going to operate on you or

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:29.120
we're going to use radiation on you they
didn't do that they accepted the cancer

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:36.919
as it was without hidden motive without
judgment and they said now we're going

00:22:36.919 --> 00:22:47.179
to choose a new reality by feeling
assuming the feeling as if the woman is

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:50.929
already healed
so what they did was they felt the

00:22:50.929 --> 00:22:58.640
feeling as if the woman was fully healed
fully enabled fully capacitated already

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.510
happened in the the chant that they were
using

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:13.010
Wassa Wassa loosely translates into the
words already done already done and then

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:18.470
when they got excited they said mate
mate mate means now now now not a year

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:23.330
from now not a month from now not five
minutes from now now in the quantum

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:32.450
world now and her body responded it must
physical reality must respond to the

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:39.500
language that it understands so in the
Buddhist traditions they are telling us

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:46.789
the quality of the feeling and in the
judeo-christian traditions they are

00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:54.140
giving us the instructions to be
surrounded to be enveloped how to create

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.870
that feeling and when you put those all
together it's something that happens in

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:06.200
our hearts not in our minds feeling as
if the prayer is already answered with

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.740
"hidden teachings of the bible" that explain manifestation, consciousness and oneness Gregg Braden Jesus law of attraction

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:14.059
no judgment and no ego and feeling from
the result feeling from the result as if

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:19.100
it's already happened are there any
martial artists here in the room karate

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.090
experts
I studied martial arts when I was in my

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:31.130
20s and 30s a little bit my 40s and 50s
have you seen martial artists when they

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:36.160
demonstrate their focus
by breaking a concrete block have you

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:44.410
seen that you've all seen that before
right okay here's the secret here is the

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.800
secret to breaking that block when the
martial artist is focused on that block

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:57.370
the very last thing that they are
thinking is about their hand hitting the

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:06.600
block because if they think about that
they know it will hurt so they focus on

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:15.520
what happens after their hand has passed
through the block as if it has already

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:23.920
happened they focus on a place below the
block and feel the feeling as if their

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:32.590
hand is already in that place that is a
metaphor that is an equivalent for what

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:38.920
we're doing with the power of emotion
feeling as if the experience has already

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:45.700
happened the Gospel of Thomas represents
our connection to consciousness and all

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:51.700
that is it is the knowledge that
liberates man if a person does not

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.960
experience this higher consciousness
they believe themselves to be separate

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:02.170
alone and simply a victim of
circumstance to break free from any

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:08.020
manifested reality that does not serve
what a person desires the false image of

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.400
the self must be replaced with the true
knowledge of who and what we each are

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.070
and the power that we each possess

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.710
