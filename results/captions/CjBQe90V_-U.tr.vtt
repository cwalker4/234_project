00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.710
Robert düşüncesine göre;
"güç içerden başlar"
Kim olduğunun farkında isen,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.920
İyi olmanın dışında bir şeyi ne kadar iyi yaptığının farkında iseniz

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:19.469
Basit içgüdülerimizin desteğiyle kendimizle ilgili bir çok stratejik ataklar yapabiliriz.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.250
diğer insanları da motive ederek anlama kabiliyetinin artmasına teşvik eden

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.079
başarının anahtarıdır ve kelimeler seni aldatmak için kullanılır

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.808
to disguise what people are really
thinking I have never

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:36.699
arada bir  kendi fikrimi ifade etmeli , kesinlikle haklısın.

it

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.020
üzerimdeki etkiyi netleştirdiğimde , Kitapla ilgili düşüncelerimin kimin için önemli olduğunu

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:12.370
onlar sevmiyorum bir işte kayıp 
ne olursa olsun ve ustalık için kendi yolunu bulmayı

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.259
kitabında bize de yer verdiğini listede gösterdi

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.719
utterly phenomenal just wanna mobile
just on the bus

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.439
on that it's all theme but this why want
to be on the show today so we talk with

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.789
him although I have high hopes for your
new book

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:30.209
on earth to me yes sure pressure on
human nature guys you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.490
may not have heard it here first but
he's working on a new book on human

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.060
nature check now be more excited about

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.599
if you've read all his books you'll see
that there's one themes guy clearly has

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.789
to have just a deep understanding of
people how they work

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.319
so anyway with out for their do you
books also around

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.780
power if you could just a fine power for
us

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.909
well the many ways to do that but I like
to look at it this way

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.009
most love things that happen in like you
have no control over

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:02.519
you don't control your parents where
you're born when you were born what your

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.620
really what schools you do anything like
that and then be on that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.539
those things happen to you and and so
the way I look at it maybe 95 96 percent

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.709
of what happens in like you have no
control over

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.719
it's just 30 hanging coming at you but
you have a little margin of control

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.590
and power is the ability to increase
that tiny little margin to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.439
four five six percent and how do you
increase that margin

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.490
have control over circumstances over
people well the the just a bit is

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.549
self-mastery power begins from within

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.400
if you're aware of who you are if you're
aware of what you're good at what you're

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.280
not good at

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.699
if you're able to see hola motions kinda
govern your life

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.049
if you can learn what your weaknesses
are and how to control them you can't

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.789
slowly through this process of knowing
who you are

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.780
and understanding other people and how
they operate so you don't make stupid

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.169
mistakes in life

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.780
you can increase that little tiny margin
more more more and you will be a

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.860
personal power

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.580
so law number one in the 48 laws of
power

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.759
is called never outshine the master an
almost

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.180
every single person in the world is has
violated that law

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.870
myself included

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.639
basically how it works you're so

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.800
eager to impress your boss or whomever
in your new job

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.300
that you try so hard that you make him
or her field in secure

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.579
like maybe your younger and better than
they are and because %uh that you're

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:36.359
fired

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.410
or something that happens to you and you
never know why

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.229
that comes from being fired having any
idea what happened to you

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.800
so that kinda little bits and knowledge
adding up with this

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.569
awareness of who you are and how other
people operate you're gonna slowly came

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.730
a little bit more that margin can be a
personal power

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.680
I'm read that stat from you before that
95 96 percent

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.759
above the world is out of our control it
that took my breath away

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.719
I didn't want to believe it but as you
start going through the things you

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.879
yeah on so if we embrace and if we
embrace that the most important thing we

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.829
can do is control ourselves I think the
bench is a quote about that right

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:27.240
yeah I think it's something to the
effect that mastery big is

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.759
is very powerful especially coming from
somebody is accomplished as him so

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.490
how what are the steps you talk a lot
about self-awareness

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.978
you pointing out that the point love
self-awareness is to get

00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:50.589
to shut down that internal monologue
that you have about yourself

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.500
so that you can focus on what that
person is thinking and feeling about use

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.180
the you can be more strategic

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.120
none walk us through the exam be given a
book about benjamin Franklin

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.610
and how he is that so profoundly yes
that the chapter in

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.139
mastery on social intelligence which is
basically the subjective my next book

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.659
and and the ideas that were social

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.819
but if you're bad with people it doesn't
mean anything you can

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.490
completely neutralize your talent to
your skill or anything that you learned

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.939
in life

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:29.819
so benjamin Franklin was someone who is
extremely ambitious he was very young

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.829
and very talented and

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:36.709
very precocious he was a great writer at
the age of 14 and 15 is already

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:37.919
publishing himself

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.920
he he was just a a mad genius

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.250
but he was terrible with people he

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.040
on irritated his brother who he was
working for

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.550
and sort have deceived him about these
letters he was writing to the newspaper

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.810
in

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.980
tricking him into silence do good yes
use tricking his brother

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.319
into publishing his own letters

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.790
under a pseudonym because brother I was
too young to write for the newspaper

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.189
confess it to his brother he confessed
it thinking that his brother would be

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.670
proud

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.490
I'll benjamin has written these are
amazing letter supposedly written by an

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:23.539
had basically mimicked the voice above
an older woman it was amazing

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:28.930
have been proud of them

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:36.389
thinking that people would be impressed
would like him because he was so smart

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.620
young and instead they were really
offended by what he did

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.500
the ability to understand what motivates
would incentivize as the other person

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.990
is like the key to success in life you
know because if you know

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.290
what it is that you're looking for what
you Tom are looking for in this moment

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.000
and I can give it to you I have

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.810
come credible power over you right to
benjamin Franklin says I'm gonna stop

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.160
this

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.860
pattern being inside my head thinking
only have myself and my own ideas and

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.660
when I think ur

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.000
my great dreams I'm in the shot that
monologue of

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.470
and I'm gonna listen Amanda immerse
myself

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.180
in other people and figure them out he
was a great

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.370
tinkerer an inventor and see it a
scientific mind

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.069
and all he did was he said I'm going to
apply that side

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:27.329
science to people and it was is

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:31.979
with completely changed his life around
I know you've worked a lot with

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.288
the internal monologue I know the EU's
Zen meditation

00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:39.979
is that partly why to quiet that
monologue or are there other reasons

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.389
that you using

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:45.649
San it was it's probably the main reason

00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:49.159
a.m. I was about to write mastery

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:53.350
open it took this item and writing a
book for me is almost like

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.149
doing 15 rounds with Mohammed

00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:01.090
I these books like kill me and

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:06.200
my digestive tract is ruined I'm
exhausted I can't sleep

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:13.610
the house kill me because the the
intensity of them

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.730
trying to the park process and so I'm on
each

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.039
if I don't do something about it mastery
will literally kill me

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:23.519
so I decided I'm gonna take that
meditation among other things

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:27.509
and on I found the benefits were

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:32.189
I can pack in quiet my mind I can set
myself up for the rest of the day

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:38.569
creative energies in me that I didn't
even know I had

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:46.069
arm and in in doing so it's not only

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:52.110
that it's already encountered to find
interesting connections

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.590
I'm do you think meditation is allowing
you to make more interesting connections

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.340
because the

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:05.309
creativity that's not my own but that I
use a lot

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:08.649
in mastery and basically the idea is
that

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:11.759
ideas are generated in the unconscious

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:15.620
they're not generated consciously your
conscious mind

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.500
is very limited what you can hold in
your memory

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.649
but unconsciously in your subconscious
when you're asleep when you're dreaming

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:27.809
the mind is filled with thousands upon
thousands of ideas and things that are

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:29.299
there that are lingering there

00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:33.219
and connections are being made all the
time

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.860
and occasionally those connections float
up to your conscious mind

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.019
and you have an a brilliant idea about
how to do something

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:44.778
will when you're meditating you're
almost like in a dream state

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:47.860
your associating and really free manner

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.889
upbeat even a meditation and I do it for
close to an hour

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:55.129
in the morning it very intense I'm

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:58.698
your a.m. memories from childhood

00:10:58.698 --> 00:11:02.139
that I've completely forgotten about
smells

00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:09.250
when you're able to steal your mind you
freeing up all that kind of

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.049
unconscious stuff that's there and
connections are happening and much

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:17.219
faster way and I had to sum up the best
ideas when I was meditating

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.629
as everyone is experience when you're
sometimes when you're showering

00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:25.679
you have a great idea because you're not
thinking about anything and they just

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:26.489
come to you

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:34.778
I know people expect me to be the guy
hiding in the quotes love that but in

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:35.669
reality

00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:38.669
I would much rather be myself on you

00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:43.409
to me are like that right reading your
books a specially the 48 laws of power

00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:45.159
which is so

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:49.169
consciously aware love um

00:11:49.169 --> 00:11:53.049
how about this it looks subjectively a
power struggle's it makes no judgment

00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:56.578
about whether they're good or bad but
and in not making a judgment

00:11:56.578 --> 00:12:00.250
stand so far outside of the norm has
normally people like who

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.759
going for powers a key new outlook it's
a reality people doing it

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:07.509
I so meeting you hand seeing like

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:11.500
a normal guys got hopes and dreams and
passions and is pursuing nominees doings

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.309
and meditation

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:16.750
it's not really what people expect do
you get that a lot yeah I do that I love

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.708
the trolls the cock what I think about
it all the time because basically what

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:20.809
he was saying is

00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:24.039
people expect to meet charles degaulle

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:27.969
right and I'm not charles degaulle
Charles the calls the name

00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.549
when I'm in the public so I've learned
people don't expect me to be.

00:12:36.549 --> 00:12:39.750
who I am 18 for Smith 50 side but a book
with 50 cent

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.429
II on he expected me to be this kinda

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:49.338
older guy with gray hair who was just
like emanating power

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:57.759
I'm not that and I was expecting a.m.
this

00:12:57.759 --> 00:13:00.778
mean thug who is going to make me

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:04.188
shiver when I was in front he's not like
that at all either

00:13:04.188 --> 00:13:09.049
um so you know you're not that image
that people expect

00:13:09.049 --> 00:13:12.929
in and sometimes you have to play that
image so when I go do interviews on

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:15.698
television or something I have to become
Robert Green

00:13:15.698 --> 00:13:19.429
but really I prefer just being who I am

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:23.638
here today in revealing the fact that I
am kind of a normal person

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:27.089
you know and I do meditate and I have

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:31.899
you know all sorts of weird habits and
stuff right now you um

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:36.259
you attack things from weird in unique
angles that I think makes your writing

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:40.379
really sticky with people and is why I'm
so eager for you to write about him in a

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:42.019
church that had to be from an angle

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:45.919
on that other people just aren't are
able to capture and I may be totally

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:49.578
misreading abut in reading the 48 laws
of power in reading the 50th law

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:53.649
arm it feels very different

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:56.889
even though clearly about power it feels
very different from the power that you

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:02.838
and and I'll go back to benjamin
Franklin for a second and you associate

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:03.240
him with

00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:07.818
to people

00:14:07.818 --> 00:14:11.049
don't be don't sympathize with people

00:14:11.049 --> 00:14:13.958
you know they're doing well as me don't
get on your knees and well as me with

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:14.378
them

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:17.539
but offer the member the in
understanding and help them back in and

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:20.139
there's a very sorta like beautiful

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:24.819
thing to that so they feel like
different angles

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.610
I'm power like to you are they one in
the same or are they really different

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:34.959
II future say it's a very interesting
question so the 48 laws of power

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.470
a was really about the kinda the
political games that we've all witnessed

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:46.070
we've ever ever worked in an office I i
have the statistic I say about 10 to 10

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.700
people

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.600
are like great manipulators and there's
just takes one person

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.230
and they can ruin your life and there's
always somebody like that

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.529
so the 48 laws the powers about that
game that people are playing and how to

00:14:58.529 --> 00:14:59.529
be aware that

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:04.309
and not get trapped in in getting
emotional and not being so naive

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:08.599
and so there's not a lot of empathy in
that book because I really wanna

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.360
open your eyes I was a naive person when
I entered Hollywood

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.370
which was the main inspiration for the
48 Laws I was just the stupid kid

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:22.000
that had no idea how machiavellian
Hollywood

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.149
and soul the book isn't form for people
like me

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:28.909
so there's not a lot of empathy because
I'm trying to say look I'm shaking you

00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:29.370
up

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.529
don't be so stupid and naive when the
doors are closed this is what the power

00:15:33.529 --> 00:15:36.879
people are doing in you need to be aware
of it but

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:41.269
the empathy is a really important
quality its really important quality its

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.960
it's a huge

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.250
subject in my notebook and it played a
very big role and masteries also played

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.000
a role in about the art of seduction

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.450
on but essentially

00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:59.569
on a high level not just understand the
political games in the manipulation but

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.570
really understand them on a deep level
so that you can influence them

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.240
cetera you have to be able to get inside
their skin

00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:16.719
with this talent for getting inside the
minds of other people

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.830
its it's something that you don't even
do not even aware autistic people are

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.240
aware up because they don't possess this
power and they see

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.759
other humans doing it is basically the
idea that I can actually sit here and

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:30.840
imagine

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:35.490
for

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.500
10 15 20 minutes I can actually maybe
get inside your mind a little

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.570
and we possess this like

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.850
and animal quality but we don't know how
to use it

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.450
we don't practice it it's like a muscle
that never is being you alright them

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.620
right now is the time

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.600
how do we help these guys aren't easy
because I think you are onto the secret

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.379
to the universe

00:16:56.379 --> 00:17:00.820
yeah and I am my partners and I break
the company into three things so there's

00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:05.539
and product I did the people this is
what I do

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:09.029
like this is all I focus on is trying to
get better at protecting myself into

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.009
their mind thinking the way that they
think

00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:14.539
and in this company the goal being to
help them

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:17.700
achieve whatever goal they have on

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.239
how to what enter the using that skill
to make their own

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.839
dreams come true well i wish i had my
next book

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:33.599
written because it the netbook iru the
law love the secret you want to hang out

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:36.959
for a few minutes yeah I think so

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.630
give me in the year and a half yeah I'm
hasten but I'm not have a single

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:52.099
in you walking in lot around in life I'm
not critical because I'm the same

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:55.929
soren sleepwalking you're inside hearing
your own thoughts

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.190
day in day out like a continually you
know

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.480
circling loop in your head and you're
not aware the fact

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.680
that if you stop that and you look at
other people

00:18:09.829 --> 00:18:14.849
what's the first component on that world
non-verbal communication ninety-five

00:18:14.849 --> 00:18:15.529
percent

00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:18.619
what really matters been in
communication between people

00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:22.859
is not through words words are used to
deceive you

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:27.719
to disguise what people are really
thinking but in people's body language

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.250
in their face I are you even aware that
there's a difference between a real

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.819
smile

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:36.480
in a fake smile you probably are but how
do you recognize a fake smile

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.799
most to the smiles that people have her
fake

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:43.619
the the eyes don't go up the cheek bones
aren't prominent

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:48.500
lips don't go up recognizing a fake
smile from a real smart already you

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.430
understand if someone is really enjoying
you or if they're just pretending

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.650
you can't get that from their words you
can get it from their body language

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:03.740
their gestures from the tone love their
voice

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.549
whether it goes upper down at the end of
a sentence the whole world from

00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:08.950
non-verbal communication

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:16.009
you were in France born there and you
didn't and you couldn't speak French

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:21.960
you can learn that language the other
aspect is understanding what really

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.490
motivates people

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.179
what really is the key you're thinking
that they have the same values

00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:34.159
completely different place

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.650
how do you sit there and by talking to
them

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.740
and understanding them in watching and
observing them how can you get a feel

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.390
for the different culture that they come
from and the different set of values

00:19:46.329 --> 00:19:50.519
there are things that you can learn by
talking

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:53.740
and observing people particularly over
time

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.808
YouTube all have the experience if
you're in a relationship I've been in a

00:19:57.808 --> 00:19:59.980
relationship for a car I don't even
wanna say

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.829
eighteen years you know when you been
with someone for eighteen years that who

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:05.539
they were

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:09.399
when you first met the man who you know
now they're not there's not the same

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.000
you reach the level of understanding
that's pretty profound you don't even

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.650
have to

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.670
think about it you know what they're
thinking rate

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:21.019
you can get that with people over time
if you're paying attention in your

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:21.970
intense

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.558
in three months interaction here at

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:28.829
the quest office observing your gonna

00:20:28.829 --> 00:20:33.099
deepen your knowledge of someone that
when you first met them you had no idea

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:36.709
but the main idea is there's that
knowledge is a

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.049
is available and you're not using it cuz
you're not aware

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:44.149
this this the secret language it's going
on priceless is getting to the top

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.940
3500 or so I love the millions of things
that we can do to help them

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.880
I so in your book massery you break
things down

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.880
in and some other really interesting
power struggle dynamics that you've

00:20:59.769 --> 00:21:03.569
you bring into the book I as to how to

00:21:03.569 --> 00:21:07.250
orchestrate a mentor to not send the
master things like that to make sure

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.980
that you're able to get the tutelage

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.569
but then you also go into the
nitty-gritty have actually acquiring a

00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:14.569
skill in the 10,000 our principle as a

00:21:14.569 --> 00:21:18.539
so applying that to emotional
intelligence and

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:22.039
and simply reading other people water
water just

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:25.069
a step or two that they can take down
that path starting today

00:21:25.069 --> 00:21:29.500
well I mean the first thing to
understand

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.829
on is the most important and that it is
a skill

00:21:33.829 --> 00:21:37.429
so if you wanna play the piano

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:41.440
you can just sit down and suddenly play
you've got a practice that you better

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.130
practice it every day to practice in our
day

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.420
you're going to get better at it okay
dealing with people

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.950
is a skill and we don't like to think of
it like that

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.710
a I got a lot of flak for the art of
seduction because

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.640
people say I don't want to think oh
seduction in love and romance

00:22:04.829 --> 00:22:09.720
d romanticize it well it's not quite
like that

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.880
you know learning to court and seduce
someone

00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:17.400
good at I

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:25.109
skip outta this mindset that you just
have to be who you are its up

00:22:25.109 --> 00:22:28.949
but of I can use the word please go put
some fucking nerve

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:29.500
the pic

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.880
that you just have to be who you are you
can be who you are when you're home

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.500
not always either when you when the door
closes but when you're here in your

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.500
office to reroute the work would you
can't be who you are

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.190
because it doesn't work very well you're
playing a role

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.279
you're being the good worker et cetera
well it's also a skill

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:54.170
in how to learn how to deal with people
understand their mindsets over to skill

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.460
you've got a practice it and even go to
practice it you gotta put in

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.660
hours so everyday you gonna give
yourself a goal

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.259
it's very easy for me to tell you to
turn off that and Terry

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:09.140
internal monologue because even as i'm
saying it you're still going through it

00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:12.759
alright I'm gonna sit here now for an
our

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:16.529
I'm gonna make myself not have a single
for I'm gonna

00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.980
absorb myself in when I'm meeting with
Tom

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.529
I'm gonna completely shut that I'm gonna
sit there and observe

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:27.430
I'm gonna take away three things that I
have not observed before

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.279
about Tom okay that's my goal you got it
baby steps you can suddenly become then

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:33.639
gym in Franklin overnight

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.240
okay now I i'm I'm and meeting Tom in
our everyday

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.009
today I'm gonna sit here among gonna
listen to myself

00:23:41.009 --> 00:23:44.789
I'm gonna pick up three things that I
had never observed from Tom before

00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:48.399
for instance he always tends to sit like
this when he's

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.750
really interested in something with that
mean okay

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:56.930
those are the kind of steps where you're
basically stopping that monologue

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.549
immersing yourself in the other person
trying to come away with three things

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:06.359
four things using your mirror neurons
which I discuss a lot in there you

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:10.409
your natural empathy and then the most
important thing of all

00:24:15.589 --> 00:24:19.349
gray I learned that Tom likes to sit
like that but what does that mean

00:24:19.349 --> 00:24:23.829
it probably means something when you're
not there with them

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:27.879
because if you do that when you're with
them you you can't be in the moment when

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:32.119
does that say about Tom

00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:35.949
well he's very relaxed okay now you're

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.279
your your observing and then your
analyzing them

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:41.240
you do that you

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.599
you make a skill you you decide you can
observe new things every day from the

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:48.369
same people that you deal with

00:24:48.369 --> 00:24:51.429
and you analyze it you're already on the
way

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.430
while so in in your book

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.420
mastery no you going to great detail

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.960
about what it actually takes to acquire
skills really phenomenal

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.490
guys you know the reason that it's on
the list is for some these examples

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.730
the one I'd like you to talk about now I
so that you understand

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.549
how many things you can get your way and
I wanna bring everything back 27

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:13.480
beginning

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.599
know thyself right understand yourself
that's step one if you don't understand

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.159
yourself if you don't

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.880
really embody the da Vinci quote about
the greatest forms master his mastery

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.710
over oneself

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.430
if you don't embody that you're in real
trouble and the reason is gonna stop you

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.160
from seeing opportunities to learn

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.440
so in your book you go on a unfortunate
forget the guys name but he went into

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.779
the Amazon any tried to learn that it on
our language

00:25:35.779 --> 00:25:39.519
than you'll ever you talk to us a little
bit about that in in

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:43.009
for England what and how his feeling of
superiority

00:25:43.009 --> 00:25:46.789
I'll became a learning disability just a
bit is why

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:50.210
our children able to learn so quickly

00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:57.089
can't so for instance he was sent to
this

00:25:57.089 --> 00:26:00.220
tribe in Brazil as a missionary

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.690
to translate the Bible into their
language the language called the pita ha

00:26:08.569 --> 00:26:12.929
it's been recognized as an no westerner
has been able to crack this language

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:13.789
it's so

00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:18.549
weird and he went there he goes but the
children can speak it

00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:21.730
two year old kids are learning how to
speak P haha

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.069
why can't I wire children able to learn

00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:30.639
and and in the adult can the reason is
children don't think that their superior

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.750
they don't think that they are ready to
understand the world

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.369
there the small their week their
defenseless

00:26:37.369 --> 00:26:41.849
they have to learn or they're gonna die
they have to learn how to speak the

00:26:41.849 --> 00:26:43.289
language they have to learn

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:47.099
how what but going on with their parents
or their literally gonna died

00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:51.639
and when we were children our minds were
completely open we were sponges for

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.659
knowledge

00:26:52.659 --> 00:26:56.009
because we never had the sensor 0 I am
great

00:26:56.009 --> 00:26:59.679
I know everything about the universe I
know

00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:07.358
republicans or the democrats are good or
evil eye I understand at all I'm

00:27:07.358 --> 00:27:08.098
wonderful

00:27:08.098 --> 00:27:11.598
that feeling of superiority it sneaks
into you

00:27:11.598 --> 00:27:15.450
as you get older and it stops you from
learning because you don't think you

00:27:16.628 --> 00:27:19.959
whereas a child begins with them I am
week

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.009
I am defenseless I'm inferior and I have
to learn

00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:27.848
you apply that to what I was talking
about and social intelligence

00:27:27.848 --> 00:27:31.288
or to working here at your office Wii U

00:27:31.288 --> 00:27:34.298
are literally in the position of a child
you don't know

00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:37.788
what you need to know and you have to be
a sponge and you have to observe things

00:27:37.788 --> 00:27:39.628
that you had been observing before

00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:45.819
yeah it's really arm it's fascinating
how many of the assumptions that you

00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:46.569
make

00:27:46.569 --> 00:27:50.259
are going to either hold you back or
pushing forward

00:27:50.259 --> 00:27:53.700
in I so I had the good fortune of
following a

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.450
a relatively straightforward example the
mentorship from your book

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.598
that was I met guys that way ahead of me
and I just had no problem submitting

00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:02.848
myself to them

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:08.079
and and truly it there is snow sons have
los amigo anything I was so hungry for

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:08.759
what they knew

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:12.019
night that I was a hacer I'm in a city
your feet like a student and I'm in a

00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:15.118
drinking as much knowledge as I can but
then as you begin to acquire the

00:28:15.118 --> 00:28:16.658
knowledge in this is where it gets
dangerous

00:28:19.878 --> 00:28:22.368
new skills they work you feel more
powerful

00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:26.808
and all the sudden you run the risk %uh
not thinking like a student anymore not

00:28:26.808 --> 00:28:28.769
being willing to subjugate yourself to
that

00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:31.829
this may seem like a great example but I

00:28:31.829 --> 00:28:35.579
when we started here manufacturing by
that point I have my feet under me be

00:28:35.579 --> 00:28:38.868
running a business for enough years ago
knew what I was doing but I knew

00:28:38.868 --> 00:28:42.569
at really visceral level the danger

00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:46.678
love not being a student in all things
and and being stupid enough to think

00:28:47.848 --> 00:28:53.298
um and quote I read the book has stuck
with me forever as a genius is a young

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:54.259
man's game

00:28:54.259 --> 00:28:57.690
that scared me right because I don't
want that to be true I don't want any

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.210
day of my life they get older to be less
valuable

00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:06.959
permits it doesn't have to be a young
man's game

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.420
but its basically geniuses young men
seem typically because you start

00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:15.579
novel connections like you talked about

00:29:15.579 --> 00:29:19.189
so if you can keep your mind open if you
can be a student in all things

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.000
if you're never afraid to be inferior if
you're not afraid to approach

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.410
the language in an in the story in the
book about the beer I have

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:31.640
on that you give he it's finally when he
realizes that

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.680
on I have to go hunting with a right
like I need to go out and

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.299
really experienced their life and then
suddenly he truly was at their mercy if

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:41.079
they don't take care man he would I is
lost and there's

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:45.629
and was in the jungle that will happily
him yeah so and in that funny realizes

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:46.690
that he's got this morning

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:54.339
of my favorite stories to remind myself
something the toilet overflowed there's

00:29:54.339 --> 00:29:55.169
literal

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:59.640
human feces on the floor and you're out
there right now at this moment like a

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.220
I who's gonna pick Matt up I

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.430
and to remind myself that at all times
you have to be willing to

00:30:12.819 --> 00:30:16.879
went 4-10 and yeah picked it up now for
sure and that became

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.390
hey that became cultural

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:27.179
student of things that's what it means
to not be afraid to take that

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.390
yep that the seat at the bottom but it
opens you up to just massive

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.970
degrees knowledge so do you have tricks
that you use for insuring their genius

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:40.459
over time

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.829
you know what it is it's actually I
don't if I recommend it because it's

00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:45.939
kinda erotic

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.480
um but it works basically

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:59.409
on I feel like no its not gonna sell as
well as the last book

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.230
I'm losing it I gotta go back to square
one

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.809
I can't rest on my laurels I can't just
turn out a book

00:31:06.809 --> 00:31:08.629
I really gotta grind it out

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:13.179
I gotta do more research I gotta think
harder and actually there's some

00:31:13.179 --> 00:31:16.200
there's a wisdom behind it which is

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.470
each project each thing that you do in
life

00:31:22.609 --> 00:31:26.240
feeling in the got like oh I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to pull it off

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.490
I don't know if I can go 12 rounds with
Floyd Mayweather this time I don't know

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.900
it

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.240
I'm back to where I was in the beginning
you know

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.589
you gotta feel a little better that
nervousness and that excitement

00:31:39.589 --> 00:31:43.720
and that sense a I've got to build it
now and its you're starting from zero

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.269
and that's sort of how I how how I
approach it and I think that keeps that

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:50.528
freshen I also try never to do the same

00:31:50.528 --> 00:31:55.769
book twice its everything has to be a
different feel a different subject

00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:59.528
structure a little differently so it
keep everything fresh

00:31:59.528 --> 00:32:03.869
you know this the secret really to
success in life

00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:07.369
I have to say is retaining II

00:32:07.369 --> 00:32:11.189
I talk about the master is retaining
your child like qualities

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.890
I'm if you completely a child that's not
gonna work

00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:22.849
you how do you do it know what
specifically me say child like all these

00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:23.658
but not all of them

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:31.369
have things like that you that pic you

00:32:31.369 --> 00:32:36.139
you wanting to keep that open this in
mind and that curiosity in that sense of

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.940
wonder

00:32:40.648 --> 00:32:44.319
knock that thing out if your brain that
you think you know

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:48.769
what the universe is like that you
understand the galaxies and what's going

00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:50.950
on you really don't have any idea

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.319
you need to get back that sense above
wonder

00:32:54.319 --> 00:32:57.879
and excitement and openness and
flexibility of mine

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.730
if thats all that you have you just
going to be a child in children don't

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.140
make anything they don't

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.179
invent a you know an iPhone and children
don't

00:33:07.179 --> 00:33:11.460
right like create a movie you're just be
like a child now you have to have your

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.019
skill your talent and all that but if
you're able

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:18.279
to maintain a fluid minor I call it

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:19.299
unit

00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:23.019
called synth mastery a yoga for the mind

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:27.829
how do you literally stretch your mind
so it becomes

00:33:27.829 --> 00:33:31.409
as flexible as you know so you can do a
Down Dog mentally

00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:40.019
and if you don't look follow anything
else and mastery that would be enough

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:44.259
negative capability is comes from the
great poet John Keats

00:33:44.259 --> 00:33:48.319
the 19th century he was trying to
understand why shakespeare was so

00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:49.419
creative and

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.990
and he decided that he had negative
capability and it's basically

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:58.529
the ability to keep to ideas that
contradict each other in your mind with

00:33:58.529 --> 00:34:02.990
out feeling uncomfortable without having
to come to a conclusion

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.789
you can think about something with out
rushing to judgment a conclusion

00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:11.360
you can be in the moment you can say
well it could be this it could be that

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.139
could be there

00:34:15.668 --> 00:34:20.190
your open to adopting three or four
different viewpoints

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:24.139
for instance argues too quick example
writing a book on human nature and this

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:29.309
to opposing views on human nature one is
it has never changed

00:34:29.309 --> 00:34:32.960
we are sick who we are ten million years
ago or

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.628
a 500,000 years ago and the other is
human nature

00:34:36.628 --> 00:34:41.898
is culturally it constantly evolves now
I happened to be at the school that

00:34:41.898 --> 00:34:46.829
human nature hasn't changed but I am
completely open to the other

00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:51.230
idea and I'm reading books apps from the
other idea and I'm incorporating ideas

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.648
from outside because its own

00:34:52.648 --> 00:34:56.690
it has definitely legitimate components
and arguments to be made

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:00.210
so that's how I'm keeping myself from
being rigidly

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.559
stamped with this one simple idea
because nothing in life is simple

00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:09.449
wears black and white everything is is
nuanced yeah I love that your books that

00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:10.759
really comes out everything in

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.110
when you read the 48 laws and then you
and every chapter by saying and now

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.059
think this in the complete opposite way
a

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:20.070
ending the book by saying I forget
everything I've said you have to I think

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.079
mourns member here

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:25.760
schorr and there they're incredibly
powerful and and I was saying to him

00:35:30.858 --> 00:35:33.348
the usability other range that's what

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.789
are being on the show is all people
they're giving you things are

00:35:38.789 --> 00:35:42.789
actually use will even go home and you
can do his forms and meditation you can

00:35:42.789 --> 00:35:44.639
go home and you can start learning

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:48.328
how to read people and then not at the
moment analyze about analyzing when you

00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:53.489
all there usable and they will have an
impact in on those eyes on the back to

00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:54.588
something that you said

00:35:54.588 --> 00:35:58.960
a few minutes ago and you were talking
about capturing that childlike state and

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.150
finding enthusiasm

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.940
you've got a really awesome quotes a
scene from a paraphrase a very pretty

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.460
close

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:09.900
I not building your life around passion
is a recipe for disaster in pain

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.059
something like that um but then cuz

00:36:14.059 --> 00:36:17.050
a lot of people say that right like I
gotta love life passion blah blah blah

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.829
but you take it to the next step in its

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:22.130
utterly fascinating which is if you

00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:26.618
family

00:36:30.409 --> 00:36:33.889
you have people say you know live your
passion for liza cliches

00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:37.170
and nobody changes their life based on
the cliche

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.909
you know you've got to do hard work and
to do hard work you have to have a

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:42.920
roadmap somebody has to show you

00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:50.539
until you know I'm trying it a really
really really want to help people I

00:36:50.539 --> 00:36:51.608
really want them

00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:54.900
to become entrepreneurs but I think
working for yourself

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.380
starting your own company doing what you
love should be everybody's cool

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.260
okay how do you really help people to
say follow your passion this is so

00:37:04.539 --> 00:37:09.099
the there's a process the process begins

00:37:09.099 --> 00:37:14.019
buy furs knowing what you really love
and believe me I do a lot of consulting

00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:18.090
a lot people have no self awareness
there don't even really know what it is

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.840
that they were meant to do in life

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.250
they loved music when they were a kid
but then they got in the law

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.690
or whatever because their parents and
then they don't know who they are and

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.769
the more 12 I really like music

00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:34.320
you gotta go through that process first
%uh figuring out what it is that really

00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:41.779
but still excites you once you go
through that and you understand it

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.769
you've got some

00:37:42.769 --> 00:37:47.309
clarity about it okay how do I
incorporate that in my life

00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:51.639
you colors primal inclinations right yes
and everybody has them

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:55.849
I talk about all the geniuses in history
who demonstrated this

00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:59.929
I'm stein with the compass Steve Jobs
when he's five years old

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:04.199
walks by an electronic store with his
dad in some legal all

00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:08.129
look at those gadgets those weird
gadgets oh that's so exciting

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:12.940
p really great geniuses in creative
people have those moments when they're

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.300
56 years old

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.210
and you probably did but you not
remembering them anyway

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.349
connecting with their primal part of
yourself and then

00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:24.349
actually doing something practical and
that's the real

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:28.089
trick in life so if you're 23 years old

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:32.108
it's a little easier I love music but I

00:38:32.108 --> 00:38:36.369
I'm not a musician because I not been
practicing I just love music

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:40.119
but I apt I'm have a real good sense a
business I've been

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:47.309
a et cetera okay I've got in now find a
way to craft a career

00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:50.820
that combines my knowledge um business

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.730
and my love music and add if I follow
that and I

00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:03.719
more business than music will end up
becoming more creative as I get better

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:04.699
and better at it

00:39:04.699 --> 00:39:08.368
you gotta figure out how you can take
your experience

00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:11.630
and spin move in a different direction a

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.570
Mb practical and take small steps and
still feed

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:20.369
my family but pursue something that I
love and the reason is

00:39:20.369 --> 00:39:24.460
if you don't do this you're gonna end up
in deep shit

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.380
because you're gonna turn forty years
old you going to be a job that you hate

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.829
you gonna be really depressed you gonna
be at an age where you don't have the

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:38.690
energy to make a big change and you're
going to be screwed in particularly in

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.829
the world today

00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:44.449
with things are moving so quickly and
there's so many dead in careers

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.730
you've gotta be light on your feet
you've gotta be

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.869
I think have an entrepreneurial spirit
you don't want to be at that point so it

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:56.309
is life and death you're not thinking
about right now is life and death

00:39:56.309 --> 00:40:00.480
but it is been really is you've got a
cool quote

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.079
arm the pain inborn we experience in the
initial stages and learning a skill

00:40:05.079 --> 00:40:06.659
strengthens our mind

00:40:06.659 --> 00:40:09.789
yeah how do you prepare somebody to

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:14.159
survive that initial stage of boredom in
pain

00:40:14.159 --> 00:40:19.589
well pain is great you've got to embrace
pain pain is pleasure

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.829
you gotta make the connection between
the physical and the mental

00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:25.889
when you work out it's painful

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:30.250
I a I do long distance swimming is Mike
my main

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:34.760
workout I'll to do other things but
that's my main work a I'm I'm on like

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.550
mile one and I'm like a hot

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.519
this is fine I'm so bored and midsole

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:43.070
I'm really gonna collapse but when I'm
finished

00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:50.199
and it feels so good and I pushed past
it we you know that when you're

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:51.349
exercising

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:54.940
when you're running are you working out
whatever it hurts

00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:02.849
mental things and if you make that could

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:07.569
that switch in your mind it is
mind-blowing what can happen to you

00:41:11.239 --> 00:41:15.199
and you're able to say to yourself while

00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:18.689
I'm gonna master this bit of coding a

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.039
after a few months and just think I've
what it's gonna

00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:26.949
allow me to do okay so the boredom now
is actually not so bad

00:41:26.949 --> 00:41:30.009
because I can imagine the powers that
it's gonna lead to

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:38.409
but I'm thinking love all of that that
post-workout feeling I'm gonna have

00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:42.089
you've got to be able to understand
embrace pain

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:47.550
pain is something to embrace if there's
no resistance to you

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:53.860
who are the most messed up people in the
world

00:41:57.409 --> 00:42:01.460
who have a rich father or mother and
they don't have to work or try

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.280
they are the most messed up people ever
meet are you reading a book on human

00:42:05.849 --> 00:42:09.949
why is that true because they have no
limits they have no resistance

00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:13.919
don't have to push against anything
there have to go like that

00:42:17.199 --> 00:42:21.769
its 10 the laws of human nature the war
10 the laws is about but I call

00:42:21.769 --> 00:42:22.699
necessity

00:42:22.699 --> 00:42:25.759
we are animals up necessity

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:33.889
if our life is on the line that's how we
were at how we're genetically primed

00:42:33.889 --> 00:42:38.920
from several million years ago and when
there's no necessity when we don't have

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.900
to do something

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.608
we just lie around and watch television
and smoke pot

00:42:44.608 --> 00:42:49.108
within if there's nothing holding you
resisting it you have to push against

00:42:49.108 --> 00:42:52.139
you just turn into flap that is

00:42:52.139 --> 00:42:55.528
so incredibly powerful and I hope that
that's a chapter in your book some

00:42:55.528 --> 00:42:57.289
desperate to reset United

00:42:57.289 --> 00:43:00.579
you know Peter Diamandis by any chance X
PRIZE yes

00:43:00.579 --> 00:43:06.068
a he he has Peters laws and one of his
losses when faced with out a challenge

00:43:06.068 --> 00:43:07.329
create one

00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:13.278
love very much

00:43:13.278 --> 00:43:16.748
and im immediately going to adopt with
my repertoire hope that's okay

00:43:16.748 --> 00:43:20.338
by a full credit to rob you don't even
have to credit I am

00:43:20.338 --> 00:43:23.568
that really sheds new light on

00:43:23.568 --> 00:43:27.079
why that would be so powerful to create

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:32.400
a obstacle difficulty necessity when
it's up Ryan talks but that overall book

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:32.778
on

00:43:32.778 --> 00:43:36.900
the obstacles the way you know now um

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.679
for its just is just very it's very
powerful

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:44.358
I you know I i have in my my war book

00:43:44.358 --> 00:43:47.538
i've a chapter on the death ground
strategy

00:43:47.539 --> 00:43:51.650
I think it's 10 more important chapters
in a book

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:55.179
and the idea is comes from Sun thru a

00:43:55.179 --> 00:43:58.179
and when you put in army on death ground

00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:02.298
it fights three times is hard and what
his death ground that ground is let's

00:44:02.298 --> 00:44:02.838
say

00:44:02.838 --> 00:44:06.219
urine army I and you're fighting on the
beach

00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:09.458
and if is the enemy pushes you back you
all drown

00:44:09.458 --> 00:44:12.688
okay you gotta fight twice as hard
because you're gonna die

00:44:12.688 --> 00:44:16.318
well where the same way will we have to
do something

00:44:16.318 --> 00:44:21.558
we work three times harder and I had an
experience with that with mastery

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:26.369
where on I was really late in finishing
the book

00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:30.969
and I had two chapters left the two
longest hardest chapters in the

00:44:32.268 --> 00:44:36.358
you have eleven weeks to finish those
two chapters or we're canceling your

00:44:36.358 --> 00:44:37.449
book all

00:44:37.449 --> 00:44:41.130
because you're so late that was death
ground cuz I

00:44:44.228 --> 00:44:48.009
but I don't have I can't do in 11 weeks
well I did it

00:44:48.009 --> 00:44:51.778
while I will I worked I just found the
energy

00:44:51.778 --> 00:44:55.510
so when you're put in that the system
jewish necessity you were

00:44:58.809 --> 00:45:02.719
underground on purpose that's the trick
in life you've talked about that before

00:45:02.719 --> 00:45:06.099
and you drive really fascinating
conclusion which is our

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:09.219
there's a quote the depth of our
learning is tied to the depth of our

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:09.980
focus

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.699
will I i know for instance like just
give an example love how to do that

00:45:13.699 --> 00:45:17.669
a thomas edison was a great believer in
and thomas hasn't won the greatest

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.769
entrepreneurs that ever lived and what
he would do

00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:23.940
is for instance he would talk about a
project

00:45:27.949 --> 00:45:31.589
and that meant his reputation was now on
the line

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:39.629
love in Thane work to actually figure
out what you just pull out to the press

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:45.250
suddenly doesn't do anything

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:49.750
if it it put him under ground alright I
talked about it now I have to do it they

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.420
just need to

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.869
as a great example alright I before we
get on your Twitter feed which I really

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:56.009
wanna spend some time on

00:45:59.199 --> 00:46:03.239
anyone concept from one of your books
for your upcoming book the thing that

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:07.039
they should just put in their mind and
let that be a see the grows into

00:46:07.039 --> 00:46:07.529
something

00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:16.239
again that to well the you know the idea
I'll just give it a little more flesh

00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:19.919
is is the i do. self-awareness so the
skin giving Adam

00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:27.189
each person I make this planet mastery
is born unique

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.210
and its kinda click one of cliches yeah
but there's

00:46:34.239 --> 00:46:38.429
will is never been will never be
repeated the way your brain is wired

00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:40.169
will never be repeated

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.840
your experiences in life you're one of a
kind

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:49.129
that have lived

00:46:54.199 --> 00:46:59.000
and the the problem in life is as you
get older you could become more

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.599
and more like other people you spend a
lot of your time

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:06.949
thinking about what other people like
and you don't you not aware

00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:11.358
what you like you go into careers
because you listen to other people

00:47:11.358 --> 00:47:16.150
and you don't you not in tune with
something really special and I like to

00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:22.509
there's something weird about you that
could be bad but it can also be really

00:47:23.108 --> 00:47:28.219
you know um and you're not mining that
weirdness

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:32.588
you're letting it go you're becoming a
copy of other people

00:47:32.588 --> 00:47:35.980
and if you can take a step back and say

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.070
what is the goal when the goal is when
I'm forty-years-old

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:43.230
or 35 or whatever I'm gonna create a
business

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:47.059
that reflects me and my strangeness

00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:52.489
and Who I am um that's what you want to
come to but you're not going to get

00:47:52.489 --> 00:47:53.479
there unless you're

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.750
aware of it and embrace what makes it
different

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:00.010
doesn't mean you as I said before that
you not practical

00:48:03.739 --> 00:48:08.328
all the brilliant people have succeeded
in life you look at a Steve Jobs look at

00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:12.919
et cetera there's nobody else out there
like them

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.858
that you never gonna be able to pinpoint
one other person like them they are

00:48:16.858 --> 00:48:19.500
completely unique and out those the
people

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.780
that end up having power in the world so
if you're gonna able to create that

00:48:25.679 --> 00:48:30.250
whatever it is that startup that is
different that has its own niche

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.588
and reflects you something good will
happen from

00:48:33.588 --> 00:48:37.099
I was like to tell people the moment I
fell in love with them

00:48:37.099 --> 00:48:41.068
the moment I fell in love with you my
biggest frustration in life

00:48:41.068 --> 00:48:44.108
is vary very powerful words

00:48:44.108 --> 00:48:47.699
become trite and cliche overtime to get
people don't get to the real meaning

00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:48.389
behind them

00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:53.259
yeah I am which in fact one of your
favor cause an issue clubs doesn't kill

00:48:54.338 --> 00:48:57.338
near I you find a way

00:48:57.338 --> 00:49:00.539
to go beyond the cliche to something
that's

00:49:00.539 --> 00:49:03.880
that's a true insight and reference

00:49:06.418 --> 00:49:10.478
the art of seduction you say to truly be
interesting to your

00:49:10.478 --> 00:49:13.718
victim to use your words I you

00:49:13.719 --> 00:49:17.548
you need to be contradictory you need to
reveal or hint at

00:49:17.548 --> 00:49:20.909
I'm some internal contradiction in
yourself and and so here we have this

00:49:20.909 --> 00:49:21.548
guy

00:49:21.548 --> 00:49:25.099
who is writing about power and

00:49:28.268 --> 00:49:31.409
just uncovering at the cold hard truths
about it

00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:34.748
and yet that person who I would expect

00:49:34.748 --> 00:49:39.649
to I'm laugh at the cliche if you're a
beautiful unique snowflake

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:44.009
I spends a lot of time very eloquently
explaining to people the importance of

00:49:44.009 --> 00:49:47.028
recognizing that you're beautiful and
unique snowflake Mb

00:49:47.028 --> 00:49:50.418
and then goes on to explain why that's
meaningful I love that about you know

00:49:50.418 --> 00:49:53.900
then you really was something that drew
me into your universe I don't think you

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:54.139
are

00:49:54.139 --> 00:49:57.528
I've never heard that express that we're
throwing knife measure thank you

00:49:57.528 --> 00:50:02.369
call now to the Twitter feed okay boys
and girls have you are not already

00:50:03.248 --> 00:50:07.139
ass Robert Green on Twitter you should
be and he's got just the

00:50:07.139 --> 00:50:11.228
an amazing feat he throwing out ideas
from his books religiously

00:50:11.228 --> 00:50:16.248
they are called to be just the cream of
the crop every one of them is impactful

00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:20.458
there's not a wasted letter in his feeds
well worth checking out I wanna go

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:21.858
through some other than that a

00:50:21.858 --> 00:50:25.168
in these are just the recent ones in
this stuff is is going on all day every

00:50:25.168 --> 00:50:25.498
day

00:50:25.498 --> 00:50:28.759
I and just have you comment on them so

00:50:32.768 --> 00:50:33.208
them

00:50:33.208 --> 00:50:36.778
it's a great military strategy

00:50:36.778 --> 00:50:41.639
a comes from the the great colonel Boyd
who invented the with notice that woulda

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:43.318
luper you from a with a good a loop

00:50:43.318 --> 00:50:47.699
I am NOT well if the military concept in
the it to

00:50:50.728 --> 00:50:54.259
one of the great modern strategists of
all time and

00:50:54.259 --> 00:50:58.358
being a fighter pilot is not like
anything else in life

00:50:58.358 --> 00:51:01.478
because you have to make decisions in
microseconds

00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:05.298
or you're dead and you have to
strategize in microseconds

00:51:05.298 --> 00:51:08.739
and he came up with the hutu loop which
means 'em

00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:11.969
Korean tation observation decision

00:51:16.478 --> 00:51:18.629
corriente yourself into the

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.730
context of it decide what you need to do

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:24.949
and act and people whose

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:29.939
Hooda lubes been disrupted they can't
observe the kampung corriente themselves

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:35.338
lose contact with reality and you lose
contact with reality in one second and

00:51:35.338 --> 00:51:36.719
you're a dead fighter pilot

00:51:36.719 --> 00:51:41.919
so the job is to control the other
fighter pilots perception of reality

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.130
that they make it mistake you can get on
their tail

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:48.329
and you can kill them and so

00:51:48.329 --> 00:51:52.528
in military terms if you can't change
what how people perceive reality and

00:51:52.528 --> 00:51:53.358
make them

00:51:53.358 --> 00:51:57.018
think they see what they don't see
you've got power over them

00:51:57.018 --> 00:52:01.088
well that applies to advertising it
applies to

00:52:01.088 --> 00:52:06.788
political campaigns on if you can set
your enemy on a red herring and make

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:11.710
important but it is an important you
have power over them

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:15.108
your contact with reality is yours

00:52:15.108 --> 00:52:18.690
is your power in life and if you lose it
you're in trouble and that's what that's

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:19.139
about

00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:22.989
I'll alright the only real ending his
death

00:52:22.989 --> 00:52:26.068
everything else is a transition my life
is forever

00:52:26.068 --> 00:52:29.429
a an example about um in that

00:52:29.429 --> 00:52:32.848
a I was kinda firm a loser

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:37.329
until I was about 35 36 years old is the
queen my parents I

00:52:37.329 --> 00:52:41.650
in that I am I wondered through life
trying different jobs

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:44.960
I did construction work in Greece I was
a

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.088
tour operator in Dublin I a

00:52:48.088 --> 00:52:51.170
with a teacher English in Barcelona I
rode

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:56.159
screenplays and I had him fifty
different jobs and then my parents room

00:52:56.159 --> 00:52:56.960
I like what what

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.278
what they would you gonna do in life you
know week he this is ridiculous

00:53:00.278 --> 00:53:03.500
and then I met this man who was a book
packager

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.130
and he asked me for an idea for a book

00:53:11.239 --> 00:53:15.098
so what you got to do that but the point
the moral of my story was

00:53:15.099 --> 00:53:19.130
all those weird transitions and things
that didn't mean anything

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:25.440
all those awful of all bosses I had

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.639
work for all those terrible jobs

00:53:28.639 --> 00:53:32.889
I wanted for a private detective agency
out in Pasadena

00:53:32.889 --> 00:53:36.500
for a while the most depressing job I've
ever had in my life

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:40.159
hollywood these asshole directors

00:53:40.159 --> 00:53:43.279
I could draw upon all of this weirdness

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.099
and then all the books that I dread on
history and create the 48 laws of power

00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:48.119
so there were no

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:51.420
deaths there they were just transitions
I think that's her

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:55.440
I love is exactly what I meant I

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.210
superiority is not a function natural
talent or privilege

00:54:03.219 --> 00:54:07.108
one believe that there are shortcuts to

00:54:07.108 --> 00:54:11.119
success we want to believe we can take a
drug

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:14.338
or we can do something that'll make it
quicken

00:54:14.338 --> 00:54:17.759
easy but the truth is it takes grit

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.119
it takes persistence it's the people
like

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:24.358
thomas edison who had no education came
from

00:54:24.358 --> 00:54:29.670
very poor background um who really end
up making it in life because they are

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:30.789
persisted in a

00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:34.429
don't settle love for for anything

00:54:34.429 --> 00:54:38.219
remotely mediocre that's what ends up

00:54:38.219 --> 00:54:41.639
making you get ahead in in the world and
it tho

00:54:41.639 --> 00:54:45.730
it's really democratic and that's what's
so great about it

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:48.608
and that's what's so great about the
world that we live in we live in a time

00:54:48.608 --> 00:54:49.578
where things

00:54:49.579 --> 00:54:53.269
are not purely democratic don't get me
wrong but they are much more democratic

00:54:53.269 --> 00:54:56.280
and they were in the past a meritocracy

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.440
it's not about if you went to Yale or or

00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:07.500
and and you have the material to get
there and one less thing I'll say on

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.380
that is awesome

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:11.960
one of the people I interviewed for a
mastery Paul Graham

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.039
a who has the company called Y
Combinator in Silicon Valley

00:55:16.039 --> 00:55:21.679
which is a sort of a a training school
for people who want to create a startup

00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:25.539
he said that the the he kept there is no
correlation

00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:29.980
between where people went to university
and their success that yet we're comin

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.440
there's zero correlation

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.068
whether you went to Yale or you went to
Dallas Community College

00:55:36.068 --> 00:55:38.940
there's equal chance that you will be
successful I

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.619
father was an amazing thing to hear and
he's seen that

00:55:42.619 --> 00:55:47.500
in action with tens of thousands of
people RI and then last one in this one

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:47.989
is

00:55:47.989 --> 00:55:53.419
I most important to me you talk about
earlier talked about using fear

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:57.050
to get you in the place we working hard
enough to really do great work

00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:00.869
and this is something that haunts my
every waking moment

00:56:00.869 --> 00:56:05.760
a venturi the time that was not spent on
learning skills will catch up with you

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.079
and the fall will be painful you know it
you know it's hard to

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:13.730
in the moment to understand

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:17.690
what that means because in the moment
you can say well

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:22.108
I've got a job in I'm alive and you know
I

00:56:22.108 --> 00:56:26.799
I feel pretty good so it's hard to
understand what could happen to you in

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800
10 years

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:31.568
in a visceral cut way what it means

00:56:31.568 --> 00:56:34.858
to have failed in life a and

00:56:34.858 --> 00:56:38.619
to me failure in life is not not having
money

00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:43.670
its not realizing your potential you're
sixty years old and he said I could have

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.519
been this

00:56:44.519 --> 00:56:48.500
and I never did that's like the worst
thought I think anybody

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:53.429
can have and you don't think about it in
the moment because your life is OK

00:56:53.429 --> 00:56:57.509
but you gotta wake up and understand
that there's an urgency here

00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:03.219
don't have a path of

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:08.618
toward something better your own rotting
on the vine and and that day of

00:57:08.619 --> 00:57:09.980
reckoning will come

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.969
at some point and it will be painful you
not gonna feel it suddenly though beam

00:57:14.969 --> 00:57:18.129
slow but it'll come and it won't be good

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:22.269
on and it doesn't mean like every day
has to be a grind and has to be

00:57:22.269 --> 00:57:25.699
awful oftentimes if you're in a bad job

00:57:25.699 --> 00:57:29.750
just being aware that you now have a
plan

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:33.510
is enough to lift you out of that
depression okay I'm working a burger

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:34.050
king

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.869
but I know I wanna get to this community
college and get a degree here

00:57:37.869 --> 00:57:41.170
after I save enough money having a goal

00:57:44.429 --> 00:57:47.659
from being depressed or not taking care
of yourself

00:57:47.659 --> 00:57:50.079
to being energized and moving in the
right

00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:54.480
right direction so you don't think
there's a day of reckoning but it's

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.320
piling up

00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:02.709
there yeah that that to me is is

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:06.730
so critical and i've talked endlessly
about it but for me it it really is how

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.860
many skills can you acquire how many
interesting connections can be made

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.400
well we live in a world of a skill
economy

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.480
were people with actual general would

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.550
genuine skills are going to be the ones
that moved to

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:23.530
the planted in the future and it doesn't
mean one skill it means

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:29.110
said have skills that you combine in a
unique way and that the world is so open

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.019
to that now

00:58:30.019 --> 00:58:34.009
your start starting off quest is a prime
example

00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:41.289
i mean you could probably talk about
that better than I can but your

00:58:41.289 --> 00:58:42.289
screenwriting

00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:46.029
your other failure the things you've
accumulated you can now you'd create

00:58:48.659 --> 00:58:52.369
skills you've accumulated had
interesting I have never

00:58:52.369 --> 00:58:56.219
put it together my own mind that's a
singly but you're absolutely right

00:58:56.219 --> 00:59:00.519
