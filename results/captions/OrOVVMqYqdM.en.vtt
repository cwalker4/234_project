00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:06.690
GUEST: During the Depression, my aunt was,
started buying up these vases from Tiffany's,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.560
so I guess she ordered some by the crate-load.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.240
APPRAISER: On the side, it actually says,
"Louis C. Tiffany Studios," with an address.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.420
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.740
APPRAISER: And the crate in itself it's something
you don't see very often, with "glass" plastered

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.810
all over the sides.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.610
But I also want to point out the straw, because
it's not often that people keep the shipping

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.610
crates.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.820
So let's talk about what you have.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.660
The, the dates are very interesting because
the first piece of glass over here, which

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.400
is what we would call pastel glass...

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.120
APPRAISER: is later-production Tiffany-- it
was made in the '20s...

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120
GUEST: Okay.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.190
APPRAISER: it was made in multiples...

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.190
GUEST: Okay.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.851
APPRAISER: and it came in different colors--
it came in pinks, and blues, and yellow, and

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:52.851
wisteria.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.660
These are the colors that you see in some
of the Depression glass of the era...

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.660
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.670
APPRAISER: but this was a lot more expensive
than your average piece of Depression glass.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.920
Now, this piece is a paperweight glass vase.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.240
APPRAISER: Leslie Nash, who worked for Louis
Comfort Tiffany, claims that while they were

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.909
working with paperweight glass, Louis Tiffany
himself, who was a painter, came into the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.850
glass-working shop, handed them a painting
of morning glories that he had painted, and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.160
said, "I want you to make this in glass."

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.000
GUEST: Wow.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.620
APPRAISER: Supposedly, it took $12,000 in
R&amp;D...

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.630
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.210
APPRAISER: to create this kind of glassware.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.770
1914 is when they first introduced it.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.450
Your piece, on the bottom, actually says "exhibition
piece" on it.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.450
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.790
APPRAISER: And I know from the date letter
on it, which is a suffix L, that that would

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.049
be somewhere around 1915.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.049
GUEST: Okay.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.930
APPRAISER: So it's possible that this could've
gone to the 1915 San Francisco International

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.930
Exhibition.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.930
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.049
APPRAISER: I think it came back to the studios,
that's the interesting part.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.970
You may have seen vases like this.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.849
They're in many museums all over the world.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.159
GUEST: I think I saw one at the Met in New
York, mm-hmm.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:19.019
APPRAISER: Yes, and the one at the Met has
a number on the bottom, which is 1130-L. Yours

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.019
is 1132-L.

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.019
GUEST: Oh.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.790
APPRAISER: So this is two numbers after the
Met's vase.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.790
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.439
APPRAISER: The Met acquired it in 1924, even
though it was probably made in 1915.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.010
So these things still were sold later.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.559
So just to give you an idea of value.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:42.719
The, the crate, in a retail setting, this
is something for Tiffany geeks everywhere--

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.079
collectors, museums.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.920
They would actually be very excited about
this, and it would be worth between $5,000

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920
and $10,000.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.379
GUEST: Holy cow!

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.139
APPRAISER: This piece, which is not as sought-after
as some of the other art glass...

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.139
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.829
APPRAISER: would retail probably between $2,000
and $3,000.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:11.020
But this piece, in a retail shop, it could
be sold for anywhere between $50,000 and $75,000.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.200
GUEST: No way!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.560
Oh, my gosh!

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.240
I was... thinking maybe $8,000 to $10,000,
I was hoping.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.000
Wow.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.650
APPRAISER: Well, that was a long time ago.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.680
GUEST: Wow, I really didn't know what the
market had done, you know, if it had gone

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.540
sideways or up or down, but... wow. (inhales)

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.099
APPRAISER: So there's one other thing in here
that I want to talk about.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.659
This vase.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.989
This practically stopped my heart when I saw
it in the box.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.459
(giggling) This is the piece I was waiting
for for 20 years.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.459
GUEST: Oh, wow.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.909
APPRAISER: And what I can tell you is, every
night before the “ROADSHOW”, people would

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.639
always say, "What is on your wish list?

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.799
What would you like to come in to the show
tomorrow?"

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.769
And I always say, "A Tiffany Lava vase."

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:03.769
GUEST: Wow.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.650
APPRAISER: And that's what this is.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.099
It's extremely special.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.719
It is meant to look like molten lava...

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.719
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.479
APPRAISER: on the surface of the vase, and
this one is particularly interesting because

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.720
you also have these protrusions here.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.710
And it's very similar to a vase that was shown
in the 1906 Paris Salon Exhibition.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.710
GUEST: Oh!

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.729
APPRAISER: A very similar example is in the
collection of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.580
in Paris, and it's been there since 1906.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.800
GUEST: Gee.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.470
APPRAISER: So when I saw this...

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.819
I was kind of excited.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.819
(laughing)

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:48.819
GUEST: Oh.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.970
APPRAISER: Well, the thing about Lava is,
it was very hard to make.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.460
They get cracked in the making.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.460
GUEST: Oh.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.801
APPRAISER: And I did go over your Lava with
my special light and a magnifying glass, and

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:04.290
I couldn't find any imperfections.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.460
An example like this, in a retail shop, could
sell between $100,000 and $150,000.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.680
GUEST: (laughing) Where's my brother?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.500
He... (laughs) Wow.

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.210
That's unbelievable.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.410
I had no idea.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.800
APPRAISER: I just can't believe that your
aunt bought all of this in the late '20s and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800
the early '30s.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
GUEST: Yeah.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
APPRAISER: It's... it's pretty remarkable.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.300
GUEST: Yeah.
