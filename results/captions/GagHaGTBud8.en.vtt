00:00:01.383 --> 00:00:02.216
POINT, IN MORE WAYS THAN WE CAN

00:00:02.217 --> 00:00:03.117
EVEN BEGIN.

00:00:03.118 --> 00:00:06.120
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, WE ARE IN

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.257
THE STUDIO OF RUSH LIMBAUGH.

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:10.358
FIRST, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.893
YOU.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:13.194
30 YEARS, TALK RADIO, THE KING

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:16.497
OF TALK RADIO, AND GOING

00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:17.065
STRONGER THAN EVER.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.466
&gt;&gt; Rush: IT IS AMAZING, IT

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:19.267
REALLY IS.

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:20.134
I AM ENJOYING IT AS MUCH AS I

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:22.403
EVER HAVE, IF NOT MORE SO.

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:24.205
I GET MORE THRILLS FROM IT, I

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:24.939
GET MORE SATISFACTION FROM IT,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.474
THAT I EVER HAD.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.076
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME 30 YEARS

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:30.078
AGO, OR EVEN 40, WHEN I WAS

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.179
DREAMING ABOUT THIS, BY THE TIME

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.115
I REACHED 65, THAT IT WOULD BE

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:34.882
MORE COMPETITIVE THAN EVER, THAT

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:36.651
IT WOULD BE MORE INVOLVED -- I

00:00:36.652 --> 00:00:40.254
THOUGHT 65, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:41.656
EASY, GO TO THE BEACH, DO A

00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:43.057
COUPLE HOURS A WEEK, THAT IS

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:44.292
THAT, LIKE JOHNNY CARSON DID.

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:46.661
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT DOING THIS.

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:49.530
LARGELY BECAUSE OF YOU -- AS YOU

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:50.999
JUST LAID OUT, WE ARE SCARCELY

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.067
AT A TIPPING POINT.

00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:54.669
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.804
ACTUALLY ARE AWARE OF HOW CLOSE

00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.275
WE ARE TO LOSING OUR COUNTRY IS

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:02.643
FOUNDED.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:03.511
WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE?

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:07.715
IT REALLY IS AT STAKE.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:09.650
I'VE BEEN TRYING AND I DON'T HOW

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.453
MANY WAYS TO EXPLAIN TO MY

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:14.022
AUDIENCE WHY IT IS DIFFERENT NOW

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:16.257
THAN IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO, OR 20.

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:18.993
AND I DO IT BY TRYING TO ANALYZE

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:19.527
WHO THE LEFT IS.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:23.064
WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:26.834
I AM NAIVE IN MANY WAYS.

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:29.470
&gt;&gt; Sean: I MIGHT TAKE AN

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.238
OBJECTION TO RUSH BEING NAIVE.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.938
&gt;&gt; Rush: YOU TELL ME IF THIS

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.874
IS NAIVE.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:33.674
I LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DURING

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:35.410
THE KAVANAUGH HEARING.

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:36.411
YOU DESCRIBED RICIN ON THE STUFF

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:37.712
TO SUSAN COLLINS.

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:41.382
WE LOOKED AT THE LITERAL MOB

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:42.917
BEHAVIOR, THAT WAS INSPIRED,

00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:46.054
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, BY THE

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:47.021
DEMOCRAT PARTY, THE MEDIA

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:48.856
ENCOURAGED IT.

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:53.594
IN MY NAIVE WORLD, THAT BEHAVIOR

00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:55.630
WOULD SECURE THE BIGGEST

00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:57.098
LANDSLIDE DEFEAT A POLITICAL

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.832
PARTY HAS EVER HAD.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.234
IN A SANE WORLD, WHERE DECENT

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:02.136
PEOPLE ARE THE MAJORITY, THAT

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:04.072
WOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND.

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:05.273
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE CONSIDERED

00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:05.640
RELEVANT.

00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:06.841
AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:09.277
WOULD WANT TO GET RID OF THAT AS

00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:11.412
QUICKLY AS THEY COULD.

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:13.648
YET, IT MAY BE CLOSE TO 50% OF

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:14.082
THE COUNTRY.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.850
I DON'T THINK IT IS, AND I HOPE

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:17.852
NOT, BUT THE FACT THAT IT

00:02:17.853 --> 00:02:19.454
CONTINUES TO SURVIVE, I HAVE

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:20.188
EVOLVED A BUNCH OF THEORIES TO

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.256
EXPLAIN IT.

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:23.624
AND I REALLY THINK -- BY THE

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.493
WAY, INTERRUPT ANY TIME WITH

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:26.094
QUESTIONS.

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:27.462
&gt;&gt; Sean: NOW, YOU ARE DOING

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:27.762
GREAT.

00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:30.565
&gt;&gt; Rush: I REALLY THINK THAT

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.934
ALL OF THIS -- THE VAST MAJORITY

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:35.136
OF IT, STILL, SEAN, REVOLVES

00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:38.039
AROUND ONE OF THE AGE-OLD

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.273
ARGUMENTS THAT LEFT VERSUS RIGHT

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:40.875
HAS HAD, THAT IS ROLE OF

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:41.275
GOVERNMENT.

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:42.376
IN THEIR LIVES.

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:45.446
THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, I READ

00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:46.647
SOME OF WHAT JIM GARRITY AND

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:47.882
NATIONAL REVIEW, ABOUT A MONTH

00:02:47.883 --> 00:02:49.016
AGO NOW, AND IT JUST STRUCK ME,

00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:51.252
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS DEAD ON.

00:02:51.253 --> 00:02:53.020
I WILL PARAPHRASE WHAT HE SAID.

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:54.956
HE SAID, WHAT HAS HAPPENED, IN

00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:56.157
HIS VIEW -- I ENDORSE THIS EVEN

00:02:56.158 --> 00:02:57.158
MORE THAN HE DOES PETER THINK IT

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.960
IS A BIGGER POINT THAT HE MADE

00:02:58.961 --> 00:02:59.227
IT.

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.362
THESE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, THE

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:04.899
MOB BEHAVIOR, IS REALLY A SERIES

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.135
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS THAT

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.538
HAVE TAKEN OVER POLITICS.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.242
WE HAVE POLITICIZED

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:14.976
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS TO THE

00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:17.245
POINTING OUT THAT THEY HAVE

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:18.446
BECOME THE OBJECTIVE OF THE

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:18.946
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

00:03:18.947 --> 00:03:21.849
ASSAULTING ALL OF THESE

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.450
DISPARATE, SEPARATE

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.184
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS, HAVING

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:25.219
THE GOVERNMENT DO IT,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.788
BASICALLY DETERMINED OUTCOMES.

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.558
AND GET EVEN WITH OPPRESSORS,

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:31.459
THE FOUNDING MAJORITY OF THE

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.792
COUNTRY.

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:33.261
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING

00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:34.428
WITH.

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:35.029
IF WE DON'T DEFINE THIS

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.631
PROPERLY, WE ARE NEVER GOING TO

00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:37.498
BE ABLE TO OPPOSE IT.

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.967
IF WE CONSIDER THE STUFF LEGIT,

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:40.468
WHICH IT ISN'T.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.003
THAT IT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:42.637
LEGITIMATE.

00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:43.371
WE DO NOT WANT TO COUNTRY BASED

00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:45.439
ON THAT KIND -- WE DON'T WANT

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.676
PEOPLE WINNING ELECTIONS BASED

00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:50.845
ON MOBS AND VIOLENCE.

00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:52.180
THINK IF THAT HAPPENS.

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.114
IF THEY WIN THE ELECTION BASED

00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:55.650
ON THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR --

00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:59.153
EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:01.989
WHAT DO DECENT PEOPLE DO?

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.058
DECENT PEOPLE DO NOT SPEND ALL

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.660
DAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:06.060
BATTLE THIS.

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:08.229
DECENT PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.963
LIVES.

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:12.266
WE'VE GOT PERVERSION, INDECENCY,

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:13.668
CORRUPTION COME UP AGAINST WHAT

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.037
USED TO BE CALLED NORMALCY.

00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:19.640
&gt;&gt; Sean: HILLARY CLINTON -- WE

00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:21.175
CAN'T BE CIVIL UNLESS YOU GIVE

00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:22.443
US POWER BACK.

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:24.245
ERIC HOLDER, THEY GO LOW, WE

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:24.612
KICK THEM.

00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:28.049
MAXINE WATERS, IF YOU SEE THEM,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.852
CREATE A CROWD.

00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:33.854
GO TELL THEM, FOLLOW THEM INTO

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:34.555
DEPARTMENT STORES AND GROCERY

00:04:34.556 --> 00:04:36.390
STORES AND GAS STATIONS.

00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:39.660
YOU ARE NOT WANTED ANYWHERE

00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:39.994
ANYMORE.

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:43.030
AND WE SAW PAM BONDI, SECRETARY

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:45.466
NIELSEN, AND WE SAW SARAH

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:48.236
SANDERS, TED CRUZ AND HIS WIFE,

00:04:48.237 --> 00:04:49.637
HEIDI, MITCH McCONNELL, I

00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:50.571
THINK RAND IS RIGHT.

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:51.739
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.039
HERE.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.842
IN THE END.

00:04:54.843 --> 00:04:56.978
LOOK AT, I BLAME THE PEOPLE FOR

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.647
THEIR ACTIONS, BUT THERE IS

00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:01.449
CERTAINLY MARCHING ORDERS HERE.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.450
CONFRONT, ATTACK, GET IN THEIR

00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:02.850
FACES.

00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:03.718
&gt;&gt; Rush: ALL OF IT IS MARCHING

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:04.652
ORDERS.

00:05:04.653 --> 00:05:06.254
ALL OF IT IS BOUGHT AND PAID

00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:06.520
FOR.

00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:08.823
LOOK AT THIS CARAVAN.

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:10.424
WHERE IS IT?

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:11.425
HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, DOESN'T

00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:11.759
MATTER.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.628
SOMEBODY IS PAYING FOR THIS.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.062
WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:15.496
THE BATHROOM?

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:18.165
WHO IS FEEDING THEM?

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:21.335
2,000, 4,000 PEOPLE, KIDS, THAT

00:05:21.336 --> 00:05:21.769
IS THE MAGIC.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.004
AND THEY PUT THE CHILDREN IN

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.772
THERE.

00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:26.641
WE CAN'T SEND THEM AWAY, IT IS

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:28.109
SO HORRIBLE.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.879
IT IS ALL DESIGNED AND IT IS ALL

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.980
DESIGNED DURING THE ELECTION

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.650
PAIRED WE HAVE THIS, WORRY ABOUT

00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:37.118
RAISING INTEREST RATES TO JAM

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:38.252
DOWN THE ECONOMY, WAY OVER

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:41.389
THERE, GUESS WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.190
ROBERT MUELLER IS ABOUT READY TO

00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:46.560
SUBMIT HIS REPORT.

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:48.929
WELL, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RULES

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.630
AND GUIDELINES SAY THEY SHOULD

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:53.167
NOT DO IT TO IMPACT THE RESULTS

00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:53.634
OF AN ELECTION.

00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:56.537
BUT THAT DIDN'T -- COMEY DID,

00:05:56.538 --> 00:05:57.238
DIDN'T HE?

00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:58.739
HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.473
TO HELP HILLARY, PEOPLE DON'T

00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:02.843
UNDERSTAND THIS.

00:06:02.844 --> 00:06:03.611
THESE THINGS ARE ALL PLANNED AND

00:06:03.612 --> 00:06:06.447
THEY ARE ALL GETTING FOCUSED

00:06:06.448 --> 00:06:07.248
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.849
PEOPLE ASK ME, WHAT CAN I DO?

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.618
I WANT TO DO MORE THAN VOTE.

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.054
RIGHT NOW, THAT IS THE ANSWER.

00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:13.821
I KNOW PEOPLE THINK THEIR VOTE

00:06:13.822 --> 00:06:17.058
IS NOT ENOUGH, BUT IT IS.

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.628
TURNOUT IS EVERYTHING.

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:21.929
THIS IS ALMOST AN IDENTICAL

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.998
SCENARIO TO 2016.

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:26.467
THEY THINK, SEAN, THEY REALLY

00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:30.071
DO -- SOME OF THIS IS HOPE, BUT

00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:31.972
A LOT OF AMERICANS THAT VOTED

00:06:31.973 --> 00:06:34.175
FOR TRUMP REGRET IT.

00:06:34.176 --> 00:06:36.677
TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISTAKE OF

00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:39.914
VOTING -- THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GO

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:40.815
OUT AND APOLOGIZE.

00:06:40.816 --> 00:06:44.819
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, SINCE

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.653
BARACK OBAMA, THE

00:06:45.654 --> 00:06:46.821
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN LOSING

00:06:46.822 --> 00:06:47.588
ELECTION PAIRED STARTING IN 2010

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.290
COME ALL THE WAY UP TO 2016, THE

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:52.760
DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS LOST 1200

00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.094
SEATS.

00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:54.829
NATIONAL, STATE, LOCAL.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.030
YOU HAVE TO COUNT ALL THE WAY

00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.298
DOWN TO THE DOG CATCHER, THEY

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:58.232
HAVE LOST.

00:06:58.233 --> 00:06:59.633
THEY HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF

00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:01.168
ELECTORAL POLITICAL POWER IN

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:04.038
WASHINGTON SINCE THE '20s.

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.439
WHERE IS THIS BLUE WAVE?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.174
WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:08.242
CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT?

00:07:08.243 --> 00:07:09.043
THE EVIDENCE AS THEY ARE ARE

00:07:09.044 --> 00:07:11.412
DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:12.646
TRUMP IS OUT THERE CONTINUING TO

00:07:12.647 --> 00:07:14.648
DO THE THINGS HE DID THAT WON

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:15.750
HIM THE ELECTION IN 2016, ALL OF

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:17.852
THESE RALLIES.

00:07:17.853 --> 00:07:19.320
THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET RID

00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:20.454
OF HIM.

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:21.856
THEY HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING AT

00:07:21.857 --> 00:07:23.357
US BEFORE THAT USUALLY GETS RID

00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:24.191
OF REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS, AND

00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:27.027
NOTHING HAS WORKED.

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:28.295
AND THEY'RE JUST FRUSTRATED AS

00:07:28.296 --> 00:07:30.064
THEY CAN BE, AND I THINK THEY

00:07:30.065 --> 00:07:30.798
ARE SO OVERPLAYING THIS, AND

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:33.567
THEY ARE GOING WAY BEYOND THE

00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:35.236
BOUNDS OF ANYWHERE NEAR

00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:36.237
PROPRIETY.

00:07:36.238 --> 00:07:37.171
WHAT THEY THINK, MOST AMERICANS

00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:41.242
WANT TO BE ENCOURAGED TO DO

00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:41.876
MOB-LIKE BEHAVIOR, GETTING

00:07:41.877 --> 00:07:42.410
PEOPLE'S FACES.

00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:43.177
I DON'T THINK PETE WE HAVE LOST

00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:46.280
THE COUNTRY TO THAT EXTENT

00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.249
THAT THAT WINS ELECTIONS.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.817
&gt;&gt; Sean: HOW BIG AN IMPACT --

00:07:49.818 --> 00:07:55.623
OHR TO ME A TIPPING POINT.

00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:56.824
I THINK MOST PEOPLE

00:07:56.825 --> 00:07:57.491
FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN THE

00:07:57.492 --> 00:07:59.026
RULE OF LAW, THE CONSTITUTION,

00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:00.961
DUE PROCESS, PRESUMPTION OF

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:01.328
INNOCENCE.

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:06.634
THERE WAS NONE OF THAT.

00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:07.568
&gt;&gt; Rush: LOOK HOW CLOSE THEY

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:09.103
WERE TO GETTING AWAY WITH THAT,

00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:09.837
THOUGH.

00:08:09.838 --> 00:08:11.439
YOU AND I WATCHED THIS FROM A

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.207
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN A LOT

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.074
OF PEOPLE.

00:08:14.075 --> 00:08:14.809
SADLY, THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.043
PEOPLE THAT ONLY GET THEIR NEWS

00:08:16.044 --> 00:08:17.611
FROM WHAT WE CALL THE MAINSTREAM

00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:19.213
MEDIA.

00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:19.713
IF DONALD TRUMP --

00:08:19.714 --> 00:08:20.481
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD NOT COME AT

00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:26.921
THAT RALLY, EXPOSED CHRISTINE --

00:08:26.922 --> 00:08:28.389
&gt;&gt; Sean: NO CORROBORATION.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.657
&gt;&gt; Rush: NON!

00:08:29.658 --> 00:08:33.461
THE FOUR PEOPLE SHE SAYS WHERE

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.362
THERE -- THEY GET MAD AT TRUMP

00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:36.230
FOR MOCKING HER.

00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.431
HE DIDN'T MARK HER PAIRED TO

00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:38.666
MOCK HER, HE WOULD HAVE TO

00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:40.334
IMPERSONATE HER.

00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:41.635
BUT I CAN DO, BUT I WILL NOT.

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:44.672
&gt;&gt; Sean: YOU ARE SHOWING GREAT

00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:45.639
RESTRAINT.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.106
HE EXPOSED HER.

00:08:46.107 --> 00:08:48.742
TO A BUNCH OF AMERICANS WHO

00:08:48.743 --> 00:08:50.144
DIDN'T KNOW, BECAUSE THE

00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:52.046
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAD NOT

00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:54.048
REPORTED ALL OF THE HOLES IN HER

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:54.348
STORY.

00:08:54.349 --> 00:08:56.617
SO TRUMP DOES, AND IN GETTING

00:08:56.618 --> 00:08:57.985
TRUMP, THEY END UP REPORTING

00:08:57.986 --> 00:08:59.653
WHAT TRUMP SAID PAIRED THAT WAS

00:08:59.654 --> 00:09:00.621
THE TIPPING POINT, PLUS WHAT

00:09:00.622 --> 00:09:01.755
KAVANAUGH DID TO SAVE HIMSELF

00:09:01.756 --> 00:09:03.224
PAIRED BUT YOU ARE RIGHT,

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:04.058
PERCEPTION OF INNOCENCE GONE

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:05.993
PAIRED THEY WERE CLOSE TO

00:09:05.994 --> 00:09:06.994
KILLING MATT BY INTIMIDATING

00:09:06.995 --> 00:09:09.897
REPUBLICAN ON THAT COMMITTEE

00:09:09.898 --> 00:09:10.264
COMMITTEE.

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:12.032
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK AGAIN BECAUSE

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:13.167
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT CAME IN

00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:14.101
AND SAVE THE DAY.

00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:16.270
&gt;&gt; Sean: LOOK, I DON'T HAVE A

00:09:16.271 --> 00:09:17.238
CRYSTAL BALL.

00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:19.373
I ALWAYS THOUGHT AND BELIEVED IN

00:09:19.374 --> 00:09:22.743
MY HEART THE MEDIA IS WRONG,

00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:23.244
TRUMP CAN WIN.

00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:25.679
YOU CAN SEE IT, YOU CAN FEEL IT.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.015
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO RUN

00:09:28.016 --> 00:09:28.782
AGAINST OBAMA AND '08.

00:09:28.783 --> 00:09:31.619
YOU SAW THE CROWDS, HE SAW THE

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.319
ENTHUSIASM, IN THAT CASE, I

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.222
THINK IT WAS A LOT OF HYPE AND

00:09:35.223 --> 00:09:37.191
NO CHANGE, TYPICAL LEFT-WING

00:09:37.192 --> 00:09:37.558
POLICIES.

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:38.592
YOU PREDICTED TO ME THAT IT

00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:41.629
WOULD FAIL, AND IT DID FAIL.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.296
BUT SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT

00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:43.998
PAIRED PRESIDENT TRUMP -- YOU

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:46.834
COULD SEE BUILDING MOMENTUM.

00:09:46.835 --> 00:09:50.237
AND NOW WE HAVE THESE MIDTERMS.

00:09:50.238 --> 00:09:51.639
FLORIDA, THEY COULD PICK UP A

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.106
SENATE SEAT.

00:09:52.107 --> 00:09:54.041
I THINK YOU COULD PICK ONE UP IN

00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:54.608
MISSOURI.

00:09:54.609 --> 00:09:56.410
I THINK HE WILL HOLD NEVADA.

00:09:56.411 --> 00:10:01.015
I THINK HE WILL WIN IN ARIZONA.

00:10:01.016 --> 00:10:02.483
NORTH DAKOTA, INDIANA, ALL

00:10:02.484 --> 00:10:04.118
POTENTIAL PICKUPS, WHERE I WOULD

00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:04.985
WORRY ABOUT MORTGAGE THE HOUSE.

00:10:04.986 --> 00:10:07.421
I DON'T HAVE A FEEL.

00:10:07.422 --> 00:10:09.223
&gt;&gt; Rush: IT IS HARD, SO MANY

00:10:09.224 --> 00:10:09.790
SEATS THERE.

00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:12.026
SO MANY VARIABLES AND VICTORIES.

00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:16.030
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THIS IN THE

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:16.730
MACRO WAY.

00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:17.798
LET'S COMPARE THIS -- YOU WANT

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:20.534
TO GO TO 2008 -- LET'S GO BACK

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:22.570
TO 2016.

00:10:22.571 --> 00:10:25.806
I KNOW YOU WERE, EARLY ON, VERY

00:10:25.807 --> 00:10:26.907
CONFIDENT THAT TRUMP WAS GOING

00:10:26.908 --> 00:10:27.608
TO WIN PAY MY STAFF HERE WILL

00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:30.644
TELL ME THAT TO GO DAYS -- WHEN

00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:32.212
I FIRST SAW THE FIRST POLLING

00:10:32.213 --> 00:10:32.947
AFTER TRUMP AND MILANI I WENT

00:10:32.948 --> 00:10:34.281
DOWN THE ESCALATOR, I SAID, HE

00:10:34.282 --> 00:10:36.250
IS THE NOMINEE.

00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:37.618
IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I FELT

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:38.252
IT.

00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:39.353
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:10:39.354 --> 00:10:41.422
BECAUSE I KNOW THE BOND, I SAW

00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:42.556
THOSE RALLIES.

00:10:42.557 --> 00:10:43.290
I SAW THE BOND THAT TRUMP HAD

00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:45.826
WITH HIS VOTERS.

00:10:45.827 --> 00:10:47.127
THE MEDIA DIDN'T CREATE THAT.

00:10:47.128 --> 00:10:49.630
HE DID.

00:10:49.631 --> 00:10:51.865
I DID VERSIONS OF THAT WHEN MY

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:53.167
SHOW STARTED TRAVELING AROUND,

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:54.768
48 WEEKENDS A YEAR FOR THE FIRST

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:55.970
TWO YEARS, TRYING TO GET MY

00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:57.371
RADIO SHOW ESTABLISHED.

00:10:57.372 --> 00:11:00.407
I SAW SIMILAR SUCCESS TRACK.

00:11:00.408 --> 00:11:01.408
AND NOBODY CAN BLOW UP THAT BOND

00:11:01.409 --> 00:11:04.411
THAT TRUMP VOTERS HAVE, BUT

00:11:04.412 --> 00:11:06.180
WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT, TO

00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:07.581
THIS DAY, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND

00:11:07.582 --> 00:11:08.649
DONALD TRUMP HERE THEY DON'T

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:09.783
UNDERSTAND HIS VOTERS, AND THEY

00:11:09.784 --> 00:11:11.485
ARE NOT CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHY.

00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:13.787
THEY JUST RESENTED.

00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:14.989
AND THEY ARE STILL OPERATING

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.090
UNDER THE SAME RULES THEY

00:11:16.091 --> 00:11:19.259
OPERATED UNDER IN 2016, AND THE

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.394
PARALLELS ARE IDENTICAL HERE.

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:22.796
THEY THINK I'M IN 2016, HILLARY

00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:24.431
IS GOING TO WIN.

00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:25.666
MASSIVE LANDSLIDE, MEASURING THE

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.267
CURTAINS, HILLARY PLANNING ALL

00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:28.002
OF THESE THINGS.

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:29.803
THE DEEP STATE GUYS BACK THEN

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:30.638
ARE CONFIDENT NOBODY WILL EVER

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:32.439
KNOW WHAT THEY DID, THEIR JOBS

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.443
AND CAREERS WILL BE SAFE.

00:11:36.444 --> 00:11:37.745
STRZOK AND ALL OF THEM, BUT THEN

00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:41.015
A TRUMP COMES ALONG AND WINS.

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:42.816
SAME THING NOW, THEY THINK THEY

00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:44.018
HAVE WON THE HOUSE A MONTH AGO.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:45.219
IT IS IN THE CAN.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.487
THEY ARE JUST WAITING FOR THE

00:11:46.488 --> 00:11:49.990
CALENDAR AND THE DAYS TO GO BY.

00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:52.693
WHEN ALL OF THEIR OWN POINT

00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:55.262
DATA SHOWS THE BLUE WAVE

00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:55.863
SHRINKING AND SHRINKING.

00:11:55.864 --> 00:12:00.267
NOW YOU FIND LESS CONFIDENCE IN

00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:02.202
ALL OF THE REPORTING ABOUT THE

00:12:02.203 --> 00:12:05.005
BLUE WAVE, SO NOW WE HAVE THE

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:06.407
CARE OF ON, THEY TRY KAVANAUGH

00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:08.842
PAIR LOOK AT ALL OF THE OCTOBER

00:12:08.843 --> 00:12:10.611
SURPRISES.

00:12:10.612 --> 00:12:11.011
POCAHONTAS.

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:11.812
ELIZABETH WARREN, HOW ABOUT

00:12:11.813 --> 00:12:12.446
THIS, FOLKS.

00:12:12.447 --> 00:12:14.248
WE USED TO BE JUDGED BY THE

00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:15.015
CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER.

00:12:15.016 --> 00:12:16.984
NOW IT IS THE CONTENT OF OUR

00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:17.251
DNA.

00:12:17.252 --> 00:12:19.086
IS THAT WITH THE DEMOCRATIC

00:12:19.087 --> 00:12:24.958
PARTY -- TALK ABOUT BASTARDIZING

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.561
MARTIN LUTHER KING.

00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:28.095
FEINSTEIN BOMBS OUT.

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:29.763
AND ALL OF THESE -- BALL FOUR

00:12:29.764 --> 00:12:31.665
WERE ATTEMPTED, WERE PURPOSE TO,

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.600
TO BLOW TRUMP UP, AND HE JUST

00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:35.035
KEEPS BEATING THEM BACK.

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:36.103
AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL

00:12:36.104 --> 00:12:36.637
WITH IT.

00:12:36.638 --> 00:12:38.005
THEY GET MORE AND MORE

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.773
FRUSTRATED, MORE AND MORE ANGRY.

00:12:39.774 --> 00:12:42.342
&gt;&gt; Sean: SOME ICE AT THE END

00:12:42.343 --> 00:12:46.714
OF THE SHOW WILL TAKE A CLIP AND

00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:49.016
RUN IT.

00:12:49.017 --> 00:12:50.084
MY AUDIENCE LOVES TO SEE YOU,

00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:52.486
THANKS FOR DOING THE SHOW.

00:12:52.487 --> 00:12:55.389
AS DO I.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.423
WHAT IF THEY WIN?

00:12:56.424 --> 00:12:59.993
WHAT IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN?

00:12:59.994 --> 00:13:02.629
YOU LOVE THAT QUESTION.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.530
&gt;&gt; Rush: THE PROBLEM HERE IS I

00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:05.399
AM ON TELEVISION, AND I'M REALLY

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.100
TRYING TO BE PERSUASIVE, I DO

00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:08.001
NOT WANT TO DRAMATIZE IT.

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:09.336
I DO NOT WANT TO LIE TO PEOPLE

00:13:09.337 --> 00:13:13.140
AND I DID NOT WANT TO FILL

00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:14.975
PEOPLE WITH PHONY, MANIPULATIVE,

00:13:14.976 --> 00:13:17.611
EMOTIONAL THINGS.

00:13:17.612 --> 00:13:18.946
BUT IT MIGHT SERVE TO ANSWER

00:13:18.947 --> 00:13:20.280
THAT QUESTION TO GO BACK -- WHAT

00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:22.950
IF HILLARY HAD WON IN 2016?

00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:25.319
STOP AND THINK OF THAT.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.354
THERE WOULDN'T BE A ROARING

00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:27.788
ECONOMY.

00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:28.956
THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY CAT

00:13:28.957 --> 00:13:30.791
TAX CUTS, THERE WOULD NOT HAVE

00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:31.892
BEEN ROLLED BACK ON REGULATIONS,

00:13:31.893 --> 00:13:36.196
NO SWEARING OF THE DEAL WITH

00:13:36.197 --> 00:13:36.497
NATO.

00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:37.297
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TOLD

00:13:37.298 --> 00:13:38.799
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GET USE TO

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.801
IT, THERE IS A NEW AMERICAN

00:13:40.802 --> 00:13:41.568
ECONOMY, AND IT IS FLAT LINE OR

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:43.203
IN DECLINE.

00:13:43.204 --> 00:13:45.506
AMERICA'S PAST, WE DID NOT

00:13:45.507 --> 00:13:47.007
DESERVE THAT.

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:48.942
AMERICA WAS FOUNDED BY A WHITE

00:13:48.943 --> 00:13:51.578
PATRIARCHY TO SET ITSELF UP --

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:52.746
PEOPLE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST,

00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:56.016
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

00:13:56.017 --> 00:13:57.351
THE DAYS BEHIND US, DID WE

00:13:57.352 --> 00:13:59.620
DIDN'T DESERVE THOSE ANYWAY.

00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:02.422
WE HAVE A FLAT LINE ECONOMY, WE

00:14:02.423 --> 00:14:04.424
WERE TOLD -- OBAMA IS OUT THERE

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:05.192
IN INDIANA TELLING THESE PEOPLE

00:14:05.193 --> 00:14:06.593
THEIR JOBS ARE NEVER COMING

00:14:06.594 --> 00:14:07.127
BACK.

00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:10.130
AND SOME IN THE AUDIENCE,

00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:12.633
"MR. TRUMP SAYS."

00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:13.700
AND OBAMA SAYS "WHAT IS HE GOING

00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:17.204
TO DO, WAVE A MAGIC WAND?"

00:14:17.205 --> 00:14:18.438
LOOK WHAT WE DID, THEY DO NOT

00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:20.307
WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT.

00:14:20.308 --> 00:14:22.009
THEY RESENT THE WHOLE IDEA OF

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:22.709
AMERICA BECOMING GREAT.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.311
THEY RESENT THE IDEA OF AMERICA

00:14:24.312 --> 00:14:25.379
AS A SUPERPOWER, RUNNING THE

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:25.846
WORLD FOR GOOD.

00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:33.420
WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS.

00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:35.289
IF HE HAD AN WON, SEAN, I

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.690
SHUDDER TO THINK, WITH

00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:37.291
HILLARY CLINTON IN THE

00:14:37.292 --> 00:14:38.392
WHITE HOUSE AND ALL OF HER

00:14:38.393 --> 00:14:40.327
CRONIES IN THE CABINET

00:14:40.328 --> 00:14:44.131
POSITIONS, AND THE VALIDATION OF

00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:49.236
ALL OF THESE ON BALL, WEIRD,

00:14:49.237 --> 00:14:50.704
PERVERTED, LEFT-WING BEHAVIORS

00:14:50.705 --> 00:14:51.271
BECOMING MORE AND MORE

00:14:51.272 --> 00:14:53.073
NORMALIZED, AND POLITICS AND

00:14:53.074 --> 00:14:54.341
GOVERNMENT ALL BEING ADDRESSED

00:14:54.342 --> 00:14:56.376
IN THEIR GRIEVANCES -- WE HAVE

00:14:56.377 --> 00:14:57.144
BECOME A COUNTRY OF NOTHING BUT

00:14:57.145 --> 00:15:00.414
A BUNCH OF VICTIMS CONSTANTLY

00:15:00.415 --> 00:15:01.815
ANGRY, DEMANDING THAT SOMEBODY

00:15:01.816 --> 00:15:03.116
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, INSTEAD

00:15:03.117 --> 00:15:06.921
OF ALL OF US -- AS WE USED TO
