00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.600
How high do we need
to make our dykes?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.280
How can you protect yourself
from a hurricane?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.360
The effects of global warming
are becoming increasingly visible.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.400
How long must we wait before
taking real, serious measures?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.920
This is&lt;i&gt; Backlight.
Welcome to our wet, rough future.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.440
Long, long ago, when people
still drank water from plastic bottles...

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.520
...and went on holiday
four times a year by plane...

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.280
...when we still threw car tyres
into the sea...

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.320
...and bought clothes every few weeks,
in warm cosy shops...

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.040
...when we ate meat every day
and were quite content...

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.240
...that's when glaciers still existed: thick
masses of ice on beautiful mountains.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.680
But that was long ago.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.320
The ice has melted and
we're up to our neck in water.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.440
Hurricanes and tornados
have ripped cities apart.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.920
The mountains have fallen down
onto our villages.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.920
We knew it would happen.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.320
But most of us preferred
not to think about it.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.240
This story takes place
long before that day.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.320
In a time where people tried
to change the course of events.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.280
One of these people was Saul Luciano
Lliuya, a mountain guide from Peru.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.800
He took his battle to Europe.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.440
With his German allies, he wanted
to tackle the CO2 emission...

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.160
...responsible for melting his glacier
and threatening to destroy his village...

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.360
...at the source.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.320
Many people will support you
for your work.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.320
You can explain to them
what you're doing and why.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.200
You'll have a lot of people behind you.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.600
It's important to get a lot of attention...

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.920
...from the industrial countries.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.200
Developed countries like Germany,
among others.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800
Saul felt powerless for a long time.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.240
The melt water from the glacier had
accumulated above his village.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.280
The dam was ready to burst.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.800
It would destroy his home and
flush away all the drinking water.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.920
The mountains have always been
part of our lives.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.920
They provide us with the water we use.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.320
If we didn't have that,
that would be the end of us.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.480
If we lose the water, we're finished.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.840
One day, Saul met a group
of German environmentalists...

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.760
...during a hike in the Andes.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.440
They didn't know how to protect
a village from a melting glacier.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.320
But they encouraged him
to fight the looming catastrophe.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.480
They became Saul's guardian angels
and he became their talisman.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.320
Can we practice your speech?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.640
Say it in a clear, strong voice.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.720
'I'm from Huaraz, in the Peruvian Andes.'
Say it like that. Go on.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.280
Since I was a small child
I've seen it change.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.240
Just shouting that something
had to change, wasn't enough.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.640
And so Saul, with the support
of the German environmentalists...

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.560
...took the unusual step
to hire a lawyer...

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.120
...and sue one of the biggest
polluting companies in the world:

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.200
The German coal-fired
power station company RWE.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.280
Today we're going to enter the court
the same way as last time.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.120
The judge sits in front,
we'll sit on the right.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.720
And the defendant will sit on the left.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.320
We'll sit down, and the names
will be recorded in the protocol.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.320
And then the court will
state how things will proceed.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.320
It's your trial.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.320
Like last time.
You're the plaintiff, you decide.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.640
It's important to remember that.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.480
And keep your back straight.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.720
Chest out.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:14.320
We want to make sure you're not at risk.
You're fully in your right.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.720
All RWE is saying is:

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.200
Everyone pollutes,
so we're not responsible.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.040
I don't believe that is justified.
We have the right to be there.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.320
What do you expect personally?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.320
We're hoping to win today.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:45.720
If we lose, global warming will continue.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.720
But if we win, we'll be contributing
to the end of global warming.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.960
We can't imagine it now,
but one day everything will be gone.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.120
Our houses, our streets,
our libraries and beauty parlours.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.240
Our planes will be grounded.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.480
Grass will grow between the rubber
wheels, and moss on the seats.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.880
Cities will sink into the mud
and be flushed away by the water.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.200
Humans caused this. It has only just
begun and we're unable to stop it.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.280
In the summer of 2017,
a Swiss mountain came down...

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.160
...crushing the village of Bondo.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.480
The huge mudslide was the result of the
melting glacier just above the village.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.080
We were in the high side valley,
Bondasca.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.680
I was cooking in front of the house.
I'd made a fire with a cooking pot.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:30.120
Then Monica came too. It was 7.30,
she came to bring some meat.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.600
And then I got a call,
asking if Monica had made it safely.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.440
They were afraid
something would happen to her.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.280
So I rang Monica in the hut,
and I heard the hut manager cry:

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.720
'The whole mountain is coming down.'

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.640
They filmed it, did you see?
- Yes, I saw that video.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.920
Barbara cried: Get out of here.
You see it coming towards us.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.240
We went outside,
but I couldn't hear anything.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.320
But suddenly I saw
all these plants coming down.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.080
We ran away as fast as we could.
- Yes.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.920
To the little lakes?
- Yes, down to the little lakes.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:31.080
After 30 or 40 metres we looked back,
and everything was gone.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.160
There was just a big pile of rubble.
We ran 30, 40 metres through the field.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.600
Tragic.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.000
A helicopter took us away.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.200
I asked the pilot: Where are you going?
We're from Bondo.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.880
We can't go there, he said.
- Gosh.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.320
We wore the same clothes for a week.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.960
Because everything we had
in Bondasca was gone.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.920
I had nothing, not even slippers.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.920
You were in bad shape.
- Yes, I hardly had anything for a week.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.880
Eventually I could go back
and borrowed clothes from Dario.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.920
Normally it would come down 300 metres
and stay there.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.600
But nothing like this.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.920
Anyway, what can you do?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.320
When did life start up again in Bondo?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.800
When I opened up again.
- That's when it started?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.320
How long after the landslide was that?

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.920
52 days.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.920
Were you lucky
that it didn't hit your house?

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.520
Absolutely.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.920
Checkpoint for the red zone.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.920
You can only go in supervised.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.320
OK, and the red zone is
the zone that's still dangerous?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.520
It's still inhabitable.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:43.760
Nature follows its own course,
it doesn't ask people what to do.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.200
Was anyone killed?

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.840
Eight tourists.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.080
Eight tourists. Where were they?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.360
They went into the side valley.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.920
They didn't see it coming?
- No, probably not.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.240
It took them by surprise.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.080
Were those tourists ever found?
- No.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.520
They were buried in the rubble.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:30.000
We have to accept the consequences
and carry on with our lives.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.640
The question is also:
Who will return to Bondo?

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.280
What did it look like?
- Deserted.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.880
Everyone was gone.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.760
Company ready.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.960
How can you protect your village
from a melting glacier?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.560
The rock under the glacier becomes
saturated with water and breaks off.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.040
Since the Bondo disaster, an alarm will
go off when there's an avalanche threat.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.880
Residents will have exactly
four minutes to escape.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.280
There's no alarm service in Peru.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.000
Global warming continues steadily.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.600
It's the biggest threat
to the next generations...

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.720
...and yet there seems to be a sort of
paralysis when we talk about it.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.880
What are we supposed to do?
Radically change our lives?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Would it make a difference?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.600
Saul's story captures the imagination.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.080
If his village is buried,
the consequences will be profound.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.400
But European glaciers are melting too.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.880
The environmentalists brought him to
Switzerland to show him he's not alone.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.800
Can you imagine going up
this easily this in Peru?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.000
You're from here.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.480
You must have seen the glacier
retreat over the last few years?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.120
A bit more every year.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.440
The mouth of the Lang Glacier
has collapsed.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.680
The mouth. It had become so thin
that it collapsed.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.120
This year?
- Yes, this year.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.920
In the Lötschen Valley.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.080
Do you have childhood memories
of the glacier?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.040
Yes, especially of the Rhône Glacier.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.320
The Rhône Glacier flows down to the
valley and the train goes right past it.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.720
And all the way up at the back,
a lake has formed.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.280
The melt water has formed a lake.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.800
Look at the horizon.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.200
You never know what's going on
behind a mountain...

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.760
...until you climb it.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.520
We're at the Eggishorn,
2,900 metres high.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.840
We have a wonderful view
of the Aletsch Glacier from here.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.560
This year the glacier has lost at least
three to four metres in volume.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.800
Just this summer.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.720
That's a lot. In this summer,
the summer of 2017...

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.040
...the Swiss Alps...

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.280
...more than three percent
of the total ice volume...

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.360
...has melted away in one year's time.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.040
That makes you think.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.120
When you're here every summer
and you see how quickly it's going.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.400
It has always fluctuated.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:49.720
But in the last fifteen years
it's been going extremely fast.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.080
You've seen that?
- Yes, you see it happen.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.880
All you have to do is come to Eggishorn
and look at the glacier.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.920
It's going incredibly quickly.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.880
What can we do about it?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.400
Yes, what can we do?

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.680
All the fuel we're burning...

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.320
...with our cars, planes, heating...

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.680
...that's speeding up the process,
that is crystal clear.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.840
It's a vicious circle.
You can't change things overnight...

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.120
...and get rid of all
the heatings, cars, and so on.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.920
The population is growing and more
and more fossil fuels are burned.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.240
That speeds it up, so it's difficult.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.720
Many say it's already too late.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.880
But nobody can truly imagine
what that really means.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.480
Have we turned our backs
on nature?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.040
And is nature now turning
her back on us?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.200
There is hope for the future,
but uneasiness prevails.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.240
Author Amitav Ghosh,
who's writing a new book on Sicily...

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.800
...was the child of climate fugitives
from Bangladesh.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.760
He thinks that the human desire
for possessions and comfort...

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:33.120
...and our desire to live the good life,
will be our downfall.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.920
In Europe people are studying
permafrost in Sierra Nevada, the Alps...

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.520
...and from Scandinavia to Spitsbergen.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.400
Because permafrost
is affected by climate change.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:40.360
Scientists need to know how the soil
temperature changes over the years.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.680
That's what the house looked like.
Last year, not this year.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.400
The garden with the hydrangeas
and the roses here.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.280
Loss is part of life.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.920
Such a lovely rose.
- It was indeed.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.240
The mountain, the Cengalo,
more or less exploded.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.880
Even the specialized
geologists were surprised.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.560
What's it like on the inside?
- It's fine.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.160
No floods downstairs either?
- Nothing at all.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.040
People keep saying that: We should be
happy the house is still standing.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.840
We've been lucky.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.840
Everyone has accepted
his or her damage.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.880
Everyone deals with it their own way.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.200
The worst is obviously death.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.760
That's the worst that can happen to you.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.560
But I have to now...
Next spring will be hard.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.560
There are far worse things.
Tomorrow things will be better.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:20.680
People are killed all over the world.
There are worse things than this.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.560
We're still here,
we can talk to each other.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.400
We can have coffee together
and we'll sleep well again tonight.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.040
There you go.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.880
There's more poverty in Peru than here.
You can see that, can't you?

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.160
It's almost like being home.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.920
Yes, Peruvian Switzerland.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.480
Yes, that's what they say.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.440
I grew up in the mountains.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:15.720
I saw what happened to
the mountains with my own eyes.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.760
As I got older, I could see
the glacier retreat more and more.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.760
I could see it change.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.840
And because I worked
as a mountain guide...

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.160
...I could feel and see
the changes straight away.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:43.560
The climate change,
the glacier retreating.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.640
It's very sad to see
the mountains disappearing.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.520
You have to look at it every day...

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.680
...and feel it and do something about it.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.320
Because it's your nature,
your mountains that's being damaged.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.960
You have to do something
to stop it.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.480
I'm hungry.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:21.200
At an altitude of 4,400 metres...

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:26.720
...there's a massive amount of water.
The town is down below.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.880
If there's an avalanche or earthquake...

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.080
...it might collapse and come down.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.760
In Peru we also contribute to pollution...

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.320
...but relatively little.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.520
We've hardly contributed to pollution...

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.400
...and yet we're so badly affected
by the consequences.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.440
There's bread and cheese in there.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.600
This is for the rubbish.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.520
This one's better, it's paper.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.240
You're right, that's better.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.520
My client has an acute problem.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.600
It's a matter of time before
his house is flushed away...

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.760
...by the imminent glacier flood
in the Andean Mountains.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.720
The problem isn't new,
but it is a big problem.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.000
He wants to force measures
to prevent the tidal wave.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.720
In concrete terms this means a dam
has to be built and new drain pipes...

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.920
...to make the lake safe.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.320
He says RWE plays a significant part
in global warming.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.480
RWE's business model is based
on producing electricity with coal.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.440
That leads to CO2 emission.
That's how they make money.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.360
So I want them to make sure
that my house isn't flushed away.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.760
We're not holding RWE solely
responsible for global warming.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.640
We've never suggested that.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.400
We're saying:
For the emission you have caused...

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.280
...you need to take
precautionary measures.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.760
RWE says: That's impossible.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:15.160
To make a claim like that you'd need
to monitor each CO2 molecule...

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.280
...and follow its effect
on the glacier in question.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.320
That's impossible.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.560
Secondly, even if you don't do that,
it's completely unrealistic...

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.040
...to pick one out of so many culprits.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.360
Even if you could,
it's impossible to establish...

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.720
...that our emission made
any difference to that one area.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:47.000
You need to know that RWE causes
the most CO2 emission in Europe.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.880
RWE emits as much
as the whole of Holland.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.720
Around 20% of Germany's
total emission comes from RWE.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.880
RWE is responsible for 0,5%
of the total rise in temperature.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.800
That's not negligible, it's significant.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.680
You can't compare it to
an individual car owner.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:13.840
Car owners have a collective effect.
RWE just on its own.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.960
Why do we need so many words...

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.960
...to protect something
which everyone knows is vital?

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.560
We're aware of the consequences
and yet we pollute more and more.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.000
Meanwhile, all over the world...

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.360
...people are busy cleaning up
the damage nature has caused.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.000
As if nothing happened.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.080
The step that Saul has taken
seems peculiar...

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.920
...seeing as he lives in Peru,
and not in Germany.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.520
And German energy giant RWE
is not the only polluter in the world.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.640
We are all polluters.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600
Hello.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.480
You live in the red zone?
Then I won't hold you up.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.880
You haven't been home for a month?
- Two months.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.440
We're coming with you. We'll walk.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.520
Good, good. Thank you.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.840
Aren't you afraid of living here?
- No.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:13.840
Not now, but in springtime...
- Maybe in spring, but not now.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.720
Are you sleeping at home tonight?
- Yes.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.960
After two months.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.720
When we heard, we fled into the forest.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.480
We were picked up
by a helicopter later on.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.440
After half an hour, or 45 minutes.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.680
Because there was a cloud of...
how do you call that?

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.920
He couldn't fly because of all the dust.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:53.920
How did they know you were there?
- No. Yes, they did know.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:59.840
They were told. The people in
the village knew we were up there.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.840
You were lucky.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.920
Very lucky.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.880
Otherwise we wouldn't be here.
We wouldn't have been carried off.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.440
They say it's because
of the climate change.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:24.320
I think so too.
It's because of the permafrost.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.880
But well...

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.720
Should we change how we live?
- We should, but how?

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.160
Difficult, isn't it?

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.440
We were at the Aletsch glacier.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.160
It has melted a lot.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.920
So has the Bernina.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.600
The Bernina is retreating
more and more.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:54.520
Will more mountains come down?
- Absolutely.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.680
If the temperature
continues to rise like this...

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.320
...I think there will be
more places where...

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:09.720
You can't do much about it.
People are a bit...

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:27.600
After a long session, a German judge
rules in favour of Saul.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.200
He can sue energy giant RWE...

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.600
...for being responsible for melting his
glacier on the other side of the globe.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.320
The case is far from decided.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.480
You look happy. How did it go?

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:51.360
It's incredible.
It's an overwhelming feeling.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.480
The court heard all my arguments.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.880
Now we can start proving that RWE...

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.160
...is co-responsible for the rise in
temperature and for my client's problem.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.720
It has far-reaching consequences,
but we're primarily very happy...

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.960
...that we were truly heard...

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:18.120
...and such a clear decision was made.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.200
The trial will be continued.
My goal for today has been reached.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.720
How does your client feel?

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.120
The mountains won.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.360
The lagoons are the tears
of the mountains.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.440
Justice has heard us
and ruled in our favour.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.720
Join our discussion
about the devil's choice...

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.880
...between a care-free life
and a melting glacier...

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.600
...at our meet-up in Pakhuis
De Zwijger in Amsterdam.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.400
Or a meet-up near you, like
the Central Library in Utrecht.
