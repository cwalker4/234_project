00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.768
The President: Thank you very much.

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:06.773
Wow, what a nice visit this was.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.011
Inspirational visit,
I have to tell you.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.646
I'm a fan.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.281
I'm a big fan.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:20.587
I want to thank Howard
Kettell, Francis Spradley

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.457
of the Andrew Jackson
Foundation, and all of the

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.260
foundation's incredible
employees and supporters

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.263
for preserving this great
landmark, which is what it

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:34.768
is -- it's a landmark of
our national heritage.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:39.305
And a special thank you to
Governor Bill Haslam and

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.207
his incredible wife, who
-- we just rode over

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:46.780
together -- and Senators
Lamar Alexander and Bob

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.416
Corker, two great friends
of mine, been a

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.950
big, big help.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.820
Both incredible guys.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.689
In my address to Congress,
I looked forward nine

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.628
years, to the 250th
anniversary of

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.964
American Independence.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:09.068
Today, I call attention to
another anniversary: the

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:14.073
250th birthday of the very
great Andrew Jackson.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:23.783
(Applause.)

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.886
And he loved Tennessee, and so do I --

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.956
to tell you that.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:30.757
(Applause.)

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.894
On this day
in 1767, Andrew Jackson

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:40.600
was born on the backwoods
soil of the Carolinas.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.069
From poverty and
obscurity, Jackson rose to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.607
glory and greatness --
first as a military

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.710
leader, and then as the
seventh President of the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.912
United States.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.282
He did it with courage,
with grit, and with

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.184
patriotic heart.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.854
And by the way, he was one
of our great Presidents.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:05.959
(Applause.)

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.496
Jackson was
the son of the frontier.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.131
His father died
before he was born.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.868
His brother died fighting
the British in the

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.903
American Revolution.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.706
And his mother caught
a fatal illness while

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.276
tending to the
wounded troops.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:28.248
At the age of 14, Andrew
Jackson was an orphan, and

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.283
look what he
was able to do.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.585
Look what he was
able to build.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.787
It was during the Revolution that Jackson

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:40.927
first confronted and defied an arrogant elite.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.762
Does that sound familiar to you?

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:43.763
(Laughter.)

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.432
I wonder why
they keep talking about

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.434
Trump and Jackson,
Jackson and Trump.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.972
Oh, I know the
feeling, Andrew.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:56.576
(Laughter.)

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.946
Captured by the Redcoats and ordered

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.983
to shine the boots of a
British officer, Jackson

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.185
simply refused.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.689
The officer took his saber
and slashed at Jackson,

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.226
leaving gashes in his head
and hand that remained

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.763
permanent scars for
the rest of his life.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.533
These were the first and
far from the last blows

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.970
that Andrew Jackson took
for his country that he

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.538
loved so much.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:30.176
From that day on, Andrew
Jackson rejected authority

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:33.980
that looked down on
the common people.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.184
First as a boy, when
he bravely served the

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.920
Revolutionary cause.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.425
Next, as the heroic victor
at New Orleans where his

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.161
ragtag -- and it was
ragtag -- militia, but

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.129
they were tough.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.765
And they drove the British
imperial forces from

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:57.103
America in a triumphant
end to the War of 1812.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:00.707
He was a real
general, that one.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.209
And, finally, as President
-- when he reclaimed the

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.881
people's government from
an emerging aristocracy.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.918
Jackson's victory shook
the establishment

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.987
like an earthquake.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:17.690
Henry Clay, Secretary of
State for the defeated

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.494
President John Quincy
Adams, called Jackson's

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:25.498
victory "mortifying
and sickening".

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.133
Oh, boy, does this
sound familiar.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.636
(Laughter.)

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.703
Have we heard this?

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.238
(Laughter.)

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:36.909
This is terrible.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.913
He said there had been "no
greater calamity" in the

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.915
nation's history.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:45.752
The political class in
Washington had good reason

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:50.423
to fear Jackson's
great triumph.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:53.159
"The rich and powerful,"
Jackson said, "too often

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.561
bend the acts of
government to their

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.964
selfish purposes."

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.567
Jackson warned they had
turned government into an

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:05.505
"engine for the support of
the few at the

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:08.608
expense of the many."

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:11.611
Andrew Jackson was the
People's President, and

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.314
his election came at a
time when the vote was

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.784
finally being extended
to those who did

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:20.586
not own property.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.855
To clean out the
bureaucracy, Jackson

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:27.493
removed 10 percent of
the federal workforce.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.595
He launched a campaign
to sweep out

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.830
government corruption.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.764
Totally.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:35.168
He didn't want
government corruption.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.637
He expanded benefits
for veterans.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.440
He battled the centralized
financial power that

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.743
brought influence at
our citizens' expense.

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.312
He imposed tariffs on
foreign countries to

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:49.215
protect American workers.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.350
That sounds very familiar.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.719
Wait till you see what's
going to be happening

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.720
pretty soon, folks.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.191
(Laughter.)

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:58.891
It's time.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:05:59.892
It's time.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.695
Andrew Jackson was called
many names, accused of

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.631
many things, and by
fighting for change,

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:09.335
earned many, many enemies.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:13.372
Today the portrait of this
orphan son who rose to the

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:17.110
presidency hangs proudly
in the Oval Office,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.479
opposite the portrait of
another great American,

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.814
Thomas Jefferson.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:25.084
I brought the Andrew
Jackson portrait there.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.453
(Applause.)

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.156
Right behind me, right -- boom, over my

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.492
left shoulder.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.427
Now I'm honored to
sit between those two

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:38.297
portraits and to use this
high office to serve,

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.266
defend, and protect the
citizens of the

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.367
United States.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:42.468
It is my great honor.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.203
I will tell you that.

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:48.241
From that desk I can
see out the wonderful,

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:53.246
beautiful, large great
window to an even greater

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:59.652
magnolia tree, standing
strong and tall across the

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.487
White House lawn.

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.457
That tree was planted
there many years ago, when

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.093
it was just a sprout
carried from

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.327
these very grounds.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.362
Came right from here.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:13.299
(Applause.)

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.334
Beautiful tree.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:20.306
That spout was nourished,
it took root, and on this,

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:28.781
his 250th birthday, Andrew
Jackson's magnolia is a

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.384
sight to behold.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:35.188
I looked at it
actually this morning.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:36.289
Really beautiful.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.059
(Applause.)

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.527
But the growth of that beautiful

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:44.463
tree is nothing compared
to growth of our

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:46.499
beautiful nation.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.135
That growth has been made
possible because more and

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.138
more of our people have
been given their dignity

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:56.809
as equals under law and
equals in the eyes of God.

00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:01.414
Andrew Jackson as a
military hero and genius

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.850
and a beloved President.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.887
But he was also a flawed
and imperfect man, a

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.389
product of his time.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:14.994
It is the duty of each
generation to carry on the

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.963
fight for justice.

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:21.167
My administration will
work night and day to

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.637
ensure that the sacred
rights which God has

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:30.076
bestowed on His children
are protected for each and

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:33.946
every one of you, for
each and every American.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:38.784
(Applause.)

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:41.320
We must all remember Jackson's words:

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.860
that in "the planter, the
farmer, the mechanic, and

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.266
the laborer," we will find
muscle and bone

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.233
of our country.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:54.901
So true.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:55.568
So true.

00:08:55.568 --> 00:09:00.573
Now, we must work in our
time to expand -- and we

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.778
have to do that because
we have no choice.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:08.948
We're going to make
America great again, folks.

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:12.451
We're going to make
America great again --

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.153
(applause)

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.589
-- to expand
the blessings of America

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:19.558
to every citizen
in our land.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:22.228
And when we do,
watch us grow.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.663
Watch what's happening.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:25.631
You see it
happening already.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.668
You see it with
our great military.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.537
You see it with
our great markets.

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.306
You see it with our
incredible

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:34.206
business people.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:37.443
You see it with the level
of enthusiasm that they

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:40.112
haven't seen
in many years.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:42.815
People are proud
again of our country.

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:46.152
And you're going to get
prouder and prouder and

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.753
prouder, I can
promise you that.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.489
(Applause.)

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:51.590
And watch us grow.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.994
We will truly be one
nation, with deep roots, a

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:59.899
strong core, and a very
new springtime of American

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.068
greatness yet to come.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:06.639
Andrew Jackson, we thank
you for your service.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.543
We honor you
for your memory.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.979
We build on your legacy.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:17.917
And we thank God for the
United States of America.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.251
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.252
(Applause.)
