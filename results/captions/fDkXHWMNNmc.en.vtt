00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.920
Welcome, and most importantly, congratulations!

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.620
Congratulations to everyone who's nominated tonight.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.620
Thank you for letting me be a part of this.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.540
I'm excited. I've never been to the Oscars before.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240
This is my first time here

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.040
and the way you people go through hosts, it's probably my last time here, so I'm gonna enjoy this while I'm here.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.940
This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.180
and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.460
And I think that is an amazing thing.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.780
As you know, I don't have to tell anybody, the country is divided right now.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.860
I've been getting a lot of advice

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.860
people have been telling me it's time to bring everyone together

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.560
you need to say something to unite us, and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.980
let's just get something straight off the top

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.840
I'm not-- I can't do that. That's not-- there's only one Braveheart

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.180
in this room, and he's not gonna unite us either.  Okay?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.700
Mel, you look great. I think the Scientology is working, I really do.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.360
I'm not the man to unite this country, but it can be done.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.240
You know, if every person watching this show

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.980
I don't want to get too serious, but there are millions and millions of people watching right now

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.700
and if every one of you took a minute to reach out to one person

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.840
you disagree with - someone you like - and have a positive

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.100
considerate conversation - not as liberals or conservatives

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.840
as Americans, if we would all do that, we could make America great again. We really could.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.840
It starts with us.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.340
And tonight, in the spirit of healing and bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.020
with someone I've had issues with.  I would.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.680
Matt Damon. Now Matt, I've known Matt for a long time now.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.980
You know, I've known Matt so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.420
Okay?  True.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.040
And we've had problems. He's a selfish person.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.620
Those of you who have worked with him know this.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.480
But Matt did something very unselfish and I want to commend him for it.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.240
For real. Matt, as you probably know, could have starred

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240
in "Manchester By The Sea", he was the producer

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.140
it's nominated for six Oscars including Lead Actor

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.320
and he could have taken that lead actor part for himself.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.560
But he didn't, he gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.440
He handed what turned out to be an Oscar caliber role

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:42.920
over to his friend and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.900
And that movie, "The Great Wall" went on to lose 80 million dollars.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.960
Smooth move, dumbass.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.660
See? It's so easy to reach out and heal. And I want to say-- maybe this is not

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.160
a popular thing to say, but I want to say thank you to President Trump.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.680
I mean remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.240
That's gone!

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.660
Thanks to him.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.520
What a night. It has been an amazing year for movies.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.440
Black people saved NASA and white people saved jazz.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.520
That's what we call progress.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.360
A little movie musical named, "La La Land" ties the all time Oscar record

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360
it was directed by Damien Chazelle

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:41.240
Fourteen nominations.  Fourteen nominations: one for every year Damien has been alive.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.980
Tonight is very important for Damien: if he wins, he'll be able to go to any college he wants.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.760
So we wish you the best.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.580
The movie business is changing. For the first time ever, Amazon is represented

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.180
at the Academy Awards. Amazon is the first streaming service nominated for Best Picture.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.120
Jeff Bezos is the founder and CEO and I want to say congratulations to Jeff

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.580
you know, and I also want you to know, Jeff, if you win tonight you can expect your Oscar

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.700
to arrive in two to five business days.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.620
Possibly stolen by a Grubhub delivery man.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.960
Amazon produced "Manchester By The Sea"

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.280
That was a fun movie, wasn't it?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.940
You know if you search for "Manchester By The Sea" on Amazon it says

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.020
"Customers who bought this item also purchased Zoloft.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.440
I don't know what's going on but there are a lot of sad movies this year.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:44.340
Of all the nominees, the only happy ending of all the nominees was the one in the middle of "Moonlight".

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.520
You didn't watch it, did you?  "Oh we love it so much!"

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.280
The incredible Denzel Washington is nominated for "Fences" - a movie he also directed.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.160
I don't know, you've probably heard the story of how it came together: apparently Denzel had always wanted

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.620
to work with Denzel, and it just so happened that their schedules worked out

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.980
and the rest is Oscar history. Congratulations to you, my friend.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.240
We have friends and colleagues visiting from all around the world tonight.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.620
The great actress from France, Isabelle Huppert, is here with us.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.960
Isabelle, as you know, is nominated for her performance

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.540
in the movie, "Elle" and on behalf of everyone here, I would like to say

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.260
we didn't see "Elle" but we absolutely loved it. You were amazing in that film

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.000
and I'm glad Homeland Security let you in tonight. I really am.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.160
We are very welcoming to outsiders here in Hollywood.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.840
We don't discriminate against people based on what countries they come from

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.720
we discriminate against them based on their age and weight.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.940
Andrew Garfield lost 40 pounds - where is Andrew?

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.940
Oh you can barely even see him, he got so thin

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.060
There he is. He lost 40 pounds for his role in the movie, "Silence".

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:05.720
It was an astonishing physical transformation that hasn't been attempted since every actress in every role ever.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.480
Viggo Mortensen, who is terrific, is nominated for Best Actor

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.140
for his performance in the movie, "Captain Fantastic"

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.580
and it is so well deserved. Too often The Academy only recognizes movies that people have seen.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.160
And I just think it's wonderful.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.460
We are here tonight to honor great actors

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.680
but we're also here to honor the actors who seem great, but actually really aren't.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.300
And of all the "great" actors here in Hollywood

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:55.040
one in particular has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.020
See?  That's what he means.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.540
And may I say, from her mediocre early work in "The Dear Hunter" and "Out of Africa"

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.680
to her underwhelming performances in "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Sophie's Choice",

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.300
Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.240
over the course of her lackluster career.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.360
This is Meryl's 20th Oscar nomination.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.480
Made even more amazing considering the fact that she wasn't even in a movie this year

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.120
we just wrote her name down out of habit.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.120
Meryl, stand up if you would. Everybody please join me in giving Meryl Streep

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:48.960
a totally undeserved round of applause, will you?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.920
The highly overrated Meryl Streep, everyone.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.900
We're gonna have fun tonight. I hope we're gonna have fun tonight.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.780
Nice dress by the way, is that an Ivanka?

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.540
This is exciting. I think it's important that we all-- I know we've all seen it all, but it's important

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.180
that we take a second to appreciate what is happening here

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.760
we're at The Oscars, The Academy Awards. You're nominated! You got to come!

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.020
Your families are nominated, your friends-- some of you will get to come up here on this stage tonight

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.260
and give a speech that the President of the United States will tweet about

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.780
in all caps during his 5 am bowel movement tomorrow.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.060
And I think that's pretty darn excellent if you ask me. So let's get going

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.940
it's time for our first category of the night, Supporting Actors.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.500
It's what most actors parents are still doing: supporting actors.
