00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.310
MOST Insane Military Aircraft In The World

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.750
From fifth-generation fighter jets to experimental
space planes, today we look at the MOST Insane

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.040
Military Aircraft In The World.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:25.609
#9 Boeing EA-18G Growler
The most advanced modern method of airborne

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.610
electronic attack, the EA-18G Growler is a
source of military support in the field.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.940
This plane safeguards strike aircrafts thanks
to its ability to tactically jam and protect

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.400
electronics during hazardous missions.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.230
Thanks in part to powerful afterburners, the
maximum speed of the Growler is a whopping

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.880
1,190 miles per hour or Mach 1.8.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.440
The EA-18G typically isn’t weighed down
by heavy machinery as its normal payloads

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.030
consist of external fuel tanks, jamming pods,
and some missiles.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.550
A larger jet, the Growler has room for a single
pilot and a weapons system officer, despite

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.020
being equipped with minimal projectile weapons.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.020
Regardless of equipped self-defense capabilities,
though, pilots of this plane tend to be more

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.460
concerned with matters of disruption and radar-tampering.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.140
#8 Lockheed Martin X-59 QueSST
One of the latest projects of the United States

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.490
X-planes, a category assigned to experimental
planes under development for the U.S. government,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.950
the X-59 Quiet Supersonic Transport, or QueSST
for short, was devised to test the potential

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.100
for supersonic transport.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.999
Lockheed Martin won the design contract to
build this aircraft in 2016 with an extensive

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:54.100
time table for building, testing and reporting
the results of scale models beforehand.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.830
Earlier this year, NASA awarded them with
a $247.5 million contract to continue with

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.149
the project and go on to fully design, construct
and deliver the plane by 2021.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.459
The sharp-looking, needle-nosed aircraft is
meant to work as a low-boom flight demonstrator

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.760
as its expected to have a ground noise of
about 60 decibels.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.660
That’s only one one-thousandth the volume
of a current supersonic plane.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.349
The QueSST’s long, narrow frame plays a
large part in this process as it keeps the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.810
shock waves generated by the supersonic speeds
from coalescing.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.980
Though still in its early stages of development,
the quest to create a speedy yet silent aircraft

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.549
looks optimistic with the X-59!
#7 ESAero/Tecnam X-57 Maxwell

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.440
Revealed by a NASA administrator in June of
2016, the X-57 Maxwell was the first X-plane

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.930
project announced in nearly a decade.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.049
Part of an initiative to decrease reliance
on fossil fuels, improve performance and reduce

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:09.100
aircraft noise, the X-57 is a fully electric
aircraft with 14 electric motors along its

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.100
wings.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.709
Seating two, this relatively small aircraft
maximizes out at approximately 100 miles and

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.640
1 hour of flight time.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.390
However, thanks to its electric powered fuel
source, engineers believe they will be able

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.739
to cut down on energy use five times over.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.579
As with all X-planes, the development of the
X-57 Maxwell is not funded in hopes of mass

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.580
production but more simply for the ability
to experiment with specific technologies.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.810
Upon successful testing, the aerospace developments
made here could go on to be applied across

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.859
the United States military and used in ways
we haven’t even conceived yet.

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:57.260
#6 Mitsubishi X-2 Shinshin
At the turn of the twenty first century, the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.010
Japanese government turned to the United States
military in hopes of upgrading an aging air

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.480
force.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.290
They sought to purchase F-22 Raptors, the
top of the line stealth fighter jet at the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.150
time, but were rejected due to a restriction
on exporting the jet by the U.S. military.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.430
As a result, the Japanese were left to devise
their own stealth fighter.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.100
In 2006, researchers began by building a test
models of a fighter jet at about one fifth

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.040
the size of the final product and by 2007
Japan had decided charge head-first into the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.940
40-billion-yen project with full steam ahead.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.240
Construction of the first prototype began
in 2009 and was finally unveiled 7 years late

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.690
in 2016.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.120
Later that year, the X-2 Shinshin would take
its first test flight after a 10-year journey

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.800
to completion.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.060
One of the features of this new aircraft includes
a three-dimensional thrust vectoring option,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.979
allowing the pilot to manipulate the direction
of the vehicles thrust with excellent precision.

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.289
Another interesting design highlight is the
inclusion of a fly-by-optics flight control

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.289
system.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.099
This would let data transfer quicker and unhindered
by replacing wires with optical wires within

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.770
the X-2.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.380
Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the
X-2, though, the jet also features what its

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.810
engineers refer to as a “Self Repairing
Flight Control Capability.”

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.660
This is a process by which the jet will automatically
calibrate corrections to compensate for minor

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.090
damages or failures and keep the plane airborne.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.830
Despite all these features and the time put
into the project, Japan decided in 2018 to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.500
reach out to other countries to assist with
completing the project as development of Japan’s

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.080
own fighter jet continues.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.870
#5 Eurofighter Typhoon
Originally entering development in 1983, the

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.889
Eurofighter Typhoon was the project of conjoined
efforts in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy,

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.020
and Spain.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.410
France was originally involved in the project
as well, but left amidst disagreements and

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.660
ended up developing the famed Dassault Rafale
independently.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.990
Spanning two decades in development, the Future
European Fighter Aircraft programme endured

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.220
a slow, deliberate process to craft the agile
dogfighter that would be the Typhoon.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.120
In 1998, the first production contracts for
the fighter plane were signed and by 2003

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.830
the jet would enter operational service.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.650
As of 2016, the total number of Eurofighter
Typhoons procured by European and other nations

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.139
totaled 599, bolstering a large percentage
of air-defence duties for the customer countries.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:54.289
#4 The Piasecki X-49 Speedhawk
With its large, vectored thrust propeller

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:59.360
and lifting wings, this experimental helicopter
looks anything but standard.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.319
Another entry into the X-plane program, the
X-49 Speedhawk is a modified twin-engine,

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.530
four-blade compound helicopter.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:14.490
In hopes of creating a much faster helicopter,
the United States Navy invested $26.1 million

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.830
into this project by teaming with the Piasecki
Aircraft Corporation.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.389
Not necessarily meant to go into mass production
itself, the X-49 Speedhawk was developed to

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:30.360
test the ability to integrate higher speed
technology into pre-existing helicopters.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.389
With hopes of reaching 200 knots or more,
the X-49 project was underway but transferred

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.860
to the United States Army by 2004.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.360
Three years later, the Speedhawk would make
its first flight for only 15 minutes, but

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.259
this would be the first of many.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:53.699
Since its first flight in 2007, the X-49 has
launched 80 flights with a total of 80 flight

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.919
hours logged and it is currently considered
to be still in development.

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:05.949
#3 Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor
A quintessential fifth-generation fighter

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:11.930
jet, the F-22 is a twin-engine tactical stealth
aircraft design for a single pilot.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:17.379
This plane combines elements such as improved
aerodynamic performance, stealth capabilities,

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:21.460
and a streamlined design to assist with critical
decision-making.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.500
These features culminated in one of the best
multirole air superiority fighters ever due

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.720
to its groundbreaking combat capabilities.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.690
It even has a radar cross section less than
one ten-thousandth of a square meter, meaning

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:40.700
the F-22 appears smaller than a hummingbird
against radar detection.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.180
With a maximum speed of 1,500 miles per hour
and a climb rate of 62,000 feet per minute,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.529
the quick and quiet Raptor is as versatile
as it is stealthy thanks to its electronic

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:56.700
warfare, ground attack, and signal intelligence
options.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.860
Because of this the F-22 is partially responsible
for retiring a number of specialized planes.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.460
But top-of-the-line always comes at a price.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:13.380
One of the pillars of the modern U.S. Air
Force, 187 total operational F-22 Raptors

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.820
file the ranks.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.360
Though excellent in completion, the Air Force
ran into many hurdles during production.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.600
One major problem, among the various reasons
for the hold up, was the price.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.589
At $150 million per unit, the F-22 program
is estimated to have cost the U.S. Air Force

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:37.540
a total of $66.7 billion by the end of production
in 2011.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.350
The development of a successor, in addition
to the high price per unit, was also to blame

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.290
for phasing out of the F-22.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:53.680
#2 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II
Moving in to replace the F-22, the F-35 Lightning

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.440
II provides a lot of the same, if not more,
versatility as its predecessor.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.740
This single-engined plane resembles the Raptor,
but not quite as large and costly.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.870
Upgraded avionics, stealth, sensor, and flight
control technology make the Lightning II an

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.570
upgrade in almost every way.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:18.500
In addition, the F-35 features advanced touchscreen
and voice-recognition cockpit tools, as well

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:24.340
as a helmet-mounted display, making for a
more efficient and simplified time piloting.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.300
These complex flight systems contain more
than eight million lines of code, allowing

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.500
the jet to utilize network attack abilities,
data streaming, advanced communications and

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.390
radar jamming.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:42.120
Despite these advancements, the cost per unit
of the F-35 is $91 million dollars, less than

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.930
two-thirds the price per unit for the F-22!

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.700
That being said, there are still some areas
in which the F-22 still beats out the F-35.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.000
Though smaller in stature, the F-35 is not
as swift as the F-22 with a maximum speed

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.220
of Mach 1.6 versus the F-22’s Mach 2.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.510
The top takeoff weight for both vehicles is
also not in the Lightning II’s favor as

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.579
the F-22 can lift an additional thirteen and
a half thousand pounds.

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:15.360
And lastly, though equipped for aerial refueling,
the F-35 loses out to the F-22 Raptor in terms

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.440
of long distance travel capabilities, hitting
its limit 400 to 500 miles short of its big

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.680
brother.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.320
Despite these factors, however, the U.S. has
made the switch to the Lightning II.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.360
Delays and high costs have held up the F-35
program for more than a decade, but the jet

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.700
saw its first use in combat earlier this year
to much success.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:44.209
#1 Boeing X-37
More often referred to as the Orbital Test

00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:50.920
Vehicle, or OTV for short, the Boeing X-37
is a large aircraft designed to be launched

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.880
into space...and then reused after re-entering
Earth’s atmosphere and landing.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.360
The OTV has been used by the United States
Air Force since the project was transferred

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.399
from NASA to the Department of Defense in
2004 with a total of five launches.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:13.050
Sporting a design more reminiscent of a shuttle
than a plane, the X-37 is currently in orbit

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.720
around the Earth with a most recent launch
date in September of 2017!

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.010
Each launch, the aircraft has remained in
orbit for longer and longer periods of time

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:30.590
with its last trip lasting a total of 717
days and 20 hours!

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.399
The OTV is an uncrewed vehicle and the majority
of its operations are kept under wraps by

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:36.990
the U.S. government.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.779
The official word from the U.S. Air Force
is that the experimental plane is meant to

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:47.850
test and demonstrate “technologies for a
reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform,”

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.330
but specifics lack any further detail than
that.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:57.880
As a result, public speculation regarding
this $192 million project has run rampant

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.600
regarding the X-37 in recent years.
