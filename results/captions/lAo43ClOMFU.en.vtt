00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.470
15. Debra Kincy
Imagine giving an interview to reporters,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.580
having just taken the life of your next-door
neighbor.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.720
That’s what 63-year-old Debra Kincy did
after taking the life of her 64-year-old friend,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.090
Charlotte Nicholas.
Kincy called 911 and claimed she’d found

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.929
her friend passed away. But it was later discovered
that she’d taken her life with a screwdriver

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:47.140
and took all of Nicholas’ jewelry to sell
it off. She’d been to a nearby pawn shop

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.879
the same day of the event, wearing red-stained
clothes.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.180
In the TV interview, Kincy appears completely
distraught. But text messages between the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.670
pair tell another story.
Charlotte’s fiancé also confirmed that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.090
Nicholas had been having problems with her
neighbor.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.659
Kincy was taken into custody and charged for
her actions

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.830
She’ll have a hard time launching her acting
career from behind bars.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.130
14. Edward Wayne Edwards
Once appearing on not one, but two TV shows,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.450
Edward Wayne Edwards’ infamy came not from
his TV appearances, but from making the F

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.829
B I’s Ten Most Wanted list.
Edwards appeared on To Tell the Truth in 1972

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.890
and What's My Line?
It was before this To Tell the Truth appearance

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.770
that Edwards was being sought by the F B I.
They caught him. He was taken into custody

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.510
in Georgia in 1962. He’d been wanted for
escaping from custody in 1955 and holding

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:16.150
up gas stations for the cash. For some strange
reason, he was paroled only five years after

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.020
his capture in ’67, after which he went
on to take five separate lives.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.910
Sometimes, there’s no justice in the justice
system.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.330
13. Grant Robicheaux
This man is not a great look at the stars

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.100
of the TV show Online Dating Rituals of the
American Male.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.380
The show’s goal was to give women an inside
look about the way men think in the dating

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.090
game - especially online. The episode that
aired in 2014 starring Grant William Robicheaux

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.960
stated that the doctor was looking for love.
On paper, Robicheaux was perfect. A doctor,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.090
who once won the title of Orange County’s
“most eligible bachelor,” also sought

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.430
perfection in someone. He said on the show:
“With online dating, if a girl’s not perfect

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.480
to start with - boom…you’ve got to be
out. I’m not looking for a party girl; I’m

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.560
looking for a wife to raise a family with.”
But, as it would turn out, Robicheaux was

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.670
far from perfect. In fact he was a predator.
And he wasn’t looking for a wife so much

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.780
as he was looking for prey.
The 38-year-old wolf in sheep’s clothing,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.230
along with his 31-year-old girlfriend, Cerissa
Laura Riley, stand accused of doing horrible

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.590
things to unconscious women that they’d
regularly pick up at bars. After searching

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.260
Robicheaux’s phone, police detectives believe
they did this “hundreds” of times.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.320
These are some seriously sickening “online
dating rituals”. The pair may face up to

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.470
life in prison.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.960
12. Chris Watts
Another actor who was later discovered to

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.360
be the a very scary person was the recent
family annihilator, Chris Watts.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.570
Watts appeared in an interview with a local
news station when his wife and two young daughters

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.410
went missing.
In the interview, he claims Shanann Watts

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.120
returned from a business trip at around 2
AM and, when he left the house around 5:15

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.930
in the morning, she was still at home. But
when her friend came by the house around noon,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.530
she and her daughters had disappeared.
He appears not so much rattled about their

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.550
disappearance as nervous. He gives an unusually
flat performance. At times, he smiles and

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.610
laughs, crosses his arms. To put it simply,
he appears disingenuous.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.210
And as it would turn out, there was reason
for his off-putting performance. Not long

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.770
after, he confessed to having taken the lives
of his pregnant wife and their two daughters,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.350
3-year-old Celeste and 4-year-old Bella. He
led the police to their bodies.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.540
Chris later claimed that he only took Shannan's
life in a rage after seeing her take the life

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.730
of one of their daughters, while the other
lay lifeless, when he told her he wanted a

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.850
divorce. But he failed a lie detector test
on that one.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.920
On November 6th, 2018, Chris Watts pled guilty
to his actions, for which he received five

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:41.810
consecutive life sentences.
To many, this was not severe enough.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.590
11.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.430
A lifeless person is wrapped in a blue tarp
was recently found in Camp Town, Pennsylvania,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.710
and a local news reporter is digging for details.
She arranges for an interview with someone

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.221
named Matthew Haverly, a man who happens to
live across from the creek where the person

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:11.960
was found. He acts completely surprised about
the situation and disavows any knowledge of

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:21.940
what could have transpired.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.320
Hours later, police discover that the person
was, in fact, none other than Matthew’s

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.420
mother, which makes this last comment a terrible
coincidence. If Matthew was aware beforehand

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.400
that it was his mother floating in the creek,
he gives absolutely no indication at the time.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.560
He ends the short interview by saying how
the person was probably dumped in the creek

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:54.840
out of town by hitmen.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.930
Police investigators don’t buy this explanation
one bit. They raid his property and in his

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.870
shed they find the same blue tarp that his
mother’s body was wrapped in. As of this

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.250
date, he has been charged with a capital offense
but not yet convicted.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.880
If he is found guilty, then this means, out
of sheer coincidence, the reporter had unknowingly

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.760
scheduled an interview with the very same
man who had taken his mother’s life not

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.340
too long ago. She may very well have been
standing just a few feet away from a calm

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.320
and collected psycho without realizing it.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.160
10. Jonathan Schmitz

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:40.350
In 1995, The Jenny Jones Show featured two
men; one, Jonathan Schmitz, oblivious to what

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:47.410
was about to go down - and the other, Scott
Amedure, a man who had a crush on Schmitz.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.530
When Amedure’s crush was unveiled, Schmitz
seemingly took it in stride, saying he was

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.930
“completely hetero” Although likely a
disappointment to Scott, the incident should

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.890
have ended there. But it didn’t.
Only three days later, and Schmitz would come

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:11.440
face to face with Amedure again, this time
to take his life. Amedure had left a note

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.840
on his door and, in a rage, Schmitz took his
life, telling police it was because of the

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.050
humiliation he’d experienced on The Jenny
Jones Show.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.949
The case’s prosecutor, Richard Thompson,
highlighted the upset the show had caused

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:34.300
Schmitz, saying: “What you are seeing on
the tape is a 24-year-old man facing the studio

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.590
audience and the camera with what I consider
to be an ambush…It’s like a Roman circus

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:56.650
where the audience gives a thumbs up or thumbs
down to everything that is going on.”

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:02.089
The producers of Jenny Jones were found liable
and were forced to pay Amedure’s family

00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:07.510
$25 million.
Schmitz was, of course, found guilty and sentenced

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:14.180
to 25 to 50 years behind bars in 1999 after
a mistrial.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.550
9. Brian Hawkins
Imagine living 25 years with the darkest sin

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.710
never letting up on your conscience: taking
someone’s life.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.640
That’s what happened to Brian Hawkins, who
was involved in taking the life of 19-year-old

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.800
Frankie McAlister, in 1993. The senseless
event ended up in the infinite pile of cold

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.900
cases that haunt those family members who
live on. The case likely would have remained

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.350
unsolved had it not been for Hawkins’ live
on-air confession.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:52.850
Hawkins couldn’t take the guilt anymore,
so he entered a local TV station, KRCR, and

00:09:52.850 --> 00:10:00.750
told reporters what he’d done.
Hawkins said he would turn himself into the

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:06.020
police next door after his confession. But
before he did, he explained that there was

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:12.720
two accomplices - siblings, Curtis and Shanna
Culver. He said that life had been “absolute

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.290
horror” and “a nightmare” since the
event.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:22.200
Following the interview, he did as he said
he would: turned himself in to police investigators

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.260
at Shasta County Sheriff’s office. He was
charged for his actions, along with the Culver

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.149
siblings.
The interview was held from airing until after

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:37.850
Hawkins had turned himself in. He told police
that he’d also contacted McAlister’s family

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.770
to seek redemption, but the father had passed
away by the time he got up the courage to

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.350
go visit.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:50.360
8. Sefer Calinak
There are some game show contestants who are

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.730
psychos posing as normal people…and then
there are those who confess to doing horrible

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.170
things like it’s no big deal.
That’s what happened on this Turkish dating

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:07.890
show, Luck of the Draw, when 62-year-old Sefer
Calinak appeared as a contestant, describing

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:13.890
himself as, “an honest person looking for
a new wife.” Later on in the show, however,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:20.399
he suprised the audience and the TV host by
confessing to not one, but taking two lives.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:25.210
Well, he said he was honest.
He had taken the lives of his first wife and

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:30.040
his lover.
The motives? Calinak said he took the life

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.170
of his wife because of her irritating behavior,
and he took his lover’s life, because he

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:42.590
believed she was a gold digger. He’d been
married to his first wife, Fadime, at 17 and

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:48.700
became jealous of her alleged interest in
another man. He served only 4.5 years of his

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.220
13-year sentence.
Calinak said he’d served time for taking

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:57.990
his lover’s life too but had been let go
early under an amnesty program.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:04.170
Although the lack of justice in this one is
insane, one thing is clear: the female guest

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:09.200
on this episode of Luck of the Draw had no
luck at all.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.360
7. Bryan Romero Leiva
A show entitled The Value of Truth was sure

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.491
to get someone in trouble. When the reality
confession show premiered in Peru, the truth

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:29.200
would get its contestant, Ruth Sanchez, lifeless.
19-year-old Sanchez appeared on The Value

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:36.290
of Truth alongside her parents and her boyfriend,
Bryan Romero Leiva. The show involved intrusion

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:41.790
into the personal lives of contestants in
front of a live audience, as well as friends

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:47.560
and family. The questions were at first not
so difficult to answer, but they became more

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.600
and more humiliating as the prize money increased.
On the show, Sanchez confessed that she’d

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.770
accepted money for services twice at the nightclub
she worked at. Admittedly a surprising confession

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.910
to make to your parents and your partner,
it certainly wasn’t worthy of losing your

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:09.089
life.
But that’s how Romero dealt with his ex-girlfriend.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:14.850
Soon after her appearance on the reality show,
Sanchez disappeared. After being questioned

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:21.150
by police, Romero led them to her body, which
he’d hid in a well. She’d been lifeless

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.890
for sometime.
One of Sanchez’s friends told police that

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:30.870
Sanchez hadn’t even been dating Romero when
he appeared on the show with her - she paid

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.300
him for his time.
However, police believe Romero was after the

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:45.560
money Sanchez had won, which was 15,000 soles
($5700) - nearly 10 times the average monthly

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.250
salary in Peru.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:53.860
6. Rodney Alcala
Before Rodney Alcala was convicted of doing

00:13:53.860 --> 00:14:00.660
horrible things and taking lives in the 70s,
he was a game show contestant on the ABC favorite,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.029
The Dating Game.
Alcala appeared on the game show in 1978,

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:12.640
where he was introduced by host of the show,
Jim Lange, as a “successful photographer.”

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.390
Although his competition on the show, actor
Jed Mills, said that Alcala was strange and

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:23.250
with “bizarre opinions,” that didn’t
stop the man from beating out Mills and winning

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:30.160
a date with Cheryl Bradshaw. Bradshaw, however,
later refused to accept the date, as she found

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:39.610
Alcala “creepy.”
In reality, many were lured to Alcala’s

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:45.350
apartment under the guise that he was a professional
fashion photographer wanting to build his

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:51.649
portfolio. Some of these subjects ended up
getting their lives taken in his apartment.

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:56.750
Before he was accepted on the gameshow, he
had taken five lives, two in New York and

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:02.980
three in California. After the show, he committed
two more. And these are only the events he

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:08.170
was convicted of…there could have been many,
many more.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.980
5. Ralf Panitz
The Jerry Springer Show was known for wild

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:20.410
and dramatic antics. The headline for this
episode read, “Eleanor says her husband's

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:26.610
ex-wife, Nancy, won't take no for an answer.
Nancy has [shaken] them so severely that they

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:32.660
had to go into hiding. Today, Nancy will learn
that her ex-husband is actually married to

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.370
Eleanor!"
Nancy Campbell-Panitz appeared on the show

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:42.930
at the request of her ex-husband, Ralf. The
former couple had had a rocky relationship,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.060
and Nancy believed that he was coming back
to her for good this time.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.709
But the surprise must have torn into her when
she was labelled a jealous jilted stalker

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:58.380
and shamed by the audience. Ralf and Eleanor
then announced their marriage.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.340
When Springer told Nancy that Ralf didn’t
want to be with her, she replied that this

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.740
was fine and left the stage. The next time
she would appear on TV would be as a news

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.090
headline.
Nancy was found passed away on her kitchen

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:20.490
floor in Sarasota mere hours after the episode
screened. The prime suspects: Ralf and Eleanor.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.290
Eleanor was not charged, but Panitz was. He
pleaded innocent.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:32.390
Unfortunately, the evidence suggested otherwise.
His DNA was found under Nancy’s fingernail.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.690
He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to
life behind bars.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:43.670
4. Stephen Port
So many “master chef” and cooking shows,

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:49.829
I suppose it was only a matter of time before
one of those chefs would be accused of spiking

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:53.540
their food.
40-year-old Stephen Port appeared on the show

00:16:53.540 --> 00:17:00.960
Celebrity Masterchef. He was filmed helping
EastEnders star, Emma Barton, make meatballs,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.559
wearing chef’s clothes, a blonde toupee,
and smiling for the camera.

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:12.480
Unbeknownst to everyone on the show, Port
had a habit of taking lives. In 2016, he was

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.899
charged with taking the lives of four men
over the course of fifteen months. Port had

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:23.009
met these men on the dating app, Grindr.
In one of the cases, it appears as though

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:29.299
Port tried to frame one of the people whose
life he has taken for taking the life of another.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:34.880
In 21-year-old, Whitworth’s hand, a note
had been placed that read, “I can’t go

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:42.759
on anymore, I took the life of my friend Gabriel.”.
Port had taken Gabriel’s life before Whitworth’s.

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:47.649
Framing someone for taking a life? You’ll
see later on in this list that that’s not

00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:49.519
unusual.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:56.960
3. Louis William “Bill” Conradt, Jr
A show like Dateline’s To Catch a Predator

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.929
was bound to catch, well, predators. But one
surprise catch was Louis William "Bill" Conradt

00:18:03.929 --> 00:18:11.580
Jr., Texas’ former assistant district attorney.
Posing as 13-year-old Luke, the team was chatting

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.639
with the assistant district attorney, who
was also posing as someone much younger: a

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:23.309
19-year-old university student. After the
team and Dateline got Conradt on the phone

00:18:23.309 --> 00:18:30.179
with an actor, Conradt suddenly stopped responding
to calls and messages, and content began disappearing

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:51.210
from Conradt’s fake MySpace page. It was
time for police to step in.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:58.539
A search warrant was sought, a SWAT team was
called in, and a tactical entry was performed.

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:03.451
Conradt was found in a hallway, where he said,
“I’m not going to hurt anyone,” before

00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:08.179
taking his own life.
Dateline found itself in hot water after the

00:19:08.179 --> 00:19:15.160
incident. Afterwards, raw footage contradicted
statements made by Dateline, in which they’d

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.730
denied collusion with law enforcement.
Do you think To Catch a Predator was in the

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:22.730
wrong?

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:27.580
2. Ryan Jenkins
Jasmine Fiore was a model whose body was found

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:36.529
stuffed into a suitcase on August 15, 2009.
The only suspect? Former reality TV contestant

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:43.860
and Fiore’s husband, 32-year-old Ryan Alexander
Jenkins. After making a run for it, he was

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.470
found a little over a week later, passed away
in his hotel room in Hope, British Columbia,

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.350
Canada.
What went down?

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.960
Jenkins had just finished filming Megan Wants
a Millionaire. He met Fiore at a Las Vegas

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:04.149
casino and two days after they met, they married
at The Little White Wedding Chapel.

00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:10.341
But it was an unhappy marriage. Jenkins reported
Fiore missing, probably thinking he’d get

00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:16.940
away with his actions. But his suspicious
activity thereafter - i.e. fleeing to Canada

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:22.729
- revealed that he may not be as innocent
as he claimed. Although he did manage to elude

00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:28.000
authorities who were on the lookout for him
at the Canada–US border, he later took his

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.639
life at the hotel.

00:20:30.639 --> 00:20:35.940

1. John Cooper
When retired chief superintendent, Steve Wilkins,

00:21:06.649 --> 00:21:13.690
tracked down an old gameshow episode of Bullseye,
he knew he had the final piece of the puzzle:

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.809
John Cooper was the man he’d been looking
for all along.

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:22.799
The man had been a suspect of four passing
since the ‘90s - those of Richard and Helen

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:28.049
Thomas and Peter and Gwenda Dixon.
The footage, which was tracked down by Wilkins

00:21:28.049 --> 00:21:33.450
and ITV presenter Jonathan Hill, resulted
in the man’s conviction.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:40.190
The episode from 1989 was discovered in a
library in Leeds in 2009. The episode was

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.669
filmed just one month before the Dixons were
found passed away on a coastal path while

00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:50.779
on holiday.
And only four years earlier, in 1985, millionaire

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:55.269
farmer, Richard, and his sister, Helen, were
found passed away at their manor.

00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:59.749
When Steve Wilkins watched the clip, he was
amazed. In his own words:

00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:06.249
“It was Cooper, bold as brass, smiling and
joking on national television having almost

00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:12.049
certainly [taken two lives].”
In the video clip, Cooper also expressed knowledge

00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:17.309
about the area where the Dixons were found
when being interviewed by the gameshow host.

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:22.489
And when Cooper lost the game, forget it.
Wilkins said: “He looked to the camera with

00:22:22.489 --> 00:22:27.919
a stare that said it all.”
A very scary disturbing man accidentally shown

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:41.609
on live tv.
