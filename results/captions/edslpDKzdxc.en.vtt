00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:11.663
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WELL, OCASIO-CORTEZ

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:12.430
NOT WORRIED ABOUT LOSING JOBS

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.167
BECAUSE MORE JOBS WILL BE MADE

00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:17.469
BY THE GREEN YOU DEAL

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:21.072
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:22.407
ON.

00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:23.942
YOU ARE ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF

00:00:23.943 --> 00:00:24.642
ONE OF THE MOST ENVIRONMENTAL

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:25.910
DON'T MAKE THEM AS ENVIRONMENT

00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:26.878
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD AND

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.584
YOU THINK THE GREEN NEW DEAL

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:33.084
SOUNDS TERRIFYING.

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:33.518
TELL US WHY?

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:34.319
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WOULD BE BASICALLY

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.053
THE END OF CIVILIZATION IF 85%

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:39.724
OF THE WORLD AND ALSO 85% OF THE

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:41.259
U.S.'S ENERGY IS IN THE FORM OF

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.995
COAL, OIL, NATURAL GAS WERE

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:46.398
PHASED OUT OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.265
YEARS.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:47.899
LIKE TEN YEARS.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.300
WE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO

00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:50.535
REPLACE THEM WITH.

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:53.038
YES, IF WE WENT INTO A CRASH

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.406
COURSE OF BUILDING NUCLEAR

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:56.107
REACTORS, WE COULD REPLACE THEM

00:00:56.108 --> 00:00:56.775
FOR PRODUCING ELECTRICITY.

00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:58.877
BUT THAT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:00.613
BECAUSE THE GREENS ARE AGAINST

00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:03.082
NUCLEAR AND THEY ARE EVEN

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:07.753
AGAINST HYDROELECTRIC DAMS WHICH

00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:08.387
AT LEAST IS RENEWABLE.

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:09.121
BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT THAT

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:09.455
EITHER.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:11.957
SO BASICALLY THEY ARE OPPOSED TO

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.125
APPROXIMATELY 98.5% OF ALL THE

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:15.494
ELECTRICITY THAT WE ARE USING

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:18.230
AND NEARLY 100% OF ALL OF THE

00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:20.165
VEHICLE AND TRANSPORTATION AND

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.835
SHIPS AND PLANES THAT WE ARE

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:23.168
USING.

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:28.140
SO I JUST -- WHEN I TWEETED THE

00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.774
OTHER DAY AND HAD A HUGE

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:29.375
RESPONSE, OVER 3 MILLION

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:30.376
IMPRESSIONS ON TWITTER, WHEN I

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:33.679
SAID YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.947
FEED 8 BILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT

00:01:34.948 --> 00:01:35.381
FOSSIL FUELS.

00:01:35.382 --> 00:01:43.289
OR GET THE FOOD INTO THE CITIES

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.056
WHERE IT'S NEEDED FOR THAT NEEDS

00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:44.823
COMIC REQUIRES LARGE TRUCKS PER

00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:45.591
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ELECTRIC

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:47.159
TRUCKS ANYTIME SOON HAULING

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.760
40 TONS OF FOODS IN THE

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:49.662
SUPERMARKETS WHERE PEOPLE IN THE

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:50.963
CITY PROBABLY THINKS IT

00:01:50.964 --> 00:01:51.697
ORIGINATES IN THE SUPERMARKET,

00:01:51.698 --> 00:01:53.132
BUT IT DOES NOT.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.633
IT'S COMING FROM FARMS OUT IN

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:56.735
THE COUNTRY WHERE A FEW MILLION

00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:58.604
PEOPLE ARE GROWING THE FOOD FOR

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.873
ALL THE REST OF THE POPULATION.

00:02:00.874 --> 00:02:04.476
AND IF WE BAN FOSSIL FUELS,

00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:05.511
FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION

00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:07.546
WOULD COLLAPSE IN A VERY SHORT

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.080
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.582
THERE ARE THESE THINGS CALLED

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.017
TRACTORS AND THEY USE FUEL.

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:13.786
AND ALL THE OTHER IMPLEMENTS ON

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:18.424
THE FARM.

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:18.991
AND THEN THERE IS THE

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:19.458
TRANSPORTATION.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.259
SO WHEN YOU HAVE NO FUEL, HOW DO

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.027
YOU GET THE FOOD TO THE CENTER

00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:23.562
OF NEW YORK, TO MANHATTAN, WHERE

00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:24.363
AOC IS FROM?

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:24.764
YOU DON'T.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:27.600
THEN THE PEOPLE THERE WILL BEGIN

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:28.734
TO STARVE.

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:30.636
AND THAT WILL SPREAD OUT AS A

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:33.706
ROCK FROM THE CENTER OF THE

00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.207
METROPOLISES ALL ACROSS THE

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:36.742
COUNTRY AND HALF THE POPULATION

00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:37.943
WILL DIE IN A VERY SHORT

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:39.245
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:41.113
AS I ALSO POINTED OUT, THERE

00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:42.782
WOULDN'T BE A TREE LEFT ON THIS

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:43.616
PLANET.

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.518
SAY THIS WAS A WORLDWIDE THING.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.886
THE UNITED STATES ISN'T GOING TO

00:02:46.887 --> 00:02:48.487
BAN FOSSIL FUELS IF NO ONE ELSE

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:48.788
DOES.

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:54.060
BUT SAY THE PARIS AGREEMENT CAME

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:54.827
INTO EFFECT FULLY ALL AROUND THE

00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:55.628
WORLD AND EVERYBODY BAN FOSSIL

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.962
FUELS.

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:57.697
THERE WOULDN'T BE A TREE LEFT ON

00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.298
THIS PLANET BECAUSE THAT WOULD

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.835
BE ALL THERE WAS FOR FUEL FOR

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:04.003
HEATING AND COOKING AS THEY DID

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.038
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THERE WAS

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.240
HARDLY ANYBODY ON THE PLANET

00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.775
COMPARED TO WHAT THERE IS TODAY.

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:12.712
SO JUST THAT ONE POINT -- NEVER

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:13.780
MIND THE INSANITY OF BANDING

00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:18.618
AIRCRAFT AND FOSSIL FUELS USING

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:19.652
VEHICLES.

00:03:19.653 --> 00:03:20.753
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YOU JUST COMPLETELY

00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:22.322
BLEW MY MIND.
