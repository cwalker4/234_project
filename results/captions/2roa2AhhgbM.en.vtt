Hey, I need you to cover
for me at Pines Road.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.970
Hey, you know how Jasper
went missing today?

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.575
Yeah, some guy found him.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.700
I bet it took a lot of time
loops to find that dog.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.045
Eh, not really.

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.850
I took him from his
backyard this morning.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.650
OK, we're on foot form here.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.220
Keys back.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.130
All right, you ready
to save the world?

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.160
You want to time travel
back, try that again?

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.150
No.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:42.650
Let's go.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.650
Come on.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.620
Pick it up.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.120
Pick it up.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.720
We're here.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.320
This is it.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.420
Hey, sorry about this.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.320
No fires today.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.410
Y'all shouldn't be out
here by yourselves anyway.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:01.910
Sorry.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.730
You could have some
weirdo come up to you.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.380
Well you don't have
to run-- whatever.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:06.880
We did it.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.379
We did it.

00:09:10.036 --> 00:09:10.910
I'm glad you're here.

00:09:15.074 --> 00:09:16.490
You know, this
isn't really a fire

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.140
that would have gotten
out of control, though.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.110
There's a good perimeter
and there's a lot of--

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.300
[PAGER BEEPING]

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.800
What's that?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.041
It's my emergency pager.

00:09:25.954 --> 00:09:27.370
Five alarm fire
broke out downtown

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.453
six blocks from the diner.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.300
Why did you bring me out here?

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.110
When you stay downtown, you die.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.666
We tried to stop the
fire hundreds of times.

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:46.165
We stop the electrical
fire and then

00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:47.650
an oven fire breaks
out in the kitchen.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.750
We stop the kitchen fire
and then three teenagers

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.450
forget to put a
cigarette out next door.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.160
The fire always
happens, you always die.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.297
I always live.

00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:58.130
Even when you manage
to rescue a few people,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.046
you never make it out.

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:02.840
So I started looking for
another exit to the maze

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.070
away from the fire.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.960
I spent days searching
for locations.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.570
I calibrated what would be the
shortest safe distance away.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.650
And then it hit
me, here it's where

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.050
we used to go camping with dad.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.522
Firemen don't run from fires.

00:10:13.522 --> 00:10:15.980
Something always happened that
brought you back to the fire

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.690
or killed you on
your way out of town.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.670
This time, I saved
you this time.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.920
I don't need you
to save me, Shane.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.414
Why do you even care?

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.330
You've talked to me like
twice since dad died.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.845
Yeah, but look, if I
could create a time

00:10:26.845 --> 00:10:28.053
loop that goes back to when--

00:10:28.053 --> 00:10:29.880
I don't care about
time loops, Shane.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.772
If you don't care,
why did you come?

00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:39.730
Because I wanted to spend
time with my brother.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.286
Give me the keys, Shane.

00:10:45.286 --> 00:10:46.190
No, I can't do that.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.330
Give me the keys, Shane.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.265
People are dying.

00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:50.890
No, no, no, no.

00:10:56.812 --> 00:10:57.312
Matt?

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:33.840
You can't escape the maze.

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:38.441
How's it going.

00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:40.940
Uh, I work at the fire station,
fire station three downtown.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.260
If you're a firefighter,
you need your asses

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.290
back out to town, man.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.250
There's a fire out
there, not back here.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.980
I found your dog.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.410
I'm gonna put on some music.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.847
The fire downtown has
spread to a second building.

00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:54.680
Firefighters are just
arriving at the scene.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.790
We got to go back.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.474
No, radio.

00:11:57.474 --> 00:11:58.950
Whoa, whoa, no, no!

00:12:02.144 --> 00:12:04.450

at the station like now.

be in space or building
