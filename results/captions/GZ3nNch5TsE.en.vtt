00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.820
Welcome to the DietDoctor podcast
with Dr. Bret Scher.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.419
Today I'm joined by Peter Ballerstedt.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.060
Peter is a very unique individual because
he's a foot in two completely different worlds.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.899
On the one hand he has a degree
in forage agronomy and ruminant feeding

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.980
from the University of Kentucky.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.859
On the other hand he has had
this personal journey with health

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.660
that's brought him
to the low-carb ketogenic world

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.579
and he's helping bridge the gap between
what you can call the grass people,

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.140
the ranchers, the farmers
and the health side of things.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.979
And in conferences like Low-Carb Houston
where we are now,

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.820
he helps provide
that additional perspective.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.219
So that's why I enjoy having him
on the show today

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.100
to talk about this other aspect
of what we're doing

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.659
as we're trying to change how we eat,
to change our nutrition,

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.979
we also have to think
about the environmental impact,

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.979
the impact on animals
and the whole other world.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.020
And interestingly maybe it's not
as simple as we like to think.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.819
Just as I would say we should never make
your healthcare simple or your health simple.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.780
Peter has the same approach;

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.780
we shouldn't make farming and ranching
and raising ruminants as simple as it is.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.620
I am a big fan of grass fed, grass finished,
I think it's important, I think it's healthier.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.659
Peter has a different opinion.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.459
So it's very interesting
to get that type of opinion

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:28.260
and kind of stew with it a little bit and
see how it sits with us and if it makes sense.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.540
There are some other things that may be
different from what you've heard

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.219
and that's what I really appreciate
about his message.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.420
So I hope you enjoy this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.780
and you can incorporate what he says
into your thinking process.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.260
Maybe we're not thinking about things as
being so black and white but as more nuanced.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.412
So enjoy this interview
with Peter Ballerstedt.

00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:54.620
Peter Ballerstedt thank you so much
for joining me on the DietDoctor podcast today.

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:56.852
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.900
So here we are at a low-carb conference
as frequently happens across the country

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.340
and at these conferences there is plenty
of scientists and engineers and physicians.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699
You seem to stand out a little bit
from the crowd

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.174
and not just because you wear a tie with
cows on it when you give your presentation

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:18.780
but you represent the agriculture side and
the farming side and the ranchers site

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.060
and it's a very unique perspective.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.780
And you have your degree both
in forage agronomy and ruminant feeding

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.259
and I think that's fascinating
because it gives you such a perspective

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.369
from the animal side
and the agriculture and plant side.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.020
I am curious how you find that you fit
into this low-carb community

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.819
and what you see is your role
on the low-carb message?

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.340
Primarily my role as I see it
is to build bridges

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.219
between the producers
and the consumers.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.819
Unfortunately we have just far too big a gap
between those two.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.460
And the same issues that you could see
in the general population

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.419
in terms of chronic illness etc.
you see in the farming community.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.500
So I want my agricultural tribe

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.379
to be introduced to what I'm convinced
is a life-saving message

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.621
that I get to hear from all these amazing
researchers and clinicians.

00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:23.979
On the other side we have access to the food
that we're arguing we should eat

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.979
at a lower cost
than anywhere else in the world

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:32.699
and in greater abundance,
greater availability

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:38.500
and unfortunately we really don't understand
what it takes to have that happen.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.259
And so that creates a lot of space

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.659
for some misunderstanding
and miscommunication to come in.

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.020
So likewise I'd like my low-carb tribe
to be introduced to my agricultural tribe

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.819
because they do amazing things.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.780
And I think that we'll actually make
more progress

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.580
in getting the low carbohydrate message
out to more people

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.572
if we can get the kind of bridge building;
so that's my primary hope.

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.500
It's great a perspective on that.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.860
And we do like to put people
in organizations, in buckets, don't we?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.100
And good and bad
and as not so black and white

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.260
and I think is important to have someone
like you to help bridge those gaps.

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:22.746
Thank you.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:26.019
Now you came to this
from a personal experience as well.

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.100
In your speech you are very open

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.899
about saying you were
a 50-year-old obese balding diabetic

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:34.494
and now you're just balding... I was hoping
you found a cure for that one too.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.295
No, sorry brother.

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:37.757
Keep working.

00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:41.860
But you reversed all this personally
through a low-carb diet

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.860
brought on by-- like your wife
and Gary Taubes.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
Gary's book and then
with your wife's influence.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.059
That must've been a very formative
experience for you.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.303
Absolutely and to be completely honest

00:04:55.304 --> 00:05:00.300
Nancy started on this journey in 2002

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.620
and it took me five years to join.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.220
And then of course Gary Taube's great book
&lt;i&gt;Good Calories, Bad Calories&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.420
came out the year after.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.615
So she was wise enough--
she still is wise,

00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:17.100
but she was wise enough to realize
that talking to me

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.220
before I was ready to listen to her
talk to me about it wouldn't be helpful.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.500
That's not her way.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.339
So her approach was, "This is what I'll eat.
What would you like to eat?"

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:35.939
And I don't know, I'm sorry, I don't know
when you came into this realm,

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:40.939
but in 2002...
there were many fewer resources,

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:47.259
and we started doing the best we could
and of course all that's evolved over time.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:53.139
In 2007 I finally got serious
and began my own journey in earnest.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:00.090
And as I read Gary Taubes and Michael
and Mary Dan Eades and so many others,

00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:01.980
I got angry...

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.131
I got angry at what had been done
to the American public

00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:10.019
in the guise of science.

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:13.579
I got angry at what has been done

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:17.483
to the industries
that I've been trained to serve

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:23.899
in the name of better health
and protecting the environment.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:31.060
When I know now manifestly
those are both incorrect.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.060
And so with that anger finally...
okay, we get over that

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.540
and then we start trying to introduce
my friends to some of these books.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.459
And I remember one colleague saying,

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:45.883
"I couldn't get a paper published
in the agronomy Journal

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:50.660
doing what they did to get papers published
in the medical journals."

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.568
And I've had other--

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.527
Meaning the quality of science is
so different, so much lower,

00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:59.740
so that the standards
in the Agronomy Journal would say,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.459
"We cannot accept this the science
because this is not proper science.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:06.100
Whereas for the nutrition science,
that's the way it works."

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:12.484
Yeah, and to be fair to human nutrition

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:15.579
they don't have the tools available to them

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:20.899
that animal nutrition, or plant nutrition,
or soil fertility has.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:28.100
We can get very controlled environments,
if you will, to do our studies

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.779
certainly in soils much more so.

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:34.980
Plants, well you could grow them
in the greenhouse,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.980
but yet at some point you want to go out
to the field and mother nature still rules,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.740
but there's some things you can do there.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:49.768
To make for example the site that you plant
one variety from one lot of seeds

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:53.740
on a ground that's as uniform as possible
with your statistical design.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.819
So at the end you have a fair idea.

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:05.620
Animals, again, there are issues of ethics
in how you treat experimental animals

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.899
and that's a good thing...

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:10.939
You get to humans
and as I said at one meeting

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:15.420
it's very difficult to find large groups
of genetically similar human beings

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.939
that you can completely control
for long periods of time

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:25.180
where you absolutely measure what goes in
what comes out, their activity.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.459
And then Adele Hite spoke out
from the audience and said,

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:32.899
"And sacrifice them at the end of the study
to determine body composition."

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:35.080
It's hard to find volunteers
for that kind of work.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.241
Yeah.

00:08:36.353 --> 00:08:38.620
So there are natural limitations

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.019
and are completely understandable
and it's a good thing.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:46.259
The bad thing is when frankly
the human nutritionists act

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:53.259
as if they are rigorous in their studies
as my animal nutrition colleagues.

00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:56.419
That's a great point,
a great perspective to bring in.

00:08:56.419 --> 00:09:00.100
Having a foot in both worlds and
understanding the difference in science.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.580
So from a scientific discussion
to a very nonscientific discussion,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.057
you are what you eat becomes
you are what you eat eats...

00:09:09.058 --> 00:09:14.419
Well actually it's you are what you eat does
to metabolize what it eats...

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:16.820
It gets a little complicated.

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:19.580
Right, and it's fundamentally flawed,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.019
because I think it was Jeff Volek,
but I've certainly adopted it,

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:27.379
"You're not what you eat, you are
what your body does with what you eat."

00:09:27.556 --> 00:09:29.218
Right.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.860
And so I have a slide
of cows eating hay.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.860
Well, the hay is in no way
like what the cow is.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.139
And it's in some
very interesting differences;

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:47.340
one is high-fiber, the other isn't,
one is low-fat, the other is high-fat,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.620
one is low-protein content
and poor protein quality

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.500
and of course the other isn't.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.460
And so in the case of ruminants you have
this wonderful structure and capability

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.460
to convert this resource
that we can't utilize directly

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.059
into something that we can.

00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:11.980
And it's interesting to me
that this whole "you are what you eat"

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:19.340
never says, well yeah, we're animal tissue
so maybe we should be eating animal tissue.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.740
The argument never goes there.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.460
But no, I think it's very important for us

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.139
to realize that different mammals
have different means

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:32.860
of converting the resources
from their environment

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.244
into the nutrients that they need
and then absorbing those nutrients.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.048
You brought up the difference
in proteins, animal proteins.

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:47.620
Basically an animal eating a poor protein
source of grass, cellulose, converting it,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.019
but yet we hear over and over again
from the vegan community

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:55.700
that you get all the proteins you need,
readily absorbable and bioavailable

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.460
and we see examples of pro athletes
who are vegan

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.539
who are clearly excelling on a physical level,
so clearly getting enough protein.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:07.860
So it seems like two messages,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.820
because on the one hand animal proteins,
more bioavailable, as complete protein,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.220
vegan proteins are not,
but yet some people still thrive.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.391
So how do we make sense
of that difference?

00:11:18.513 --> 00:11:22.860
There are individual differences
amongst the population.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.460
Forgive me but one of the lines
that I heard from an old professor

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.899
was that the average human being
has one breast and one testicle,

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:34.419
but you don't see
many of them rolling around.

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:40.538
So I'm not interested in telling anyone
what they need to eat or should eat,

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:48.326
but it's true that there's only a few plant
source foods that have complete protein,

00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:52.019
that have all the amino acids that we need.

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.460
And then the question is,
"Are they there in the right ratios?

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:01.379
And it's remarkable to me that we still have
large gaps in our knowledge

00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:06.139
about human requirements for protein.

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:08.779
That being said,

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:12.862
the simple fact is that
animal source protein

00:12:12.863 --> 00:12:16.379
is of much higher value
than plant source protein

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:21.580
in part because of that biological value,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:29.379
but also because typically protein is
assessed biometric called crude protein.

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:35.979
And this involves determining
the percent nitrogen in any foodstuff

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.700
multiplying that number by 6.25.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:48.100
The assumption is that all the nitrogen
that was there was in protein

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.179
and all of that protein was 16% nitrogen.

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:56.059
Now you can get away with that
with some foodstuffs

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:59.779
and when you're feeding some animals.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:06.899
So if I'm feeding ruminants,
it really isn't all that important

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:12.220
whether the nitrogen that's in the feed
that they're getting

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.740
is in protein or nonprotein nitrogen,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.820
because the rumen environment
will take all of that, degrade it down

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.580
and build it back up into microbial protein.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.179
So the important thing there is whether
that nitrogen containing material

00:13:28.179 --> 00:13:30.740
is degradable in the rumen.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.700
Humans can't use nonprotein nitrogen.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.779
So there's no such thing as an essential
amino acid in a ruminant's diet,

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:41.379
there is in humans diet.

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:44.539
And so you can look at crude protein

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:47.860
in equivalent amounts of cooked
navy beans for example

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.620
and cooked beef muscle.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.100
And actually I believe it's like
a 10th of a percent more in the beans

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.059
than there is in the beef,
but that's not true protein.

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:04.899
So if you then look at the amino acid
content in those two amounts

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:11.179
what you end up with is something like 58%
of the crude protein

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:17.820
is actually true protein in the beans
where it's 92% in the beef.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.620
And then in addition to that
you've got various peptides

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:27.059
that are present in the beef that are also
of use in human nutrition.

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:31.860
And now we get into the bit that we're,
you know, kind of now discovering.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.019
So those are two primary differences

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:39.031
and unless we account for that
we can be misled by the numbers.

00:14:39.153 --> 00:14:41.659
That's a great point because
when you see these graphs

00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:44.299
that are postured on social media

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:46.940
comparing animal
and plant sources approach

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.620
and they are frequently only talking about
crude protein but not specifying that,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.776
which always makes me wonder,
"Do they know and they're being deceitful?

00:14:53.777 --> 00:14:56.138
Or they just don't know
or they just don't understand?"

00:14:56.139 --> 00:15:00.497
I like to think it's the latter and they need to
understand the explanation that you're giving.

00:15:00.593 --> 00:15:05.940
I think it's always best to assume
that people may be sincerely wrong.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.340
They actually believe what they're saying

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.740
just as many human nutritionists
have been taught certain things...

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.700
Ough, there I say it, physicians...

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.860
in their extensive human nutrition training
have been taught certain things...

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.899
and they were taught by their teachers.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:27.779
And these are people-- Gary Fettke talks
about generational learning,

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:33.659
you know, the people that we respect,
part of our academic lineage

00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:39.119
and it's natural for
that kind of information

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.620
to be difficult to overturn.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:49.860
I do think that there's a number of people
who do know and yet maintain.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:55.716
But I think it's always best to operate
from the position of being gracious.

00:15:55.876 --> 00:15:59.700
And that's where the difference
of science and religion of nutrition comes in

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.379
and then we don't need
to go down there right now

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.659
but one thing I do want to address with you

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:07.220
where I was surprised the first time
I heard you speak,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.820
because I am a proponent
of grass fed, grass finished,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.860
it's what I've learned
is healthier and better

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.580
and when I first heard your talk, I was like,
"Of course, he's going to agree with that."

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.620
And I was surprised that you took
a little different stands

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.899
that maybe grass fed, grass finished
isn't as important as it's made out to be.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:28.419
Now from my standpoint the research
shows it has higher Omega-3s, higher CLAs,

00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:31.179
Conjugated Linoleic Acid,

00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:36.820
higher vitamin A, higher vitamin B
and just seems better, feels better,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.980
the pictures are better,
so of course it must be better.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.019
And you say, hold on a second,
let's put this into perspective.

00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:45.860
So talk to me a little bit about that.

00:16:46.002 --> 00:16:52.860
So just my personal perspective when
I came into this realm of human nutrition

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.539
I had been out of agriculture
for several years.

00:16:56.539 --> 00:17:01.100
Of course all my training is
in pasture-based livestock systems

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.539
and grazing management
and all of that kind of thing,

00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:07.500
so I started seeing things about grass fed

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.980
and I was like that tripped
all of my confirmation bias triggers

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.696
and of course it's got to be pastured,

00:17:13.697 --> 00:17:17.940
and then I went and started looking
at the articles the people were referencing

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.220
to support the arguments

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.808
and I became
less and less convinced over time.

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:28.451
My position at this point

00:17:28.452 --> 00:17:32.538
is that hyperinsulinemia
is the short stave in the barrel.

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:39.420
And it's such a profound effect...
I'm convinced.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.859
The strength of that signal is so large

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:49.460
that until we've adequately accounted
for that in our studies,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:57.299
we can't be certain about any other effect
that undoubtedly is going to be there.

00:17:57.299 --> 00:18:02.259
But if we nibble at those effects
before we've dealt with the biggest one,

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:04.279
we're not likely to see it.

00:18:04.396 --> 00:18:07.380
So is that sort of saying,
"Perfect is the enemy of good"?

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.220
If we're only going to have
grass fed, grass finished

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.246
and at the expense
of not being able to get that,

00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:19.019
we're going to shun the CAFOs,
grain feds

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:22.259
and as a result not help ourselves
by changing our diet,

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:24.180
then we're not doing ourselves any favors.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.860
Is that the summary, or--?

00:18:25.956 --> 00:18:28.740
Yeah, let me put it this way.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.059
It strikes me that we've got
into the mess that we're in

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:35.220
by people speculating
about incomplete data.

00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:37.420
Okay.

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:41.539
And I doubt that we can make progress
if we do exactly the same thing,

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:45.059
though of course we'd be right
when we do it.

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:48.579
Not like those people
who were wrong and ignorant

00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:51.858
and, you know, in the employ
of special interests.

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:56.019
Again this is sort of like
basic human group behavior.

00:18:56.019 --> 00:18:59.059
So when I start seeing things like that,

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:02.740
I start saying, "Let me come back
and look at this again."

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.380
And so we can deconstruct the stories
that are told

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.099
about why one would be better
than the other.

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:18.220
And then we get to the point
where I also start saying

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.180
if this makes this product more expensive

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:29.619
then how do we justify that when we have
a population that is economically challenged

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:32.619
and we know that the burden
of chronic illness

00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:36.339
falls heaviest on those populations?

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:42.887
Also how do we leverage and expand this
not just in the United States but worldwide?

00:19:42.888 --> 00:19:46.740
Because we see
the same problem worldwide.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:53.208
So I think we need to be very circumspect
in terms of some of these now

00:19:53.209 --> 00:19:57.940
and we can deal with each one,
and I'd like to do that.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.980
but I'll give you an example of how
this ripples out and it fascinates me.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:08.729
There are long chain Omega-3 fatty acids.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.420
We got started on this road,

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.380
because somebody came across what I call
the Greenland paradox

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.579
to follow with the Mediterranean
and the French and...

00:20:18.579 --> 00:20:22.779
so one more time we find
yet another population

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:27.246
that despite eating a diet high in fat
has very little heart disease.

00:20:27.247 --> 00:20:32.723
And that quote is almost word for word
out of the start of the first fish oil study.

00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:36.980
Okay, how many paradoxes does it take
before is no longer a paradox?

00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:42.619
Exactly, so their thought was
it must be the fish oil.

00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:48.900
Now not coincidentally or coincidentally
it launched a billion-dollar fish oil industry

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.980
where one had not been before.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:59.766
Now fish have EPA and DHA
as their long chain Omega-3 fatty acids

00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:05.940
and that became the foundation of labeling
and suggestions and everything else.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.859
It turns out, ironically enough,

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:16.579
that fish wasn't the largest source of fat
in their diet.

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:21.420
The largest source of fat in their diet
was coming from marine mammals.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:27.619
And mammals, including cows, contain
three long chain Omega-3 fatty acids,

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.579
there is a DPA.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:34.940
And again because we got down this track
we didn't look at all three,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.740
took us a while to find a source of it.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.660
Now there's some work
suggesting it's important too.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.804
So one, that's a cautionary tale.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:50.980
Two, maybe all of those coming from
ruminants

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.980
regardless of how they are finished

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.940
would be sufficient in a population

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:03.779
that wasn't being abused by high levels
of refined carbohydrates and industrial oils.

00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:06.059
Very good point.

00:22:06.276 --> 00:22:08.420
And we don't know.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.700
I think Amber O'Hearn says that everything
we think we know about nutrition

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.448
comes to us through this filter
of carbohydrate-based diets.

00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:26.059
And then I am still impressed
by how many people for example think

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:33.980
that a beef animal spends its entire life
in a cage, eating corn, nothing else.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:40.406
And so the words imply things to people,
images imply things to people

00:22:40.407 --> 00:22:46.231
and I just want us to make sure that
we understand what's actually going on.

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:48.819
And I think the image part
is very important,

00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:51.619
because especially documentaries
like &lt;i&gt;What the Health&lt;/i&gt;,

00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:56.539
which was very well
done as a vegan propaganda piece,

00:22:56.539 --> 00:22:59.980
not as a true documentary
representing science,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.259
but one of the things that stands out
the most are the images of the CAFOs,

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:10.900
the Confined Animal Feeding Operations,
the grain fed, the cages, the crowds of cows.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.900
So that's the image
people have in their heads.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.140
So are you here to say that that's not
the true image of what a grain fed cow is?

00:23:19.353 --> 00:23:22.299
Yes, that's what I'm here...

00:23:22.299 --> 00:23:26.859
I am here to assure people they can go
to the supermarket, certainly in the US,

00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:30.161
and I understand you have
an international footprint,

00:23:30.162 --> 00:23:32.059
congratulations, that is amazing...

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:35.819
But certainly in the United States
we can go to the supermarket

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:40.180
and, you know, nothing fancy,
we can buy what we can afford

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:45.859
and we can eat it in confidence that it's safe,
it's helpful, it's nutritious.

00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:50.379
And as Dr. Westman says,

00:23:50.379 --> 00:23:54.379
"If you eat that and not the CARBage,
you will get better."

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.460
And so then I am left saying,

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.779
so what's the justification
for saying these other things?

00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:03.959
That it must be these other things.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.819
I've had people from the audience,
people I've known for a very long time,

00:24:07.819 --> 00:24:11.339
and I think a lot of them in their sphere.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:18.940
But they tell me, "If I'm not going to get
somebody to eat a wholly organic diet,

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:24.128
then they are better off being left
on the SAD diet."

00:24:24.237 --> 00:24:25.641
 It's so scary.

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:28.619
It, sort of to me, says that we're dealing
with belief system,

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:31.262
no objective information here.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.420
If all things were equal...

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:40.500
wave a magic wand and grass fed grass finished
is equally as inexpensive as grain fed,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.531
would you choose it?

00:24:42.532 --> 00:24:47.178
Would you say there is a probable value
to choosing it if everything else were equal?

00:24:47.282 --> 00:24:50.420
One, I don't think that
that's a fair statement,

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.339
because there's a reason
that we do what we do.

00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:57.539
But that being aside,
there are differences,

00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:03.019
we have no ability to assess the biological
significance of those differences.

00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:05.900
If you like the taste, do it.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.819
I'm all for supporting a rancher or farmer
that somebody knows personally

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:12.539
or thinks they know personally.

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:14.220
I'm all for that.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.539
I'm all for variety and choices
within the marketplace.

00:25:17.539 --> 00:25:20.220
So I don't want to be misunderstood.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.140
What I don't think we can afford
in the industry side

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.099
is to set ourselves against each other.

00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:29.812
There's too few producers.

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:31.628
That's a good point.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:37.700
Then on the consumer side,
certainly within my all low-carb tribe,

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.660
I want us to be aware that there is a lot
of incorrect information

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.140
that people pick up as they go along
and they say that

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:54.259
and that then puts their area
of expertise credibility at risk

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:59.363
certainly in the eyes of people
who know more about this subject.

00:25:59.364 --> 00:26:02.180
So, you know, the nightmare for me...

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.140
or the concern for me,
let's not be too dramatic...

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:11.500
the concern for me is that I could talk
to let's say Estate Beef Council audience

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:17.019
and tell people about a low carbohydrate
ketogenic diet

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:19.380
and all the great things that come,

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.500
and the value of their products as part
or the majority of this kind of a lifestyle

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.980
and the impact that could make
in their families,

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.059
the communities that they live in,
the states and nation and the world.

00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:39.500
Then they go look up, you know,
low-carb ketogenic, google it

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.140
and they find somebody who's talking
about some of these things

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.460
and they go, "They are wrong about that."

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.500
Now, that's not fair...
None of us can be right in everything.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.059
But it is part of the human nature.

00:26:56.059 --> 00:27:01.380
And I'd hate to have that
be a barrier to this

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:09.259
and then again if people assume that
the environmental footprint of these different--

00:27:09.259 --> 00:27:13.019
if they incorrectly assume
the environmental footprints

00:27:13.019 --> 00:27:16.220
of these different management systems,

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.775
then that could lead them astray as well.

00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:21.900
Yes, so let's talk about the footprints
because I think it's very important.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.740
I took a family vacation to Colorado

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.772
and we're driving from Denver
to Colorado Springs

00:27:27.773 --> 00:27:30.859
and you look out the window
and you see these happy cows...

00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:32.940
I'm going to put my feelings on them...

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.299
They are happy cows, roaming around,
eating grass in the sunshine,

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:38.460
the way a cow should be.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.259
Then took a trip to Big Bear in California
and we're driving back...

00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:46.819
and you can smell the ranch
before you even hit it,

00:27:46.819 --> 00:27:49.299
whereas before in Colorado
you couldn't smell it.

00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:53.900
So you smell this ranch a couple miles away,
you see the crowded cows on concrete

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.460
and it's a completely different feeling.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.339
You can imagine there must be
a different environmental impact.

00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:02.441
So you are here to say, "Hold on,
maybe it's not all that it seems"?

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:06.619
Yes, first of all I think the numbers...

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:12.500
like we've got 113 million cows
in the United States, something like that.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:19.380
And only 11 million some of them were
on feed last month, which was a record.

00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:28.619
The number of animals that you would see
in confinement being fed that way

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:32.420
is a small portion of the entire beef heard.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.686
So you have to have cows
to produce calves.

00:28:35.687 --> 00:28:40.019
You have to have bulls... at some point
they are using artificial insemination, total

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:43.779
but most beef producers
still have herd bulls.

00:28:43.779 --> 00:28:47.460
So then you've got the young females
that are growing up

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.420
to become replacement heifers.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.819
So you have to have
a larger number of animals

00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:59.380
to support the crop of steers
that are going to be harvested.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.859
So that's one thing.

00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:08.019
Two is that part of the reason
for those confinement operations

00:29:08.019 --> 00:29:15.339
is to limit the movement of nutrients
from that source off-site.

00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:21.420
So there's lot of regulation
and there's a lot of inspection

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.420
and things that go on in there.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:30.980
Number three is when we're trying to get
these animals to finished weight

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:37.420
we do have to feed them
a higher-quality diet.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:43.019
Now a mama cow running out on
the rangeland that you drove by in Colorado

00:29:43.019 --> 00:29:47.460
is the perfect animal to utilize that,
because she doesn't have to grow much,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.700
she's typically at a mature body weight.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.259
So she needs to be maintained,

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:56.339
she needs to support the growth
of the developing calf

00:29:56.339 --> 00:29:58.579
and she needs to produce milk

00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:02.500
so indeed over time in any one cycle

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.899
her feed quality needs 
are going to increase.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:13.059
But at her lowest point she can eat some
pretty poor quality forage and be very happy.

00:30:13.059 --> 00:30:15.735
You can't do that with a growing animal.

00:30:15.736 --> 00:30:19.900
You don't see that feed out in the rangeland
where those calves are roaming.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.940
So those calves have to be removed
and moved to a different environment...

00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:26.618
Oh, interesting.

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:30.460
...where they can then feed
on that higher-quality feed.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:37.380
Now a lot of animals will go from the poor
production pastures to better quality pastures

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.859
and spend several more months on pasture.

00:30:40.859 --> 00:30:45.900
They may then go completely to finish weight
on that kind of feed resource

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:54.208
or they might then get moved again
into a confined feeding operation.

00:30:54.209 --> 00:30:56.099
So at the end of the day,

00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:59.019
maybe four or six months
out of that steer's life

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:01.980
is going to be spent
in that kind of situation.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:08.660
So it's certainly not, you know, the lifetime
spent which some people imagine.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.579
These kinds of animals
are herd animals

00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:16.048
and they will naturally crowd
regardless of how much space they're given,

00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:22.531
and in fact if you try to separate them
then that becomes a stress to them.

00:31:22.532 --> 00:31:28.980
And then the other aspect is it's tempting
to put our emotions on animals,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.579
but that's a mistake.

00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:39.940
But that's not to say that every responsible
member of the livestock industry

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.819
isn't concerned about animal welfare.

00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:48.740
They very much are... in many cases
these operations are multigenerational,

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.619
and the animals that are on, in that herd

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:57.259
are the product of a program that stretches
back to their grandfathers.

00:31:57.259 --> 00:32:00.099
So they've grown up with these animals,

00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:05.059
they have this tie to the land
that others of us can only envy.

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:09.140
And so they have
that concern and perspective.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:16.700
Also you have the hard reality
that if they don't care about animal welfare

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.733
they hurt their own profits.

00:32:19.734 --> 00:32:22.380
And then the third is they understand

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.259
that the care and treatment of the animals
will be reflected in the meat.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:30.180
Yes, so some statistics that I read

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:35.660
are 11% of CAFO and grain fed cows

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:42.660
have liver abscesses,
but only 0.2% of grass fed grazing cows do.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.539
So it seems like that there would be
a health difference.

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:48.980
I don't know how significant that is,
but in the use of antibiotics is different,

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.579
maybe the use of hormones are different.

00:32:51.579 --> 00:32:54.180
So there are still more things
under the surface

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.779
that maybe aren't as big of a deal
as I would like to make them to be,

00:32:57.779 --> 00:33:00.631
but they still show a difference
between the two.

00:33:00.719 --> 00:33:03.579
One of the uses
for antibiotics for example

00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:08.131
is a class of chemical that has absolutely
no application in human health,

00:33:08.132 --> 00:33:14.420
and what it does is it shifts the population
of microorganisms in the rumen

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.646
to depress
the activity of methanogenic bacteria,

00:33:18.647 --> 00:33:22.059
so those organisms that produce methane,

00:33:22.059 --> 00:33:27.259
which increases the efficiency of feed use
and lower submission.

00:33:27.259 --> 00:33:31.731
Okay so is that a good thing or bad thing?

00:33:31.732 --> 00:33:35.619
United States has about 9%
of the world's beef cattle,

00:33:35.619 --> 00:33:37.660
I think it's North America, actually.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.740
So, Canada, the United States
has about 9% of the world's beef cattle

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.292
but produces almost 20%
of the world's beef.

00:33:44.353 --> 00:33:45.698
Oh, wow!

00:33:45.877 --> 00:33:49.859
So that comes because
of the technology that's available.

00:33:49.859 --> 00:33:54.140
So, efficiency in almost
other every other aspect of human life

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.099
is considered desirable thing.

00:33:57.099 --> 00:34:02.299
For some reason it's looked at
with suspicion in agriculture.

00:34:02.299 --> 00:34:06.019
If we go looking for actual differences
in product,

00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:10.940
there are screening and surveillance
protocols in place for monitoring,

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:16.420
for antibiotic residues,
for pesticide residues,

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:21.820
and if the animals are above, you know, 
if carcasses are found to be above

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.820
then that doesn't go into the feed channel.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.300
In terms of hormones from use
of exogenous hormones

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:34.420
which does tend to be more
in the confinement feeding operation,

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.900
but again you're talking about the vast
majority of beef that's produced in the U.S.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.539
We're still at a low percentage
from grass fed.

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:50.169
We're talking about 1 nanogram difference
in 3 ounces of beef.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:56.300
Between a an animal that didn't get that
and an animal that did,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:02.500
and that's at least an order of magnitude
less than you get from an egg.

00:35:02.607 --> 00:35:03.571
Oh, interesting.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:10.420
Or from butter, or from other products,
animal products.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:18.099
And then you have to become aware
that there are phytoestrogenic compounds,

00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:23.699
and especially ironically enough soy
is a massive source,

00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:29.900
and so these substances are present
in those feeds

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:35.644
at multiple orders of magnitude
above what you could get.

00:35:35.799 --> 00:35:39.500
You're making this much more complex;
it's easier to think of it in simple terms.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.678
That's definitely getting more complex.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.659
Would you like your physician
to think about your treatment?

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:46.732
I don't know maybe that's it didn't but.

00:35:46.841 --> 00:35:50.659
That's one of my big messages 
that we shouldn't dumb this down

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:53.340
and just make it black-and-white
when it comes to your health,

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:57.213
but when it comes to nutrition
and agriculture and farming

00:35:57.214 --> 00:35:59.780
I want it black and white,
I don't want this nuance.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.097
So I can see why other people want that
in medicine as well.

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:05.139
Indeed and maybe it's because,

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:08.579
okay if I can believe I understand it
then that makes it comfortable.

00:36:08.676 --> 00:36:09.739
Right.

00:36:09.882 --> 00:36:14.179
And I certainly get that,
but back to human beings,

00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:17.900
I think it was Ted Naiman who tells
a story about one patient

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.699
who despite the challenges of his life,

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:27.980
he went and bought a used cast-iron skillet.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.980
He cooks on a butane stove.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:38.300
He goes to Safeway, he buys the cheap
80-20-80% lean 20% fat hamburger.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:43.653
He buys this, you know, the store brand eggs
and that's what he eats.

00:36:43.654 --> 00:36:48.300
It's costing him $6 to $7 a day 
food and fuel.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.619
And in whatever the time was,
I'll say it was a year,

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:58.260
he dumped 70 pounds of excess body
weight and normalized all his panels.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:03.219
Okay so let's have a conversation
about health food.

00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:11.260
Let's have a conversation about why that man
should've been paying more than he could

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.059
to eat the food to produce that effect.

00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:18.260
Now somewhere down the road of course,
something but we're not there yet.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.820
We're not there yet by a long shot.

00:37:20.927 --> 00:37:25.980
Yes, you've mentioned this before
about sustainability and global impact,

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:30.739
and we have to factor into that health
impact as well, and health sustainability

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:32.860
which I think is a great point.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.300
So, but when we talk
about environment sustainability,

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.420
you mentioned methane and that's a bit--
that's obviously a big topic.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.139
Everybody's worried about cow farts and
cow burps and the methane emissions.

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:49.659
And, that's where a lot of this reporting
in data gets really fuzzy as well

00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:55.820
because at one point cows were contributing
more to climate change

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.780
than the whole transportation sector,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.940
and then that was absolutely false
because of awful data collection,

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.699
comparing apples to oranges basically.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:12.568
So now is down about 4%,
or so I think of the climate change.

00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:16.539
But there's still this concern
that it's a part of the problem,

00:38:16.539 --> 00:38:22.500
and there's a way to improve it with
rotational grazing like the savory institute,

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:28.300
and then is it, not only contributing
to the environmental pollution

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.380
but it can actually be in that carbon sink
and take carbon out of the environment.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.780
Do you subscribe to that as well,
and say this is a great model

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.219
to try and transition to so that we can
no longer talk about ruminants

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:45.900
as a contributor to fossil fuel missions

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.681
but instead as a sink to improve
the environment?

00:38:49.836 --> 00:38:53.460
First of all I think the figures
for the United States are the 2%,

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.699
T-W-O percent

00:38:57.699 --> 00:39:03.619
of the anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions in the US

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:06.300
are from the beef industry.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:13.179
All of animal agriculture is 4,
all of agriculture is 9.

00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:17.059
So in the weird world that I live in,

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:22.139
the plant agriculture produces
5% of the greenhouse gas emissions

00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:23.812
and beef produces 2.

00:39:23.919 --> 00:39:26.814
Seems like that's new math,
but now that's just math.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:31.579
Just math and meanwhile
the healthcare industry is 10%.

00:39:31.713 --> 00:39:34.500
I'm contributing more than the cow
that I drove by?

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:39.179
Absolutely, and we'll avoid all those lines
that are sitting right there in front of us.

00:39:39.179 --> 00:39:44.219
Another point is that while
it is humorous to think about rocket cows

00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:48.099
with flames coming out of their back end,
it's not...

00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:54.099
The methane is not from farts.
It's coming from belching.

00:39:54.099 --> 00:39:58.500
The release of gases that are produced
in the rumen

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.420
as the microorganisms
break down the feed.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.340
So there're several things you can do
to lower that.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.726
One is feed higher quality diet.

00:40:08.727 --> 00:40:12.300
So clearly 2% is 2%... it's important.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.739
If you look worldwide certainly
the enteric methane emissions,

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:21.385
which is the methane that comes from
this ruminant digestion

00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:24.860
in the United States
have essentially been flat.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:30.659
They've been trending significantly
downward in the so-called developed world,

00:40:30.659 --> 00:40:35.820
while they've been trending significantly
upward in the developing world.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.940
And what we have to get
our arms around

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:45.099
is that the majority of protein in humanity's
diet is not coming from animal source foods.

00:40:45.099 --> 00:40:48.619
The vast majority is coming
from plant source foods.

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:51.860
And we've already discussed
that animal source of protein

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:56.219
is superior for human nutrition
to plant source protein.

00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:00.460
In addition the majority of calories
by a larger margin,

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:05.659
the majority of calories in humanity's diet
are coming from plants.

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:08.569
And if I understand you people right,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:13.300
eating sugar and starch which we get
from plants may not be a good thing.

00:41:13.441 --> 00:41:14.866
May not.

00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:20.940
And in fact consuming animal fats as part
of our diet might actually be a good thing,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.940
and we've got 2 billion more people coming
at us in 32 years,

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.900
that's the projection.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.420
That's going to be accompanied
by a requirement

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:37.860
per the UN of increasing,
doubling food production.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.460
Now we could probably make a big impact
if we reduced food waste.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.132
So maybe we don't have
to double food production.

00:41:45.319 --> 00:41:47.380
And the majority of the food waste
is from the plant side,

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.099
not from the animal side as well.

00:41:49.201 --> 00:41:54.886
Indeed, that's in fact
an inconvenient truth to use a phrase.

00:41:54.887 --> 00:42:00.139
Also at the same time they're projecting
this increase of 66%

00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:03.968
in the demand
for animal protein worldwide,

00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:08.604
but that's all based on their assumption
of what the proper human diet ought to be.

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:14.300
Right and then because of that you see
publications in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; recently,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.059
in &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;,
in the landmark UN report,

00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:22.019
that all say we need to convert
more of our beef production

00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:25.579
over to a plant-based agriculture

00:42:25.579 --> 00:42:30.300
for sustainment of enough food
for the world and health for the world.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.059
But that makes quite a few assumptions,
doesn't it?

00:42:33.158 --> 00:42:38.099
Right it conflates cropland with farmland
or agricultural land.

00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:45.019
So the land that we can grow crops on
is a small portion of the farmland in the world

00:42:45.019 --> 00:42:48.500
because relatively small percentage
of the earth's surface

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.219
is suitable for cultivation, about 4%.

00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:55.139
Unfortunately, that's land
that we're degrading.

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:59.178
It's also land that we're building cities
and suburbs on,

00:42:59.179 --> 00:43:04.179
and so we're losing that
at a frightening rate.

00:43:04.179 --> 00:43:08.099
But we have almost a quarter
of the earth's surface

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:14.820
and I'm including the oceans in that,
which is classed as rangeland,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.059
which is long-term pasture,

00:43:18.059 --> 00:43:22.619
should not be cultivated
when you do think dust ball.

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:27.420
Then we have forest land making up another
significant chunk that we put it together

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.739
we come up with almost a quarter.

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:33.059
We can raise ruminant animals
in agroforestry systems.

00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:36.579
We can raise trees, grass and animals
on the same ground,

00:43:36.579 --> 00:43:41.260
and we can even then do that
in rotation with crops.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.420
So we can plant trees in rows

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.260
and in between,
in large spaces in the middle,

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.327
we can then have grass growing,
raise animals on that

00:43:49.328 --> 00:43:54.260
and then maybe we can come back in
and plant soybeans or corn

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.820
or something else
for a period of time,

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.820
then go back into grass
as the trees continue to grow.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:05.340
This is in Brazil, this was integrated
cropping livestock systems.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.019
In other areas, they call it agroforestry.

00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:12.300
But this is the kind
of integration

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.380
that other parts of the world are looking at 
and trying to practice,

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.580
and for a number of reasons 
we've kind of gone to another direction,

00:44:19.581 --> 00:44:22.659
but I see sort of that trend bending back

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.852
towards more integrated farming systems
in this country.

00:44:25.959 --> 00:44:30.099
And one of the main questions is,
how scalable is that? How realistic is that?

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:33.460
Is that something that's going to help us
get out of the predicament?

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.900
Or, is that just going to be
a fraction of a percent?

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.659
It's going to be real nice
but not really have much of an impact.

00:44:39.659 --> 00:44:41.940
You have a feel for how realistic that is?

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:44.449
I think it's abundantly realistic.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.260
This gets to the whole idea
of a ruminant revolution.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:51.139
We need to revolutionize our dietary advice.

00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:55.820
We need to do that
because our dietary policy,

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.860
and advice influences
all kinds of other policy,

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:06.300
and all kinds of other funding, and all kinds
of other decisions that are made.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.059
So we can't really make these changes

00:45:11.059 --> 00:45:15.460
in some of these column downstream
parts of the system

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.780
until we no longer have
the message being,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:24.739
"We need to be eating polyunsaturated
fatty acids, instead of saturated fatty acids".

00:45:24.739 --> 00:45:28.260
Well, where do we get the poof is from?
We get those from plants.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.059
Well we'd better be growing
more oilseed crops

00:45:31.059 --> 00:45:34.380
so that we can get those "healthier oils".

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.380
You can see that rippling out.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:44.900
Part of this is that 
a lot of what is impacting

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:52.179
our ability to produce enough food 
to feed humanity appropriately

00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:55.780
really isn't agronomy,
really isn't animal science.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:46:02.659
It's things to do with sociology, it's things
to do with stable governments rule of law,

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:07.019
those kinds of infrastructure issues,
and all those need to be addressed.

00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:11.900
We should be looking at that
and trying to help other people

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:19.099
become as prosperous and as flourishing
as we have been allowed to become

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:22.179
because of what our grandparents did

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:25.017
to create the environment
that we're now able to live in.

00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:30.780
That's again a unique perspective
that we don't hear as much about.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.780
So I read an article recently about goats.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.340
And they're saying goats
are going to save us.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:41.420
Goats would be the best option
to increase their usage as a food source

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.340
because one, they will eat anything,

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.099
and they can convert pretty much anything
into a high-quality protein

00:46:48.099 --> 00:46:52.099
and in some locations goats actually are
a delicacy and they're common,

00:46:52.099 --> 00:46:54.860
but here in the United States they're not.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.455
Can we have a goat revolution?
Is that going to help things?

00:46:57.559 --> 00:47:02.219
Well notice it's a ruminant revolution,
as we both know ruminants rule.

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:06.699
And I don't mean to be no bovine centric,

00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:10.980
but that's just the one that most people
in the United States are used to

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.780
and of course when we see that
the propaganda come out...

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.219
it's cows, it's not the sheep,
it's not the goats.

00:47:17.219 --> 00:47:23.900
And wild ruminants release methane as well,
just like termites do.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:27.391
Somehow we don't have a thing
against termites, I wonder why that is.

00:47:27.392 --> 00:47:31.500
Small ruminants are a critical resource
in some parts of the world.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:38.860
They farm deer, you know, you look
at the northern people in Europe

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:43.579
and they manage their reindeer herds.

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:47.260
So, human beings
have domesticated ruminants

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:53.780
in every biome that humans have learned
how to live in.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:58.331
They've been a partner just like
the dog's been a partner in our success.

00:47:58.332 --> 00:48:04.820
So, undoubtedly these other ruminants
will play a significant part in.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.820
And we perhaps
would be better off

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.019
rather than focus on the cow or the sheep
or the goat

00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:18.300
to look at becoming grass farmers.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:22.059
And what we need
to teach people how to do,

00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:26.900
is grow grass to the best
of that site's ability

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.380
and that's going to vary tremendously
because of environmental factors.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.539
And then how they can convert that product,

00:48:34.539 --> 00:48:41.098
which really they can't sell directly,
into something that has value.

00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:46.460
So livestock, the products of livestock,
both edible and byproducts,

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:51.739
because leather is valuable
for example.

00:48:51.739 --> 00:48:55.300
So, there's lot of layers to this

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:02.500
but we need to be open to the idea
that this isn't a dead-end.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.380
This isn't the enemy.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:11.884
The problems have been 
I think oversimplified.

00:49:11.996 --> 00:49:17.500
Yes and that's really disturbing because
we hear a report from the United Nations.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.539
I mean this isn't just some journal
or some opinion piece,

00:49:20.539 --> 00:49:23.739
but it's a report from the United Nations

00:49:23.739 --> 00:49:26.980
that we need to reduce
the amount of meat we're eating

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:33.019
and the amount of land we're giving
to grazing or raising cows,

00:49:33.019 --> 00:49:35.500
from the United Nations.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.177
That seems like almost too big
to counteract in the fight against.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.420
Well and let me just turn the table
and say that there are some people

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:48.139
who don't yet understand the value
of a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet,

00:49:48.139 --> 00:49:53.539
which is completely against what
the official dietary guidelines have been.

00:49:53.539 --> 00:49:59.099
My goodness, that's coming from the USDA
and the Health and Human Services Department

00:49:59.099 --> 00:50:04.300
and it's supposed to be developed
by people who are experts in the field,

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.300
who are considering all the relevant
literature...

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.313
I'm being really sarcastic.

00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:09.993
Right, but a very similar--

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:15.099
Absolutely, and then the other point
I want people to understand

00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:20.500
is we got those dietary guidelines
as a product of their time,

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:25.059
and part of that time was this emerging
environmental movement

00:50:25.059 --> 00:50:27.699
of the 60's and 70's.

00:50:27.699 --> 00:50:33.340
So one of the reasons
for this diet being advanced

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.059
was because of the perception

00:50:37.059 --> 00:50:39.820
that we can't feed the world
with animal products.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.940
We have to get everybody 
on a plant source diet.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.500
And then if you start tracking some of the
influential books and people of the time

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:52.699
you see their influence showing up
in the dietary goals.

00:50:52.699 --> 00:50:56.699
And now we're sort of coming back around
because it seems, to me at least,

00:50:56.699 --> 00:51:00.260
that a lot of the dietary messages,
the nutrition messages,

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.860
are getting harder and harder
to maintain.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:09.659
So there was never any justification
for cholesterol restriction in the diet,

00:51:09.659 --> 00:51:13.699
so they're kind of sort of admitting that,
although they say not to eat too much.

00:51:13.699 --> 00:51:17.219
Well okay I won't,
because there is no upper limit.

00:51:17.219 --> 00:51:20.340
You know saturated fat,
well they're less concerned,

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.739
but they're not fully convinced yet.

00:51:22.739 --> 00:51:25.300
It's still there is a restriction,

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:29.139
but it seems that more and more
it's becoming understood

00:51:29.139 --> 00:51:32.940
that natural saturated fats,
we always have to say that--

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:38.579
at one point they included
the trans fats, the artificial trans fats.

00:51:38.713 --> 00:51:40.380
Industrial trans fats.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.780
Yes, so that's falling away

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:49.391
and then if you read Zoe Harcombe's
excellent takedown of the red meat story.

00:51:49.392 --> 00:51:52.260
There's no "there there" either.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.619
Okay, so what's left?

00:51:54.619 --> 00:51:58.619
Well okay now we'll appeal
to the environmental impact

00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:04.139
and part of what I've tried to do here,
we're at low-carb Houston,

00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:09.174
was present some information
to just look at the numbers.

00:52:09.175 --> 00:52:14.099
Because there's lots of layers to this story
that you could go to,

00:52:14.099 --> 00:52:18.780
but sometimes I think that's just a bridge
too far for people.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:26.260
So let's start with the fact that
when they say that livestock agriculture

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.139
or cows by themselves,

00:52:29.139 --> 00:52:33.659
are, you know, more greenhouse 
gas emissions than transportation

00:52:33.659 --> 00:52:36.780
that's just factually incorrect
based on the numbers

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:42.570
and the numbers are always some degree
of modeling right there.

00:52:42.571 --> 00:52:49.739
Now when scientists
actually put cattle into devices

00:52:49.739 --> 00:52:54.340
where there's a sleeve around their neck,

00:52:54.340 --> 00:53:01.460
so that they can enclose the atmosphere
that these animals are then burping into

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.340
and they can feed and then measure
the methane generation,

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.860
they find very different numbers.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:14.776
And the idea that there is such a thing
as a consensus in science

00:53:14.777 --> 00:53:19.500
speaks to the weakness of that discipline

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.699
because there may be some things
that we think we know,

00:53:23.699 --> 00:53:28.057
but we should always be open
and testing whether in fact those are so.

00:53:28.159 --> 00:53:31.500
Right and what you compare it to,
makes a big difference as well.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.182
So I read this one quote
that I wanted to read,

00:53:34.183 --> 00:53:38.139
you can fill your shopping basket
with lentils from Canada, mangoes from India,

00:53:38.139 --> 00:53:41.739
beans from Brazil, goji berries from China,
blueberries from the United States,

00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:43.780
and Qinoa from the Andes,

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:47.780
or you could go to your local rancher
and get a chunk of meat.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.334
Which is going to have
the environmental impact,

00:53:50.335 --> 00:53:53.500
but that's not factored in
to a lot of these studies and these headlines

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.699
when they talk
about environmental impact.

00:53:55.836 --> 00:54:00.219
Exactly and then the point
that I would make on top of that,

00:54:00.219 --> 00:54:07.179
is if you're right and the burden
of chronic disease in the United States

00:54:07.179 --> 00:54:14.131
is in part because we're eating
a mostly plant-based processed food diet,

00:54:14.132 --> 00:54:19.567
then how do we factor that into
the conversation about environmental impact?

00:54:19.568 --> 00:54:22.420
There are certain words
that when they get used in conversation,

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:26.179
they sort of become these feel good,
you know, blankets,

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:30.460
and we don't really have to know what
we're talking about, but now we feel good.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:34.300
So sustainability is one of those words.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:38.860
And unfortunately too often
it's what I call sustain a babble.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.820
If we're not talking
about a societal component

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:46.888
as well as an economic component,
as well as an ecological component,

00:54:46.889 --> 00:54:50.780
then we're not having
the full sort of conversation,

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:56.332
and clearly that's got to be
a very difficult exercise.

00:54:56.333 --> 00:55:01.780
But I would point out that when we have
60% of the adult population in the US

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.219
having one or more chronic diseases,

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:10.139
when we have over half of adult Americans
being diabetic or pre-diabetic,

00:55:10.139 --> 00:55:14.380
when we have 200 people a day
losing some part of their body

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.179
because of the standard of care
for diabetes,

00:55:17.179 --> 00:55:23.206
which is the clearest case
for restricted carbohydrate diets.

00:55:23.207 --> 00:55:27.699
Yet we're hearing at meetings like this
and in the literature

00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:34.086
a growing number of chronic illnesses that
are plausibly linked to hyperinsulinemia,

00:55:34.087 --> 00:55:39.780
what's the impact on the families
of those people?

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:45.139
What's the impact in terms of their
communities just from that perspective?

00:55:45.139 --> 00:55:48.940
And then I think to figure something
like $1 billion a day close to that

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:53.405
just for diabetes care.

00:55:53.406 --> 00:55:58.260
Well we know that the chronic disease
epidemic is bankrupting the United States.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.380
So how do you factor that in?

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:06.340
And the interesting thing, the frustrating
thing for me is when I talk to people

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.139
who are sincerely engaged
in this kind of an exercise

00:56:10.139 --> 00:56:15.340
when they're trying to do essentially
lifecycle analysis,

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:19.820
you know, sustainability discussions
around beef in society,

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:26.099
they have a significant number of places
for health to come in,

00:56:26.099 --> 00:56:31.260
health of workers, health of consumers,
health of producers.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:36.940
Who's informing that part
of your calculations?

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:43.619
Is that reflecting the conventional wisdom?

00:56:43.619 --> 00:56:50.300
Where maybe, you know, 4 ounces of red
meat a couple times a week would be okay,

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:57.460
or is the room may be to make a run
of your model using may be an alternative,

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.579
and so these conversations
need to take place as well

00:57:00.579 --> 00:57:03.900
because I think we could find
a very different answer.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.260
And so if we're right,
always a useful phrase to keep in mind,

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:11.300
if we're right that eating
more animal product

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.619
would produce this improvement
in the health of humans

00:57:15.619 --> 00:57:19.034
not just in the United States
but around the world,

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:24.420
then how do you balance that off
against some model prediction

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:30.209
of what that's going to wreak
half a century or century down the road?

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:33.340
I think that's a great summary
and a great way to tie it all together,

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:37.099
that we can't look at medicine and health
in one bucket

00:57:37.099 --> 00:57:40.500
and environment and farming and crops
in another bucket,

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.539
because they're so interrelated,
one influences the other

00:57:43.539 --> 00:57:45.780
and you have to factor them in together.

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.980
I mean that is a great part
of your message.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.219
That's one thing I really like about,
as we saw in this discussion,

00:57:51.219 --> 00:57:54.860
you have a very nuanced approach
and a great way of looking at things

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.820
from a wider perspective seeing
how they interrelate each other.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:04.739
I'm glad that you're the messenger trying
to bridge the gap between the disciplines,

00:58:04.739 --> 00:58:06.657
I think you're well suited for that.

00:58:06.835 --> 00:58:08.260
Thank you very much.

00:58:08.341 --> 00:58:10.790
So if people want to learn more
about you and your message,

00:58:10.791 --> 00:58:12.984
where can they go to find out more?

00:58:13.079 --> 00:58:18.619
You can find me on Twitter and
on Instagram it's "grassbased" one word.

00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:22.219
You can find me on Facebook,
I have a personal page,

00:58:22.219 --> 00:58:25.900
but then if you're more interested
in just the grass based health,

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.500
that's the name of the page.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.619
I have a mostly dormant blog
that I keep threatening to write more for

00:58:32.619 --> 00:58:35.900
but there's some stuff there
and you can also find me on YouTube.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:40.099
I have a channel where I've put links
to a number of videos of presentations

00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:43.219
as well as a bunch of stuff
I just find interesting.

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:46.659
So if you want to learn about
Pacific Northwest geography for example

00:58:46.659 --> 00:58:51.739
I've got a number of links to some really
great lectures that you can learn a lot about,

00:58:51.739 --> 00:58:53.757
something that I find interesting.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.460
Well I have to check those out.

00:58:55.461 --> 00:58:57.498
Peter Ballerstedt, 
thank you for joining me today.

00:58:57.593 --> 00:58:59.583
You're very welcome,
thank you for the chance.
