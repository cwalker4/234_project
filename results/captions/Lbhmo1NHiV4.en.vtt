00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:09.180
For the first time ever has Danish TV been granted
access to a NATO warship out on live operations.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.594
For three months will the 150 men and women on board
Absalon fight pirates in the waters outside Somalia.

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:23.630
For the Danish soldiers it will be 3 months of
action, hardships and unique solidarity.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.705
And we are along at the frontline
when Denmark goes pirate hunting.

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:29.961
Pirate Hunt

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:32.401
You have permission to open fire.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.286
If I'm shot it will be by something like this.

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:39.518
By something I hold the most of.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.887
If they were amateurs they would have given up
straight away, but these are remaining cool.

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:46.830
He's aiming on the hostages!

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.847
Pirate Hunt

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:20.650
It's afternoon on the Danish warship Absalon.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.610
But far from a normal afternoon.

00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:29.104
Absalon has for 24 hours followed a
pirate mothership with 25 pirates onboard.

00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:39.754
He's turning.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.680
He's turned 180 degrees hasn't he?
Bring up the FLIR.

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:49.641
The warship has cut off its ability to flee
and a battle is therefore unavoidable.

00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:53.266
For Carsten, Absalons captain,
the task is clear.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:58.008
The pirates onboard Jelbut 40 must
be stopped and the hostages freed.

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.764
The pirates are now also so close
they pose a threat towards Absalons crew.

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:06.666
If we see an RPG pointed towards us,
that's a primary threat -

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.437
- and we fire in self-defense.

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:13.261
If we are closer by and a rifle is
lifted towards the hostages -

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.683
- we fire in self-defense
for the hostages -

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:21.307
- in accordance with FKO's directives
about inhumane and degrading treatment.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.622
We should still be able to look ourself
in the mirrors when we get home.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.811
We don't let humans get slaughtered.
Let's man our posts.

00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.165
High alert.

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:45.925
In the operations room Absalons
commanders go to high alert.

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:51.106
Because of the pirates anti-armour weapons
they all dress in combat uniforms.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:54.891
It's the first time on this mission
the threat from pirates is so high -

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:59.280
- that also the leaders onboard have
to dress in fire retardant gear.

00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:04.974
In the operations room Carsten stands ready.

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:08.964
Thanks to Absalons powerful camera
he can watch the action on the screens -

00:03:08.964 --> 00:03:12.681
- and see every move the pirates make.

00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:18.662
Mike Papa here, thanks for that.

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:22.016
At the lower decks stand the
leader for the Military Police.

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:27.371
If the mission is a success it's him and his men
that will gather evidence on the boat afterwards.

00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.799
But until he can move out he acts
like an extra set of eyes for Carsten.

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.490
So it's my job to observe the Jelbut
and come with messages to them.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.732
On another deck stands men from
the specially trained  Frogman corps.

00:03:40.732 --> 00:03:44.330
They are ready with the
Gustav recoilless rifle -

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.005
- if the pirates resist Absalon and
Carstens orders for surrender.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.912
Which Carsten and his crew
will find out shortly.

00:03:54.762 --> 00:03:57.060
Disengage safety!

00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.512
Distance 440 meters.

00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:13.814
The Danes hope to quickly set the pirates out
thanks to their overwhelming firepower.

00:04:13.814 --> 00:04:18.608
Carsten prepares to fire the first warning shots
towards the pirate mothership.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.633
Seven.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:21.454
Six.

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:22.533
Five.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:23.471
Four.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.506
Three.

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:25.483
Two.

00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:26.544
Fire!

00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:32.637
Begin shouting on the LRAD.

00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:39.086
Through the giant megaphone LRAD Absalons
interpreter tells the Somali pirates to surrender.

00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:44.276
Listen! Everyone come out with
your hands above your head!

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:56.623
The pirates are completely indifferent
to Absalons massive salvos.

00:04:56.623 --> 00:05:00.087
And makes no sign of surrendering.

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.978
Carsten knows it's important to
show determination from the start.

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.517
Permission granted to fire
second warning salvo.

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.910
I want it just infront.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.273
The 50 year old captain Carsten Fjord Larsen bears
the full responsibility for the top modern warship.

00:05:17.273 --> 00:05:20.603
During this mission he will have
to make difficult descisions -

00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:26.176
- that could mean the difference between life and
death for the pirates, the hostages and his own crew.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:33.836
It's the descisions he make now that defines
him as human and as chief for Absalon.

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:38.564
Before we start such an operation, -

00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:45.330
- I have to establish with
myself where the line goes.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.377
We will of course solve the mission,
but the ship and crew are also coming home.

00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:54.158
-Distance 300 meters.
-Place it 10 meters ahead.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:56.878
Disengage safety!

00:05:57.214 --> 00:05:59.383
In short bursts!
Fire!

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.280
Careful.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.021
That was real close to his head.

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:11.382
They're drinking coffee.

00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:19.111
It is now completely clear to Carsten and his crew
what kind of pirates they are dealing with.

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:25.742
If they were amateurs they would have given up
straight away, but these here are remaining cool.

00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:29.925
In the operations room Carsten
decides to take it a step further.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:35.415
It's time to bring out the heavier weapons to stop
the pirates and hopefully free the hostages.

00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:38.988
-Are we firing the recoilless?
-Yes.

00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:46.389
He orders the elite Frogmen soldiers to fire
a warning shot with the Gustav recoilless rifle.

00:06:56.832 --> 00:06:59.733
No activity.

00:06:59.733 --> 00:07:05.481
The intention now is to allow the snipers
to fire on the port side water tank.

00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:11.254
Neither the machine gun or rocket fire
in front or rear of the boat has had any effect.

00:07:11.254 --> 00:07:16.825
Carsten decides to escalate the situation and
allow his men to fire directly on the pirates boat.

00:07:17.493 --> 00:07:24.122
Since the hostages are likely hidden under deck
it's an order to be carried out with the utmost precision.

00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:35.196
Open fire on the water tank.

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:48.610
I'm counting 1-2-3-4-5 pax in the middle.

00:07:49.692 --> 00:07:52.914
And I can clearly see one RPG.

00:07:52.914 --> 00:07:56.000
-Where?
-Aft! Last man at the aft!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.114
-Where?
-He's got it on his shoulder.

00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:02.675
He's got a red shirt.

00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:06.553
The direct fire is apparently
making the pirates nervous.

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:09.882
But they are still not surrendering,
rather the opposite.

00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:15.025
-Has he gone in position? -No he has not
gone in position, he is still at the aft.

00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:18.228
-With the weapon up?
-On his shoulder.

00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:23.605
An RPG is a serious threat towards Absalon.
A grenade could pierce the hull -

00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:29.162
- and in worst case scenario hit the operations
room where Carsten and  the officers are located.

00:08:29.162 --> 00:08:35.029
We can still observe one person with RPG.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.132
Roger. Copy that.

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:41.063
Chief, we have weapons.

00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:44.703
If anyone points an RPG towards
us we fire in self-defense.

00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:49.855
SMI Leader. It looks like an RPG has
been brought to the fore of the ship.

00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:56.855
-I've told them if they see the RPG being pointed-
-We fire.

00:08:57.697 --> 00:09:01.343
Everyone on their toes now.
Sharp focus.

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:10.797
The biggest dilemma you encounter is probably
the process where you make the descision -

00:09:10.797 --> 00:09:14.084
- "this is how I want it done, this is how it will be".

00:09:14.084 --> 00:09:20.184
This is the goal. Because you have all
these other thought processes, "what if"-

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:23.848
- what if you consider the
situation wrong, what will you do.

00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:31.782
This uncertainty and doubt is something
I think should be there at all times.

00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:36.597
Not take anything for granted.
But this dilemma you experience, -

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:41.196
- are you sure of your descision?
Are there any guarantees? There aren't.

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:55.374
On the signal deck stands 22 year old Helene.

00:09:55.374 --> 00:10:00.590
She mans the HMG and has also spotted
the pirates bringing out the heavier guns.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.426
And she is complelely aware of the risk
of being in direct combat with pirates.

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:09.203
If I'm shot by something like this.

00:10:09.203 --> 00:10:15.924
In that regrard I'd be killed by something
I work the most with. Probably sounds psychopathic!

00:10:15.924 --> 00:10:18.235
It's my job and it's something I burn for -

00:10:18.235 --> 00:10:22.082
- and one of my reasons for applying
to the Navy was to hunt these pirates -

00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:24.680
- so when you stand in such a situation -

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.519
- I have achieved exactly what I want from my job,
and I know if I'm shot now -

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:36.833
- those at home know I was
killed doing my dream.

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:38.997
Short bursts! Fire!

00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:51.206
The massive fire is not having the
effect Carsten was hoping for.

00:10:54.106 --> 00:10:56.520
AK down on the deck.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.416
Two AK down on the deck!

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:00.472
Down the sides.

00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:04.183
One AK at the bow.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.017
Absalons sniper has shot a hole in
the boats single cruical water tank.

00:11:10.482 --> 00:11:17.452
Carstens next step is to ensure the pirates don't
flee in the two Skiffs on the deck.

00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:22.914
I want to take out the Skiff engines.
We can't fire on it just now.

00:11:23.757 --> 00:11:31.204
But we can fire a non-disabling on the rear
followed up by sniper shots on the water tank.

00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:33.157
Initiate.

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:37.508
-We got the gas tank?
-No, the water tank.

00:11:38.517 --> 00:11:41.898
I've shot a the gas tank
but nothing happened.

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:45.812
-A dolphin!
-Dolphin dolphin!

00:11:45.812 --> 00:11:46.691
Three.

00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:47.619
Two.

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:48.435
One.

00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:49.407
Fire!

00:11:59.974 --> 00:12:03.538
Suddenly happens what
the crew on Absalon fears.

00:12:04.484 --> 00:12:07.615
They are moving the
hostages out on deck.

00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:12.885
We'll continue laying close to it
and fire into their wheelhouse.

00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:15.587
AK in the back!
He's aiming on the hostages!

00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:23.002
Pirate Hunt

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:30.461
Absalon is engaging a hostile pirate ship.

00:12:36.443 --> 00:12:40.736
Despite numberous salvos both in front
and directly to the pirates boat -

00:12:40.736 --> 00:12:46.674
- there's no sign of the pirates surrendering to
Commander Captain Carsten and his crew.

00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:52.335
The pirates have just pulled their
most desperate and critical trump card.

00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:54.248
The defenseless hostages.

00:12:55.568 --> 00:12:59.030
They are signaling the
hostages to move out on the deck.

00:13:08.228 --> 00:13:14.635
Place the hostages visibly at the front.
Place them ahead of you.

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:26.729
In the operations room are the captain and his
colleagues unsure what the pirates are planning to do.

00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:31.735
Either the pirates want to surrender or they
want to use the hostages as human shields.

00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:35.995
Disengage safety.

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:39.924
We should get SMI in the boats.

00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:44.984
Looks like they are waiting out there but
let's be completely sure what's going on.

00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:50.566
Are they still standing with weapons?

00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:54.570
Yeah that's received.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.239
We're holding fire to see what happens.

00:13:57.239 --> 00:14:00.164
Go more to port,
those are the hostages.

00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:05.669
Can you go back?

00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:10.028
Carsten realizes the pirates
are not going to surrender.

00:14:10.028 --> 00:14:15.044
The hostages have instead been moved to
the water tanks Absalon just fired upon.

00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:18.246
They are not ready for boarding,
cancel the boarding.

00:14:18.246 --> 00:14:24.777
The top trained elite soldiers from the Frogman Corps
was ready to board the pirates and free the hostages -

00:14:24.777 --> 00:14:28.918
- but  the boarding is stopped, it's still
too dangerous to close in on the pirates.

00:14:28.918 --> 00:14:32.228
There's one behind the hostages now.

00:14:32.228 --> 00:14:34.117
I think the one with the
life jacket is the leader.

00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:44.949
They got more hostages gathered in a
group now. Hard to tell how many.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.339
Can we see a clear visual
threat towards the hostages?

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:50.620
-No.
-Good.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.010
The captain is now
in a dilemma.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:58.578
If the pirates start threatening hostages he has to
decide if they should try to shoot the pirates.

00:14:58.578 --> 00:15:03.882
He knows it could escalate the conflict and
put the hostages even more at danger.

00:15:03.882 --> 00:15:06.664
Basic dilemma is the hostages.

00:15:06.664 --> 00:15:10.734
We have the hostages by the Skiff engines.

00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:15.367
The target we can engage
is the water tanks.

00:15:17.508 --> 00:15:21.888
We can't fire on the Skiff engines
because the hostages are sitting there.

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:29.294
But we will fire into the wheelhouse to see
if we can't knock some systems out.

00:15:29.294 --> 00:15:33.786
While also giving continious fire
to the bow and stern, -

00:15:33.786 --> 00:15:36.944
- with a heavy machine gun.

00:15:36.944 --> 00:15:39.762
In order to always keep the
pressure on them up.

00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:43.638
Into the wheelhouse.

00:15:43.638 --> 00:15:47.937
The wheelhouse is just
aft of the machine room.

00:16:00.074 --> 00:16:03.793
No reaction on the hostages.
No reaction anywhere.

00:16:03.793 --> 00:16:07.744
-We're firing flashbangs.
-100% focus on what's happening over there.

00:16:28.107 --> 00:16:32.435
We keep up the pressure and
fire into their wheelhouse.

00:16:32.435 --> 00:16:36.380
Trying to take out lights
and power if we can.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.323
Fire at the bottom chimney.

00:16:39.323 --> 00:16:43.885
And eventually putting pressure on the leader
by firing sniper shots close to him.

00:16:43.885 --> 00:16:45.479
That's where we are now.

00:16:45.479 --> 00:16:49.781
-But then what everyone was hoping to avoid.
-Clearly aiming! Clearly aiming!

00:16:49.781 --> 00:16:52.732
AK behind the hostages,
he's aiming at them!

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.387
Reports that they are threatening
the hostages behind the Skiff.

00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:13.051
The pirathes are threatening the
hostages to get Absalon to stop firing.

00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:25.236
The Frogman Corps leader arrives at the operations
room to talk to the captain about their options.

00:17:25.236 --> 00:17:31.542
The one sitting between the Skiffs
aiming at the hostages. He's the leader.

00:17:32.074 --> 00:17:36.886
-Where.
-Here, he's running the show.

00:17:36.886 --> 00:17:40.028
??

00:17:40.028 --> 00:17:44.876
?? ??

00:17:44.876 --> 00:17:49.217
??
-I'll go up and take a look.

00:17:49.217 --> 00:17:55.801
The captain is about to decide if they should shoot
the pirates leader that is threatening the hostages.

00:17:55.801 --> 00:18:01.760
It's a serious desicion that could cost
the life of one or more hostages.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.097
Therefore he insists on getting
full overview of the situation.

00:18:06.097 --> 00:18:10.246
-Where the fuck is he?
-Between the two Skiffs.

00:18:10.254 --> 00:18:14.457
If the situation happens again...
That's him, he's running the show.

00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:19.246
-Can you shoot the rifle out of his hands?
-It will be difficult.

00:18:19.246 --> 00:18:22.700
They're sitting and
threatening the hostages.

00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:26.340
Can you take out the chimney?
Shoot it down?

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.082
Sure.
Can we fire non-disabling close to him?

00:18:30.793 --> 00:18:32.864
Carsten gives his orders.

00:18:34.074 --> 00:18:38.965
The Frogmen are going to fire warning shots
up close to the pirate threatening the hostages.

00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:45.465
The one that points the gun on the hostages,
we will fire non-disabling shots close to him.

00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:48.223
The way he's pointing at them,
it's kind of on-off.

00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:52.757
There's no constant visual threat.
And nothing has been called out.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:57.493
We will shoot the chimney and fire
non-disabling shots close to him.

00:18:57.493 --> 00:18:59.184
Then see what the reaction is.

00:18:59.184 --> 00:19:05.097
The captain instructs the Frogmen's to fire close
to a pirate that is posed to shoot the hostages.

00:19:05.097 --> 00:19:11.074
If he seriously takes aim and charges his weapon
then they can shoot him to protect the hostages.

00:19:11.074 --> 00:19:13.998
Clear constant threath.

00:19:13.998 --> 00:19:19.878
The dilemma, will you fire on a pirate
that's about to shoot a hostage -

00:19:19.878 --> 00:19:24.846
- that's a descision you have
to live with afterwards as well.

00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:29.627
That's not a question of law in my eyes,
it's a question of ethics and moral.

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:36.188
And really there are people in a very exposed
situation where they can't do anything.

00:19:36.188 --> 00:19:40.103
Am I acting correctly on their behalf?
Do I hit the right descisions?

00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:43.619
But you have to believe so.
That your choices are correct.

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:47.470
And just hope you also have that
little portion of luck with you as well.

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:55.998
Carsten remains cool. He orders the men
to fire even more on the pirates boat.

00:19:55.998 --> 00:20:00.077
This will show the pirates it has not helped
them to bring the hostages on the deck.

00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:04.877
-Do you see the gas tanks?
-Yes!

00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:09.586
Take the chimney.

00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:16.080
We're firing on the chimney.

00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:22.238
Tag the gas tank.

00:20:24.136 --> 00:20:28.956
Provide non-disabling fire
with the HMG to the bow -

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.253
- by the waterline.

00:20:31.472 --> 00:20:34.698
Five short bursts!
Fire!

00:20:37.238 --> 00:20:38.764
Up!

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:55.004
The pirates boat heels violently and it's hard
for Helene to fire precisely with the HMG.

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:59.246
At one point it strikes me I could really hit them.

00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:03.116
The distance I got was incorrect -

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:09.187
- so I could see my bullets fly straigth over the bow,
if anybody had been on deck I could easily have taken them.

00:21:09.187 --> 00:21:11.712
We have one AK among the hostages.

00:21:11.712 --> 00:21:18.175
Man with AK moving midship to
the Skiffs behind the hostages.

00:21:18.175 --> 00:21:20.358
Standing behind with AK.

00:21:21.376 --> 00:21:25.806
Man to the right behind them is armed.

00:21:27.462 --> 00:21:29.822
They're signaling something to us.

00:21:31.806 --> 00:21:33.134
No reaction.

00:21:34.911 --> 00:21:37.700
No reaction from hostag-
Wait they are waving.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.332
Telling us to go away.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.238
Some are waving.

00:21:43.442 --> 00:21:46.856
They are waving at us.

00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:51.958
The hostages are waving us away.

00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:57.114
It's something they've been instructed to do.
It's not their own idea.

00:21:58.757 --> 00:22:02.611
It's three hours since Absalon
fired the first warning shot.

00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:07.718
The pirates are still resisting. The captain
must now apply even more pressure on the pirates.

00:22:07.718 --> 00:22:12.223
-Close in and fire gas.
-That will also affect the hostages.

00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:14.817
It will go over.

00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:20.099
We are going to fire gas.

00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:25.265
We have AK's onboard.
We are closing in to 150 yards to fire gas.

00:22:26.488 --> 00:22:31.372
-Should we warn the hostages first in Arabic?
-The Somalis will understand.

00:22:31.372 --> 00:22:37.614
-But we could call it over.
-We can say we are now firing gas, surrender.

00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:43.161
Put down your weapon and surrender,
put down your weapon and follow our instructions.

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:45.575
Or hands in the air,
fucking whatever.

00:22:45.575 --> 00:22:50.427
But they have RPG on board.

00:22:50.427 --> 00:22:56.395
Should we get SMI ready at 150 yards?

00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:58.362
Everyone on their toes again.

00:22:58.362 --> 00:23:06.519
Be ready for what happens in
there when we come close.

00:23:11.232 --> 00:23:12.659
20 meters short.

00:23:17.798 --> 00:23:19.298
No effect that there.

00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:25.416
Short. He's aiming at the hostages!

00:23:32.772 --> 00:23:36.034
Suddenly there's commotion
between the pirates and hostages.

00:24:01.268 --> 00:24:03.627
The pirates are leading
men to the Skiffs now.

00:24:03.627 --> 00:24:08.969
Man with AK, blue t-shirt and red boxers,
they are walking towards port side.

00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:14.605
Pirate with his back towards us port side.

00:24:16.228 --> 00:24:20.569
The boat stops which could be a sign
the pirates either want to give up -

00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:23.064
- or further escalate the fight.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.200
-They're throwing weapons overboard.
-They are throwing something overboard.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.300
Calm now.
The bear hasn't been shot yet.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.420
But it's positive.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.620
A lot of weapons.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:48.475
Status is after long time pressure towards the pirates
and intensive fire from the machine guns, -

00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:52.803
- we've fired tear gas,
we've shot their water tank, -

00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:55.686
- and been firm with our display -

00:24:55.686 --> 00:25:00.308
- the mothership has now stopped and we can see
large amounts of weapons being thrown overboard.

00:25:00.308 --> 00:25:07.401
We can see there's been a desire to make
us think the hostages were about to be shot.

00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:14.713
But we couldn't confirm rifles being charged and
aimed at the hostages so we've had our suspicions -

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:18.729
- that they were close to surrendering.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:38.844
After a four hour duel the pirates
have seemingly given up.

00:25:56.681 --> 00:26:02.015
On the signal deck the 22 year old gunner
Helene relieved the fight is over.

00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:05.436
When they throw the weapons overboard
you think "Yes man! We succeeded!"

00:26:05.436 --> 00:26:10.850
Then you stand and relax a bit.
I gave a high-five to my ??

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.921
- because it was the highlight of the day.

00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:16.523
If you take a look over again,
see the hostages, -

00:26:16.523 --> 00:26:21.401
- you can see them
throwing kisses and praying.

00:26:21.401 --> 00:26:25.088
You can just see the gratitude radiating from them.

00:26:25.088 --> 00:26:29.460
You just feel good and you
know what you do is important.

00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:49.049
Even now that the pirates have thrown their weapons
overboard it could still be a dangerous boarding for the Frogmen.

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:52.526
Without the hostages secured
the situation isn't under control.

00:26:52.526 --> 00:26:56.987
And the next minutes will show if
the hostages joy and relief can last.

00:26:56.987 --> 00:27:00.674
Transitioning to SMI boarding.
SMI boarding team heading out.

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:15.505
Pirate Hunt

00:27:18.093 --> 00:27:21.923
On the Danish Warship Absalon has
Carsten Fjord Larsen and his crew -

00:27:21.923 --> 00:27:25.091
- just fought a four hour long
battle with desperate pirates.

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:31.500
Everything suggests the pirates have surrendered.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.243
But they are still together with 14 hostages
onboard the pirate mothership.

00:27:36.948 --> 00:27:40.988
This is the next in command updating the situation.

00:27:40.988 --> 00:27:43.242
We're going to board.

00:27:43.754 --> 00:27:47.050
The Danish Frogman Corps
is preparing to board.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:51.213
But nothing is certain until the pirates
are disarmed and the hostages freed.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.593
Over the megaphone the interpreter tells the pirates
to take off their clothing so they can't hide any weapons.

00:27:59.593 --> 00:28:03.241
Transitioning to SMI boarding.
SMI boarding team heading out.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.230
The Frogmen are specially trained to
pacify the pirates and free the hostages.

00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:17.203
The situation could quickly turn dangerous if
the pirates have hidden any weapons onboard.

00:28:18.244 --> 00:28:19.748
Everyone ready?

00:28:44.518 --> 00:28:49.697
If the pirates really have surrendered
the hostages will finally be free again.

00:28:51.471 --> 00:28:55.484
First the Frogmen will
secure the pirates.

00:29:25.379 --> 00:29:28.759
We get them to sit with their hands on
the head on the bridge deck.

00:29:28.759 --> 00:29:30.987
With guns and other things ??

00:29:48.947 --> 00:29:53.253
The pirates have realized the
game is over and remains calm.

00:29:53.253 --> 00:29:58.589
The Frogmen achieve control over the situation
and the next phase of the boarding can begin.

00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:01.388
Wire is free!

00:30:01.839 --> 00:30:04.534
The Military Police comes sailing in their boat.

00:30:04.534 --> 00:30:07.870
Send a message asking if there
is any activity on the Jelbut.

00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:11.167
They are standing with their
hands on their heads and are ready.

00:30:11.167 --> 00:30:14.692
-Copy that. -They are on the bridge deck.
-Starboard side? -Yeah.

00:30:15.308 --> 00:30:18.090
The Military Police is going to secure
the evidence against the pirates.

00:30:21.511 --> 00:30:27.317
And they are going to frisk the hostages to ensure
nothing dangerous is brought back to Absalon.

00:30:27.594 --> 00:30:30.516
Keep an eye on them from the back.

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:32.694
-First presumed hostage.
-Yeah.

00:30:49.857 --> 00:30:54.154
While the Military Police clears the hostages
the boarding team is now going to action.

00:30:54.154 --> 00:30:58.858
Boarding team prepare to launch.

00:30:58.858 --> 00:31:03.875
The boarding team is going to transport the
pirates and hostages back to Absalon.

00:31:04.592 --> 00:31:09.630
The pirates mothership has received so many
shots there's a risk someone's been hit.

00:31:10.287 --> 00:31:14.600
You will take the hostages first?

00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:21.805
Yeah that's correct, unless someone's injured.

00:31:21.805 --> 00:31:25.517
We will get the hostages over first and
then we will consider the situation.

00:31:26.945 --> 00:31:30.484
DJ who's the group leader for the Military Police
stands ready on Absalon -

00:31:30.484 --> 00:31:34.953
- to take care of the important task of receiving
the hostages thereafter the pirates.

00:31:34.953 --> 00:31:39.833
Kind of surprising really, just surrendering
like that, you wouldn't expect it.

00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:45.614
They are pretty calm now,
taken off their clothing as we asked.

00:31:45.614 --> 00:31:49.156
To make sure they don't have any
hidden weapons on them.

00:31:49.156 --> 00:31:54.279
But it went nice, no injured or dead as of now.

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:58.365
But they got quite the amount of shots.

00:31:59.028 --> 00:32:04.833
Don't think we will find any weapons, probably
threw them all overboard as we observed.

00:32:09.434 --> 00:32:13.489
Boarding leader Martin now faces
his biggest task during the mission -

00:32:13.489 --> 00:32:17.614
- as he is about to transport
hostages and pirates to Absalon.

00:32:25.004 --> 00:32:29.293
We're going to pick up the
hostages on Jelbut 40.

00:32:29.293 --> 00:32:34.973
Get them over and see if they are
alright and make sure everything is ok.

00:32:34.973 --> 00:32:37.771
Then we will get the presumed pirates.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.502
For the last four hours the hostages have
been unsure if they would stay alive.

00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:28.359
The hostages are very very very happy.
They've been trapped very very long.

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:31.316
They are really happy to be free.

00:34:01.031 --> 00:34:03.782
The first hostages arrive at Absalon.

00:34:03.782 --> 00:34:07.078
Here they are welcomed by an
interpreter and Military Police.

00:34:07.571 --> 00:34:11.825
Finally they can feel safe again
after two months of imprisonment.

00:34:27.608 --> 00:34:34.242
In order to identify the hostages DJ and the
Military Police makes sure everyone is photographed.

00:34:56.993 --> 00:35:02.610
The last hostages are sailed away from the mothership
and pirates that has trapped them for months.

00:35:35.755 --> 00:35:39.960
While the hostages are in safety and
receiving a warm welcome on Absalon -

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.436
- an entirely different welcome is
being prepared for the pirates.

00:35:44.872 --> 00:35:49.983
I would not want to be taken prisoner by those frogs

00:35:53.665 --> 00:35:58.681
Now we are going to bring over the pirates
you can see on the aft of the ship.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:05.735
We will do it in two turns with two boats
with two men as security on each boat.

00:36:06.611 --> 00:36:09.825
Then they will be brought up
on starboard side of Absalon.

00:36:09.825 --> 00:36:14.541
Be photographed and escorted
down to the cell area.

00:36:14.541 --> 00:36:22.042
When we get the pirates onbard you will
stay down here and we'll secure here.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.766
Have you received the last four?

00:36:36.345 --> 00:36:39.595
Yeah that's correct we have
14 hostages onboard now.

00:36:50.045 --> 00:36:54.641
The hostages will help testify so
the pirates can be prosecuted.

00:37:13.828 --> 00:37:16.617
Caution starbord!

00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:22.406
We are not gonna take any crap from these guys.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.940
We start by putting them here
and then we move them up there.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:32.400
If anyone puts their feet in there you just kick them.
We don't want them in there﻿.

00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:35.389
We'll sit here and secure.

00:37:37.882 --> 00:37:39.421
We will take them both up yeah.

00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:43.699
And if anybody tries
anything just deck them.

00:37:58.284 --> 00:38:04.694
While the hostages are safe on Absalon the
pirates will now be transported to the Danish warship.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.020
Yeah. Off with it.

00:38:44.843 --> 00:38:50.636
The Danish soldiers are intentonally harsh
and firm to keep the Somali pirates in shock.

00:39:05.772 --> 00:39:07.928
Last man.

00:39:21.853 --> 00:39:27.774
DJ and his Military Police colleagues are
responsible for the pirates onboard Absalon.

00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:37.593
Twenty-three. Is that the last one?

00:39:37.593 --> 00:39:41.492
-I think it's this one and one more.
-Shut up man.

00:39:41.492 --> 00:39:44.024
-They are many.
-That's for sure.

00:39:44.024 --> 00:39:47.431
 

00:39:48.118 --> 00:39:52.150
They don't say much as you can see.
They behave nice.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:55.716
So yeah...
Sitting here and enoying themselves.

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:21.779
DJ and Stine are happy with the
succsessful operation being over.

00:40:21.779 --> 00:40:24.646
-What do you say?
-**** it.

00:40:24.646 --> 00:40:29.982
-Didn't you do it last time? -Yeah but they were
just 7 last time. This is with hostages and all!

00:40:35.807 --> 00:40:41.818
When I transport pirates it's
just to turn on the grim face.

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:08.915
An action that has lasted
many hours is finally over.

00:41:08.915 --> 00:41:12.640
And in the operations room it is
time to evaluate the timeline.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.337
Without falling to self-praise.

00:41:15.337 --> 00:41:20.626
We can allow ourselves to say it went ok.
We made a difference today.

00:41:20.626 --> 00:41:25.376
What we planned was also what we executed
and the entire organisation worked well together.

00:41:25.376 --> 00:41:29.859
So it's a delight to say well
done and thanks for today.

00:41:34.195 --> 00:41:38.866
The roles have been switched. And while
the pirates are prisoners in Absalons cages.

00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:41.946
The hostages are allowed to feel like free men.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.757
For the last two months have the hostages
friends and family lived in fear of their fates.

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:13.858
But through Absalons satellite phone
they may finally know they are safe.

00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:19.067
Hallo. Good day Haji.
How are you?

00:42:20.794 --> 00:42:25.223
Hallo. Good day.

00:42:25.223 --> 00:42:30.452
Thanks I'm fine.
How are you?

00:42:41.873 --> 00:42:47.154
On the signal deck stands the 22 year old
gunner Helene with the satellite phone.

00:42:47.154 --> 00:42:52.873
She's had the most dramatic day of her short career
and is phoning home to Denmark to share with her father.

00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:58.186
It was a special experience, the SMI team
came over and they put the hostages out.

00:42:58.186 --> 00:43:02.631
We were looking at them and you could just
see their gratitude through their eyes.

00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:05.569
They were throwing hand kisses
and everything, it was super awesome.

00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:09.680
So we made a difference.
I was super happy.

00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:23.954
The Somali pirate groups
are now a mothership poorer.

00:43:24.859 --> 00:43:29.032
And the 150 men on Absalon
continue their Pirate Hunt.

00:43:30.795 --> 00:43:33.913
-I think you're lying!
-There was a fight in the cells.

00:43:37.967 --> 00:43:39.335
Hell ?

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:48.346
What they have done.
