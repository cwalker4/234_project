00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; You were really close with Sinatra.
&gt;&gt; As close as you can be, yeah.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.540
So why were you not part of the Rat Pack?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.368
’Cause I was too talented.

00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:08.746
[laughter]

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:17.133
How many years do we know each other?

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.436
&gt;&gt; Man, I know you a long time.
&gt;&gt; A long time.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.717
&gt;&gt; Plus, your cousin...
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:25.085
&gt;&gt; Solomon Griboff...
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the doctor.

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.232
&gt;&gt; was my doctor.
&gt;&gt; That's how I remember.

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.166
He ruined my baseball career.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.008
&gt;&gt; Did he really?
&gt;&gt; Yes. It was right before my bar mitzvah.

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:33.488
&gt;&gt; I lived in Long Beach.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:33.488 --> 00:00:35.032
&gt;&gt; You were a Queens kid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:38.412
All right, so...
It's right before my bar mitzvah,

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:40.016
and I'm small.

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:42.028
I have a brother 6-2, another one 5-10,

00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:43.584
and I get scraps.

00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:48.626
So your cousin, Solomon, says,
"Well, let's put him on appetite pills.

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:51.350
The more he eats, maybe he'll grow."

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.148
I get fat. I don't grow.

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:56.288
I burst through Robert Hall suits.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:59.700
So now he said, “Well, let's X-ray his hands,” right?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.860
And I'm thinking I could be the Yankee shortstop.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.680
You know, I'm 12 years old. Phil Rizzuto was 5-5, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.875
So he comes out and he says the thing that to this day has devastated me.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:14.151
He says, "Maybe 5-8.”

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.116
That killed me.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.448
Your cousin.

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:23.762
I didn't know that you grew up in Queens.
&gt;&gt; Jackson Heights.

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:25.800
Jackson Heights.
What high school did you go to?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.037
Newtown High School.

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:29.161
&gt;&gt; Brothers? Sisters?
&gt;&gt; No, just me.

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.566
&gt;&gt; Just you. Only child?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.081
I never knew that.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.203
Were you a funny kid?

00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:35.001
&gt;&gt; Well, my mother thought so.
&gt;&gt; [laughing]

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:35.971
&gt;&gt; This is great.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.254
&gt;&gt; Mr. Rickles will get the check too, thanks.
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.

00:01:39.254 --> 00:01:45.402
So when I started out, we had Catch a Rising Star, we had the Improv, there was The Comedy Store.

00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:47.384
It was a place for us to be bad.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:49.592
You know, to get our chops, to get our muscles going,

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:51.807
before we went out and started to get jobs.

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:56.285
Where was the first place that you said, “All right, I’m going to do an act. Can I get on?”

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:57.563
How did you start?

00:01:57.563 --> 00:02:00.719
Well, I was working in places right off the street.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.190
As I was doing my act, paper was rolling in...with a piano player outside.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.570
"Dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, Don Rickles.”

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930
And I would just talk to the people.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.623
&gt;&gt; So you put this act together...
&gt;&gt; I didn't put nothing together.

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:15.501
They said, "You’re on.”
And I said, "I'm on what?"

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.438
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; What was your opening line?

00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:18.354
Well like things like,

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:23.069
I'd walk out on the stage, look at a woman and say, "The dress is embarrassing."

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.375
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Right away?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.053
Look at the front row, I'm working a home.

00:02:30.302 --> 00:02:32.145
Look at the guy with the beard. You've got an hour.

00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:36.485
Jesus. He's sitting there like he has years.
You're going to die in the morning, for Christ's sake.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.739
Inherently, you're a wonderful man and I think that comes through.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.525
So when you do that...
&gt;&gt; That's very sweet, thank you.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:45.681
&gt;&gt; you can get away with stuff.
&gt;&gt; There was one guy — bad, bad guy —

00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:48.601
and he came to the show with his wife.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:53.555
And I said to the wife, "Yeah. Ooh, what, a bus hit her? What happened?”

00:02:53.555 --> 00:03:01.245
Show's over, guy comes backstage with her.
“I want you to tell her now that she's a dog. You made fun of her, huh?"

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:04.590
&gt;&gt; Ow...
&gt;&gt; "How would you like it if I come back here and break your arms?"

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.143
And my manager, Joe Scandori, at the time was related to, you know, a chain of people, you know."

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.886
Yeah. [laughing] A chain of people!

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.415
And I call him and says, "Joe, this guy is going to kill me."

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:26.503
And he had a voice like a bird. "Don't worry, sweetheart, I'll take care of it."

00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:29.348
&gt;&gt; [laughing]
&gt;&gt; "I'll take care of everything, don't worry."

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:35.410
It seems the guys in Brooklyn called and said, "Schmuck, Rickles is our friend. He could say anything."

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.179
&gt;&gt; That's a good chain of friends.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.552
[laughter]

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.319
Jilly Rizzo gave me a break in Miami Beach.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.151
Guy said, "You stink!” and Jilly walked over and said,
"[strangling noises]"

00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:47.691
[laughter]

00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:49.618
&gt;&gt; So why were you not part of the Rat Pack?

00:03:49.618 --> 00:03:51.597
Cause I was too talented.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.380
[laughter]

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.434
No, I...

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.780
I mean, I'm sure Peter Lawford was laughs, but

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.623
He was fun. He knew how to carry a casket.

00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:01.381
[laughter]

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:03.615
&gt;&gt; And Sammy?
&gt;&gt; He was fun to be with.

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:08.129
&gt;&gt; That was like a big break for me. I became his opening act for him.
&gt;&gt; Really.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.687
&gt;&gt; And that's where I starting doing him, because when you're in a room with somebody

00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:16.677
that infectious and that legendary...
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:20.565
You can't help but not want to start to talk like him, and I mean that.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:22.490
Yeah, I know, I always remember you did that.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.627
Yeah, and it became so exciting.

00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:28.173
A lot is made of the jewelry that you wear. I mean, it's just part of you.

00:04:28.173 --> 00:04:33.660
It's not like you're bragging or, you know, it's not an ostentatious...
&gt;&gt; They're fun!

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.640
&gt;&gt; They're fun.
&gt;&gt; They're fun.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.675
And they are a part of me because I can't get the damn things off, you know.

00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:40.864
But I love them! And this is very special to me.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:47.370
This is from Dick Clark for playing “Pyramid” more than anybody else has ever played the game.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.405
&gt;&gt; But not on television.
&gt;&gt; No, at home.

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:53.188
&gt;&gt; Just at home, yeah.
&gt;&gt; A dog, a cat, let's play a little bit.

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:55.173
&gt;&gt; House pets.
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:04:55.173 --> 00:04:59.078
Crackers, pickles, monkeys.
&gt;&gt; Things found in a barrel.

00:04:59.078 --> 00:04:59.854
Very good.

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:05.931
Schmechlich, albechin, Kichtachen, Schmelmin,
&gt;&gt; Things you hock up in the morning!

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:07.077
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:10.977
&gt;&gt; I would do Cosell, I would do Ali.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, you do them good, by the way.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:15.581
Hello once again, everyone, Howard Cosell coming to you.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:18.061
[applause]

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:22.197
Mohammad, Frazier was incredible. How did you feel about the contest?

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:25.767
[laughter]

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:29.158
Everybody's talking about Joe Frazier. Don't want to talk about you.

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.332
[laughter]

00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:33.109
You did a lot of impressions in the beginning.

00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:34.668
Yeah, we all did, yeah.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:38.652
But the early ones you did was Gable and Burt Lancaster

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:40.875
because your first movie was “Run Silent, Run Deep.”

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:47.843
Gable used to say to me, "God dammit, Rickles, let's go and have a beer. We don't need this.”

00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:52.665
But Burt, he was serious. “Learn about the submarine, learn about the engine.”

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:56.449
“Learn why the sub goes fast.”
[laughter]

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.321
The first time I met Burt Lancaster was at the Oscars.

00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:02.615
I tapped him on the shoulder, he turned around and, oh my God, it's Burt Lancaster.

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:05.562
He looked at me and he goes, "Have you ever been an acrobat?"

00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:07.924
"Because you move like an acrobat. I think you could be an acrobat."

00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:10.390
"I was an acrobat. I started as an acrobat."

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.300
Anthony Quinn, I loved him.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.060
He always used to say, "Uhhhh, where's the waitress, for Christ’s sake?"

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:27.062
And I said, "Tony, you can't keep eating with your hands."
[laughter]

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:31.338
You've seen a lot of presidents.

00:06:31.338 --> 00:06:33.668
You were born in ’26, so you see...

00:06:33.668 --> 00:06:36.555
&gt;&gt; Well, I did a show for
&gt;&gt; Lincoln.

00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:40.032
&gt;&gt; Washington.
&gt;&gt; Washington. Washington.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:46.347
&gt;&gt; The guy I was really close with is George Bush Sr.
&gt;&gt; Senior.

00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:50.440
&gt;&gt; He was like the back-up guy.
&gt;&gt; It's called the vice president.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.300
Yeah.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.499
The president's here, this is a big shot for me.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.200
Last night we had Bush. Well...

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.696
It was great. Did you see him and the wife after the show?

00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.465
He was in the lobby going, "Nobody knows me."

00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:01.980
[laughter]

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.892
I gave him a cookie, he went away. He didn't know what time it was.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:13.473
I won a thousand dollars in a bet about you. With Robin, rest his soul.

00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:16.908
We were doing “Comic Relief,” Robin, Whoopi and I.

00:07:16.908 --> 00:07:18.847
You graciously come on.

00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:20.728
We were raising money for the homeless.

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:24.291
And I say to Robin before you come out, because we were all so excited that you were coming,

00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:30.635
I said, "Robin, I'll bet you a thousand dollars, at some point, Don will slap one of us in the face."

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:32.521
[laughing] I remember that.

00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:37.597
And you come out, you kill the audience and we sold T-shirts together,

00:07:37.597 --> 00:07:40.479
and at the end of it when you said, "Am I getting out of here now? Can I leave now?"

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:44.027
and we said, "Yeah,” and you slapped Robin in the face.

00:07:44.427 --> 00:07:47.132
&gt;&gt; Take care of yourself.
&gt;&gt; You too, take care, and I'm glad the hair thing did well.

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:49.321
[laughter]

00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:50.782
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you want to know something?
&gt;&gt; What?

00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:54.492
I can't believe that you're Peter Pan.
[slap] Now, I'll tell you this...

00:07:55.123 --> 00:07:56.792
&gt;&gt; I called it!
&gt;&gt;I know!

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.997
[applause]

00:07:58.997 --> 00:08:02.904
And as we walk off, I'm basically almost falling down saying,

00:08:02.904 --> 00:08:05.368
"All right, give me the thousand, we'll give it to the charity."

00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:13.260
But could you have imagined that at 90, you'd still be great and still be out there working?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.320
Isn't that amazing?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.840
Well that’s very sweet of you, but..

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.683
You go out. How many dates a year do you do now?

00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:19.255
About 20.

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:20.653
And you go out with Regis a lot.

00:08:20.653 --> 00:08:22.055
Well, that's a mercy thing.

00:08:22.055 --> 00:08:23.800
[laughter]

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.835
You know I'm glad, I'm glad we did this.

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:28.529
&gt;&gt; Should we do this again?
&gt;&gt; You're not strong enough.

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:29.848
[laughter]

00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:34.205
&gt;&gt; Good things, Don.
&gt;&gt; For you, too, a happy and healthy new year.

00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:36.146
You too, Don.

00:08:36.146 --> 00:08:36.861
[applause]

00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.580
OK, we're leaving.

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:43.520
I really first became aware of Don on “The Tonight Show,”

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.322
when he'd come on and he just would destroy everybody.

00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:51.334
And then I'd see him on the Dean Martin roasts,

00:08:51.334 --> 00:08:53.991
and where everybody was doing prepared jokes,

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:59.678
he took everybody on with an attitude that was just hilarious and you believed him.

00:08:59.678 --> 00:09:06.893
He's the last of the breed of comics that inspired me to want to be a comedian.

00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:10.957
He was on a “Tonight Show” with Johnny and something died.

00:09:10.957 --> 00:09:12.867
A joke just sat there.

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:17.983
And Don said, "I feel like I'm a Jew in Germany and my bike broke."

00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:25.991
First, it’s just funny. But second of all, it's just so...

00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:27.913
historically accurate.

00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:30.261
What was harder than being a Jew in Germany

00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:34.672
and the fact that your mode of getting away from everybody is broken.

00:09:34.672 --> 00:09:39.056
You don't get a chance to speak to people like this very often.

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.190
What it do? It's your boy, big Snoop Dogg.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.901
