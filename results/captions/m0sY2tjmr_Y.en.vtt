00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.429
Let's talk about global warming then I want to get to the snowflakes

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.419
Okay, we were on stage and a woman got up and asked you a question

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.710
I thought good warming and you went on to explain why you don't believe in it

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.960
You said you changed you know, you said you got some new evidence recently. Yeah, what happened that night? Okay

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.890
Why did that clip go viral?

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.539
the lady

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.809
said I have children and you got a few bucks and don't you want I want to leave the world a better place for my

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.039
Kids essentially what you buy in you had a question. Yeah, it's fine. You know, yeah

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.499
I'd like my show. I want my children very much. But I realize it's up to them. It's not up to me

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.029
See, I feel like I said worse multipliers in the world. Yeah, but I don't have a Vietnam, but it's up to the individual

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.030
I can give you all the information, but if you don't pull the trigger and take action

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.149
so getting back to the lady and I said

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.159
Then I went through my store which is not a story Sally and I are in the South South Pole

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.399
2011 and were there and there's a big half a billion dollar

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.600
scientific

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.980
Station there. That's mostly funded by the US government and

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.459
The scientists came over give us presentations and they had that time they drilled five or six or seven thousand cores

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.339
In the South Pole not many people realize that South Poles on a mountaintop stir up about 12 13 14 thousand feet

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.509
so a lot of people suffer from oxygen deprivation didn't bother Sally and I and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.500
So he's going through these cores and then he says in fifty five thousand years ago

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.759
It was two

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.619
1.96 degrees

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.889
Warmer Celsius than today in it

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.930
Let's go back to that how do you know that and then all these MIT?

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.209
Caltech all these got all of that because of this equals and bullshit bullshit. We know from absolutely within a millionth of a percent

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.529
It was warmer, but no one's denying. No, no, no way. Okay and so on so and just we all know it's cyclical

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.419
Yeah, you know it's cyclic. Okay, and then what about global warming everybody? Laughs all at the same time?

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.369
It's a load of shit

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.379
I mean we could have predicted this

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.820
Global warming 200 years before but nobody did because nobody figured out a way to make any money out of it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.529
Okay, but when people talk about global or they're talking about the human being accelerated version of the warming no, no no, no, no

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.929
No, they say it has nothing the hairspray the ozone nothing zero

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.140
In fact, if you read Scientific American like the good MIT guy you are you would have known three months ago

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.539
They said for the first time in 40 years

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.080
The ozone what he called is thickened up again

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.530
Yeah

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530
the ozone has but that's a little different than

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.360
carbon dioxide emissions and they also said that we've known for at least 50 60 70 years that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.639
Every square meter on the ground on the planet has between ten and fifteen thousand times more energy from the Sun

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.250
Than is needed

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.630
Ten to fifteen thousand. How does it bury your closer to the Sun? It's fifteen thousand farther from the Sun ten thousand, okay?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.949
Okay, there's tons of energy on the tons and tons and tons. Okay the first electric car

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.089
Was in 1846, I believe I don't believe I know

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.970
1846 do you think if we really wanted fucking electric cars we couldn't have them it was thirty-five or forty years before gasoline cars

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.189
But now since then and then the question since Alan I went to the North Pole

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.229
Okay, God, let me a car thing is because the oil business and all that right? I'll get back to that go back

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.709
So then we go to the North Pole and now there's Russian scientists

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.470
Hardly anybody spoke English? Okay, and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.889
We've got remarried at the North Pole and we talk to the scientists and same questions same

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.640
Answers as we got from the South Pole and then well but warming they all laughed

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.170
Bryggen, both glow everybody's drinking when in the North Pole the Russians and Russians

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.160
Do you like to drink but go as they say and they're saying yeah, just a load of shit

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.410
Everybody knows it's a load of shit and we've known it for years

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.869
When I was in the energy business and forevermore, I'm beyond oil man. Ok, you are Noel man

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.010
Oh, man, everybody let everybody knew that when?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.630
When people will take more seriously global warming is when a Ramco

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.110
Saudi the kingdom runs out of oil

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040
Now two years ago

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.390
Aramco which is a

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.489
Petroleum company of the Saudi government and how they're going to go public

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.169
This is when oil was $28 a barrel. Now, why would

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.520
smart guys

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.370
MIT kind of guys say they're going to go like at the lowest oil price in

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.890
the last 3040 years

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.490
Why why hmm because when you go public and they're going to sell it they wouldn't sell 2% of the the company off

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.340
When they go public they have to report a reserve report publish a reserve report

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.719
Which means that for the first time in the history since they discovered oil there jay paul Getty discovered oil

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.630
They're back 70 80 years ago. They're gonna know

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.539
about plus or minus 10% how much oil

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.240
Saudis really have

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.730
Now I'm here to tell you

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.420
They have hundreds of trillions of barrels

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.230
They are never going to run out of fucking oil and your children's lifetime

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.500
Now

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.840
They've now pulled back and they've changed three times the date of the public offering

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.559
three times in the last two years now in

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.860
2019 looks good, but maybe maybe not

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.170
Will it the market dictate of course oil is up from twenty five twenty six dollars a barrel up to sixty five

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.170
Is she more or less?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.300
and

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.069
The they don't want to publish that number if they don't have to

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.620
the price I hear the price the the where the lines cross supply and demand for a

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.790
Ramco-4700 out as a barrel

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.240
Stabilized over two three four five years not one day

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.390
Okay, so I don't see one they're going to go public

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.999
because if they do they're gonna have to tell what the reserves are and you know what the price of oil is gonna do when

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.940
They say that there's 42 kazillion jillion barrels of oil

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.559
Gonna drop like a fucking stone. And so what does this have to do with the global warming? No, I'm because

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.890
Global warming is a an anomaly

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.719
Based on hyped up by this generation for something to bitch about

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.770
We've had it we had a 55,000 years ago

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.699
We had a 300,000 years ago, but to blame it on us is bullshit. Isn't it not accelerated by humans?

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.120
100 millionth of a percent who cares? So this is just a scam and a sham and all I'm jealous of vice-president

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.999
What's-his-face Gore Gore I'm jealous and Sally and I were on a plane with him a few years ago

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.470
He got in trouble because of the footprint, you know, the big G 3 he flies around or g5. I guess it is

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.800
And so he was a flying commercial. We're coming back from Peru

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.090
Lima and Sally and I are down there and some Safari and

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.380
I noticed why are these guys with fucking suits in here?

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.170
Business cuz they had no first class and so it's President Vice President Gore. He stands up and the

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.909
And he's not it's tough. You know, all these people that say there's six three I mean Jesus Christ

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.650
I mean, he's about your height and you know, everyone forty-six one. He's only six when he's about

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.670
Everyone says I'm as tall as you. Yeah, I'll tell you I'm six one. Okay, I'm not sick. No, no, okay. Okay and

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:32.600
So does Gore believe in climate change or is it all made up? I don't know. I can't speak for the former vice president

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:40.490
But he's got to know the same stats. I know now since then since the thing went viral because of your movie premiere. I

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.110
Had my crack staff do some research and

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.159
Then I double-check the research we found one air

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.259
And the you know how many people have been to the North and South Pole?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:01.309
Both since the beginning of motherfucking time recorded time

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.760
Come on, dude

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.130
Just you and said no no no no

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.080
I'm not counting the teams, but the lead people ten people plus Sally and I

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.750
Twelve

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:26.480
Since the beginning of fucking time, you know, how many of those other ten are bitching about global warming?

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.900
zero I

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.979
Can't wait I was supposed to be on a panel at George Mason University last March

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.740
First it was going to be a talk

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.580
I could talk about anything and then it wasn't there was a panel and then they wouldn't let me film it

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.480
So then I dropped out

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.480
But I was hoping global warming would come up

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.880
And so you're saying because you were at the south and you were at the north, I mean it doesn't make an expert

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.279
No, no, but I talk to the experts, okay?

00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:03.169
My analyst these fucking journalists are writing about this never talk to dick. I'm talking anybody. Nobody's asked me what I saw there

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.929
nobody asked me the solid scientist said I met with

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.899
Ya ten plus Sally and I and Sally and I are bipolar
