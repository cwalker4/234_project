00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.066
- I ALWAYS END EACH SHOW
BY SAYING

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.200
"BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER,"

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.633
AND OUR FIRST GUEST IS
A WAITRESS

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.833
FROM HENNIKER, NEW HAMPSHIRE,
WHO DID JUST THAT.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:08.766
PLEASE WELCOME SARAH HOIDAHL.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.266
YOU ARE A SERVER.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.266

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.133
- AND BARTEND AT...

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.466
- RUBY TUESDAY'S.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.466
- WHERE IS IT?

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.700
LET'S GIVE IT A PLUG.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.966
RUBY TUESDAYS WHERE?
- CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.500
WHOO!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.633
- AND HOW OLD ARE YOU?

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:24.766
- I AM 22.

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.466
- 22-YEARS-OLD,
AND YOU LIVE WITH YOUR MOM.

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.500
- I DO.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.733
- AND YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM.
- I AM.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.966
- ALL RIGHT,
SO AND YOU'RE--

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.733
SO THAT'S HOW YOU'RE
MAKING YOUR MONEY.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.800
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY OFF OF TIPS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.933
- MM-HMM.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.466
- AND EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE
WHAT YOU DID.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.700
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.766
IT WAS A REGULAR WEDNESDAY
LUNCH SHIFT I WENT IN,

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:47.366
AND TWO WOMEN NATIONAL GUARD,

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.133
THEY WERE IN THEIR UNIFORMS
AND EVERYTHING.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.300
THEY CAME IN FOR LUNCH,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.033
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO
DECIDE WHAT TO GET.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.466
THEY WERE LOOKING
THROUGH THE MENU.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.333
THEY SAID THEY WERE TRYING
TO KEEP IT LIGHT.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.133
THEY MENTIONED WITH
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.800
THAT THEY WERE FURLOUGHED,
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.700
THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.133
I--THAT JUST GOT ME THINKING.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.000
I WAS LIKE,
"JEEZ, THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.233
I'M A WAITRESS,
SINGLE MOTHER.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.866
I KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.300
AND I JUST DECIDED, YOU KNOW I'M
GONNA DO SOMETHING GOOD TODAY.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.700
I'M GONNA BUY
THEIR LUNCH FOR THEM.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.900
- YOU'RE GONNA BUY THEIR LUNCH.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900
SO INSTEAD OF THE BILL...

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
[cheers and applause]

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:22.933
I THINK WE HAVE A COPY
OF THE NOTE,

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.866
BUT IT SAYS, "THANKS TO
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN,

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.566
"PEOPLE LIKE YOU
THAT PROTECT THIS COUNTRY

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.566
"ARE NOT GETTING PAID.

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.566
"HOWEVER, I STILL AM.

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.566
"LUNCH IS ON ME.

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.800
"THANK YOU FOR SERVING, LADIES.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800
HAVE A GOOD DAY."

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
THAT'S WHAT YOU LEFT.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
[cheers and applause]

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.800
AND THEN THEY POSTED THIS
ON FACEBOOK,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.733
AND--AND THEN IT'S JUST
TAKEN OFF.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.533
EVERYBODY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.566
AND, I MEAN, THAT'S AMAZING.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:47.666
JUST ONE GOOD DEED,

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.533
THAT YOU WERE JUST HELPING
THOSE TWO WOMEN,

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.900
AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.666
- YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:54.666
IT'S MIND-BLOWING,

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:55.666
AND NOW I'M ON ELLEN.

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:59.300
[laughs]

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.433
YES!

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:02.000
OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S MIND-BLOWING.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.700
MY MIND IS STILL BLOWN.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.266
- SO HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE
THAT NIGHT?

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.300
WHAT DID YOU GO HOME WITH?

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.833
- I WALKED AWAY WITH--
WITH $8,

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.066
WHICH ISN'T EVEN ENOUGH
TO COVER MY GAS.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.166
[laughs]

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.533
- SO--SO THAT'S--
THAT'S AMAZING,

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.600
THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE A SON.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600
HOW OLD IS YOUR SON?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
- HE'S 15 MONTHS.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.766
- 15 MONTHS.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:25.933
- ASHTON.
- ASHTON.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:27.966
SO YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF ASHTON.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.866
- OH!

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:30.966
- PRECIOUS LITTLE BOY.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:31.966
- THAT'S MY BABY.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:33.066
- THAT'S YOUR BABY.

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:34.066
THAT'S ADORABLE.

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.333
AND THAT'S TOUGH.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.000
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIVING AT HOME
WITH YOUR MOM.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.700
AND I WANT TO--
HOW MUCH WAS THE BILL?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.866
'CAUSE I'M GONNA PAY YOU BACK.

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:41.966
- [laughs]

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:43.300
- HOW MUCH WAS THE BILL?

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:50.233
- I LIKE IT.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:52.133
I LIKE THE CAT.

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:53.266
- GOD, I HAVE SO MUCH--

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.433
I CARRY AROUND SO MUCH STUFF
IN MY PURSE.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:57.100
HERE IT IS.
OKAY.

00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:01.033
HOW MUCH?

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:03.200
- THE BILL WAS $27.75.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
- $27.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.733
ONE.

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:10.300
TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300
WELL, THERE'S 27.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.600
$27.75?

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.966
HERE'S 25.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:19.966
50.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.533
- [laughs]

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:24.333
- 60.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:26.300
WELL, JUST KEEP IT,
WHATEVER THAT IS.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300
- THANK YOU.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.300
- AND THEN--

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300
[cheers and applause]

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.200
FIRST OF ALL,
SO YOU'RE PAID BACK ON THAT,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.966
AND THEN I HEARD
THAT YOU CAN'T WATCH MY SHOW.

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:39.166
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.766
THIS IS WHY I HAVE YOU HERE.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:43.033
YOUR TELEVISION IS BROKEN,
SO YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO WATCH ME,

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.566
AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:46.000
- [laughs]

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.133
- SO I GOT YOU A BRAND-NEW
50-INCH INSIGNIA TELEVISION.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:51.133
[cheers and applause]

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.166
YEP.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:03:59.666
- OH, MY GOSH, THANK YOU.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.866
- AND YOU GET TWO OF THOSE
AND PUT 'EM NEXT TO EACH OTHER,

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:02.866
YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR LAWN.

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.333
- [laughs]

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:08.133
- THEN IT'S WORTH, LIKE,
A MILLION.

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.333
AND THEN, I AM COMPLETELY
OUT OF CASH NOW,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.266
AND I GOT TO MAKE IT
HOME MYSELF.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:15.566
CAN--ANDY, CAN YOU BRING MAMA

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:16.700
