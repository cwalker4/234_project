00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.530
Have you ever thought about what the world
would be like if it was a cube?

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.480
What would happen if you chose to live in
the water?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.140
Or what if every nuclear bomb in the world
went off?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.590
These are just a few of the crazy scenarios
in our latest installment of 10 Crazy ‘What

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.290
If’ Scenarios…

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.640
10.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.869
What Would Happen if all the Mosquitoes Died
out?

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.989
In many cases, losing a species is a bad thing
for an ecosystem because ecosystems are structured

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.230
like pyramids.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.890
If you take out a species on the low end of
the food chain, like frogs, then everything

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.280
that frogs eat will have their population
explode, whereas animals that eat frogs will

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.019
die off because there isn’t enough food
to sustain their population.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.140
What would happen if we decided to kill off
all the mosquitoes?

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.960
Mosquitoes are not only annoying pests, but
they are disease carriers.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.730
To name just a few of the more serious diseases
they transmit, we’ve got malaria, West Nile

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.300
virus, elephantiasis, dengue fever, and yellow
fever.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.320
On the other hand, they are part of the food
chain.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.180
Their larvae is eaten by frogs and fish.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.070
So would it be that bad if we killed all of
them off?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.120
Kateryn Rochon, an entomologist at the University
of Manitoba says not a whole lot would change.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.740
In the long run, the ecosystems will bounce
back because no animals or insects are mosquito

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.740
dependent.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.740
Awesome!

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.740
Yeah, we’re on board with this one.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.740
Let’s do it.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.720
Let’s wipe those buzzing jerks out!

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720
9.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.900
What Would Happen if You Lived in Water

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.460
Life on land has become too much for you,
and you think, ‘Screw it.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.240
I’m going to live in a giant tank of water.’

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.730
Would this be a viable way to live?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.030
According to the website Digg, which interviewed
a dermatologist, you would notice problems

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.390
within a day or two.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.520
Between the top layer of skin, which is called
the epidermis, and the middle layer of skin,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
which is the dermis, bubbles will form.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.440
These bubbles will burst and then your skin
will peel away.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.930
This is what happened to David Blaine when
he spent seven days in a water tank.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.039
When your skin peels, it will expose the dermis,
which isn’t meant to be exposed and it definitely

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.950
shouldn’t be exposed to the water you’ve
been living and defecating in.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.620
You’ll probably develop an infection and
unless you get help, you’ll die.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.620
8.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.340
What Would Happen if the Yellowstone Supervolcano
Exploded?

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.700
In the Wyoming section of Yellowstone Park
there is a supervolcano.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.270
The last time it erupted was 174,000 years
ago.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.590
What would happen if it erupted again?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.410
Of course, lava would ooze out, but that wouldn’t
be the biggest concern for people unless you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.640
happen to be in the immediate area, because
the lava probably wouldn’t spread farther

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640
than the park.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.450
Instead, ash will be scattered over 500 miles
and it will be four inches thick when it settles

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.920
on nearby land.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.310
The American Midwest and Pacific Northwest
would be hardest hit.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.880
Agriculture in the area would be devastated
and rivers would be clogged with gray muck.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.819
Gases like sulfur dioxide will also be spewed
into the air.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.680
Not only will this smell awful, but the gas
and the ash will block sunlight from getting

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.850
to Earth, which will cool that part of the
planet.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.490
This cooling could last for 10 years, and
it would alter the weather.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.490
The altered weather would lead to less crop
production, meaning there will be famines.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.040
In this ‘what if’ scenario, there are
two pieces of good news.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.760
The first is that this is very unlikely to
happen any time soon.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.810
The second is that it won’t be the deathblow
for humans.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.819
Our ancestors experienced supervolcano eruptions
and they survived, so there is no reason to

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.810
believe humanity wouldn’t survive this one.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.810
7.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.220
What Would Happen if You Exploded a Nuclear
Bomb in the Deepest Part of the Ocean?

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.920
If you detonate a nuclear bomb near the surface
of the water, it’s quite an impressive show

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.340
because thousands of gallons of water shoot
up into the air.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.010
But what happens when a nuclear bomb is exploded
six miles under water?

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.680
In their “What If” series, webcomic xkcd
answers the question of what would happen

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.209
if someone exploded a large bomb in the Mariana
Trench.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.459
The Mariana Trench is found in the western
Pacific Ocean and is the deepest part of the

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.459
ocean.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.280
The deepest known measurement is 36,070 feet.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.530
The explosion in the deepest part of the ocean
would be nothing like if you denoted it near

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.530
the surface.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.650
Instead, it will create a bubble that is about
0.6 miles across, and then the pressure will

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.050
cause it to collapse to it’s minimal size.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.780
Then it will expand again.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.130
It will do this three or four more times.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.659
After that, the only thing left will be warm
water and debris.

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.199
And, presumably, a lot of annoyed fish who
suddenly find themselves with superpowers.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.229
6.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.999
What if the World Was a Cube?

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:36.460
All large masses in the universe are spheres,
and this includes Earth.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.199
But what would Earth be like if it was a cube?

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.410
All the water and the atmosphere will be drawn
to where the gravity is strongest and that

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.580
will be the center of each face of the cube.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.419
In the center of each face, there will be
a large ocean.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.539
There is also a good chance that each face
could have very different ecosystems.

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.249
The edges and the corners of the Earth would
be rocky with very little atmosphere.

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.150
However, this cube world wouldn’t last very
long.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.999
Eventually it would start to round out until
it was a sphere, just like the rest of the

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.070
massive objects in the universe.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.070
5.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.490
What if the World was Flat?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.009
No matter what rapper B.o.B. says, the world
is not flat.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.770
But what if he was right, and the Earth is
actually pancake-shaped?

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.849
Gizmodo asked a few experts and the news isn’t
good for B.o.B. and the Flat World Society.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.279
Gravity would be an immediate problem.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.550
At the center of the flat Earth, gravity would
be less than it is now and it would be weaker

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.589
around the edges of the flat Earth.

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.939
Without gravity, we wouldn’t have an atmosphere,
so life on Earth wouldn’t be possible.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.930
We also wouldn’t have a magnetic field and
cosmic rays would prevent any life from forming.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.199
However, if we somehow managed to live on
a flat Earth, everyone would see the same

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.580
stars at the same time and we wouldn’t be
able to see the curvature of the earth.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.580
4.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.699
What Would Happen if the Earth Stopped Spinning?

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.080
Currently, the earth spins at 1,000 miles
per hour, but what would happen if it stopped

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.080
spinning?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.710
There are two possible ways that this could
happen.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.789
The first is that it stops spinning immediately.

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.580
If that happened, everything that isn’t
bedrock would fly off the earth and out into

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.289
the atmosphere, which would be one wild ride.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.729
The other way is a gradual slow down.

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.599
If the Earth stopped spinning over billions
of years, we wouldn’t be thrown off the

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:17.599
planet.

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.400
The Earth would be a much different place,
though.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.539
Days and nights would be six months long,
meaning a day would be as long as a year.

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.419
The Earth’s spin creates a centrifugal force
at the equator and this creates a bulge.

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.120
This bulge keeps all the oceans where they
are.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.129
If the Earth stops spinning, all the oceans
would go to the top and the bottom of the

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.339
Earth, leaving a belt of land around the planet.

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:43.689
Humans may be able to survive for a short
time on thin strips of the Earth, but without

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.330
the world rotating, the electric field that
protects us from cosmic rays would fade.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.559
This would cause Earth’s atmosphere to be
ripped away by the sun’s natural wind and

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.939
without atmosphere, we wouldn’t survive
for very long.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:56.939
3.

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.810
What Would Happen if the Moon Exploded?

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.159
On the dark side of the moon, an advanced
alien race drills deep into the moon and implants

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:06.210
a mindbogglingly powerful explosive.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.349
They take off, and when they are a safe distance
away, they detonate the explosive and the

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:17.650
moon explodes into several large pieces and
millions of smaller pieces.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.330
What would happen to us here on Earth?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.189
And why are those aliens such jerks?

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:24.849
We can’t answer that second question, but
we can take a stab at the first.

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.430
If you’re one of the 17 people who saw the
2002 version of The Time Machine, you know

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.879
it’s not good.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:35.849
First, the pieces would break up and form
a torus, which is a donut-like ring, around

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:36.849
the Earth.

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:40.699
This would make it very difficult for us to
leave the Earth, which is bad news because

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.279
we’re going to want to leave if we want
to survive.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:47.919
First, the small flaming pieces will rain
down on the Earth for the next 5,000 to 10,000

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:48.919
years.

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:51.659
It will eventually get so hot that the oceans
will evaporate.

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:55.009
So it’s a slightly bigger disaster than
The Time Machine.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.009
(Yes, we really hated that movie.

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.009
Come on, Guy Pearce.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.009
You’re better than that.)

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:01.229
The good news is that it’s nearly impossible
to blow up the moon.

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:04.439
We just have to hope that no rogue planets
smash into it.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:05.439
2.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.399
What Would Happen if Every Nuclear Device
Exploded?

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:13.020
Unfortunately, in the summer and fall of 2017,
a legitimate fear for some people is the outbreak

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.539
of nuclear war.

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:19.479
One question that inevitably arises when thinking
about nuclear war is what would happen if

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:21.370
all the nuclear weapons in the world went
off?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:27.060
IFLScience took a look at this question and
– surprise, surprise – things aren’t

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.259
good.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:34.390
According to the Federation of American Scientists,
there are about 14,900 nuclear weapons in

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.390
the world.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.440
A vast majority of them are in the possession
of Russia and the United States.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.029
Also, there are varying levels of power when
it comes to nuclear weapons.

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:47.500
Russia and the United States have thermonuclear
weapons, while a country like North Korea

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.069
has fission-style.

00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:53.131
One of the most powerful American nuclear
weapons is B83.

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:57.760
It’s as powerful as 79 “Little Boy”
atomic bombs – that’s the one that was

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.560
dropped on Hiroshima.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.519
One bomb would cause a fireball that is 2.2
square miles.

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:07.050
All buildings within 6.5 square miles will
be flattened.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.550
It will burn everyone within 162 square miles
to the point where their nerve endings will

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.560
burn off.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.540
50 to 90 percent of people within 8 square
miles will die from radiation sickness.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.920
IFLScience says that if the average device
possessed by Russia and the United States

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:30.019
is similar to a B83 and they were spread out
evenly and hit land, it would be devastating.

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:36.230
It will turn 90,000 square miles, which is
about the size of 295 New York Cities, to

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.230
dust.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.970
A fireball will also form and it will grow
to the size of 31,000 square miles.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.120
That is about the size of 3,700 Londons.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.650
Everyone who is in that area will be vaporized.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.660
Then there is the fallout.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.110
It will be spread out over 110,000 square
miles.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.120
If the wind is blowing and if it gets into
the lower atmosphere, it could spread even

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120
farther.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.870
For those people who weren’t wiped out in
the nuclear blasts, or survives the fire ball,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.459
or doesn’t die from radiation sickness,
they’ll have to deal with nuclear winter.

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:12.019
All the destruction on Earth would send up
ash, dust, and soot into the air.

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:17.810
This would stop solar radiation from reaching
Earth for years, possibly even centuries.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.519
During this time, the Earth will be dark and
without sunlight, and plant life will die

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.519
off.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:26.270
Most animals, including humans, will die off
a short time later.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.820
Hopefully if all the nuclear bombs do go off,
you just get vaporized.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.199
You’ll only feel a second of pain and then
nothing.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.750
Of course, you’ll also miss your chance
to be a real-life Sole Survivor.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.750
1.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.100
What Would Happen if Earth Lost Oxygen for
Five Seconds

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.470
Clearly, oxygen is pretty important to life
here on Earth.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.329
But do you know exactly how important it is?

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:47.960
For example, what happened if we lost all
the oxygen in the world for five seconds?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.350
You’re probably thinking, “Not too much.”

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.649
After all, you can probably hold your breath
for five seconds, so it’s not like you’ll

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:56.649
suffocate.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:11:00.920
But it’s actually much worse than that.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.730
Buzzfeed took a short break from telling you
which Friends character you should eat a taco

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.889
salad with to explain that if oxygen went
away during the day, the sky would turn dark

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:12.959
because sunlight reflects off oxygen particles.

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:17.490
Untreated metal would also instantly weld
together because a layer of oxidation is what

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.600
keeps metals from doing exactly that.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.870
However, we probably wouldn’t have time
to notice the metal welding together or the

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.079
sky turning dark because we’d have much
bigger problems.

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:29.290
Notably, the Earth’s crust is 45 percent
oxygen.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.139
Without oxygen, it would crumble.

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:35.920
Buildings would also be turned to dust, because,
you guessed it: oxygen is an important element

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920
in concrete.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.889
As for humans, you’d immediately get a sunburn,
because oxygen molecules help protect us from

00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:42.889
UV light.

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:47.180
Everyone’s ear drums would blow out, because
we’d lose too much air pressure.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.470
But, we probably wouldn’t notice because
the human body is up to 60 percent water.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.120
A major component of water is oxygen.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.380
Without oxygen, every living cell would simply
be hydrogen gas.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.100
Finally, the oceans would evaporate and all
the hydrogen, which was once you and every

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.930
living cell on Earth, would float into the
sky.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:34.409
So, basically… it would suck even more than
The Time Machine.
