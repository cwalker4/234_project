00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:17.520
We’ve never seen them directly, yet we know
they are there, lurking within dense star

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:32.430
clusters or wandering the dust lanes of the
galaxy, where they prey on stars or swallow

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.410
planets whole.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.650
Our Milky Way may harbor millions of black
holes, the ultra dense remnants of dead stars.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:56.940
But now, in the universe far beyond our galaxy,
there's evidence of something far more ominous,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.909
a breed of black holes that has reached incomprehensible
size and destructive power.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:18.830
Just how large, and violent, and strange can
they get?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:36.570
A new era in astronomy has revealed a universe
long hidden to us.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.450
High-tech instruments sent into space have
been tuned to sense high-energy forms of light

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:53.950
– x-rays and gamma rays – that are invisible
to our eyes and do not penetrate our atmosphere.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.880
On the ground, precision telescopes are equipped
with technologies that allow them to cancel

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.759
out the blurring effects of the atmosphere.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.280
They are peering into the far reaches of the
universe, and into distant caldrons of light

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.030
and energy.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.110
In some distant galaxies, astronomers are
now finding evidence that space and time are

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:32.170
being shattered by eruptions so vast they
boggle the mind.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.010
We are just beginning to understand the impact
these outbursts have had on the universe:

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:51.310
on the shapes of galaxies, the spread of elements
that make up stars and planets, and ultimately

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.959
the very existence of Earth.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:08.130
The discovery of what causes these eruptions
has led to a new understanding of cosmic history.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.880
Back in 1995, the Hubble space telescope was
enlisted to begin filling in the details of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.340
that history.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:29.860
Astronomers selected tiny regions in the sky,
between the stars.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:40.629
For days at a time, they focused Hubble’s
gaze on remote regions of the universe.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:51.270
These Hubble Deep Field images offered incredibly
clear views of the cosmos in its infancy.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.150
What drew astronomers’ attention were the
tiniest galaxies, covering only a few pixels

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.190
on Hubble’s detector.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.860
Most of them do not have the grand spiral
or elliptical shapes of large galaxies we

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.540
see close to us today.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:22.860
Instead, they are irregular, scrappy collections
of stars.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.819
The Hubble Deep Field confirmed a long-standing
idea that the universe must have evolved in

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:36.729
a series of building blocks, with small galaxies
gradually merging and assembling into larger

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.889
ones.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:49.439
You can see evidence of this pattern by looking
out into the universe.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.650
Many galaxies are gyrating around one another.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:03.990
Some are crashing together, others ripping
each other apart.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:11.189
Gravity calls the tune as these galaxies draw
together, exchanging stars and gas, and, over

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:21.300
time, merging to form larger composite galaxies.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.149
This came to be known as the hierarchical
picture of cosmic history, in which the universe

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:38.309
evolved from the ground up, with its structures
growing larger and larger over time.

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:50.580
A team operating at the Subaru Observatory
atop Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano examined

00:05:50.580 --> 00:06:00.210
one of the deepest galaxies known, whose light
has taken nearly 13 billion years to reach

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.389
us.

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.639
It was a messenger from a time not long after
the universe was born.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.500
This object is known as a quasar, short for
“quasi-stellar radio source.”

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.791
It offered a stunning surprise.

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:24.179
A small region in its center is so bright
that astronomers believe its light is coming

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:30.080
not from a collection of stars, but from a
single object of at least a billion times

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.389
the mass of our sun.

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:45.379
This beacon is generated by gas falling onto
the object and heating up to extreme temperatures.

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:51.400
The only thing known to generate this much
power is a swirling caldron, where space suddenly

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.580
turns dark as it merges into a giant black
hole.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:04.629
For astronomers, the question was: how did
this black hole get so big so early in the

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:11.289
history of the universe?

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:22.840
It likely got its start in an early generation
of stars, often known as population 3 stars.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:32.699
Made up of hydrogen, they are thought to have
been hundreds of times the mass of the sun.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:40.060
These giant stars burned hot and fast, and
died young.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:47.599
A star is like a cosmic pressure-cooker.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:53.449
In its core, the crush of gravity produces
such intense heat that atoms are stripped

00:07:53.449 --> 00:08:01.259
and rearranged.

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:07.819
Lighter elements like hydrogen and helium
fuse together to form heavier ones like calcium,

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:15.449
oxygen, silicon, and finally iron.

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:21.169
When enough iron accumulates in the core of
the star, it begins to collapse of its own

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:25.749
weight.

00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:33.610
That can send a shock wave racing outward
that literally blows the star apart in a supernova.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:44.310
At the moment the star dies, if enough matter
falls into its core, it can collapse to a

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:56.630
point, forming a black hole.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:06.750
The first generations of stars and black holes
burst onto the cosmic scene in a time of incredible

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.240
turbulence.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:20.020
Within primordial gas clouds, stars were being
born in dense knots.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:28.910
They gave rise to black holes that began to
swallow more and more matter.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:39.420
A computer simulation of the early universe
shows just how quickly these voracious monsters

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.959
were able to grow.

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:50.860
The project, by scientists at Carnegie Mellon
University, was designed to recreate a region

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:59.260
in the early universe that measured over a
hundred million light years on a side.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:08.350
It shows what took place in the first one
billion years of cosmic history.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:15.050
This virtual universe is set in motion by
equations describing the properties of gas,

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:21.300
the energy released in star birth and the
outward motion of time and space.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:28.959
The result: an intricate cosmic web, with
gravity drawing matter into filaments and

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:35.939
knots like a vast tangle of interconnected
spiders’ webs.

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:44.829
Inside the densest regions is where the largest
galaxies, and black holes, grew.

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:55.939
Here, circles indicate the appearance of black
holes deep in the data.

00:10:55.939 --> 00:11:01.900
As they gain weight, by eating up their surroundings,
the circles grow larger.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:10.649
A few, in the largest galaxies, reach ultra
massive proportions, billions of times the

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:16.839
mass of the sun.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:25.130
These black holes were not just swallowing
gas.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:31.230
The orbiting Chandra X-Ray Observatory was
dispatched to look into distant galaxies for

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.970
black holes on growth spurts.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:44.730
Scientists looked for pockets of gas and stars
glowing hotly in X-ray light.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:51.910
What Chandra found was that the core of some
distant galaxies countained hot pairs, twin

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:59.650
supermassive black holes drawn together by
gravity.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:05.700
Black holes by nature resist this dark marriage.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:15.509
As the two approach each other, they go into
an orbit that could last virtually forever.

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:25.540
To learn what allows them to merge, we go
back to the ideas developed by Albert Einstein.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.499
He said that when massive bodies accelerate
or whip around each other, they literally

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:41.670
disturb the fabric of space, causing it to
ripple like a disturbance on a pond.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:47.600
When these ripples move outward, they carry
with them the energy of the pair’s orbit,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.140
causing them to spiral closer.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.980
When this dance of death comes to an end,
that’s when the pair joins together to form

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:08.620
a larger black hole.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:16.290
That moment may be approaching for a quasar
called OJ-287, at 3.5 billion light years

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.269
away.

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:26.189
Flareups in the surrounding region have led
astrophysicists to conclude that another black

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:32.930
hole is flying around it.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:38.470
By measuring the giant's gravitational hold
on its companion, astronomers estimate its

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:46.339
mass at 18 billion solar masses.

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:52.529
For a time, OJ-287 was the largest black hole
ever detected.

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:57.430
It no longer is.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:04.620
Deep in the heart of the Coma galaxy cluster,
a mere 321 million light years away, lies

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:14.810
a giant eliptical galaxy known as NGC 4889.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:19.410
Astronomers used several large telescopes
to measure the speed at which stars are orbiting

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.620
around the center.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.870
They used that data to calculate the mass
of the central object,

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:40.959
a whopping 21 billion solar masses, give or
take a few billion.

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:53.559
Theoretically there are no limits to how much
weight a black hole can gain.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:15:04.490
And yet even the largest black holes, and
their host galaxies, seem to obey limits.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:10.279
What holds them back has to do with the way
clusters of galaxies evolve, a pattern long

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:19.120
noted by scientists.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:29.770
This computer simulation shows the evolution
of a galaxy cluster in the early universe.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:36.009
The gravity of the entire region draws small
galaxies by the thousands, along with great

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:42.069
streams of gas, into the center.

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:47.749
So why doesn’t the central galaxy, and the
black hole that resides within it, capture

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:49.769
all this matter?

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:56.399
Why don’t they swallow the entire cluster?

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:04.130
You can see the answer in a region called
MS0735.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.439
At two and a half billion light years away,
it appears in visible light to be a typical

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:15.119
galaxy cluster.

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:21.140
In X-ray light, you can see that it’s enveloped
in a cloud of hot gas, measured at nearly

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.139
50 million degrees.

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:32.630
Hollowed out of this cloud are two immense
cavities up to 600,000 light years across.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:43.670
That’s enough room in each to stuff 600
galaxies the size of our Milky Way.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.120
Now add in a radio image of the cluster.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.910
You can see two vast streams of matter pushing
out from the center.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:59.009
That’s a give-away that the cavities were
formed by an eruption in the core of the giant

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:01.430
central galaxy.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:08.780
Two jets, shooting out of a central black
hole, have launched blast waves that plowed

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.529
through the gas that makes up the inter-galactic
medium.

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:20.740
The 
energy it took to carve out these Xray cavities

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:34.140
is remarkable, the equivalent of several billion
supernovae, according to one calculation.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:45.660
In fact, this has been referred to as the
largest single eruption recorded since the

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.740
big bang.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:18:05.000
It was generated by a black hole that weighs
in at around 10 billion solar masses.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.570
Black hole jets like this have been seen all
around the universe, including in our own

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:17.500
cosmic neighborhood.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:25.011
This is the famous M87 galaxy, at the center
of the Virgo galaxy cluster, around 50 million

00:18:25.011 --> 00:18:31.390
light years away

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.870
Astronomers have been intensively studying
the black hole that lurks in its heart, and

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:44.810
recently estimated its mass at 6.6 billion
solar masses.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:52.919
It powers a pair of high-powered jets that
are plowing through the galaxy.

00:18:52.919 --> 00:19:02.470
But how does a black hole, a creature famous
for hiding in the dark, emit this much energy?

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:09.650
Think of a black hole as the eye of a cosmic
hurricane, kept rotating by all the stars,

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:14.750
gas, and other black holes that fall into
it.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:21.970
As this matter flows in, it forms a spinning
donut-like feature called an accretion disk,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.529
which works like a dynamo.

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:30.820
The spinning motion of the disk generates
magnetic fields that twist around and channel

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:41.860
some of the inflowing matter out into a pair
of high-energy beams, or jets.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:48.260
How much energy depends on the black hole’s
gravity, and how much matter has already crashed

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:53.740
through the event horizon.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.669
Is this just another frightening spectacle
of Nature?

00:19:57.669 --> 00:20:00.340
Or is it part of a more profound process at
work?

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.500
It shows that a monster black hole will not
be forcefed.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:09.030
The largest black holes in the universe probably
rose between 10 and 12 billion years ago,

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.650
the age of the quasars.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:20.730
By releasing energy in the form of jets, they
heated up their surrounding regions.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:26.470
This prevented gas from collapsing into the
central galaxy, and allowed smaller galaxies

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:32.500
on the periphery to form and grow.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:39.600
But the impact the black holes did not stop
there.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.840
This Chandra image of the Hydra A galaxy cluster
shows the same immense hot cavities, glowing

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:56.120
in X-ray light, as well as a jet blasting
out of its central galaxy.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.870
Gas along the edge of the jet was found to
contain high levels of iron and other metals

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:11.200
probably generated by supernova explosions
in the center.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.330
By pushing these metals into regions beyond,
a black hole seeded more distant galaxies

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:26.600
with the elements needed to form stars and
solar systems like ours.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:37.600
The black holes in these more remote galaxies
then seeded their own environments.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:57.690
This is what might be happening in Centaurus
A, also known as the “hamburger galaxy.”

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:02.600
Peering through the dense dust lanes that
dominate our line of sight, astronomers have

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.940
come to believe that it’s actually two galaxies
in the act of colliding.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.830
In X-rays, you can see a jet erupting from
the center.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:18.539
This computer simulation shows the effect
of such a merger on black holes.

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:25.360
As the two galaxies pass by each other, the
pull of gravity disrupts their spiral shapes,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:33.919
forcing huge volumes of gas into their cores.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:39.870
As the black holes begin to feed, they emit
blast waves that push much of the loose gas

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:47.899
out beyond the boundaries of the new galaxy.

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:54.940
In the final steps of this cosmic dance, the
two black holes merge, and emit one final

00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:00.250
blast.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:08.029
To think that our Earth, our solar system,
ourselves are the beneficiaries of these far-away

00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:13.850
monsters.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:26.429
The largest black holes have played dual roles
in a great cosmic struggle.

00:23:26.429 --> 00:23:33.570
They are the product of gravity’s relentless
inward pull, the force that has drawn matter

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:50.110
into galaxies, clusters, and the structures
they form.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:59.250
But with their incredible power, they emit
energy that pushes back on gravity.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:11.149
In so doing, these strange and powerful objects
have become the master architects of space

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:33.130
and time.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:54.950
