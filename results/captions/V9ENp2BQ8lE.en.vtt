shopping on its marketplaces and tens of

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.230
millions of businesses selling their

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900
products the company has directly and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.570
indirectly employed more than or created

more than 30 million jobs and Jack says

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.470
the company is just getting started

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.510
he has ambitions of creating a hundred

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.269
million jobs and reaching 2 billion

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.519
people Jack also has a long history with

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.920
the World Economic Forum he first came

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
to Davos in 2001 as a young global

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
leader he sits on the board of the World

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.570
Economic Forum and he recently joined

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
the board of global shapers we are so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
lucky to have Jack with us here today

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
thank you so much for making time for

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.059
the young communities within Davos and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:59.309
can I please ask everyone to join me in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:01:01.590
giving Jack a very warm welcome we have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.719
global shapers young global leaders and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.129
technology pioneers in the room we're

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.450
all really looking forward to asking

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.880
some questions so I'll just kick off

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.740
with a few first please so you ended

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.470
your interview last year by saying we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
really need to pay attention to people

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.640
who are 30 years old to the next 30

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.100
years and to companies that have less

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.020
than 30 employees I turned 30 last year

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.180
so it was particularly welcome to hear

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
this and I think for many people in the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.320
room they meet one or two of those

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.909
categories so in light of that what are

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.229
you most looking forward to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.299
and most scared of in the next 30 years

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.720
yeah we people are very lucky

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.270
because we are in the area that the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.549
world is in a very big transformation

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.220
because of the chip technology I think

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.170
we read a lot of on the books that 200

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
years ago when the first industry have a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.060
lot of great people and then a hundred

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.409
years ago

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.630
electricity revolution camp a lot of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.540
success people so now the technology

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.259
come this new technology will also

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.190
create a lot of successful people

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.380
interesting careers but honestly every

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.700
technology craft were average income is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.680
create a lot of social problems and my

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.190
view is the first a technology

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.710
revolution cause the first world war ii

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.760
technology love lucy' red cuff the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.970
second world war

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.340
now we under third so what what it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.070
gonna happening people worry about

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.020
artificial intelligence people worry

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.360
about robots people worry about a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.350
computer and datas and privacy

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.930
insecurities people start to worry but

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.630
whether you're worried it will come you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.530
don't worry it comes so the thing is how

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.380
you change yourself so I I think next to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.900
30 years the world is going to be a huge

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.660
change if there is a third world war

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.380
I think the world war should be a wall

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.140
against the disease a war against

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.010
environment pollution a war against the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.250
poverty together which another war

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.860
against ourselves but if we do not see

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.900
clearly that using the new technology to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.750
solve this problem if we do not unite

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.300
align together with human being gonna

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.010
fight each other because every

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.960
technology revolution will make the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.300
world unbalanced when something

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.190
unbalanced coming somebody used to be

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.660
number one suddenly began number two as

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.060
somebody was number three and then

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.240
become number one it's all about

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.930
comfortable so we people if you're 30

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.620
years old my my view is if when you have

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.440
20 to 30 years old you should follow a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.860
good boss join a good company to learn

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.090
how to do things properly

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.760
when you're 30 to 40 years old if you

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.910
want to do something yourself just do it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.740
you're sticking afford to lose to fail

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.860
but when you're 40 to 50 years old my

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.940
suggestion is that you should do things

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.740
that you are good at right and not do

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.910
things that oh that's very interesting I

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.760
want to try something new

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.989
it's be dangerous more when you're 50 to

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.940
60 years old

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.340
spending time training and developing

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.980
young people the next generation when

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.950
you'll see over 60 years old better stay

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.380
with your grandchildren mm-hmm but this

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.970
is normally general like that not

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.040
everybody like but most of the people

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:42.410
were looked at so 30 years old we people

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.660
next to 30 years are they lucky stay

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.700
pure we're a lot of challenges a lot of

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.330
things that's happening and with our

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.190
knowledge with our physical power it's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.580
time you need to change you have to

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.710
think we oh if you want to be successful

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.080
tomorrow it's impossible if you want to

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.560
be successful a year later it's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.980
impossible but if you want to win 10

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.280
years later you have chance that is what

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.220
I think wonderful and moving on to a

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.669
topic which is kind of impossible to

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.320
ignore after 2017 so aside of all the

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.750
people in leadership positions in

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.060
Alibaba are women but the picture

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.590
elsewhere is is a bit more bleak and a

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.380
friend of mine recently said something

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.900
that has really stayed with me women are

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.560
tired of empowerment programs and we

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.510
want power in 2016 venture capitalists

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.479
invested fifty eight point two billion

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.130
dollars in male founded companies while

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.810
women received just one point four six

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:47.150
billion and as 2017 showed it was a year

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.979
of sexual harassment scandals the gender

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.710
pay gap still exists and unfortunately

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:54.110
the list does go on so how do you think

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.350
we can move beyond tokenistic gestures

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.080
towards genuine gender equality yeah

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.250
that is very interesting a few years are

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.820
like four years ago there is journalists

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.300
are came to our

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.100
company and when he leaves he asking me

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.340
pressing why there are so many women in

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.990
your company and I never realized we

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.320
have so many women in our company I said

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:25.500
anything wrong today we have a 49% close

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.260
49% of the employees of our company a

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.260
woman that's a lot for a high-tech

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.630
company it's not on purpose to a high

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.780
woman we think they are great in helping

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.050
us to grow Alibaba is an e-commerce

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.570
company ecommerce is a service industry

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.540
to serve people better you have that you

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.620
should have a surf hop service part we

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.950
find that women doing much better jobs

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:57.300
than men and the second is the last

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.980
century people compete because muscle no

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:04.290
not this century is not much as the

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.790
wisdom and next is I believe if a person

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.020
want to be successful we should have a

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:14.040
high EQ but if you don't want to lose

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.990
quickly you should have a high IQ but if

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.790
you want to be respected you should have

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:24.830
have high lq the queue of love so those

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:28.830
three queues put together a lot of men

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:32.670
they have a high IQ below EQ on a very

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:36.750
tiny lq women balance wise they're the

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:39.900
best if you want your company to be

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:44.460
successful if you want your company to

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:47.430
operate with wisdom with cared wonder is

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:51.390
the best in my company and we noticed

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:54.750
that women they care others much more

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:56.970
than men even our site today our

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.490
shopping site ecommerce we found a woman

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.320
buy a lot of things but they buy for

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.940
their husband their parents their kids

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:08.040
may only buy for themselves mostly

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:14.730
because you care that make you the

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:18.240
difference so we have a 49 percent of

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.230
the the colleagues in the company of

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.560
women

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:25.470
and close 37% of the senior management

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:29.010
of women we never feel anything wrong

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.380
and women they they they sacrifice more

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:36.720
that when they they love it they believe

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:40.530
it they continue to do it so I think the

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.840
very one of the secret sauce for Alibaba

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.000
to be successful it was successful in

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.550
the past 18 years because we have so

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.760
many women colleagues and the other

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:53.400
thing is that with you so proud and you

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.470
know most of the time you see I go out I

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.560
never realized that when we can't always

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:02.070
50 percent of women with my delegation

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.630
my team because we never think they're

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.530
women do we think their great big

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.030
colleagues know if you try to say now

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.490
we've got a too many man's and we do

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:15.060
have to put some women inside oh that's

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.310
a disaster for both side so what would

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.350
your advice be to companies that operate

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.570
a little bit more on that quote of a

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.400
system but seem to be not making

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.440
progress or not having such kind of

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.970
representation when you have a porter

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.720
base to have you must have a lot of

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:34.380
women you will never reach that I think

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.990
I'm if a company for a man trust me

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.790
this company cannot be sustainable

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:43.230
cannot keep on growing because just like

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:47.130
a stew if you don't put what inside this

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:49.230
do is too tough is easy to break so when

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.930
you have a woman amending in the same

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.300
company when something happened the

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.460
women are the for example one of the

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.140
valley for our company is that the

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.300
number one value is custom number one

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.120
being pride number to share whole number

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.830
three this is everywhere I go Wall

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.080
Street did not like my point but this is

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.150
what I said you know if you if you if

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.980
you like us investing us if you don't

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.380
like us please sell our stocks don't buy

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.870
us you believe custom number one in

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.150
pride number two Cheryl number three but

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.310
when man start when we start to compete

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.850
man suddenly get very angry and you know

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.200
this that and women are always come up

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:28.200
no competition let's think about

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.230
customer number one most of the women

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.870
they believe in the first day dream of

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.779
first day love

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:39.440
the man easy to forget I'm sorry it's

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:41.930
did not say bad about man this is C this

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.650
is statistic this is why our company

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:50.740
worked the balance and it's naturally

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:53.720
happening it's not like a week but so a

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:59.960
lot of people have a tendency nag is

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:02.089
better in doing things but we don't we

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.130
think that even if man is a better we

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:05.870
still have to hide the woman inside and

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.600
then the women have enough women women

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:11.630
will hire people more so this is how we

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.640
did it so I don't know how many high

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:17.210
tech companies in the world like us

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.820
49% colleagues are women who feel proud

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.920
of for that as you should be and I think

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.870
it's a very strong message to send out

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.330
to like I say other companies that have

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.650
a range of reasons for why that's why

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.630
that's not the case but clearly you've

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.430
been able to build the most successful

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.890
one with with that being with that being

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.870
so so you just came off stage after

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.240
giving a talk about digital ecommerce

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.550
and what needs to happen for small

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.650
businesses and entrepreneurs to benefit

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.720
from globalization at a time when

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.339
globalization once again is being

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.870
questioned is it really delivering for

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:50.660
the most vulnerable is it delivering for

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.120
people in the global south etc so what

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.279
is your message to people in this room

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.560
kind of about globalization really I

00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:02.959
think globalization cannot be stopped

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:06.410
nobody can stop globalization nobody can

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:09.199
stop trade and I believe if trade stops

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:13.069
war stuff

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:17.420
trade is the way to solve the solve the

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:19.999
war not cause the wars i think

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:23.119
globalization to the fantastic jobs in

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:27.259
the past of 30 years being rich lot of

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:29.929
countries but of course caused a lot of

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:32.600
problems right young people did not have

00:12:29.929 --> 00:12:35.029
opportunities small business have done

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.209
opportunities development developing

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:42.709
countries were neglected but it's only

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:46.009
30 years it's a baby it's a grow you

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:49.189
have to improve it if you try to improve

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:52.279
it then you kill it's easy most of the

00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:53.569
time to kill something is much easy so

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:56.480
my beliefs

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:59.419
it's our generations job today we have a

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.720
better technology we have a better

00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:07.480
knowledge about a globalization and it's

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:11.449
our generations responsibility or

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:15.559
opportunity to improve it tell me how

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:19.399
can you stop globalization now after

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:23.689
fish intelligence come robots come my

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:27.559
grandfather worked 16 hours a day and he

00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:32.290
said he was very busy we work eight

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:35.989
hours a day we said we are very busy our

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:38.809
children may only work three hours of

00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:41.709
four hours a day for three days a week I

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:44.749
bet they would say oh we're very busy

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:48.259
then when you work only three hours a

00:13:44.749 --> 00:13:51.829
day and four days a week we're gonna do

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:54.499
you're going to travel around right you

00:13:51.829 --> 00:14:00.499
cannot stay in the home for a week you

00:13:54.499 --> 00:14:02.370
would travel 30 years ago normal life

00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:06.689
you visit

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:08.279
20 to 30 cities for your life 30 years

00:14:06.689 --> 00:14:10.249
later in your life

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:14.279
you have visited 300 cities in your life

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:17.970
because of mobile okay stop it it's

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:20.910
impossible so thinking about that the

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.959
only thing is to improve it to make it

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.449
simple

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:27.509
global trade should be simple should be

00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:30.360
modernized should giving inclusive

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:32.670
everybody had the opportunity so my

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.980
strong message is that well I feel sorry

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.920
for WTO they did a great job but in the

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.230
past 20 years when you put a 200

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.160
government and ministers in a one room

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:46.259
how can they agree on something right

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.029
because I don't like your country no

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:51.540
matter how good suggestion you have I

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:53.550
said no but business people even if we

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:57.889
put 200 business people in the one room

00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:01.519
we will surely agree on something and

00:14:57.889 --> 00:15:04.139
this is what I believe the next

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:07.139
generation of globalization should be

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:09.529
inclusive should create opportunities

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:13.230
for young people to get involved

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:17.929
the first globalization in a human

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:23.699
history was controlled by few kings and

00:15:17.929 --> 00:15:27.360
emperors last 30 years globalization was

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:29.730
controlled by 60,000 big companies if

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.100
you're not amount of big companies if

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.410
you're not in the big powerful countries

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:41.100
you don't have chance the next 30 years

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:46.199
I bet we will be we will have 6 million

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:49.499
or 16 million or 16 minute companies get

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:53.629
involved the globalization and I am sure

00:15:49.499 --> 00:15:53.629
we will make it happen

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.439
together with a lot of people maybe with

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.110
you with the mobile phone if people

00:15:58.439 --> 00:16:03.029
still using mobile phones 30 years later

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:06.809
with a mobile phone you can global by

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:09.149
you want to buy something from Kenya you

00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:12.299
just click you want to buy something

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:14.759
from Norway you click global by global

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:16.050
cell if your small thing without

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.760
internet you can only

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:21.620
cell in your village or small town today

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:25.649
can sell across world and global pay

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.480
global delivery and girl will travel the

00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:30.660
only thing you have to bring is a mobile

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:34.320
phone no not even passport this is going

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:37.290
to happen in ten years and this is the

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.440
message let's catch this opportunity if

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:44.339
you complain the other people catch it

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:49.829
if you catch the opportunity embraced it

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:52.140
now you will be the next Alibaba people

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:56.519
like me I was born in a very poor family

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:58.410
I never got a great education I filled

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:01.920
all the examinations for what reason I

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.779
don't know but later I realize I don't

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.640
have money I don't have technology I

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:07.319
don't have a lot of good backgrounds

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.079
where we have a rich uncle or something

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:12.360
no they only start competing with my

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.760
people then young people's let's compete

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.079
it for ten years later this is what I

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.329
believe ten years later will be

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.370
happening so everything I do for that

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:22.410
goal I know

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:24.959
ten years later this thing is going to

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.939
happen so prepare for that because I

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:30.510
know if I compete with him for next

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:33.570
Mouse no chance so this is how my

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.450
message it's up it's a challenge but

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:39.419
it's opportunity and it's the

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:42.030
opportunity for people like us this

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:46.440
world the most difficult of thing is to

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:48.210
convincing a successful people wait tell

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.620
him this is a great opportunity to

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.780
nananananana

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:56.730
forget it right I've been doing this for

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:58.710
30 years but for people like us we're

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.500
looking for opportunities in order to

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:05.429
survive so we will do anything to be

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:07.770
creative so this is the message 30 years

00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:11.460
it's opportunity for us it's a challenge

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:15.230
for those people who are 60 years old if

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.230
they're 60 years old

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:22.020
and that discrimination but it's it is

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.640
tough for them and maybe says something

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.710
about how we need to look at government

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.650
as well in terms of more young people

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:31.800
entering and doing policymaking so if

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.690
there are these six or 16 or 60 million

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.120
businesses and we're all kind of hyper

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.090
connected on a more fundamental level do

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.860
you think consumption is making us happy

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.870
consumption what I mean consumption by

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.610
making us happy

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.500
through through consuming are we

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.630
becoming happier through being more

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.270
connected is that genuinely yeah of

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:53.610
course consumption were makin some

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.010
definitely we're not happy right but if

00:18:53.610 --> 00:19:00.240
their consumption may not be the thing

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:02.130
is that for me people like me people say

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.460
Oh Jack you're very rich no but I don't

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:08.010
have time to spend money and I know this

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.600
money that does not belong to me when I

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:13.980
have a one minute to minute it's my

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.570
money but we have 20 minute problem

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.700
comes you think the u.s. daughters who

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.860
gets the valley or Ingrid porn and the

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.010
stock market is gonna problem when

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.620
you're over 1 billion daughters that is

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:28.860
the responsibility because the society

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:31.230
trusted you can manage the money better

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.230
if you think that it's your money you'll

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:37.080
get into trouble this is what I always

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:40.140
believed that's the how can a person

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:44.160
have a you know 2000 I make two billion

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:47.130
dollars no matter how hard we hop harder

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.110
your work you should not get to be an

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.150
out 2d billion the many people put on

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.770
you it's the trust and credit you have

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.420
so you should have spent a money better

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.270
than government you should spend money

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:01.860
better than the other people spend money

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:04.650
on the right places so consumptions yes

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:07.530
and I can service industry let me tell

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:10.820
you one thing the AI robots is going to

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:15.690
kill a lot of jobs because in the future

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:18.410
machine but there will be we have to

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.580
create more than service industry

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:23.840
service industry is going to have

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:27.450
services got a lot about consumptions so

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.290
doing the consumptions service industry

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:35.320
has huge hope but

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:37.930
have to do uniquely I think from that

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:42.010
slightly philosophical point we can turn

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:44.830
to the floor for questions so if you if

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:46.600
you could please introduce yourself say

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.580
where you're from please keep your

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.890
question six sinks so we can take as

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:54.490
many as possible and relevant for the

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:56.730
whole group great so would you like to

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.730
go first

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.480
hi my name is Parv I'm a global shaper

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.740
from Chicago and you just talked about

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.420
philanthropy and I'm curious if you

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.760
could talk about how you see your role

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.350
is changing in in the giving space

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.740
particularly given the fractured world

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.740
we live in

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:20.220
yep I think for alpha P P it's not about

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:24.840
helping others is about helping yourself

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:26.920
I had a huge debate with my colleagues

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.950
several years ago there's a big

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:34.960
earthquake in China and there versus big

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:38.890
earthquake in Japan so I thought we we

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.020
donated like a I forgot that we exempt

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:44.530
like a twenty thousand dollars to Japan

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.640
ten fifteen dollars to China and people

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.620
say why we don't know that little

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:52.600
because we are you know we have a lot of

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:54.940
money and my point is no matter how much

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.380
money you donate two minutes twenty

00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:00.450
minutes that money compared to that

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.090
we cannot change a lot of things there

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:05.130
the thing you donate because you change

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:08.420
yourself when you change the world is

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:10.970
changing you have to change yourself

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.800
right and the next thing is that

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:16.820
philanthropy is about action it's about

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.050
involvement it's not about giving money

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:27.180
it's about a wake-up of people's

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:30.570
consciousness so I think to me I grow up

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.110
and my globalization is grew up in this

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.930
place

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:36.510
2,000 year 2001 when I was nominated as

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:39.000
a young global leader I had no idea what

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:41.970
he's Devil's where is that is it and

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.820
what what is about a young global leader

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:47.160
but I came here I learned I listen about

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:50.010
these Capri the city of global

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:54.390
citizenship and mobilization all things

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:57.750
I grow up I interstates this is to make

00:22:54.390 --> 00:23:01.950
France appear this has changed to me

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:04.890
because I talk shrub that every time I

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.560
come to Davos I want to spend time who

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:10.460
is young

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.620
because I benefit from global young

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.900
global leader early days when I listened

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.210
to Bill Gates of / Bill Clinton and

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.220
George Soros these guys at that time we

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.740
don't have that many people very poor

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:25.100
facilities well very cold and won't like

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:29.270
it you know 30 minutes driving in a bus

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.250
coming here and fortune but now how do

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.990
you screw up but this is good

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.630
you know this is this is a wit this is

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:40.220
the this is the the to issue with pain

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:43.190
for a grown up and now to me I think

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.750
spending time with you benefit me and

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.340
also I want to tell you my true

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:52.700
experience after off the people does not

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:55.280
necessarily shmoney know by charity you

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.730
cannot change the world but if you have

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.010
a France appear hard you can do a lot of

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:03.560
things so I find this well unfortunately

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:07.270
a lot of people have a business heart

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:09.120
here making money but do things like a

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.400
frothing

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.840
what we should do is should be a profit

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:18.050
be heart they have a business of skill I

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.280
hate a lot of people do the opposite

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:22.470
they want to make money but they talk

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.520
like a friend's lippy and they do like

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:29.040
the France that we've wasted a lot of

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:33.000
money so this is what I mean and it's if

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:36.240
you want your team to continue to work

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:42.770
with you all your life you have to plant

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:46.010
the seed of care the world care others

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.539
the first day they join I don't like a

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.659
lot of companies who make a lot of money

00:24:47.539 --> 00:24:52.850
because making pollutions counterfeit

00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:55.730
products by end of the year donated some

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:58.730
money business

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:04.690
the philosophy ideation should be buried

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:07.039
into the business model alike not

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.809
philanthropy apart I think a message

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:14.419
that young people can take forward

00:25:08.809 --> 00:25:15.860
please hi my name is Iman I'm a global

00:25:14.419 --> 00:25:19.820
shaper from the Jeddah hub in Saudi

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.559
Arabia my question is as a young boy did

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.390
you envision that your life would be

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:26.799
like this did you have intuition about

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:31.270
this and if so do you think the belief

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:36.860
helped in achieving such great success

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:38.270
as a young boy I never thought oh you

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.210
know it's a young but you've ever -

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:46.130
today I never thought I would be here

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:49.340
honestly I never thought but as a young

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:52.820
boy I probably when I look back every

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.530
problems I met me might when I was a kid

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:59.360
anything to me

00:25:54.530 --> 00:26:01.550
I filled so many times people probably

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.690
know that I've applied jobs for so many

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:09.920
jobs over 30 jobs all rejected not even

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:13.610
got a chance 24 of us are interview for

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:16.820
a KFC job 23 accepted I was the only guy

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:19.220
rejected six people went fuller looking

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:22.700
for a police job five except I was the

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.310
only one my cousin I applied job as a as

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:28.400
a as a server in a four style to my city

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:30.770
we wait a long queue for two hours he

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:36.500
was accepted I really so my mother

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:39.700
looked at me huh you know guess but I

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:43.370
know this is a training course for me

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:46.970
before my thirty years old I'm a failure

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:51.820
all people lose by never give up I think

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:54.560
there is opportunity there and then I I

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.700
was a teacher later I read from

00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.680
University I was teaching in the

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:02.750
university for six years number five

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.730
because number five year I was elected

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:08.960
the best a teacher of my universe

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:11.660
elected by students so I said everything

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.480
I taught my students are the things I

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:17.360
learned from books what if I go out

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.060
spend a ten years experience all the

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.940
things whether fail or succeed I'd go

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.880
back to teach again that was my original

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.610
thing in doing Alibaba so I never

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.710
thought I could be rich I never thought

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:34.570
it would be successful I never thought

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:38.210
we could survive for eighteen years and

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:39.650
then we made it the only thing that

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.900
today we should do is share the

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:45.580
experience and know-how especially share

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:49.820
the mistakes suffers with others my

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:52.730
thinking is that you guys remember if

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.590
you want to be successful learn from the

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:57.880
other people's mistakes

00:27:54.590 --> 00:28:01.620
don't learn from the successful stories

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:04.710
successful stories they make

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:09.680
don't listen to that there are a lot of

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:11.700
reasons behind it just like God I

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.120
remember the first time Harvard Business

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:17.010
School came to us say Jack we want to

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:21.120
write a case study for you

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:22.830
yes years 2001 a 2000 they came they

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.400
spent one week and they write a report

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:28.440
and I really I said this is not me and

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.110
this is this is you as a no this is not

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.410
us he said this is you so they make IV

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:36.570
sign and the case study go up and they

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.460
started teaching lot of universities the

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.550
next of five years they invited me to go

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.550
to the case study and they always find a

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:46.950
competitor of my company and F after

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:49.500
every case that case study Ali Papa

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:52.290
would die that company will succeed all

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.450
the students are green and actually

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:57.000
every five years all the competitive

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:59.900
diet was your survival so how can you

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.820
study this kind of a successful story

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.580
learn from the mistakes the other people

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.610
no matter how smart you are you will

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.500
encounter these mistakes you learn from

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.620
mistakes not because you will be able to

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.600
avoid mistakes you were able to when

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:19.620
these mistakes come they suffer comes

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:25.860
you know how to deal with it how to face

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:30.840
it I I the book I want to write if I if

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:34.920
I want if I can it's a re Bubber 1001

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:37.950
mistake this is the most rational things

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:41.190
that in my life in my life is not how

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.710
much we achieved is how much we go

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:47.670
through the tough days and mistakes and

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:50.550
this is what is it if you start to think

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:52.310
now would be good so if you ask me where

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:55.830
as a boy I never thought about that

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:58.130
never that's going to use the back of

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.130
the room

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:10.080
funnily ygl from Shanghai I know that

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:12.470
you recently spend a hundred million a

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.420
hundred billion RMB in deep tack

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:16.920
research I just wonder how you think of

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.780
the future of the attack and how that's

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:24.600
going to influence humanity and

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:28.740
creativity thank you I think technology

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:31.130
as a company we invest a hundred billion

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:38.130
I'm B which is like a hundred fifty

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:40.350
right or fifteen fifteen billion u.s.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:45.090
dollars all researching for the

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:47.460
high-tech as a company I hope in the

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:52.890
future we gain our profit because of our

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:55.020
technology not because our size so we

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:57.050
have to invest in technology but I don't

00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:01.680
like this convert there's a debate

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:02.100
artificial intelligence threat the human

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.180
beings

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:09.360
I think artificial intelligence should

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.760
support human beings the technology

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:17.030
should always doing something to enable

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:21.600
people instead of today disabled people

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:24.570
well steam machine comes when car comes

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.360
people hate it you know today we think

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:29.280
car is good when that meant that the

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.940
automobile when first was designed

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.440
people especially this car this horseman

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:39.930
right they destroy every cars they can

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:41.970
see so I would say people like us when

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.680
we have the money we have the resources

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.710
we have the young old excellent young

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.610
people we should spend money on the

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:55.350
technology that enable people empower

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:58.170
people make life better so this is what

00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:01.830
we want to invest and I think artificial

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:04.740
intelligence no matter how apt efficient

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:07.170
town is good human being in the future

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.950
competed with machine on knowledge you

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:12.660
don't have chance computer is always

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.810
going to be smarter than you are

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:18.480
when there's a car forget about a full

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:21.030
run faster when there's a plane don't

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.580
think you can fly like a when there's

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:25.860
computer you know computer is always

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.960
smarter than you are they never forget

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:31.050
they remember everything they never get

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.470
angry they calculate faster but computer

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:38.940
can never be as wise as a man what's the

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:42.420
difference between smart and wisdom my

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.740
view is a smart people see something the

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.730
other people don't see

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:50.470
a wise people

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:54.950
see something he pretend he did not see

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:58.690
how smart people know what he want and

00:32:54.950 --> 00:33:02.690
wise people know what it doesn't want a

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:06.649
wisdom the person with wisdom knows item

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:08.440
only you know I don't want this then you

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:12.259
know what do you want

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:15.139
so I think this is the money we invest

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:18.049
to support human beings not supporting

00:33:15.139 --> 00:33:18.590
Alibaba this lab is open to the whole

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:23.560
world

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:28.540
it's not supporting Alibaba at all

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:31.460
[Music]

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:33.830
so high I'm sad global shaper from the

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.870
slumber huh I really want to know what

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.030
you think about leadership is it

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.560
something that comes from the heart when

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.960
it comes to decision making as a leader

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.640
is it something that that you have to

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.470
take you have to think through your mind

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.450
as well or is it a bit of both like as a

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:49.100
leader when you make decisions would you

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.800
go with something that you really feel

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.600
about from your heart or would you have

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.760
tried to have a mix off your mind and

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.010
your heart when you make decisions yeah

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.630
I think you are it's a good question

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:06.230
I've been thinking about that first it's

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:09.429
a it's your nature instinct there must

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:12.740
be have something that you're different

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:15.919
second is you you need a training you

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:19.280
should be trained through all the tough

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:21.440
experience but still positive I found

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.440
some great leaders in the world they are

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.030
always positive they never complained

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:31.270
others and never complain and they they

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:38.280
look at the things in a different view

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:45.030
like normal people so I think people

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:47.070
a my company they at the beginning they

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:51.119
don't like me because I'll always think

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:53.849
about ten years five years and then

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:55.230
after we working together for three or

00:34:53.849 --> 00:34:58.890
five years they find out who you are

00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:01.200
right then we got the credit rating and

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.880
as a CEO one of the jobs where

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.950
everybody's happy you have to see the

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.670
unhappy things when everybody's unhappy

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:11.369
you have to see the happy things so

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:16.050
leadership is nature but you have to

00:35:11.369 --> 00:35:16.859
have trained and learn and I got my

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:20.670
leadership

00:35:16.859 --> 00:35:22.560
some upper graded in doubles I see so

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.090
many well honey you know on the end -

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:28.530
financing how many people here know

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:31.890
about how deep a thank you ally pays

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:35.250
decision was made here I was thinking

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:37.710
about Ally pay you know but I was not a

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:40.740
dare to launch out evening because in

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:42.660
China if you do financing with

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:45.630
unlicensed you were being jailed at that

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:47.580
time so I say I went to the bank's can

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.880
help us do the e-commerce of transaction

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:53.250
no no no no banks would accept it so if

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.690
there will be no a leap no financing the

00:35:53.250 --> 00:36:00.750
e-commerce would go nowhere

00:35:54.690 --> 00:36:06.080
so I was year 2004 I was here listen to

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:09.750
a speech by two state leaders about

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:14.460
leadership and this guy's a leadership

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:17.490
is about responsibility you believe it

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.630
people don't believe it but if you think

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.839
it's so critical

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:24.300
you should pay any price to do it so

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:29.280
that day changed my mind and a call back

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:31.710
to my team say let's launch it within

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.980
one month if somebody else go to the

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:37.290
jail I go to the gym who would be the

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.810
second we'll follow me if I go you

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.760
continue and you got the job Yoga

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:45.359
continued that was they called the

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:47.099
leadership determination and year 2004 I

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:55.670
made a decision here and I called back

00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:55.670
and now to date the Ali pay it's so big

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:05.869
wonderful shall we take one from a ydl

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:09.260
to be to be fair any questions

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:09.260
yeah please

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:16.780
hello my name is Pablo from Costa Rica

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:20.080
ygl and given your perspective of caring

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:22.540
and being a trustee of all this what do

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.460
you do for self care and also maybe

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.590
within your company because earlier on

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.600
often you can cut through sleep or other

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.760
things in a silly way and you realize

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.930
that if you plan for the long term one

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:37.150
also has to take personal care be their

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:38.740
mindfulness or prioritizing better and

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:44.800
how are you doing this and how do you

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:49.690
promote that in your company well I'm

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:53.080
lucky that I have 18 co-founders and

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:55.600
most of them my students when we in my

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.850
apartment I told them my dream and my

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.760
vision and we're videotape funny thing

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:03.090
is that when Alibaba launched her for

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:06.670
the first day I said that's a videotape

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:09.460
everything every important meetings that

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:12.610
we join together I said the purpose is

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:15.040
that someday if we Phil would give the

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.460
videos to the people to research why we

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.830
film

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.240
if we succeed give the videos to the

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.270
other people so we have a lie almost a

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:24.670
whole house of videotapes

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:27.700
so the first videotape I say I speak for

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:31.390
two hours and those guys look at me ok

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:36.880
so that's what do you want to do I'll

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:39.760
say yeah this is what I want to do we I

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.740
was the first I know nothing about

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.780
technology I know that nothing about

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.460
management I know nothing but but the

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:47.110
only thing is that you don't have to

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.900
know a lot of things you have to find

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:52.120
the people who are smart that you are my

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:55.440
first away is always find people who

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:59.230
knowledge on computer smart denying

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.660
accounting smart on for so many years I

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:05.380
always try to find the people who smart

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:08.380
than I am and when you find so many

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:11.760
smart people my job is to making sure

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:15.790
the smart people can work it together

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.400
and then if smart people can work it

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:21.670
together it's easier the vision do

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.380
believe because if stupid people can

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.490
working together easily

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.839
not people can never work together

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:31.690
people work it together easily they

00:39:28.839 --> 00:39:33.009
don't believe the vision the people who

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.890
believe the vision but they don't work

00:39:33.009 --> 00:39:39.039
together so very important is a finding

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:42.130
smart people and my job is two things

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:45.910
making sure they work together so the

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:48.250
culture is important long-term Isha you

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:50.230
should be ideal it was great strong

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.609
vision leader but you should also have

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:57.180
to survive today

00:39:51.609 --> 00:40:00.099
if you don't survive today you got so

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:02.349
the best way to promote your company is

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:03.940
not to you it's not me as the CEO the

00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:07.390
best way is your product your services

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:11.200
your employees the best investor product

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:14.589
of your company is your employee so I

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:18.059
spent a lot of time 30 days for the

00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:21.210
first 2000 price of Alibaba I speak

00:40:18.059 --> 00:40:25.059
everybody for for one or two hours

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:26.559
Wendi joining I said I would never

00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:29.410
promise you would be rich

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:34.180
I never promise you will be promoted but

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:38.019
I promise you suffer I promise you will

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.460
have a terrible life right although all

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:41.829
the terrible things I promise you

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.589
enjoying this company right but good

00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:47.289
things if you promise good things you

00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:50.440
are misleading them because I cannot

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:54.210
promise myself we we know this is the

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:58.180
future but we not we are not sure that

00:40:54.210 --> 00:41:03.369
we will be there but if we don't work

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:04.839
together we all will lose our job and

00:41:03.369 --> 00:41:06.819
they do always say and I think I've

00:41:04.839 --> 00:41:08.619
experienced this myself if you knew how

00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:10.690
hard it would be would you would you do

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:12.640
it and it seems for you a key part of

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.740
leadership is leaving the ego at the

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.420
door and being willing to hire people

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.289
better than you who you can then kind of

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:22.799
empower to carry out your your vision

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:22.799
wonderful yep

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:30.750
hi I'm Aiman from Google shipper Sakura

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.760
hub how does your experience of being a

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:34.230
teacher influence how you run the

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.460
business okay and do you have any

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:39.390
message for those who are working in

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:41.130
education space thank you how does your

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.720
experience of being a teacher in early

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.080
days o influence how you run the

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:48.780
business

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:53.190
oh yeah let me tell you one thing I

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:55.880
never thought I could be a CEO I never

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:59.040
thought I later I'd become a good CEO

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:01.590
one of the thing I learned from teachers

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.990
as a teacher very important a character

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:06.090
of a teacher is the teacher always

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:09.270
expect his students better

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:10.950
I want this student to become a banker

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.580
that's to become a mayor they're gonna

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:18.210
is a scientist this is all teachers want

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:22.290
if you don't have this kind of thinking

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:24.480
it's a it's a lousy loop it's a terrible

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:26.130
teacher a good teacher always want the

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.200
other people better you don't want this

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:30.690
teacher in jail that teaches a backrub

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:34.800
that that teacher is you know you know

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:38.070
so as a CEO I trained myself is I always

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:41.430
want those people join the company do

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:43.260
better than they thought and everything

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.970
the company should do is making sure the

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.730
good environment to training him to be

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:49.100
more positive

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:51.350
and everything we do this is a teacher

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.330
and teacher does not mean I know better

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.040
than you are everything I know better

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.930
than you are because I learn from others

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.380
so a teacher shouldn't learn all the

00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:00.380
time

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.450
a teacher should I share all the time a

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.670
teacher should always expect the other

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:08.600
people better than you are and by the

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:13.390
way education it's a good big challenge

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:15.830
now if we do not change the way we teach

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:19.100
30 years later we'll be in trouble

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:22.250
because the way we teach the things we

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:26.810
talk teach our kids other things to pass

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:29.240
200 years is knowledge based and we

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.960
cannot teach our kids to compete so

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:35.290
machine will be smarter

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:37.119
we have to do something unique that is

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:41.470
machine connecticut trouble with us in

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:44.730
this way 30 years later our kids have

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:47.500
the chance I hope I ask your question

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:50.080
it's a very difficult one to answer but

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.670
what are those skills that you think we

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.980
need to you need to teach if it's we're

00:43:51.670 --> 00:44:01.390
moving away from knowledge what are the

00:43:53.980 --> 00:44:07.150
key things value believing independent

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:10.480
thinking teamwork care for others these

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:13.599
are the soft part the knowledge may not

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.859
teach you that but that's why I think we

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:22.560
should teach our kids sports

00:44:16.859 --> 00:44:25.690
entertainment a little music painting

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.550
art to making sure humans should be

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:31.690
different from everything we teach

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:33.640
should be different from machine if the

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:35.849
machine can do better you have to think

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.849
about

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.689
[Music]

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.869
hi this is Hashem and Moussaoui from

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.700
Manama Bahrain talking about education

00:44:48.869 --> 00:44:52.830
and for this revolution we have been

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.570
talking about people losing their jobs

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:56.760
or they are not qualified enough with

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.590
the skills needed what are you doing for

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.450
the people within your company to get

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.890
up-to-date to get continuous learning to

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.900
get to know what's the technologies

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.720
needed for the future thank you

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.200
okay luckily I don't have to do a lot of

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:13.830
these kind of things in my company

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:16.710
because we are fighting every day for

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:19.830
the future we know if we do not work

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:22.350
hard Facebook or Google and Amazon all

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:25.410
these got to venner right so this is why

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:28.200
we are globalized the it's a competition

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:31.320
globalized but we know that's not it's

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.660
not about technology competition all the

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.180
people today not like eighteen founders

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.820
will never - and a happy block engineers

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.280
today we have more than 25000 engineers

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:44.040
they are all smart people they do much

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.140
better job than the 18 years ago but the

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.730
only thing I wanted making sure that

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.880
these people have a friend that they

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:53.790
heart because the data we have the

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.400
technology we have if they do not have

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:58.780
have great hardening Sun we are going to

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:04.100
make disaster for the world

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:06.860
Google Facebook Amazon Alibaba these

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:09.680
companies we are the luckiest company of

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:11.480
this century and we have the luck if

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.720
we're lucky we have the responsibility

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:17.720
that we should have a good heart to do

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:22.670
something good but on the other thing I

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:24.470
want to say is bad that making sure that

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:26.950
everything you do is for the future for

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:31.010
example you know about a single estate

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:33.590
single stay shopping day November 11 is

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:37.580
the day we've created last year that

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:41.720
they were certain 25 billion US dollars

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:46.130
for one day and for the first a minute

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:49.490
over 70 to 80 million people who rush

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:51.890
inside to shop on the mobile phone so

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:55.880
you have to making sure the system is

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:59.870
good enough we have to finish we have to

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:04.760
finish two hundred and seventy thousand

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:09.560
transactions per second okay imagine

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:12.620
that toilet is 70,000 the transactions

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:16.160
per second if we do not have that kind

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:18.290
of computing capability the whole system

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.080
will crash because we have several

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:25.550
hundred million people waiting to pay

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:28.760
the money so this technology we know why

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:31.820
we do this for crazy for one day because

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:34.430
we want to test the technology this

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:38.030
technology should be inclusive because

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:39.830
we know today in China we create

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:43.910
probably like a hundred minute package

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:46.640
deliver we believe a date five years

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:49.220
later the whole world would deliver 1

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:52.310
billion packages per day think about

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:55.070
what's the technology are we ready for

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:58.070
that so the synchronous day is to

00:47:55.070 --> 00:48:02.210
testing this technology and then to be

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:05.890
inclusive so making sure the market

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.890
drive done not the bus driver

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.640
thank you very thank you jack

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:17.799
mr. Zepeda from Mexico from the monetary

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.420
hablo shaper we have been talking a lot

00:48:17.799 --> 00:48:21.009
about our generation and I really like

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.529
the conversation about three to four

00:48:21.009 --> 00:48:25.029
three years after actually I have been

00:48:23.529 --> 00:48:27.400
hearing these days that we haven't had

00:48:25.029 --> 00:48:29.319
this snow in 30 years here so the

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.150
question is going to a quote of

00:48:29.319 --> 00:48:33.069
Professor Schwab he said a couple of

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.839
months ago to the global shapers that

00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:36.099
were the first generation that is going

00:48:34.839 --> 00:48:37.750
to software about climate change

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:40.359
and we are the last one that can do

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:42.640
something about it so with your teaching

00:48:40.359 --> 00:48:44.680
teaching passion what are the three

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.480
things that we are saying to educate the

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.430
term million employees for the Hana

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.049
Miller employees wherever who's looking

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.240
at this video to develop an

00:48:50.049 --> 00:48:54.480
environmental mindset a spiritual

00:48:52.240 --> 00:49:00.220
mindset and non fragmented world mindset

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:02.829
okay first let me say this

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:06.279
every disasters the environment

00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:12.960
disasters as a reflect of human heart

00:49:06.279 --> 00:49:16.000
today because when we need it too much

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:21.569
we destroy a lot of things I think the

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:25.289
human being today we the past 200 years

00:49:21.569 --> 00:49:28.059
because of knowledge-based technology o

00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:32.559
knowledge-based the training system all

00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:35.200
we want to do is get more we want more

00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:38.410
things we go to the moon we go to Mars

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:42.579
we go this we always also looking we

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:45.880
human being never inside looking if you

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:49.390
don't have the inside looking you will

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:52.180
never be wise if you're not wise you

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:54.819
never know what do you don't want today

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.769
human being get much more than they

00:49:54.819 --> 00:49:59.829
expect they should have so the

00:49:56.769 --> 00:50:03.009
environmental pollution the whole thing

00:49:59.829 --> 00:50:08.079
happening is because human being become

00:50:03.009 --> 00:50:12.700
greedy become arrogant so this is why

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:15.549
the big data the data technology is try

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.920
to understand the inside of human what

00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:20.039
is that data is the human behavior a lot

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.780
of people

00:50:20.039 --> 00:50:25.500
trust me the machine will know you

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:29.770
better than you know yourself

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:31.510
obvious in some movies some gamblers you

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:33.940
know they're great they look at the eyes

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:36.430
you if he got a good card

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:38.880
this I believe but none of people don't

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:42.250
see that the Machine see all the details

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:45.730
machine know you better so what I would

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:48.520
say is that in a data period human be

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:51.630
next to 100 years people human will not

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:54.549
try to understand things inward-looking

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:56.530
we will see a lot of eglise of ugly

00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:59.530
things of ourselves where knowledge

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:01.359
based art were looking you see the ugly

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:03.609
things of the others and good things

00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:07.059
when looking side working this is

00:51:03.609 --> 00:51:09.430
Chinese philosophy Chinese people our

00:51:07.059 --> 00:51:12.039
believing is always inside watching

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:15.940
we're supposed to have inside checking

00:51:12.039 --> 00:51:19.200
every three time three times a day but

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:22.150
not not really if you can really do that

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:25.059
you can do that then you'll be good so

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:30.940
for environment you're right if we do

00:51:25.059 --> 00:51:33.990
not make action take action all the

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:38.010
money you make was spent in the hospital

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:42.460
medicine our kids were being big trouble

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:48.069
so let's fix it and fix first fix our

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:50.289
heart fix our know-how and fix our

00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:54.750
belief we have a belief wherever

00:51:50.289 --> 00:51:57.210
religion we have a valley it's better

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:58.740
so I think this is what I concern to me

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:01.440
this is what I think the young people

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:04.500
should always have the valley the

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:06.540
mission if you have something you

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:08.280
believe in your heart that would be

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:11.040
different this is what next two thirty

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:13.109
years education shipping focus up we

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:20.490
have time for one last brief question

00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:23.670
Runa Thank You this is Karuna from the

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:26.010
poultry shop mauritius and my question

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:28.050
is you talked about your workplace

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.700
culture I'd like to have one or two

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:33.060
examples if possible of how do you

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.829
motivate your employees and I'd like to

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.230
throw in the last question is how much

00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:38.970
do you sleep okay this is such a

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:42.150
controversial topic and I keep hearing

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:48.810
different versions thank you what about

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:50.760
keeping the different versions ezio

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.960
sleep on these three to four hours and

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.750
whereas ever heard like you know you

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:57.000
need at least eight eyes so yeah I'm a

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:59.760
bit divided and and I'd love to know

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:04.680
your secret thank you yeah how do i

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:07.770
emot-- to buy incentive unload by my

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:11.160
colleagues you have to find the people

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:14.069
became mobilize themselves it's

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:17.069
impossible to find to to encourage an

00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:20.819
active person so the people you're hi

00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:24.569
the people work together they they have

00:53:20.819 --> 00:53:27.030
to be oh you cannot we have a 65,000 in

00:53:24.569 --> 00:53:29.339
price now you cannot hire all of them

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.380
that positive but at least the people

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:37.080
work with me

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:39.750
my management leadership several areas

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:42.780
they have to be positive they have to

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:45.720
know the to incentive the others because

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:50.120
I cannot accept everybody and making

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.120
sure the culture so

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:57.280
I think it will be very painful for me

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.890
to talk to my vice president and he need

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:03.790
to be incentivized and mobilized every

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:06.310
time right this is one word if he is not

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:10.390
if he does not know how to incentivize

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:11.350
or mobilize his people is better and I

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:14.369
don't think he will be the vice

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:17.619
president they should be a good engineer

00:54:14.369 --> 00:54:21.940
good designer but not a good leader a

00:54:17.619 --> 00:54:26.619
good leader should know how but not by

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:28.600
only money most of people being

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:31.300
centralized or mover not because you

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:36.690
give them a lot of money you give the

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:42.740
respect trust appreciation

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:42.740
and correct hard to fool advice

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.800
when it come to my meetings internal

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.170
meetings you will be shocked because we

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.420
we're not like a lot of other Chinese

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:59.610
company the bossy and Melissa take notes

00:54:54.420 --> 00:55:02.580
and go down we are like a war room we

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:06.810
make decision based on whose voice is

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:08.970
louder early days you know we'll find it

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:14.310
a talk and then making sure everybody

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:16.230
speak up so this is also a way of mobile

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:18.060
life and incentives there are lot of

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:22.650
ways and different people have a

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:27.660
different way to send incentives of this

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:33.840
how much time I sleep I have a problem I

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:35.030
mean I don't I sleep not very shot but

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:39.810
not good

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:45.720
and I don't eat a lot this is something

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:51.510
that I was sure I don't eat a lot I'm a

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:53.280
very pickle on the food and I don't know

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:55.010
sometimes I would love to see what the

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:59.570
things that make me

00:55:55.010 --> 00:56:03.710
worked like that but for sure that if I

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:08.720
suddenly give me one month location I'll

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:11.950
collapse its I think there will be

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:14.240
something in my heart maybe the mission

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:17.960
at the beginning of a mission of

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:20.780
eighteen people today we have 65,000

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:23.060
people they all believe the mission so

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.589
if I give up I can give up in my

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.780
position but I should not give up a

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:29.810
commission if I give up everybody say

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:33.140
hey no so and then especially today

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:37.130
Alibaba at this size people continue to

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:41.630
say for this size the growth rate will

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:45.849
be tiny but down the ten twenty years

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:50.720
Alibaba will look like if you want to be

00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:53.900
stupid greater or triple our size what's

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:57.170
what what the direction how to do it so

00:56:53.900 --> 00:57:00.530
I spend lot of time thinking a lot of

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:03.260
time thinking and I love to think good

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:07.579
thing is I have a good team now I think

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:09.740
I do the talk they do the work yes on

00:57:07.579 --> 00:57:11.240
that note I would think I'm sorry we

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.710
didn't have a chance to take everyone's

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:15.380
questions we'll just have to make this

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:16.839
an annual convening from now on and I

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:19.480
hope you can all join me in thanking

00:57:16.839 --> 00:57:21.920
Jack for his strong message of youth

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.810
inclusivity particularly in the context

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.300
of trade and how we should all take time

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:27.890
to look inside ourselves cultivate our

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.900
wiseness because that's how we'll

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.550
differentiate ourselves from machines

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:37.539
thank you so much

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:37.539
[Applause]
