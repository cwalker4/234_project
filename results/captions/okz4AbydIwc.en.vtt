♪♪

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.855
&gt;&gt; I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH AS A

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:13.423
PERSON BUT SOMETIMES EVEN GOOD

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:13.690
PEOPLE DO THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:14.724
DO.

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:16.193
I HAVE READ THE REPORT.

00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:18.895
I'M NOT THE JUDGE IN THE CASE.

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:19.830
I'M TO THE THE DISCIPLINE,

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.865
DECISION-MAKER IN THE CASE.

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:22.966
I THINK IT IS ACCOUNTABILITY

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:24.801
MECHANISMS WORKING AND THEY

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.503
SHOULD WORK BECAUSE IT IS NOT

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:27.838
ACCEPTABLE IN THE FBI OR THE

00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:29.539
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:31.475
LACK CANDOR.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.842
SOMETHING WE TAKE REALLY

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:33.043
SERIOUSLY?

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.911
BRIAN: REALLY?

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:36.480
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:39.583
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE

00:00:36.613 --> 00:00:43.653
NEWT GINGRICH WAS WATCHING WITH

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:43.987
ALL OF US AS HE TALKED TO JAKE

00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:44.754
TAPPER.

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:45.722
SOMETIMES GOOD PEOPLE LIVE.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:47.958
&gt;&gt; WATCH HIS FACE.

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:48.291
TURN OFF THE SOUND, WATCH HIS

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:50.560
FACE.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:51.862
STEVE: MARK, CAN YOU RERACK THAT

00:00:50.694 --> 00:00:52.829
CLIP, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND WATCH

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.164
HIS FACE.

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.431
NEWT, TELL US WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:56.399
AT.

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:58.935
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GUY WHO

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.836
AROUND THE 7th GRADE

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.239
PRACTICED SINCERITY.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.506
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN TO HIT THE

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:03.773
CAR.

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.208
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE BASEBALL

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:05.642
GOT OUT OF MY HANDS.

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:07.344
AINSLEY: YEAH.

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:07.911
&gt;&gt; I THINK MY COUSIN MUST HAVE

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:10.147
DONE IT.

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:12.916
BECAUSE I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.584
THIS PAINED, I HATE THROWING

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.019
McCABE UNDER THE BUS.

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:16.353
STEVE: YOU'RE SAYING HE IS

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:18.855
ACTING?

00:01:16.486 --> 00:01:21.158
&gt;&gt; I'M SAYING HE TAUGHT HIMSELF

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:23.393
A EARLY AGE A SERIES OF

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.693
SELF-SERVING EMOTIONS, HE USES

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:24.561
OVER.

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:26.396
WATCH HIM FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:27.264
OF THIS STUFF, HE USES IT OVER

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.366
AND OVER AND OVER.

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:29.933
THIS IS ALMOST A PATHOLOGICAL

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.269
LIAR.

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:35.372
STEVE: BUT HE SAID RIGHT THERE,

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:36.439
IT SOUNDS AS IF HE AGREES WITH

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:39.176
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:40.744
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, ANDY

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:42.445
McCABE BROKE ALL THE RULES AND

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:42.812
THAT IS WHY THERE IS CRIMINAL

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.882
REFERRAL.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.883
&gt;&gt; THAT SHOULD BE A GREAT SHOCK

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:49.286
BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY AUTHORITY

00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:51.855
FIGURE HE IS DISAPPOINTED.

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:52.289
BRIAN: PETER STRZOK HE IS A

00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:53.557
DISAPPOINTED.

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:53.957
LISA PAGE HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.659
HAPPENED.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.092
&gt;&gt; ATTORNEY GENERAL LYNCH,

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:56.793
DISAPPOINTED.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:59.396
GO DOWN TO THE LIST.

00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:02.098
HE IS DISAPPOINTED IN TRUMP.

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:04.768
BRIAN: TO FINISH THIS POINT,

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:06.803
ANDY McCABE'S LAWYER CAME OUT

00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:09.072
AND SAID HE TOLD JAMES COMEY

00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:11.474
MULTIPLE TIMES --

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:12.475
&gt;&gt; THESE TWO GUYS WILL BE IN

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:13.210
CRIMINAL COURT AS WITNESSES

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.611
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

00:02:13.343 --> 00:02:15.412
AINSLEY: WHO BROKE THE LAW?

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:16.613
WHO DO YOU THINK?

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:18.481
&gt;&gt; BOTH OF THEM.

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:19.216
I JUST DID A PIECE FOR

00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:21.117
"THE HILL" YESTERDAY POINTING

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.986
OUT THE TOP TWO PEOPLE AT THE

00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:25.422
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.256
ARE BOTH PEOPLE WHO BROKE THE

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:26.957
LAW.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.392
THAT'S -- THINK ABOUT IT.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.026
THIS IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT LAW

00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:31.795
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.364
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS.

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:36.533
BY THE WAY, THEY ARE BREAKING

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:36.833
THE LAW -- COMEY IS LYING TO

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:37.734
LYNCH.

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:39.502
YOU KNOW.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:41.938
I THINK FOR ALL PRACTICAL

00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:42.339
PURPOSES HE WAS LYING TO

00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:43.740
ROSENSTEIN.

00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:44.174
BRIAN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN LYING TO

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:45.342
LYNCH?

00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:46.543
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE MATTER

00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:47.811
AND INVESTIGATION OR LYNCH IS

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:49.312
LYING ABOUT HER REVISIONIST?

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:49.613
ONE OF THEM IS NOT TELLING THE

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.448
TRUTH.

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:52.849
&gt;&gt; IF I HAD TO CHOOSE GIVEN THE

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:53.383
CURRENT TRACK RECORD I WOULD BET

00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:57.120
WITH LYNCH.

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:59.256
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT, I URGE

00:02:57.254 --> 00:03:02.959
EVERYBODY TO JUST GO GOOGLE REST

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.694
SEND STEEN'S REPORT ON COMEY --

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:07.631
ROSENSTEIN'S REPORT ON COMEY.

00:03:04.828 --> 00:03:07.998
THIS IS ONE OF TRUMP'S ORIGINAL

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:08.932
MISTAKES.

00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:09.633
TRUMP SHOULD HAVE DONE NOTHING

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:11.234
FOR THREE DAYS.

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:12.335
SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE REPORT

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:14.004
AND RELEASED IT.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.306
LET THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS DEAL

00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:17.274
WITH THE REPORT.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.209
ROSENSTEIN'S REPORT ENDS WE'LL

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:20.410
NEVER BE ABLE TO FIX THE FBI AS

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.611
LONG AS COMEY IS HERE.

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:22.479
NOW AT THAT POINT, WHAT DO YOU

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:23.580
THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE

00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:25.715
UNITED STATES OUGHT TO DO?

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:28.418
THEN THE IG REPORT WHICH I ALSO

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.887
RECOMMEND PEOPLE READ, BUT IT IS

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:31.855
LONGER, THE END IG SAID THIS GUY

00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:33.823
LIED UNDER OATH.

00:03:31.988 --> 00:03:34.157
HE LIED WHEN HE WASN'T UNDER

00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:35.492
OATH.

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:37.227
LYING UNDER OATH IS A FELONY.

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.361
BRIAN: THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.530
IF HILLARY CLINTON WON?

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:42.065
&gt;&gt; WOULD WE BE KNOW NOTHING.

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:43.366
IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON, WE

00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:45.335
WOULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.869
DEPTH OF CORRUPTION AT THE TOP.

00:03:45.468 --> 00:03:46.603
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:50.607
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH POMPEO?

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:51.007
HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE THE CIA

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.075
DIRECTOR.

00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.709
NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE THE

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:54.577
SECRETARY OF STATE?

00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:55.578
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.180
START GOING INTO EVERY STATE

00:03:55.712 --> 00:04:01.117
WITH A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AND

00:03:57.314 --> 00:04:01.418
LEAD A PATRIOTIC PRO-AMERICAN

00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:02.952
RALLY.

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:04.254
THAT SAYS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:05.088
DOING IN THE SENATE IS

00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:05.422
DESTRUCTIVE OF THE UNITED

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:07.090
STATES.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:09.225
TO PUT, YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:12.495
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.396
BOTTLED UP, AMBASSADORS, VARIOUS

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.031
APPOINTMENTS, THE DEGREE THE

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.666
PRESIDENT IS RUNNING THE

00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:17.467
GOVERNMENT WITH 1/3 OF PEOPLE HE

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.202
OUGHT TO HAVE.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.536
LOOK WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH

00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:20.870
POMPEO.

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.237
FIRST IN HIS CLASS AT WEST

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:23.139
POINT.

00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.074
FIRST IN HIS CLASS AT HARVARD.

00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:25.709
BRILLIANT GUY.

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:27.410
HILLARY CLINTON GETS THROUGH.

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:29.279
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT PARTISAN.

00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:30.980
WINS WITH OVERWHELMING VOTE.

00:04:29.412 --> 00:04:32.415
STEVE: TWO VOTED NO.

00:04:31.114 --> 00:04:34.150
&gt;&gt; JOHN KERRY GETS THROUGH.

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:35.819
&gt;&gt; THREE VOTED NO.

00:04:34.284 --> 00:04:36.353
AINSLEY: WITH SYRIA,

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.821
NORTH KOREA, CHINA.

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:39.789
&gt;&gt; SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY TO CHUCK

00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:40.490
SCHUMER TODAY PUTS THE

00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:42.192
DEMOCRATIC PARTY POSITIVE THE

00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:42.625
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HIS

00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:43.093
COLLEAGUES --

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.760
BRIAN: WHERE IS

00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:44.928
MITCH McCONNELL ON THIS?

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.395
MITCH McCONNELL HAS TO BE

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.796
OUTRAGED.

00:04:45.528 --> 00:04:47.664
HE COULD GET A CAMERA WHEREVER

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.865
HE WANTED.

00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:50.633
WHY DOES THE PRESIDENT ALWAYS

00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:51.901
HAVE TO DO THIS?

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:53.737
HE IS THE MAJORITY LEADER?

00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:56.473
&gt;&gt; McCONNELL DOESN'T HAVE

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.607
NEARLY THE CAPACITY IN THE MEDIA

00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:59.042
THAT DONALD J. TRUMP HAS.

00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:00.744
BRIAN: COULD USE SOME HELP.

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:02.312
&gt;&gt; ONE THING McCONNELL OUGHT

00:05:00.877 --> 00:05:06.549
TO DO, WE'RE NOT GOING HOME

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:08.618
UNTIL EVERY SINGLE NOMINEE,

00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:09.452
LITERALLY SEVEN DAYS A WEEKS, AS

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:11.087
MANY DAYS A WEEK.

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:12.055
IF McCONNELL SAID THAT, IT

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.289
WOULD LAST TWO WEEKS.

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:15.525
BY END OF THE SECOND WEEK,

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.960
DEMOCRATS WOULD BE SAYING TO

00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:18.261
SCHUMER, I CAN'T STAY HERE.

00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:18.595
BRIAN: THEY WORK THREE DAYS A

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:20.196
WEEK.

00:05:18.728 --> 00:05:21.898
&gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD STAY SEVEN IS

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.601
DAYS A WEEK UNTIL EVERY SINGLE

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:26.770
NOMINEE IS APPROVED.

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:28.538
STEVE: TAKES 30 HOURS OF DEBATE.

00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:30.273
NOT LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT.

00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:32.008
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON THIS.
