00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.254
- The wisest person I ever met in my life,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.087
a third grade dropout.

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:08.211
Wisest and dropout in the same sentence

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.666
is rather oxymoronic

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.797
like jumbo shrimp.

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:13.061
(audience laughing)

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:13.896
Mhmm.

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:15.969
(audience laughing)

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.285
Like fun run.

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:18.472
Ain't nothing fun about it.

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:20.645
(audience laughing)

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.010
Like Microsoft Works, y'all don't hear me.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.769
(audience laughing)

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.747
I used to say I like country music

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.623
but I've lived in Texas so long

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:31.245
I love country music now.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.645
(audience cheering)

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:33.870
Yeah.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.462
I hunt, I fish, I have
cowboy boots, and cowboy,

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:38.960
y'all, I'm a black neck redneck.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.181
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?

00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:42.789
(audience laughing)

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.266
No longer oxymoronic for
me to say country music.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.074
And it's not oxymoronic for me to say

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:50.436
third grade and dropout.

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:51.399
That third grade dropout,

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.304
the wisest person I ever met in my life

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:57.478
who taught me to combine
knowledge and wisdom

00:00:57.478 --> 00:00:59.010
to make an impact,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.461
was my father.

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.628
A simple cook.

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:04.974
Wisest man I ever met in my life.

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:06.571
Just a simple cook.

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.722
Left school in the third grade

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:08.989
to help out on the family farm

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:10.450
but just because he left school

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.759
doesn't mean education stopped.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:13.662
Mark Twain once said,

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:14.622
"I've never allowed my schooling

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:16.950
"to get in the way of my education."

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440
My father taught himself how to read,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.920
taught himself how to write.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.056
Decided in the midst of Jim Crowism,

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:25.264
as America was breathing the
last gasp of the Civil War,

00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:28.303
my father decided he was
gonna stand and be a man,

00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:30.006
not a black man,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.066
not a brown man, not a white man,

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:32.899
but a man.

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:38.924
He literally challenged himself
to be the best that he could

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:41.508
all the days of his life.

00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:43.104
I have four degrees,

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:45.330
my brother is a judge.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.842
We're not the smartest ones in our family.

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.179
It's a third grade dropout daddy,

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.115
a third grade dropout daddy

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.054
who was quoting
Michelangelo, saying to us,

00:01:54.054 --> 00:01:56.816
"Boys, I won't have a problem
if you aim high and miss

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:57.996
"but I'm gonna have a real issue

00:01:57.996 --> 00:02:00.266
"if you aim low and hit."

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.399
A country mother quoting
Henry Ford, saying,

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.745
"If you think you can or
if you think you can't,

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:06.767
"you're right."

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.952
I learned that from a third
grade drop, simple lessons.

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:10.854
Lessons like these.

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:12.786
"Son, you'd rather be an hour early

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:14.177
"than a minute late."

00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:15.489
We never knew what time it was at my house

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.389
'cause the clocks were always ahead.

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.216
My mother said for nearly 30 years,

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:21.729
my father left the house
at 3:45 in the morning.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.308
One day she asked him, "Why, Daddy?"

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:24.824
He said, "Maybe one of my boys

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:26.720
"will catch me in the act of excellence."

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.249
I wanna share two things with you.

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.770
Aristotle said you are
what you repeatedly do,

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.319
therefore excellence ought
to be a habit not an act.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.883
Don't ever forget that.

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:38.733
I know you're tough but
always remember to be kind.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:39.567
Always.

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:41.159
Don't ever forget that.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.439
Never embarrass momma.

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.272
Mhmm.

00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:45.371
(audience laughing)

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:48.517
Yeah, if momma ain't
happy, ain't nobody happy.

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:50.599
If daddy ain't happy, don't
nobody care but you know--

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.432
(audience laughing)

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:52.349
I tell you.

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:54.289
Next lesson,

00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:58.490
lesson from a cook over
there in the galley.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.340
Son, make sure your servant's towel

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.064
is bigger than your ego.

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:07.038
Ego is the anesthesia that
deadens the pain of stupidity.

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:08.913
Y'all might have a relative in mind

00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:09.746
you wanna send that to.

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:10.647
Let me say it again.

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:12.272
(audience laughing)

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:15.441
Ego is the anesthesia that
deadens the pain of stupidity.

00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:17.063
Pride is the burden of a foolish person.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.394
John Wooden coached basketball
in UCLA for a living

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:22.531
but his calling was to impact people.

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:24.683
And with all those national championships,

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.194
guess what he was found doing
in the middle of the week?

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:28.171
Going into the cupboard,

00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:32.426
grabbing a broom and
sweeping his own gym floor.

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:34.310
You wanna make an impact?

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.700
Find your broom.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.665
Every day of your life,

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:38.768
you find your broom.

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:41.060
You grow your influence that way.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.850
That way you're attracting people

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.888
so that you can impact them.

00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:46.457
Final lesson.

00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:47.290
"Son,

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.442
"you're gonna do a job,

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:52.609
"do it right."

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.525
I've always been told

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:58.276
how average I can be.

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:03.204
Always been criticized about being average

00:04:03.204 --> 00:04:04.948
but I wanna tell you something.

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.863
I stand here before you,

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:08.489
before all of these people

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.942
not listening to those words

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:13.916
but telling myself every single day

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.710
to shoot for the stars,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.869
to be the best that I can be.

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.106
Good enough isn't good enough

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:20.333
if it can be better.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.608
And better isn't good enough

00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:23.311
if it can be best.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.790
Let me close with a very personal story

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.396
that I think will bring
all this into focus.

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:31.642
Wisdom will come to you in
the unlikeliest of sources.

00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:33.321
A lot of times through failure.

00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:35.762
When you hit rock bottom remember this,

00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:37.362
while you're struggling,

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.707
rock bottom can also be a great foundation

00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:40.947
on which to build

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.430
and on which to grow.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.187
I'm not worried that you'll be successful.

00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:49.157
I'm worried that you won't
fail from time to time.

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:52.848
A person that gets up off
the canvas and keeps growing,

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:53.762
that's the person

00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:56.617
that will continue to
grow their influence.

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:58.129
Back in the '70s,

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.562
to help me make this point,

00:05:00.562 --> 00:05:02.618
let me introduce you to someone.

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:05.881
I met the finest woman
I'd ever met in my life.

00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:06.714
Mhmm.

00:05:06.714 --> 00:05:07.898
(audience laughing)

00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:11.206
Back in my day, we'd have
called her a brick house.

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:14.839
(audience laughing)

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.952
This woman was the finest
woman I'd ever seen in my life.

00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:18.276
There's just one little problem.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.571
Back then ladies didn't
like big old line men.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.094
The Blindside hadn't come out yet.

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:25.391
(audience laughing)

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.383
They liked quarterbacks and running backs.

00:05:27.383 --> 00:05:28.216
We're at this dance

00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:30.557
and I find out her name is Trina Williams

00:05:30.557 --> 00:05:32.103
from Lompoc, California

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:33.595
and we were all dancing

00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:35.760
and we're just excited

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.630
and I decide in the
middle of dancing with her

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.438
that I would ask her for her phone number.

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:41.339
She, Trina was the first one,

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:42.898
Trina was the only woman in college

00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:44.597
who gave me her real telephone number.

00:05:44.597 --> 00:05:46.177
(audience laughing)

00:05:46.177 --> 00:05:48.541
The next day we walked
to Baskin and Robbins

00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.945
ice cream parlor.

00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:51.538
My friends couldn't believe it.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:53.476
This has been 40 years ago

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:55.130
and my friends still can't believe it.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.263
(audience laughing)

00:05:56.263 --> 00:05:58.105
We go on a second date

00:05:58.105 --> 00:06:00.011
and a third date

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:02.075
and a fourth date.

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:02.908
Mhmm.

00:06:02.908 --> 00:06:04.354
(audience laughing)

00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:06.688
We drive from Chico to Vallejo

00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:08.529
so that she could meet my parents.

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:09.911
My father meets her.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.762
My daddy, my hero, he meets her,

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:15.268
pulls me to the side and
says, "Is she psycho?"

00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:16.101
But anyway--

00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.471
(audience laughing)

00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:18.995
We go together for a year, two years,

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:20.086
three years, four years

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:22.004
by now Trina's a senior in college.

00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:22.995
I'm still a freshman

00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:24.812
but I'm working some things out.

00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:26.691
(audience laughing)

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.351
I'm so glad I graduated in four terms.

00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:31.292
Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan.

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:33.713
(audience laughing)

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:35.805
So now it's time to propose.

00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:37.636
So I talked to her girlfriends

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.237
and it's California, it's in the '70s.

00:06:39.237 --> 00:06:40.375
So it has to be outside,

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.890
have to have a candle
and you have to have,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.993
some chocolate.

00:06:43.993 --> 00:06:44.826
Listen, I'm from the hood.

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:46.703
I had a bottle of Boone's Farm wine.

00:06:46.703 --> 00:06:47.536
That's what I had.

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:48.777
(audience laughing)

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:49.860
She said yes!

00:06:51.113 --> 00:06:52.497
That was the key.

00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:53.746
I married the most beautiful woman

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.070
I'd ever seen in my--

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.129
'all ever been to a wedding

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.499
and even before the wedding
starts you hear this.

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.199
"How in the world?"

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.470
(audience laughing)

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.456
And it was coming from
my side of the family!

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:09.456
(audience laughing)

00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:13.511
We get married, we have a few children.

00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:15.555
Our lives are great.

00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:19.223
One day Trina finds a
lump in her left breast.

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:20.999
Breast cancer.

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:23.612
Six years after that diagnosis,

00:07:23.612 --> 00:07:28.375
me and my two little boys
walked up to mommy's casket

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.973
and for two years my heart didn't beat.

00:07:30.973 --> 00:07:32.685
If it wasn't for my faith in God

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.350
I wouldn't be standing here today.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.753
If it wasn't for those two little boys,

00:07:36.753 --> 00:07:40.476
there'd have been no
reason for which to go on.

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:42.309
I was completely lost.

00:07:44.034 --> 00:07:45.784
That was rock bottom.

00:07:46.873 --> 00:07:48.874
You know what sustained me?

00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:51.696
The wisdom of a third grade dropout.

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:54.029
The wisdom of a simple cook.

00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:56.236
We're at the casket.

00:07:56.236 --> 00:07:58.418
I'd never seen my dad cry

00:07:58.418 --> 00:07:59.852
but this time I saw my dad cry.

00:07:59.852 --> 00:08:00.810
That was his daughter.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.230
Trina was his daughter

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.751
not his daughter-in-law.

00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:05.121
And I'm right behind my father

00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:08.002
about to see her for the
last time on this earth

00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:09.771
and my father shared three words with me

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.581
that changed my life
right there at the casket.

00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:15.483
It would be the last lesson
he would ever teach me.

00:08:15.483 --> 00:08:16.650
He said, "Son,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.664
"just stand.

00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:22.084
"You keep standing.

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:22.917
"You keep standing.

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:24.986
"No matter how rough the
sea, you keep standing.

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:27.225
"And I'm not talking about just water.

00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:29.020
"You keep standing.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.063
"No matter what, you don't give up."

00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:35.557
And as clearly as I'm
talking to you today,

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.346
these were some of her last words to me.

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:40.987
She looked me in the eye and she said,

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:44.354
"It doesn't matter to me
any longer how long I live.

00:08:44.354 --> 00:08:46.269
"What matters to me most

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:48.199
"is how I live."

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:50.164
I ask you all one question,

00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:52.261
a question that I was asked all my life

00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:54.419
by a third grade dropout.

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:56.353
"How you livin'?

00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:57.376
"How you livin'?"

00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:59.539
Everyday ask yourself that question.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.675
How you livin'?

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:04.638
Here's, here's what a cook would suggest

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:06.839
you to live, this way.

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.481
That you would not judge,

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.734
that you would show up early,

00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:12.372
that you'd be kind,

00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:15.497
that you'd make sure
that that servant's towel

00:09:15.497 --> 00:09:16.748
is huge and used,

00:09:16.748 --> 00:09:18.391
that if you're gonna do something,

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.141
you do it the right way.

00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:22.506
That cook would tell you this,

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:24.828
that it's never wrong
to do the right thing,

00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:26.576
that how you do anything

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:28.520
is how you do everything.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.569
And in that way you
will grow your influence

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:31.928
to make an impact.

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:33.384
In that way you will honor all those

00:09:33.384 --> 00:09:34.728
who have gone before you,

00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:35.971
who have invested in you.

00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:39.101
Look in those unlikeliest
places for wisdom.

00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:43.344
Enhance your life every
day by seeking that wisdom

00:09:43.344 --> 00:09:45.825
and asking yourself every night,

00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:47.111
"How am I living?"

00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:48.438
May God richly bless you all.

00:09:48.438 --> 00:09:49.898
Thank you for having me.

00:09:49.898 --> 00:09:54.090
(audience cheering and applauding)

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.923
(uplifting music)
