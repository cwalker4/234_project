00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.587
So this is a hotel room,
kind of like the one I'm staying in.

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:17.731
I get bored sometimes.

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.158
A room like this has not a lot
to offer for entertainment.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:25.687
But for a hacker, it gets a little
interesting because that television

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:28.136
is not like the television in your home,

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:31.058
it's a node on a network. Right?

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:33.442
That means I can mess with it.

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:37.694
If I plug a little device
like this into my computer,

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:40.499
it's an infrared transceiver,
I can send the codes that

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.524
the TV remote might send
and some other codes.

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:47.128
So what?
Well, I can watch movies for free.

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:49.275
(Laughter)

00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:53.681
That doesn't matter to me so much,
but I can play video games too.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.734
Hey, but what's this?

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.010
I can not only do this
for my TV in my hotel room,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.822
I can control your TV in your hotel room.

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:05.006
(Laughter)

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.906
So I can watch you
if you're checking out with one of these,

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.892
you know, TV based registration things,

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:13.512
if you're surfing
the web on your hotel TV,

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:16.224
I can watch you do it.

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.983
Sometimes it's interesting stuff.

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:22.374
Funds transfer.

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:25.830
Really big funds transfers.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.041
You never know what people
might want to do

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:31.528
while they're surfing the web
from their hotel room.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:34.633
(Laughter)

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:38.122
The point is I get to decide
if you're watching Disney or porn tonight.

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:40.141
Anybody else staying 
at the Affinia hotel?

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.614
(Laughter)

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:46.722
This is a project I worked on
when we were trying to figure out

00:01:46.722 --> 00:01:50.196
the security properties of wireless
networks; it's called the "Hackerbot".

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:54.007
This is a robot we've built that can
drive around and find Wi-Fi users,

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.358
drive up to them and show them
their passwords on the screen.

00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:00.621
(Laughter)

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.572
We just wanted to build a robot,

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:05.143
but we didn't know
what to make it do, so -

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:07.338
We made the pistol
version of the same thing.

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:09.131
This is called the "Sniper Yagi".

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.010
It's for your long-range
password sniffing action,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.669
about a mile away I can watch
your wireless network.

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.648
This is a project I worked on with
Ben Laurie to show passive surveillance.

00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:22.171
So what it is, is a map
of the conference called

00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:23.837
"Computers, Freedom and Privacy".

00:02:23.837 --> 00:02:28.774
And this conference was
in a hotel, and what we did is we,

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:31.346
you know, put a computer
in each room of the conference

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:33.284
that logged all the Bluetooth traffic.

00:02:33.284 --> 00:02:36.376
So as everybody came and went
with their phones and laptops

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.667
we were able to just log that,
correlate it,

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:42.088
and then I can print out a map like this
for everybody at the conference.

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:45.541
This is Kim Cameron,
the Chief Privacy Architect at Microsoft.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.468
(Laughter)

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:49.139
Unbeknownst to him,

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.880
I got to see everywhere he went.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.023
And I can correlate this
and show who he hangs out with

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:58.007
(phone dialing)
when he got bored,

00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.521
(phone dialing)
hangs out in the lobby with somebody.

00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.964
Anybody here use cellphones?

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:04.616
(Laughter)

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:08.488
(Phone ringing)

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:12.459
So my phone is calling -

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.711
(Ringing)

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.429
calling -

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:25.769
Voice mail: You have 100 messages.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.586
Palbos Holman: Uh oh!

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:29.744
VM: First unheard message -

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.086
PH: Where do I press -

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.367
VM: Message skipped.
First skipped message.

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:34.603
PH: Uh oh!

00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:38.133
VM: Main menu. To listen to your -
You have pressed an incorrect key -

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.933
You have two skipped messages.
Three saved messages.

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:42.583
Goodbye.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:46.264
PH: Uh oh!
So we're in Brad's voice mail.

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:47.994
(Laughter)

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.240
And I was going to record him
a new message,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.673
but I seem to have pressed an invalid key,

00:03:52.673 --> 00:03:54.323
so we're going to move on.

00:03:54.323 --> 00:03:57.963
And I'll explain how that works some
other day because we're short on time.

00:03:57.963 --> 00:04:00.114
Anybody here used MySpace?

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:01.745
MySpace users? Oh!

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.111
Used to be popular.
It's kind of like Facebook.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.663
This guy, a buddy of ours Samy,
was trying to meet chicks on MySpace

00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:10.824
which I think is what
it used to be good for.

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:15.514
And what he did is he had
a page on MySpace about him.

00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:19.075
It lists all your friends,
and that's how you know

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:22.031
somebody's cool is that they have
a lot of friends on MySpace.

00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.852
Well, Samy didn't have any friends.

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:27.743
He wrote a little bit of Javascript code
that he put in his page,

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:29.585
so that whenever you look at his page

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:32.028
it would just automagically
add you as his friend.

00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:35.369
And it would skip the whole
acknowledgement response protocol

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.703
saying "Is Samy really your friend?"

00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:40.939
But then it would copy
that code onto your page,

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.045
so that whenever anybody
looked at your page

00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:45.856
it would automatically add them
as Samy's friend too.

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:46.925
(Laughter)

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.514
And it would change your page
to say that "Samy is your hero."

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:52.023
(Laughter)

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:56.442
So in under 24 hours, Samy had
over a million friends on MySpace.

00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:58.615
(Laughter)

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:03.415
Hey, he just finished serving
3-years probation for that.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.656
(Laughter)

00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:09.819
Even better, Christopher Abad,
this guy, another hacker,

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.492
also trying to meet chicks
on MySpace but having spotty results.

00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:15.653
Some of these dates
didn't work out so well,

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:19.678
so what Abad did
is he wrote a little bit of code

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:25.602
to connect MySpace to Spam Assassin,
which is an open source spam filter.

00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:28.045
It works just like
the spam filter in your email.

00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.280
You train it by giving it some spam

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.862
train it by giving it a little
bit of legitimate email,

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:34.869
and it tries to use
artificial intelligence

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.270
to work out the difference. Right?

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.262
Well, he just trained it on profiles
from girls he dated and liked

00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:43.088
as legitimate email.

00:05:43.088 --> 00:05:46.745
Profiles from girls he dated
and not liked, as spam,

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:50.347
and then ran it against
every profile on MySpace.

00:05:50.347 --> 00:05:52.923
(Laughter)

00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:56.088
Out spits girls you might like to date.

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:59.326
What I say about Abad is, I think,
there's like three startups here.

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:02.531
I don't know why we need Match.com,
when we can have Spam dating?

00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:05.105
You know this is innovation.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.461
He's got a problem, he found a solution.

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:12.053
Does anybody use these - bleep -
keys for opening your car remotely?

00:06:12.053 --> 00:06:16.421
They're popular in, well,
maybe not Chicago, OK.

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.929
So kids these days will drive
through a Wal-Mart parking lot

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.493
clicking open, open, open, bloop.

00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:25.570
Eventually you find another
Jetta or whatever just like yours,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.555
maybe a different color,
that uses the same key code.

00:06:29.714 --> 00:06:31.931
Kids will just loot it, lock it up and go.

00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:34.102
Your insurance company
will roll over on you

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.184
because there's not
evidence of a break-in.

00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:39.626
For one manufacturer we figured
out how to manipulate that key

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:43.373
so that it will open every car
from that manufacturer.

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:44.659
(Laughter)

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.930
There is a point to be made about this
which I barely have time for,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.184
but it's that your car is now a PC,
your phone is also a PC,

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:55.723
your toaster, if it is not a PC,
soon will be. Right?

00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:57.757
And I'm not joking about that.

00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:00.192
And the point of that is
that when that happens

00:07:00.192 --> 00:07:04.342
you inherit all the security
properties and problems of PC's.

00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:06.462
And we have a lot of them.

00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:09.262
So keep that in mind,
we can talk more about that later.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.575
Anybody use a lock like this
on your front door?

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.528
OK, good.

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:15.895
I do too.

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:17.205
This is a Schlage lock.

00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:19.800
It's on half of the front doors
in America.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.240
I brought one to show you.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.437
So this is my Schlage lock.

00:07:25.437 --> 00:07:30.413
This is a key that fits the lock,
but isn't cut right, so it won't turn it.

00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:34.702
Anybody here ever tried
to pick locks with tools like this?

00:07:34.702 --> 00:07:39.207
All right, got a few,
few nefarious lock pickers.

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.994
Well, it's for kids with OCD.

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.615
You've got to put them in there,
and finick with them,

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:47.613
spend hours getting the finesse
down to manipulate the pins.

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:51.457
You know, for the ADD kids in the house
there's an easier way.

00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:53.226
I put my little magic key in here,

00:07:53.226 --> 00:07:55.917
I put a little pressure on there
to turn it, (Tapping)

00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:59.253
smack it a few times
with this special mallet

00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:02.322
and I just picked the lock. We're in.

00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:05.094
It's easy.

00:08:05.094 --> 00:08:08.309
And in fact, I don't really know
much more about this than you do.

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:09.897
It's really, really easy.

00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:12.328
I have a keychain I made
of the same kind of key

00:08:12.328 --> 00:08:14.508
for every other lock in America.

00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:19.442
And if you're interested,
I bought a key machine

00:08:19.442 --> 00:08:22.510
so that I can cut these keys
and I made some for all of you guys.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.710
(Laughter)

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.604
(Applause)

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:28.256
So my gift to you,
come afterwards and I will show you

00:08:28.256 --> 00:08:30.609
how to pick a lock
and give you one of these keys

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.628
you can take home and try it on your door.

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:35.663
Anybody used these USB thumb drives?

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:39.378
Yeah, print my Word document, yeah!

00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:42.574
They're very popular.

00:08:42.574 --> 00:08:46.489
Mine works kind of like yours.
You can print my Word document for me.

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:50.015
But while you're doing that,
invisibly and magically in the background

00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:54.056
it's just making a handy backup
of your My Documents folder,

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:58.132
and your browser history and cookies
and your registry and password database,

00:08:58.132 --> 00:09:02.076
and all the things that you might need
someday if you have a problem.

00:09:02.076 --> 00:09:05.963
So we just like to make these things
and litter them around at conferences.

00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:09.758
(Laughter)

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.977
Anybody here use credit cards?

00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:13.145
(Laughter)

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:14.435
Oh, good!

00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:17.956
Yeah, so they're popular
and wildly secure.

00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:19.210
(Laughter)

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.506
Well, there's new credit cards
that you might have gotten in the mail

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:25.538
with a letter explaining how
it's your new "Secure credit card".

00:09:25.538 --> 00:09:27.004
Anybody get one of these?

00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:31.593
You know it's secure because
it has a chip in it, an RFID tag,

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:34.792
and you can use these in
Taxicabs and at Starbucks,

00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:37.956
I brought one to show you,
by just touching the reader.

00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:39.969
Has anybody seen these before?

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.451
Okay, who's got one?

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:45.960
Bring it on up here.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.910
(Laughter)

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.616
There's a prize in it for you.

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:53.622
I just want to show you
some things we learned about them.

00:09:53.622 --> 00:09:55.663
I got this credit card in the mail.

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:58.219
I really do need some volunteers,
in fact, I need

00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:01.207
one, two, three, four, five
volunteers because the winners

00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:04.221
are going to get these
awesome stainless steel wallets

00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:08.270
that protect you against the problem that
you guessed, I'm about to demonstrate.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.570
Bring your credit card up here
and I'll show you.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.158
I want to try it on one of these
awesome new credit cards.

00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:15.670
OK.

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:21.258
Do we have a conference organizer,

00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:23.872
somebody who can coerce people
into cooperating?

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:24.825
(Laughing)

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:28.583
It's by your own volition because -

00:10:29.573 --> 00:10:32.708
This is where the demo gets really awesome

00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:34.370
I know you guys have never seen -

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.564
(Inaudible question)

00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:37.092
What's that?

00:10:37.092 --> 00:10:40.626
They're really cool wallets
made of stainless steel.

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.867
Anybody else seen code
on screen at TED before?

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.001
Yeah, this is pretty awesome.

00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:49.808
(Laughter)

00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:53.432
OK, great I got volunteers.

00:10:53.432 --> 00:10:56.590
So who has one of these
exciting credit cards?

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.282
OK, here we go.

00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:01.506
I'm about to share
your credit card number

00:11:01.506 --> 00:11:03.890
only to 350 close friends.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.194
Hear the beep?

00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:08.780
That means someone's hacking
your credit card.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.107
OK, what did we get?

00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:14.623
Valued customer and the credit
card number and expiration date.

00:11:14.623 --> 00:11:18.916
It turns out your secure new
credit card is not totally secure.

00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:21.894
Anybody else want to try yours
while you're here?

00:11:21.894 --> 00:11:24.053
Man: Can you install overdraft protection?

00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:26.478
PH: Beep, let's see what we got?

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:28.842
So we bitched about
this and AMEX changed it,

00:11:28.842 --> 00:11:31.146
so it doesn't show the name anymore.

00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:35.483
Which is progress.
You can see mine, if it shows it.

00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:40.702
Yeah, it shows my name on it,
that's what my Mom calls me anyway.

00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:43.395
Yours doesn't have it.

00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:48.530
Anyway, so next time you get
something in the mail

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.957
that says it's secure, send it to me.

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:54.582
(Laughter)

00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:59.046
Oh wait, one of these is empty, hold on.

00:12:00.856 --> 00:12:03.459
I think this is the one, yep, here you go.

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:05.422
You get the one that's disassembled.

00:12:05.422 --> 00:12:06.829
All right, cool.

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:10.351
(Applause)

00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:14.094
I still have a few minutes yet left,
so I'm going to make a couple of points.

00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:15.025
(Laughter)

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:16.512
Oh, shit.

00:12:16.512 --> 00:12:21.039
That's my subliminal messaging campaign.
It was supposed to be much faster.

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:25.209
Here's the most exciting slide
ever shown at TED.

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:27.502
This is the protocol diagram for SSL,

00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:29.853
which is the encryption
system in your web browser

00:12:29.853 --> 00:12:33.324
that protects your credit card when you're
sending it to Amazon and so on.

00:12:33.324 --> 00:12:35.341
Very exciting, I know, but the point is

00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:39.173
hackers will attack every
point in this protocol, right?

00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:42.795
I'm going to send two responses
when the server's expecting one.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:45.664
I'm going to send a zero
when it's expecting a one.

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:48.506
I'm going to send twice as much
data as it's expecting.

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:51.384
I'm going to take twice as long
answering as it's expecting.

00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:54.406
Just try a bunch of stuff.
See where it breaks.

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.218
See what falls in my lap.

00:12:56.218 --> 00:13:01.282
When I find a hole like that
then I can start looking for an exploit.

00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:06.240
This is a little more what SSL looks
like to hackers, that's really boring.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.747
This guy kills a million Africans a year.

00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:14.791
It's Anopheles stephensi mosquito
carrying malaria.

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:17.788
Is this the wrong talk?

00:13:17.788 --> 00:13:19.403
(Laughter)

00:13:19.403 --> 00:13:23.258
This is a protocol diagram for malaria.

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:27.477
So what we're doing in our lab
is attacking this protocol

00:13:27.477 --> 00:13:29.681
at every point we can find.

00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:32.758
It has a very complex life cycle
that I won't go into now,

00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:36.227
but it spends some time in humans,
some time in mosquitos

00:13:36.227 --> 00:13:39.467
and what I need are hackers.

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:43.508
Because hackers have a mind
that's optimized for discovery.

00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:47.407
They have a mind that's optimized
for figuring out what's possible.

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:49.805
You know, I often illustrate this
by saying,

00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:54.676
If you get some random new
gadget and show it to your Mom,

00:13:55.455 --> 00:13:59.245
she might say, "Well, what does this do?"
And you'd say "Mom, it's a phone."

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:02.566
And instantly, she'd would know
exactly what it's for.

00:14:02.566 --> 00:14:05.085
But with a hacker,
the question is different.

00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:08.909
The question is,
"What can I make this do?"

00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:12.029
I'm going to take all the screws out,
and take the back off,

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:13.984
and break it into a lot of little pieces.

00:14:13.984 --> 00:14:17.343
But then I'm going to figure out
what I can build from the rubble.

00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:21.299
That's discovery, and we need to do that
in science and technology

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:23.439
to figure out what's possible.

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:27.118
And so in the lab what I'm trying
to do is apply that mindset

00:14:27.118 --> 00:14:29.583
to some of the biggest
problems humans have.

00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:34.152
We work on malaria, thanks to
Bill Gates, who asked us to work on it.

00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:36.863
This is how we used to solve malaria.

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:39.070
This is a real ad from like the 40's.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.205
We eradicated malaria in the US
by spraying DDT everywhere.

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:48.505
In the lab what we do is a lot of work
to try and understand the problem.

00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:53.658
This is a high-speed video,
we have a badass video camera,

00:14:53.658 --> 00:14:56.293
trying to learn how mosquitos fly.

00:14:56.293 --> 00:14:59.441
And you can see that
they're more like swimming in air.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.299
We actually have no idea how they fly.

00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:03.520
But we have a cool video camera so we -

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.534
(Laughter)

00:15:05.534 --> 00:15:09.245
Yeah, it cost more than a Ferrari.

00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:12.395
Anyway we came up with some
ways to take care of mosquitos.

00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:14.807
Let's shoot them down with laser beams.

00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:19.318
This is what happens when you put
one of every kind of scientist in a room

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.318
and a laser junky.

00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:25.237
So people thought it was funny at first,

00:15:25.237 --> 00:15:30.076
but we figured out, you know, we can
build this out of consumer electronics.

00:15:30.076 --> 00:15:33.390
It's using the CCD from a webcam,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.590
the laser from a Blu-ray burner,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.212
the laser galvo is from a laser printer.

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:43.220
We do motion detection on a GPU processor

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.414
like you might find in video game system.

00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:47.343
It's all stuff that follows Moore's law.

00:15:47.343 --> 00:15:50.228
So it's actually not going to
be that expensive to do it.

00:15:50.228 --> 00:15:52.466
The idea is that we would put

00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:56.317
a perimeter of these laser systems
around a building or a village

00:15:56.317 --> 00:15:59.507
and just shoot all the mosquitos
on their way in to feed on humans.

00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:02.800
And we might want to do that
for your backyard.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.763
We could also do it to protect crops.

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:06.629
Our team is right now working on

00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:09.285
characterizing what they
need to do the same thing for

00:16:09.285 --> 00:16:12.899
the pest that has wiped out
about two thirds

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:16.477
of the Orange groves in Florida.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.719
So people laughed at first.

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:23.441
This is a video of our system working.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.119
We are tracking mosquitos live
as they fly around.

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.622
Those crosshairs are put there
by our computer.

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.483
It just watches them, finds them moving

00:16:30.483 --> 00:16:34.217
and then it aims a laser at them
to sample their wing beat frequency.

00:16:34.217 --> 00:16:37.424
Figure out from that, is this a mosquito?

00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:40.325
Is it Anopheles Stephensi?
Is it female?

00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:44.912
And if all that's true then
we shoot it down with lethal laser.

00:16:44.912 --> 00:16:46.981
(Laughter)

00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:48.753
So we have this working in a lab.

00:16:48.753 --> 00:16:51.879
We're working on taking
that project into the field now.

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:56.425
All this happens at the Intellectual
Ventures Lab in Seattle where I work

00:16:56.425 --> 00:17:01.626
and we try and take on some
of the hardest problems that humans have.

00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:03.468
This is the money shot.

00:17:03.468 --> 00:17:06.731
You can see we just burned
his wing off with a UV laser.

00:17:06.731 --> 00:17:08.849
He's not coming back.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.072
(Applause)

00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:15.874
Kind of vaporized
his wing right there, yeah.

00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:18.636
They love it.
I mean, you know.

00:17:18.636 --> 00:17:20.769
Never got called by PETA or anyone else.

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:23.226
I mean, it's the perfect enemy.

00:17:23.226 --> 00:17:26.379
There's just no one coming
to the rescue of mosquitos.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.660
Sometimes we overdo it.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.093
So anyway, I'm going to get off stage.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:35.141
This is the Intellectual Ventures Lab
where I work.

00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:37.835
Basically we use every kind of scientist

00:17:37.835 --> 00:17:42.185
and one of every tool in the world
to work on crazy invention projects.

00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:43.537
Thanks.

00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:45.285
(Applause)
