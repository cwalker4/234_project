00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.160
We're driving through a river right now
in the Jeep.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.860
For thousands of years,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.470
humans have drawn lines on the Earth,
dividing the planet into nations, but

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.220
there are some parts of the world that
no empire, nation, or state has been able to tame.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.060
Just the geography here is
completely unruly.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.180
Land that is so high,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.700
so rugged, that states have found it
impossible to exert control.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.460
We're about to hit 4,000 meters, feeling the effects.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.660
These are called non-state spaces.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.060
Definitely feels like humans were never
meant to be here

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.040
And the people who

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.660
settle in these places sought refuge
from borders.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.230
But even here, among the highest
mountains in the world,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.740
this stateless lifestyle is coming to an
end.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.000
Non-state spaces have always existed,
all over the globe. They're usually high

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.630
up in mountains, far from the reach of
any government and the people who live

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.440
here didn't come here by chance. Most of
them are communities who fled into the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.940
mountains to evade expanding government
forces, some communities were escaping

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.430
capture like those in Africa fleeing
from the Arab and Atlantic slave trades.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.880
Other groups retreated to remote
regions to escape ruling powers who they

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.350
opposed, from the Inuit and the Arctic,
to the Berbers in North Africa, to the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.399
Jivaroan in the Amazon rainforest.
Examples exist all over the globe of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.200
people who chose rugged terrain over
taxes, war, famine, and subjugation from

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.619
state powers. Today, there are some 5,000
indigenous groups living in 90 countries,

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.509
numbering in total around 370 million
people worldwide. 70% of those are in

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.860
Asia. Most of these groups have
integrated into countries, but for those

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.300
who reside deep in the mountains,
geography has largely held off the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.140
influence of any kind of centralized
government.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.100
So I came up here to visit

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.820
one community that fled to the mountains
1,200 years ago. Back then the Tibetan

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.810
Empire, which was just north of here was
pursuing its own state-making project,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.310
its own empire, and it was growing. As the
Tibetan Empire grew, its borders

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.900
eventually encompassed the Bon religion.
This was a religious group that predates

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.730
Buddhism. The Bon fought to preserve its
culture within the Tibetan Empire. They

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.720
resisted the Empire, but eventually
failed and instead of assimilated to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.190
this new Empire, they fled and they came
here to these mountains, where they

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.380
created a life away from the militaries,
the taxes, the religion, and the control

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.300
of the Tibetan Empire and that life
continues today.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.480
Eventually this whole area would be
drawn into a modern state, the state of

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.159
Nepal. And Tibet, where these people came
from, would become China. But these people

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.900
don't identify as Chinese, or necessarily
Nepali. People here, they wanted the kids

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.420
to learn to Tibetan, like as their
language, because we are more related

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.060
with the Tibetan culture.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.240
The 25 families that live here 
have their own distinct identity.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.480
They speak their own dialect of
Tibetan. They mainly live off the land,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.180
farming and raising animals to survive.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.480
The Himalayan mountain range is
particularly rich with these examples of

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.079
non-state spaces. So many examples in
fact, that a group of anthropologists

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.670
argue that this place should actually be
its own region. They use the term  Zomia

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.760
to describe this long range of mountains
where people have set up for thousands

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.400
of years without the help of governments
of states.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.449
The borders of this Zomia

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.199
concept encompass a hundred million
people. It runs through eight countries,

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.400
but is on the periphery of each. The
diverse set of peoples living here have

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.210
a varying degree of interaction with
their country governments. I came to this

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.610
region, one of the most remote zones
within Zomia, but even here you can feel

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.940
that Zomia's stateless days are
numbered.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.540
Everywhere you go up here, you see herds
of animals, shepherds guiding them

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.360
through the mountains. After leaving this
Bon village I moved north and came

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.690
across a different community, where this
family's lifestyle is based almost

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.150
entirely on the movement of their
animals. We're at 4,200 meters, Tibet is

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.320
just right over this hill.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.400
And I'm hanging out with some yak today.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.240
This family's actually nomadic, they're constantly

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.560
moving around throughout the year, so
they'll be in this pasture for a little

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.699
bit while the yak will graze here and
eat this grass, and then they'll move on

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.590
to another place. Meanwhile the grasses
here will have time to regenerate, the

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.639
dung from these yak right now will help
fertilize the land, and they'll

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.590
eventually come back here, maybe next
year, and they will find a pasture full

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.849
of really wonderful grass that's full of
nutrients that their yak can graze again.

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.880
And there's no external inputs to this,
there's no fertilizer or irrigation infrastructure.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.560
And this whole process and
technique hinges on their ability to be

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.659
able to move freely throughout this
region, which hasn't been a problem for

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.710
hundreds of years as this place has been
basically rid of any sort of borders or

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.840
control. But that's changing very quickly.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.420
This is where the Tibetan language is
spoken. The many communities in these

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.330
mountains have always considered
themselves Tibetan, moving freely into

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.759
Tibet for trade and religious practices,
but in 1950 China controversially

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:20.250
annexed Tibet. They eventually negotiated
this border line with Nepal. Notice that

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.180
it goes right through what these people
think of as Tibet. The yak grazers I met

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.139
are mostly based down here on the Nepal
side, and luckily for them this border

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.729
only existed in theory. The yak grazers
continue to graze their animals deep

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.190
into Tibet, as they had for hundreds of years, but over the

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.150
years China started getting rich, which
came with a renewed desire to project

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.260
its influence and protect its borders,
especially in Tibet where people were

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.370
fleeing to get away from Chinese rule.
China now had the money, technology,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.720
geopolitical motive to start taming this
region. They started crushing protests

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.200
from Tibetans and setting up military
infrastructure on the Tibetan Plateau

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.050
and in 1999 they built this fence on the
border, marking the end of the unfettered

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.980
mobility that these people had depended
on for centuries in this non-state space.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.460
This place that had been too high for
borders, suddenly had to adapt to the

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.400
first concept of boundaries and control
coming from far away governments.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.180
I wanted to go see this fence. At over 15,000 feet above sea

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.080
level, it has to be one of the highest
borders on Earth.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.800
So I'm on the windy

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:59.289
Tibetan Plateau, looking at the border
but we're half a kilometer away and

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:05.449
something really weird has happened. My
driver who's Nepali stopped and said we

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.409
can't go any further. I was like well
we're on Nepali sovereign territory, why

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:12.199
would why couldn't we just go up to the
fence? You'd be able to do this at every

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:15.590
other country I've ever been to. He said
no, the Chinese will come over and they'll

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:20.990
snatch us. Now we're still very much on
the Nepali, side but the Chinese come in

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.940
here routinely to ask questions, to even
detain people randomly. They have

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.810
surveillance, they have watch towers
even on the Nepali side. China now has

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.190
the technology and political motive to
exert control in this remote and rugged

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.620
region, to militarize its border here.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.779
This isn't the only effort by a faraway
government to tame this region. The

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.920
governments of Nepal, India, and China are
also building the first roads here.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.340
It's a lofty goal.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.340
So we've got a landslide 
on the road, which means we can

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.630
go no further in the Jeep. And we're
gonna have to hike. The thinking here is

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.480
that a road system could serve as a
trade artery through the Himalaya Mountains,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.540
eventually. We're stuck again,
this time on a waterfall with a 200-foot

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.950
cliff by the side of it. And so yes, while
these state forces are slowly

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:26.350
encroaching on this terrain, it's going
to be long work and it's not going to be

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.089
easy. They're slowly chipping away, but
man this place just was never meant to

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.000
be tamed.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.520
Nepal is sandwiched between

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.680
the two largest countries on Earth,
divided by these massive Himalaya Mountains.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.820
A road would create an
enormous trade opportunity between these countries.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.100
So there's been a blitz of construction

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.340
projects aimed at creating a viable road
through this mountain pass. The Indian

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.570
government is funding projects like this
bridge, and locals told me that the

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.080
Chinese government routinely sends
building materials to help construction.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.530
The road still has a long way to go
before it can sustain large flows of

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:18.240
goods, but even now the road is reshaping
the relationship that these communities

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.240
have with the outside world, shifting
their economy from bartering to cash-based

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.520
markets where residents can create
businesses around cheap goods from China.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.520
And as always with change, there are
winners and losers.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.980
Everything here is made of yak.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.740
This tent, which is made entirely
of yak wool.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.620
Yak cheese,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.760
Tea with yak butter in it.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.940
Drinking yak milk, which is extremely delicious.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.910
These people who are used to bartering
and are used to living off of the

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.180
products of their animals, are having a
hard time integrating, having a hard time

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.280
finding a space in this new economy that
is based on cash, is based on big

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.200
international flows of goods.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.339
That Bon community whose customs had
been so well preserved in these

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.200
mountains, have also felt the effects of
this road.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.040
People are leaving. Children
especially. Parents want to educate their

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.240
kids and they are sending them to India
or to Kathmandu to get educated. A lot of

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.780
these kids will go their entire
childhood without actually being in this community.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.980
You have to remember these people set up in the mountains

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.500
specifically to preserve their tradition

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.100
and culture, and so to see it disappear
overnight

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.259
due to these modernizing forces, is
giving people a lot of anxiety. The way

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:59.769
they've solved this is that they're
building this school, that is based on

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:05.000
educating children in the Bon tradition
and the language of this community.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.560
But despite the disruptive effects of the
road, most people I talk to are still

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.680
happy it's here.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.720
For centuries people have escaped

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.360
modern civilization by fleeing to the
mountains, but now generations later, for

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.820
some these mountains can feel more like
a trap than a refuge.
