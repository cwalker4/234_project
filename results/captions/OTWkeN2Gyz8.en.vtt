Kim Jong-Un

00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:18.898
was his great honor.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.432
I mean, then again, when you
have appeared

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:22.301
in a McDonald's commercial
talking to Grimace,

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:24.103
everything seems like an
honor.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.272
I get it. I get it.

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:29.275
But this alone--this alone is
what North Korea has been

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.943

Equal standing with the
American president,

lost his nuts in that room.

I mean, this is--this is not a
strong piece of paper.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.553
- Because you realize Kim
didn't commit to anything.

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.822
He basically Facebook RSVP'd
a nuclear deal.

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:19.959
That's all he did.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.528
And while Kim gave up nothing
major,

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.065
he got the American president
to give up a lot more.

South Korea.

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:49.088
Yeah, good luck.

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:51.223
We've been trying to figure out
Trump's accurate meaning

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:53.525
and intentions since the day he
stepped off that escalator.

00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:54.526
Yeah.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.061
But this is incredible.

00:09:56.094 --> 00:09:58.764
Kim Jong-Un went up against the
world's greatest negotiator,

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.166
the man who literally hired
someone to write

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:02.868
"The Art of the Deal"

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.872
and got him to give up
something for nothing.

00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:09.942
It's almost like Kim Jong-Un
did a Jedi mind trick on Trump.

00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:14.513
You know, Trump was like, "Yes,
I will stop military exercises,

00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:16.415
"and I will also pick you up
from the airport.

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:18.984
It'll be fun."

00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:21.387
Like, Kim Jong-Un, he owned the
summit so hard.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.024
By the end, he'd even turned
the leader of the free world

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.359

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.690 line:0%
How do you trust a killer like
that?

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.491 line:0%

00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:01.260 line:0%
His people, you see the fervor.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:02.695 line:0%
 They have a great fervor.

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:04.797 line:0%
I think they're gonna end up
with a very strong country

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.500 line:0%
and a country which has people
that--

00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:11.070 line:0%
they're so hardworking,
so industrious.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:14.973
- So--so you saw people
enslaved in labor camps,

00:11:15.006 --> 00:11:18.410
and you thought, "Man, these
people love their jobs."

00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:19.845
Really, Donald?

00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:21.680
This is what happens when
you're friends with Kanye West.

00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:24.483
I mean...and now--and now,
don't get me wrong.

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:25.884
Don't get me wrong.

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:27.553
I'm not saying President Trump
shouldn't have negotiated

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.054
with Kim Jong-Un at all.

00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:32.224
But there's a big gap between
being civil with the person

00:11:32.257 --> 00:11:34.760
and endorsing the Freddy
Krueger of human rights.

00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:36.895
The only part of that summit
that didn't seem to go

00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:39.698
Kim's way is when Donald Trump
slipped up

00:11:39.731 --> 00:11:43.969
and appeared to make a fat joke
about his new friend.

00:11:57.415 --> 00:12:00.453

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:07.693

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:10.362
Yo, the look on Kim Jong-Un's
face.

00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:12.030
It's like a scene out of "The
Office."

00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:15.434
Like, he's--you can see he's
thinking, "Make him look thin.

00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:17.603
"You mean I'm not thin?

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:18.637
"Why didn't anyone tell me?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.705
Was it the death camps?"

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.340
Why didn't you tell me?"

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:23.208
And I guess from Trump's
perspective,

00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:25.477
this is what he got out of the
whole summit.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.779
Yeah, when he gets back to the
White House,

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:28.380
his people are gonna be like,
"Mr. President,

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:30.182
you sold America down the
river."

00:12:30.215 --> 00:12:33.085
And he'll be like, "Yeah, but
did you see that fat joke?

00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:34.887
Worth it."

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.089
Cleary what happened here was
Trump didn't feel the need

00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:38.657
to prepare for a nuclear
summit, because he thought

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.627
his million-dollar listing
skills would carry him through.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.329
And it turns out if the sales
pitch fails,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:48.033
he knows that he can always
fall back on his other skill.

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.868 line:0%
- I think he's--I think,
honestly,

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:52.538 line:0%
I may be wrong.

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.673 line:0%
I mean, I may stand before you
in six months and say,

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:56.809 line:0%
"Hey, I was wrong."

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.143 line:0%
I don't know that I'll every
admit that,

kind of an excuse.

00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:05.217
- Ah, truth Trump,
my favorite Trump.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.820
He basically just admitted that
this whole deal is as shaky

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:10.656
as one of his casinos,
only if this thing falls apart,

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:13.959
instead of bankruptcy,
there's a nuclear war.

00:13:13.992 --> 00:13:17.196
- First up, after Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.798

chemical weapons last week,

would respond with military
action.

00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:26.672
And because this is a decision
that could lead to

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:29.408
an all-out war, the president
announced his decision

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:32.044
