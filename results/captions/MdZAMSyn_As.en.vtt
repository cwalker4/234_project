00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:10.792
Six years ago, I was sitting out
with some friends in New York City

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.167
when I got a notification on my phone,

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:17.965
and I was surprised to find that I had
a text message from my grandmother.

00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.535
I was surprised because my grandmother
at the time was 78 years old,

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:24.519
and she had never sent a text before.

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:27.673
And I will tell you
the first text was adorable.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:33.862
It read, "Dear Andrew,
trying out texting. Love, your grandma."

00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:37.563
I was like "Aw, she thinks it's a letter!"

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:39.408
So I sent her a message back,

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:42.362
"Hey grandma, it's a text.
You don't have to include all that."

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:43.835
Her response was "Dear Andrew,

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.372
Okay. Love, your grandma."

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:50.069
My favorite part is it's always
"Love, your grandma,"

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:52.655
like if it was "Love, grandma"
I'd be confused.

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:56.056
If it was like, "Dear Andrew,
have a good time in Texas. Love, grandma,"

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.889
I'd be like "Grandma? Who's grandma?"

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:59.889
(Laughter)

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.321
But my grandmother's still
figuring some things out.

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.844
A couple of years ago,
I went to Switzerland for work,

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:06.793
came back, sent a message to grandmother:

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:09.040
''Hey grandma, just got back
from Switzerland.''

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.320
Her response was, ''Dear Andrew, 
Switzerland? WTF.''

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.926
(Laughter)

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.592
All right, so I called my grandmother up,

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:21.350
''Grandma, what do you think WTF means?''

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.347
And she's like,

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:25.378
''Oh well, someone at Bridge told me
it means 'Wow That's Fun.''

00:01:25.378 --> 00:01:27.036
(Laughter)

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.267
I was like, ''That is exactly
what it means.''

00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:32.212
I'm not going to explain that
to my grandmother.

00:01:32.212 --> 00:01:33.884
But over time, I've come to realize

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:36.074
that I think the world
would be a happier place

00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:38.206
if more people thought WTF -

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:41.590
if more people were like my grandmother
and thought, "Wow, that's fun."

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.861
Because in 2012, I left my corporate job
at Procter and Gamble

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.771
to teach people about the value of humor.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:52.253
I've worked with more than 35,000 people
at more than 250 organizations

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:56.532
on how to be more productive,
less stressed and happier, using humor.

00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.600
But when people hear what it is that I do,
they are a little bit skeptical,

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.653
(Laughter)

00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:03.802
because no one thinks
of humor as a bad thing.

00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:06.045
Is there anyone here
that doesn't like to laugh?

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:09.278
Anyone that's like
"No, I hate feeling joy in my body?"

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:10.317
(Laughter)

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:12.619
No. People think of humor
as a nice-to-have.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.052
Oh, if I enjoyed my work more,
if I had some fun, it would be great,

00:02:16.744 --> 00:02:18.280
but if not, oh well.

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:21.336
The reality is that humor is a must-have.

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:26.391
In today's overworked, underappreciated,
stress-filled, sleep-deprived culture,

00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:28.373
humor is a necessity.

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:31.061
Because humor gets people to listen,

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.045
it increases long-term memory retention,

00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:35.065
it improves understanding,
aids in learning

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:36.813
and helps communicate messages.

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:38.645
It also improves group cohesiveness,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.036
reduces status differentials,
diffuses conflict, builds trust

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:43.909
and brings people closer together.

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:45.961
It does these things

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:47.501
(Laughter)

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:52.284
and this stuff and on and on and on ...

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:56.910
And it's all backed by research
case studies and real-world examples.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.440
(Laughter)

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.580
And these are some
impressive benefits, right?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.285
Humor can help you to look better,
live longer and make it rain, right?

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.289
(Laughter)

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.940
Because people who use humor
are paid more.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.185
And anyone can learn these benefits.

00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:15.613
Because when I talk to people
about humor or comedy,

00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:17.523
sometimes they're intimidated.

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.288
That event that I went to
in Switzerland a couple years ago

00:03:20.288 --> 00:03:21.930
that made my grandmother say WTF,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.458
it was to speak at a conference.

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:26.648
And one of the other speakers
at that conference was this gentleman.

00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:28.171
His name is Kevin Richardson.

00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:30.259
He's also known as the lion whisperer.

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.062
If you've ever seen that YouTube video
of a lion hugging a dude, that's this guy.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:35.534
He lives in South Africa,

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:37.737
he raises lions from
when they're really young,

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:39.590
and they treat him as one of the pride.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.498
He's basically the human version
of Rafiki from The Lion King.

00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:45.060
But Kevin and I were talking
before the event.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.966
He found out that I did stand-up comedy,

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:50.497
and he was like ''Huh, I could
never do that, it's too scary.''

00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:52.667
(Laughter)

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:54.923
I was like ''But you live with lions!''

00:03:54.923 --> 00:03:56.274
(Laughter)

00:03:56.274 --> 00:04:00.899
As if telling a joke is somehow
scarier than living with lions.

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:01.904
(Laughter)

00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:03.775
But so many people have this perception

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:08.079
as if the ability to make people laugh
is somehow encoded in our DNA.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.219
(Laughter)

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.334
But the reality is that humor is a skill,

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:14.656
and if it's a skill,
that means we can learn it.

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:17.851
Because I am someone
who has had to learn how to use humor.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.788
Because I've done over a thousand shows

00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:23.417
as a stand-up comedian, improviser,
storyteller, spoken word artist.

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:28.364
I've spoken and performed in all 50 states
in 18 countries and on one planet.

00:04:28.364 --> 00:04:30.315
(Laughter)

00:04:30.315 --> 00:04:32.500
I have fans in more than 150 countries,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.243
based on people who have
accidentally come to my website.

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:38.580
I've been called hilarious and smart,
at least that's what my mom says.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.582
(Laughter)

00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:43.014
And I've been seen on The Daily Show
with John Stewart, in the audience.

00:04:43.014 --> 00:04:45.143
(Laughter)

00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:47.429
I recently went to my
high school reunion though,

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.909
and when people found out
that I did stand-up comedy,

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.052
they said, ''But you're not funny.''

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:53.486
And in some ways they're right

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:57.492
because I would tell you
that this is not the face of funny.

00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:58.840
(Laughter)

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.294
There's a lot that's funny
about this picture;

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:03.189
none of it is intentional.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:04.193
(Laughter)

00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:07.797
And I have the blonde tips up top
like I wanted to be in a boy band.

00:05:07.797 --> 00:05:10.808
The theme was ''Into a Dream,''
I am no one's dream -

00:05:10.808 --> 00:05:11.859
(Laughter)

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:12.855
in this picture.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:16.327
Because, growing up, I was never
the life of the party or the class clown.

00:05:16.327 --> 00:05:19.553
My senior year - my senior superlative,
I was voted teacher's pet.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:23.824
And this is going to surprise many of you,
but it's because I am a nerd.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.774
And if you're wondering
what type of nerd,

00:05:25.774 --> 00:05:29.547
the answer is yes;
computer, math, sci-fi,

00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:33.329
Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Star Wars,
Star Trek, Starbucks - all of them.

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:34.600
(Laughter)

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.464
But most specifically, I'm an engineer.

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:38.181
I went to the Ohio State University,

00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:40.463
got a degree in computer
science and engineering.

00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:41.513
And after I graduated,

00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:44.898
I started working at Procter &amp; Gamble
as an IT project manager.

00:05:44.898 --> 00:05:47.302
And that's what people expected me to do,

00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:49.338
because based on my
personality assessment,

00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:54.112
that's what it suggests I should be
as a computer science engineer.

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:56.959
But I've learned that we're not
a personality assessment.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.106
Because my assessment is

00:05:58.106 --> 00:06:03.529
I'm a Type-A, blue square, conscientious,
INTJ with the sign of Aquarius.

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.197
That means I'm an ambitious,
stubborn introvert

00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:08.036
who likes long walks on the beach,

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:10.740
but I've learned we're not
our personality assessments.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.811
They might give us insight
into our behavior

00:06:12.811 --> 00:06:14.147
or tell us what motivates us

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:16.926
or tell us which Disney Princess
we would be - Pocahontas -

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:17.970
(Laughter)

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.763
but they don't define us;
instead, we are defined by our actions.

00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:24.119
So I started doing comedy in college.

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.603
My best friend there in the middle
wanted to start an improv comedy group.

00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:29.465
He needed people and forced me to join.

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:33.149
And as you can probably tell
from this picture, we were not very good.

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.608
At least to start out,
we had no idea what we were doing.

00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:40.065
We watched "Whose Line Is It Anyway?"
and tried to repeat what we saw.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:44.359
And what I didn't have in comedy skill
I made up in comedy project management.

00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:46.340
"If we're going to do this for real;

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.981
we'll practice three times a week,

00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:50.071
we'll have a business
meeting every Monday,

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:53.891
and we're going to go back and watch
our shows as if it was game tape.''

00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:56.487
And over the course
of two years, we got better.

00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:59.248
We went from performing
in the basements of residence halls

00:06:59.248 --> 00:07:01.736
to performing twice a week
at a theater on campus,

00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:04.482
never really learning
how to take a good picture.

00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:06.967
But that's how you learn
the skill of humor.

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.078
It's through practice and repetition.

00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:11.220
And anyone can do these things.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.722
And you don't have to become
a professional comedian to use comedy,

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:17.075
but we can learn from the professionals.

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:20.789
For example, from stand-up, we can learn
about how to share your point of view,

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.739
because Louis C.K. has
a very specific way of seeing the world,

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:25.645
which is different than Ellen DeGeneres,

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:29.112
which is different than Tig Notaro,
Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock.

00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:31.316
Everyone has their own perspective.

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:32.317
Some people tell me

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:36.784
that I kind of look like the intersection
of Hugh Jackman and Conan O'Brien.

00:07:36.784 --> 00:07:39.325
(Laughter)

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.353
Other people are like, "Ah, I kind of see
David Tennant from Doctor Who."

00:07:43.683 --> 00:07:44.681
One woman told me,

00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:47.962
''I think you look like Justin Timberlake
but from here to here.''

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.562
(Laughter)

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:54.234
And we're going to ignore the guy
that told me I look like Clay Aiken.

00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:55.646
Right, just completely.

00:07:55.646 --> 00:07:58.046
Everyone has their own perspective.

00:07:58.047 --> 00:08:02.071
And we can use that perspective as a way
to connect with other people, right?

00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:06.270
We can use it to say, ''Oh, we're alike.''
How many people here like desert?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.931
People love desert. I love deserts.
I am obsessed with milkshake.

00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:12.329
So it's the most efficient form of desert

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:16.495
because of the deliciousness of ice cream
in an easy-to-consume form.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.306
But I don't understand mint chocolate.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:20.500
I don't know if we have
any mint chocolate fan.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.043
I've never been eating chocolate

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:25.366
and been like, ''You know what would
go great with this? Toothpaste."

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:26.536
(Laughter)

00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:29.588
We can share a perspective
as a way to connect.

00:08:29.588 --> 00:08:32.269
We can also share a perspective
as a way to make a point.

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:33.425
Because I will tell you

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:38.396
that I have always understood computers
much more than I understand humans.

00:08:38.756 --> 00:08:41.184
Because when something goes wrong
with the computer,

00:08:41.184 --> 00:08:42.372
you get an error message.

00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:44.233
When something goes wrong with a human,

00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:45.492
you get feelings.

00:08:45.502 --> 00:08:46.502
(Laughter)

00:08:46.512 --> 00:08:49.605
Things would be so much easier
if humans came with error messages,

00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:50.329
wouldn't they?

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:53.253
Say you're overworked, overwhelmed,
a little bit stressed out,

00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:55.756
it would just pop up:
"Warning! System overload."

00:08:55.756 --> 00:08:56.749
(Laughter)

00:08:56.749 --> 00:08:59.363
"Please restart by taking a nap."

00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:01.504
Because we all know
naps are the human version

00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:04.098
of, "Just turn it off
and then turn it back on again."

00:09:04.098 --> 00:09:06.641
Some error messages
you wouldn't even have to change.

00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:09.925
Say, you're out flirting with a waitress,
she's not really feeling it.

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:13.348
It would just pop up: "Error.
Unable to establish connection to server."

00:09:13.348 --> 00:09:15.269
(Laughter)

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:18.792
Things would be so much easier.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:21.233
But the reality is that humans
aren't computers,

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:24.729
no matter how adorable they are
when they pretend to be.

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:28.388
Because we, as humans, not only have
to manage time, we have to manage energy.

00:09:28.388 --> 00:09:30.575
Because it doesn't matter
how much time we have

00:09:30.575 --> 00:09:33.827
if we've never have the energy
to do anything with it.

00:09:33.848 --> 00:09:37.352
From improv, we can learn how we can
explore and heighten a point of view.

00:09:37.352 --> 00:09:40.431
Because the fundamental
mindset of improvisation is "Yes, and..."

00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:44.302
It's how improvisers at UCB, Second City
and ComedySportz make things up

00:09:44.302 --> 00:09:46.386
off the top of their head.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.866
And we can use that same thing,

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:50.965
take what they do, accept and build,
explore and heighten and say,

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.525
''If this is true, what else is true?''

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:56.931
Because it took me going
to the state of Florida to realize

00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:03.011
that the rapper Flo Rida got his name
from his home state of Florida,

00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:05.044
and he put a space in it.

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:07.162
That blew my mind!

00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:08.115
(Laughter)

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:11.323
We could say, ''If this is true,
what else could be true?''

00:10:11.323 --> 00:10:12.320
We could say,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.494
"I think there should be
a Hispanic factory in Dover

00:10:15.494 --> 00:10:17.604
that goes by De La Ware."

00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:18.850
(Laughter)

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.807
Or like, "There could be a female
internet detective in Biloxi

00:10:21.807 --> 00:10:24.278
who goes by Misses IP, PI."

00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:26.032
(Laughter)

00:10:26.032 --> 00:10:28.829
And if this is true, what else is true?

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:30.904
If we can use ''Yes, and''
to create humor,

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:34.070
we can also use ''Yes, and'' as a way
to connect with other people.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.779
We can think of that stereotypical
small talk conversation

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:39.309
where people are like,
''Ah, how about this weather?''

00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:42.068
You say, "Yes, and if you were not
at this event right now,

00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:44.307
how would you be out
enjoying the weather?"

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:47.586
And we can turn an awkward conversation
into something more meaningful

00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:49.164
where you learn about the person.

00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:52.541
''With beautiful weather, I go outside,
or I go hiking or swimming.''

00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:55.155
If you're me, you stay inside,
because you're very pale.

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:59.433
I like to use SPF building;
its the best protection.

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:02.406
We learn about people
through ''Yes, and.''

00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:05.143
We can also use a yes-and mindset
to have more fun,

00:11:05.143 --> 00:11:09.140
because the reality is that the average
person works 90 thousand hours

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.517
in their lifetime.

00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:12.417
Ninety thousand hours!

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:16.512
That's the entire length,
the entire discography of Netflix.

00:11:16.512 --> 00:11:18.498
That is a lot of time.

00:11:18.498 --> 00:11:21.458
And we can say, ''Yes, I'm going
to work 90 thousand hours,

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:24.458
and I might as well enjoy it.''

00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:26.800
Between my junior
and senior year of high school,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.894
I worked in a factory,

00:11:27.894 --> 00:11:30.415
and I will tell you
what was not a very exciting job.

00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:32.992
And at the time, I thought
that I might, in the future,

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:36.143
want to become an international
hip-hop superstar.

00:11:36.243 --> 00:11:38.906
So, to pass the time,
I would think of rhymes in my head,

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.715
then I'd write them down
in a notebook a little bit later.

00:11:41.715 --> 00:11:43.712
And I recently found
one of those notebooks

00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:46.540
and discovered why I never became
a hip-hop superstar.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.984
Because one of the rhymes was,

00:11:47.984 --> 00:11:53.308
"Hydrogen plus hydrogen plus oxygen too,
bonded together with covalent glue.

00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:55.829
What do you get,
just a thing called water,

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:58.376
yeah, it's teaming up
and it's only getting hotter."

00:11:58.376 --> 00:12:00.449
(Laughter)

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:04.399
It's the reason why I never became
a hip-hop superstar.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:10.467
But it still helped me to pass the time
to create humor, to create fun.

00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:11.609
And finally from sketch,

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:14.668
we can learn about the importance
of commitment to performance.

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.916
Because the characters
from Saturday Night Live,

00:12:16.916 --> 00:12:18.183
Key &amp; Peele, Monty Python,

00:12:18.183 --> 00:12:21.670
they're so enjoyable, because the actors
are committed to the performance.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.722
And they're confident
in their presentation,

00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:25.396
because it's like dating, right?

00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:28.651
People tell you that they want
to date someone who is confident.

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:31.587
A couple years ago,
I was with some friends at a bar,

00:12:31.587 --> 00:12:33.535
and I saw this beautiful girl at the bar.

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:35.040
''You should go talk to her.''

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.496
''I can't do that.''

00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:37.372
''Why not?''

00:12:37.372 --> 00:12:39.746
''I don't have 'game.'''

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:42.170
''You don't need 'game,'
you just need confidence.''

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:45.567
But they don't tell you that they want
that confidence in certain areas.

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:49.141
Because no woman wants a man
who's confident in math.

00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:50.369
(Laughter)

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.711
That's what I've got.

00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:52.640
(Laughter)

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.173
So I was like, ''All right.
I'm going to try a math pickup line.''

00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.712
So I went up to the girl
and I was like, ''Hey, girl."

00:12:58.712 --> 00:12:59.726
(Laughter)

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:03.643
"Are you a vertical asymptote?
Because your beauty has no limits.''

00:13:03.643 --> 00:13:04.803
(Laughter)

00:13:04.803 --> 00:13:06.755
She was like, ''What did you just say?''

00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:07.756
(Laughter)

00:13:07.756 --> 00:13:10.380
So I tried again,
and I was like, ''Hey, girl.

00:13:10.447 --> 00:13:13.888
Are you opposite over hypotenuse?
Because you're making me want to sin.''

00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:15.946
(Laughter)

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:19.549
She was like, ''I think
you should probably leave.''

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:21.304
So I left, right?

00:13:21.304 --> 00:13:24.774
But then a few hours later, I was like,
"Oh, what I should've said was,

00:13:24.774 --> 00:13:28.453
'Hey girl, you're way
above average, don't be mean.'''

00:13:28.453 --> 00:13:30.226
(Laughter)

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.677
Has that ever happened to you,

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:34.631
where you thought of something
like four hours after the event?

00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:37.447
That's actually a good thing,
it's called staircase wit.

00:13:37.455 --> 00:13:39.405
The idea of ''this moment happens here,''

00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:41.697
and then you think of this idea
in the staircase.

00:13:41.697 --> 00:13:44.738
That's a good sign, because that means
you have comedic instinct.

00:13:44.738 --> 00:13:46.462
And through practice and repetition,

00:13:46.462 --> 00:13:49.175
you can shorten the time
it takes to have that a-ha moment

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:51.707
from being four hours later
to only three hours later,

00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:54.916
to only two to ten minutes
to, then, happening in the moment.

00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:59.172
Because a reflection on the past
leads to action in the future.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.083
And so we become more comfortable,
more confident using humor,

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:04.329
the more that we actually do it.

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:07.541
It's like Amy Cuddy says:
''Fake it until you become it.''

00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.140
I know there's a couple of people

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.677
that are like, ''All right,
Justin Timberlake eyes.''

00:14:11.677 --> 00:14:12.682
(Laughter)

00:14:12.682 --> 00:14:14.696
''What if I'm not funny?''

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:16.982
The truth is if you have ever
made someone laugh,

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:21.171
even if it's because you tripped
up the steps while going up the steps,

00:14:21.171 --> 00:14:23.080
you would still use humor.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.793
But even if you're not ready
to try creating humor,

00:14:25.793 --> 00:14:29.262
you can still benefit from humor
by being a shepherd of humor.

00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:33.822
You can share quotations out,
you can share a TED talk that you enjoyed,

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:36.124
or you can use images
in your presentations.

00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:38.358
Because I did not take this picture.

00:14:38.358 --> 00:14:39.841
I did not go to Sri Lanka.

00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:43.048
I do not know this shepherd
or any of these goats.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.531
I found it on Flickr
under a Creative Commons license

00:14:45.531 --> 00:14:48.346
and shared it with all of you,
because I enjoyed it.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.642
But even if you're not
ready to create humor,

00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:54.206
and you don't think that you can find
something interesting on the Internet,

00:14:54.206 --> 00:14:56.910
you can still use humor
if you know how to smile.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.768
Because when we see someone else smile,

00:14:58.768 --> 00:15:02.195
we are primed to mirror that behavior
with mirror neurons in our brain.

00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:06.099
And when we smile, they smile:
we create a human connection.

00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:08.519
Other people are like,
''But what if no one laughs?

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:11.046
What if I try humor,
and there's an awkward silence?''

00:15:11.046 --> 00:15:13.740
Well, it's really only awkward
if you spend time on it,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.057
if you dwell on it.

00:15:15.057 --> 00:15:19.860
And the reality is that no one has ever
been fired because of a bad joke.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.745
An inappropriate one, maybe,
but not a bad joke.

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:24.535
Because a bad joke is something like,

00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:26.840
"I once had to miss class
because of hypothermia,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.886
I was too cool for school."

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:29.886
(Laughter)

00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:31.262
That's a bad joke.

00:15:31.262 --> 00:15:32.894
(Laughter)

00:15:32.894 --> 00:15:36.291
An inappropriate joke is one
that has an inappropriate subject,

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:40.368
has an inappropriate target
or comes at an inappropriate time.

00:15:40.368 --> 00:15:42.024
But as long as we are positive -

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.000
(Laughter)

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.880
and inclusive, we'll be okay.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.885
Because then if no one laughs at our joke,

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:51.921
it's just now a positive
and inclusive statement.

00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:55.182
Finally, people are like
''What if no one takes me seriously?''

00:15:55.182 --> 00:15:58.739
''What if people think of me
as a jester or a clown?''

00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:00.511
If you're going to use humor at work,

00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:03.262
recognize that humor
doesn't replace the work.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.249
Humor is like the salt of a meal.

00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:07.746
You wouldn't eat an entire
meal of salt, would you?

00:16:07.746 --> 00:16:09.784
Because that would make you a horse.

00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:12.614
Do you want to be a horse? I say nay.

00:16:12.614 --> 00:16:14.354
(Laughter)

00:16:14.354 --> 00:16:17.470
But you can still use humor

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.620
as long as you're making it
more productive.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.880
Managers actually want it,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.308
because they know you're going
to be more engaged and get better results.

00:16:24.308 --> 00:16:27.791
But let's say you work for an organization
that says no fun whatsoever.

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:30.788
The reality is that no one
can control how you think.

00:16:30.788 --> 00:16:33.469
No one can prevent you
from listening to a comedy podcast

00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:34.720
on your way home from work

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.916
so that you relieve stress
and show up more present for your family.

00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:41.254
No one can stop you from creating
a Twitter account to write puns.

00:16:41.254 --> 00:16:45.427
No one can keep you from coming up
with chemistry raps while you're working.

00:16:45.427 --> 00:16:49.974
The reality is that job satisfaction,
your outlook, your way of managing stress

00:16:49.974 --> 00:16:55.382
is entirely your responsibility
and is the choice that you make.

00:16:55.382 --> 00:16:56.935
And this is a skill of humor.

00:16:56.935 --> 00:16:59.609
It starts by sharing your point of view,

00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:02.033
and then we explore
and heighten that point of view.

00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:04.515
And we yes-and both our work and our life,

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:07.692
and finally we practice,
perform and repeat,

00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:09.551
because that's how we get better.

00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:12.737
And people can take an improv class,
or you can try stand-up comedy,

00:17:12.737 --> 00:17:16.943
but we can also just be more aware
of how we create humor every single day.

00:17:16.943 --> 00:17:19.395
And anyone can do these things.

00:17:19.395 --> 00:17:24.554
I'll tell you, the funniest person I know
is my grandmother, the one that texts me.

00:17:24.614 --> 00:17:28.743
And she's elevated her game
from texting to Facebook.

00:17:28.755 --> 00:17:32.865
She's now on Facebook and she comments
on every single one of my status updates.

00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:33.879
And I can't tell

00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:38.399
if my grandmother is the nicest,
most sincere grandmother in the world,

00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:40.500
or if she is secretly trolling me.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.530
(Laughter)

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.128
A couple of months ago, I posted,

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:46.490
''I'm trying to decide if I should
become an athlete or a criminal,

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.729
so I made a list of pros and cons.''

00:17:49.729 --> 00:17:52.725
My grandmother's response
was one word: ''Funny.''

00:17:52.725 --> 00:17:55.728
(Laughter)

00:17:57.148 --> 00:17:58.902
I was like, "I don't know.

00:17:58.902 --> 00:18:02.305
Does she think it's funny,
or is she messing with me?"

00:18:02.305 --> 00:18:03.914
A couple weeks later, I posted,

00:18:03.914 --> 00:18:08.473
''I think a cozy bar that serves figs
would make for a plum date spot.''

00:18:08.473 --> 00:18:11.468
My grandmother's response was, ''Ha, ha.''

00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:12.582
(Laughter)

00:18:12.582 --> 00:18:15.056
And I was like, "There's
something about the comma.''

00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:16.925
(Laughter)

00:18:16.925 --> 00:18:20.097
And I'm like, "She's messing with me."

00:18:20.097 --> 00:18:21.719
Then a couple weeks ago, I posted,

00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:26.317
''Converting the numbers 51, 6 and 500
to Roman numerals makes me LIVID.''

00:18:26.317 --> 00:18:27.737
(Laughter)

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:30.887
My grandmother's response was,
''Hey, this one is actually good.''

00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:33.329
(Laughter)

00:18:35.473 --> 00:18:37.336
Trolled by my own grandmother.

00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:39.546
(Laughter)

00:18:39.546 --> 00:18:43.228
It doesn't matter, your age,
your income, your perspective,

00:18:43.228 --> 00:18:45.756
your personality assessment,
your senior superlative

00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:48.301
or your celebrity doppelganger.

00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:50.572
Anyone can learn to be funnier.

00:18:50.572 --> 00:18:52.103
And it all starts with a choice,

00:18:52.103 --> 00:18:54.616
a choice to try to find ways to use humor,

00:18:54.616 --> 00:18:56.469
a choice to be like my grandmother,

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.530
to look at the world around you
and think, "WTF -

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.400
Wow, that's fun."

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.517
Thank you.

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:06.450
(Applause)
