00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.979
1916. The stalemate in the trenches of the
Western Front continues, both sides desperate

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.120
to come up with new strategies and tactics
to break sophisticated enemy defenses. As

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.449
the year came to a close, neither side could
any longer afford to send wave after wave

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.310
of men out against machine guns and artillery,
but what would they do instead? The British

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.689
and French would secretly develop tanks, but
the German High Command would improve the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.209
quality and effectiveness of its infantry.
They created stormtroops.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.680
I’m Indy Neidell; welcome to a Great War
special episode about trench warfare and German

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.210
stormtroops.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.720
Now, we did one special about trench warfare
already where I talked about various close-combat

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.790
raiding groups and assault patrols engaged
in trench combat, but you could really see

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.960
that the mass slaughter at Verdun began to
change overall infantry tactics, to a certain

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.650
extent for the French, but on a large scale
for the Germans.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.770
French army captain André Laffargue was one
of the first who wrote about the realities

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.230
of trench warfare and how small concentrated
troop formations would need to operate independently,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.770
as opposed to under rigid directives from
high command. While the Allies mostly ignored

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.000
his writing, German high command used captured
texts of his pamphlets and combined his ideas

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.920
with their own experiences of infiltration
tactics.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.060
The Calsow Assault Detachment was the first
experimental Sturm Battalion, deployed on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.840
the Western Front in March 1916, and it consisted
of a headquarter element, two pioneer companies

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.830
equipped with body armor, specialized shields,
and steel helmets, and a rifle company as

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.810
support, equipped with a 37mm gun. It was
really too soon to see any success or to even

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.150
use the new weapon as intended, but the general
idea was beginning to form.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.479
The real birthplace of the Stormtroops was
in the east.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.530
The terrifying new tactics used by the Russians
in the breakthrough of the Brusilov Offensive

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.530
- sudden but massive and accurate artillery
strikes, quickly followed by concentrated

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.750
shock troop detachments - were soon to be
adapted and improved by the German captains

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.050
Willy Rohr and Bernhard Reddemann.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.230
Now, the Sturmabteilung Rohr was already known
for their shock troop tactics in the retaking

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.200
of the Hartmannsweilerkopf in 1915 and as
part of the 5th Army at the battle of Verdun.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.110
Together with Reddemann they developed new
doctrines of small unit tactics. They saw

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.450
insufficient weapons training and the lack
of cooperation between the units as the major

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.510
problems. The new shock troops would be quick
and mobile, while being flexible in their

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.250
approach of a situation. Precise operational
timing was the key for maximum effectiveness.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.080
They chose two specific types of German infantry
to build the core of the Stormtroops: first,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.099
the Jäger Corps. The Jäger were light infantry,
traditionally specializing in woodland or

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.819
wilderness combat and operating in smaller
units. Their skill in light infantry tactics

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.260
like sharpshooting, and their decentralized
leadership made them an ideal choice for stormtroop

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.920
detachments. Second, the Pioneer Corps. Like
the Jäger, the Pioneers were experts in small

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.410
unit operations under low-level command structures.
Their expertise lay in erecting or breaching

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.959
obstacles and in the art of grenade throwing.
This made them very good for storming enemy

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.019
defensive positions.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.470
In addition to their weapon and attack training,
they studied how the enemy reacted to their

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.260
assaults and moved through the trenches, and
how to prevent resistance from forming. The

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.560
new stormtroop tactics of Rohr and Reddemann
maximized their training to deadly effectiveness.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.060
The new battalions had very strict requirements.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.980
Soldiers could not be over 25 years old, had
to be mentally and physically tough, single,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.050
athletic, and also had to have one other characteristic
– they had to be aggressive. This was the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.239
key factor in the new doctrine; it was vital
that the storm would always take the initiative

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.220
from the enemy.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.739
The new tactics also changed something else,
which is often overlooked. They brought about

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.750
a revolution within German military culture
against the old style of Prussian leadership,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.830
which held to strict rules of the chain of
command. Orders came from high up and junior

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.300
officers coordinated with their superiors,
but for storm troops to be effective this

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.800
had to change, and junior leaders had to be
allowed to make their own decisions. Storm

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.490
troops went hand in hand with decentralized
leadership, Führen nach Direktive – leading

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.940
through direct command, and Auftragstaktik
– Mission tactics. All without coordinating

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.270
with high command. All revolutionary thoughts.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.169
Storm troops became the elite in the German
army. Hand picked soldiers who lived and trained

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.770
in exclusive companies, and enjoyed better
rations and more time away from the front

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.759
lines than regular troops. On the other hand,
their missions were extremely dangerous and

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.120
the casualty rate was extremely high.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.900
General Erich Ludendorff encouraged their
deployment in all German divisions and they

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.919
continued to evolve. Soon they would have
flamethrower, trench mortar, and grenadier

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.669
detachments and General Oscar von Hutier would
give his name to Hutier infiltration tactics,

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.509
which combined surprise artillery bombardments
with lightning encircling movements.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.800
Like regular trench raiders, Storm troops
were not tasked with capturing and holding

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.110
trench lines.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.169
They were lightly equipped but armed to the
teeth, with loads of ammunition and hand grenades.

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.699
In general, they preferred the shortened Mauser
M98 carbine the 98k, rapid-fire pistols like

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:59.320
the Mauser C-96, Danish Madsen Light machine
guns and the MP-18 submachine gun. Special

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.800
Grenadier squads would carry bags full of
hand grenades while others operated the flamethrower,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.009
the rifle grenade and small mortars. They
were trained to use all arms in combination

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.979
with each other. They also studied the enemy’s
weaponry to be able to take it and use it

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.889
against him.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.180
A standard attack was to approach the enemy
unseen, perhaps at night or in fog, cut the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.020
barbed wire, and wait for a sudden, violent,
and accurate artillery barrage. In the confusion

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.370
of the barrage, they emerged from cover and
assaulted key points of the enemy defenses,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.180
but rather than occupy the trench lines or
engage the enemy en masse, they pushed through

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.940
the trench system, circling and confusing
the enemy, and decimating the enemy flanks

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.130
and the moving, exposed reinforcements. The
regular German infantry would then head into

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.400
the trenches and destroy the defense lines.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.819
By the end of 1916 over 30 divisions had experimented
with, trained, and finally integrated special

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:05.250
battalions of assault troops into their forces.
From the Vosges to the Romanian Front, at

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.039
Cambrai and Caporetto, the efficiency of the
new German elite forces was astonishing.

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.319
The final hours of the offensive German war
machine were perhaps the storm troops finest.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:22.370
The Kaiserschlacht, the German Spring Offensive
of 1918 had great initial success because

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.500
the storm troops broke through the Allied
defenses along the entire line, but that we’ll

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.039
cover in our regular episodes when we get
there.

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.810
The Storm troop doctrine, of course, survived
the war. The paramilitary Freikorps used the

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.860
martial imagery of the storm troops, and Adolf
Hitler created the SA, the Sturmabteilung,

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.970
but really, many of the small until tactics
pioneered in the Great War are still taught

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:48.740
today all over the world. Erwin Rommel’s
“Infantry Attacks” is even taught at officers’

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.479
academies in the United States.

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:56.340
And what did it mean to the enemy on the ground?
Well, here’s what Rommel himself had to

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.020
say:

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.490
“The fire unit up above blazed away, followed
a few seconds later by Friedel's assault squad

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.849
running through the entanglement path and
into the hostile position. Then the forward

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:10.090
units of my
Detachment began to move. The sharp crack

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.560
of hand grenades in our immediate vicinity
drowned out the noise of firing up on the

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.889
right. A few strides through smoke and haze
and we were in the hostile trench... I reached

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.169
the trench at the head of my detachment. Up
on the right, the trench garrison was still

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:29.349
resisting the attack supposedly coming from
that direction. The configuration of the terrain

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:34.339
and the dense undergrowth prevented these
people from seeing that we had already smashed

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:39.099
into their position; they did not see company
after company moving at the double into the

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:41.119
gap in their defensive system.“

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:48.069
I’ve said it before, but it’s really fitting
here: this was Modern War.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:52.720
This was just a brief look at the beginning
of the storm troops. Other countries had their

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.410
own changes in infantry doctrine and we will
talk about them later in our show.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.550
