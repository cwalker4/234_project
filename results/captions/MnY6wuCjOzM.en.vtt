00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:04.535
Because every time I see lightning, I think
of the M.E.C of the Northwest.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.160
M.E.C. of safety and security.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.160
True genius.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.160
True comedic genius.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.039
Like we all have our mentors and you know
I look up to guys like him.

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:18.104
No because he came out after what happened
was there was a funeral on the weekend.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.200
And what happened was there was a lightning
storm and lightning struck the people at the

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.140
funeral and nine people were killed instantly.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.666
There's nothing funny about that.

00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:31.451
Nine people dead, gone.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.340
Nothing funny at all.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.910
Although it must've been a bit weird because
like, you know?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.180
You're there because someone has died and
then *lightning sound effects*

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.540
Then it's a bit awkward now.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.760
You don't know if carry on here or do you? You don't know but it's a bit you don't

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.460
know and then you're like do you put them
in because there's like cause you know there's

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.720
going to be like one uncle who's like "No
there's space... put him.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.680
I must buy another box?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.700
nuh uh."

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.180
It's just like, you know what I mean?

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.895
And if you've got like one of those possessive mothers, you know those mothers that love their kids.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.900
Probably then she's crying and then everyone's like
*lightning sound effects* and then they're dead.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:11.505
Then they're like "ahhh-" and
she's like "Don't you dare!

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.660
Don't you cry for them.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.020
You don't cry for them.

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:15.022
You came here for this.

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:16.022
You came here.

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:18.300
You save your tears and you cry where they-
Hey!

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.360
Hey! HEY!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.420
They're freshly dead you can cry for them
next week.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.960
You don't, you bring those tears here and-"

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.520
But there's nothing funny about it. And um...

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.400
And so what happened is on the Monday after
the funeral.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.110
MEC came out and he held a press conference and
he was there the journalists had all gathered

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.740
and it was very serious.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.500
And he came out there and the photographers and
everyone was there and he said,

00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:46.552
"We...

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.025
we have heard...

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:52.702
what have happened...

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.084
on that funeral.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.413
And let it be known that...

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:06.429
we...

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.660
will launch a
probe.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.562
And we will not rest...

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.900
UNTIL we know...

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.648
where does this lightning come from?!"

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:21.979
Not rest.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.605
His assistant was probably like "Up, up."

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.380
He was like, yes up,  we want to know!

00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:33.785
Where does it come from?!"

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.280
I didn't even make the joke he just said this!

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.920
I just repeated it to you!

00:02:41.383 --> 00:02:45.589
We've become a culture of distrusting, angry people.
That’s who we are, everyone’s angry.

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:49.540
Weird angriness as well. In places where it shouldn’t be.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.096
I was in Checkers the other day.

00:02:52.283 --> 00:02:54.703
I’m just shopping. It’s a normal experience, you know?

00:02:55.228 --> 00:03:00.128
I get to the cashier and, those people are so angry.

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.173
Like, I don’t know what Checkers
does to their employees.

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:05.518
But they are clearly
not enjoying it.

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:08.742
Because I get to the till, she doesn’t greet me.
She doesn’t even look at me.

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:10.768
She just pushes the little conveyer belt thing.

00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:12.739
All my groceries pull up, she’s like.

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:21.262
*Sound of a grocery scanner beeping*

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:37.777
“Shhhh”

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:41.458
They look at you like your dad invented the bar-code.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.978
*sound of buttons on a cash register*

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:56.664
*Sound of a grocery scanner beeping*

00:03:57.248 --> 00:04:01.010
Then they look at you and ask you that question
like you kill baby panda bears for a living.

00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:03.815
“Plastic?”

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:09.294
“No, I am fine. Thank you.”

00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:11.322
“No, I’ll just hold it, I’ll just, yea.”

00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:15.023
“I’ll just. No, no. Thank you, thank you.”

00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:20.457
They’re so angry.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.833
And they look angry.

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:25.557
Because they’ve drawn they’re eyebrows on.

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:29.339
And that permanent scowl.

00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:35.034
I don’t understand that trend it
fashion, I am honest with you.

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.515
Why would you shave your eyebrows off?

00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:40.247
and then draw them back on where they were?

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.523
It’s weird, but I also commend it you know.

00:04:46.548 --> 00:04:48.994
That level of commitment has to be commended.

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.374
Because I don’t understand how anyone can
commit to one expression for the entire day.

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.067
Like how do you choose that expression?

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:58.490
Do you just work on how you feel in the morning?
Is that what you do?

00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:01.881
You just wake up and be like, “I’m feeling angry!”

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:03.319
“Haaaaa!”

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:13.641
What if something good happens? Something good. You’d be like,

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.879
”Yea Temby, you won the Lotto.”

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.881
“Yay!”

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:20.282
“You don’t look happy.”

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:21.956
“I just can’t show it.”

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.681
“I’ll draw it tomorrow.”

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:31.091
You guys, you guys love your sport out here I’ve never
seen more focus put on sport anywhere else in the world

00:05:31.116 --> 00:05:33.698
Americans love they’re sport back to front

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.526
you analyze them
 you worship them

00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:40.403
you watch the game before the game 
you watch the game after the game

00:05:40.654 --> 00:05:44.019
you talk about what might happen in the game 
you talk about what’s happening in the game

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.132
and then you talk about what happened in the game

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.174
and what could've and what might've but didn’t happen in the game

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:51.630
it’s just the craziest thing I've seen in my life

00:05:51.654 --> 00:05:53.944
it’s all about statistics
 have you seen sports in America?

00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:55.690
non-stop. Guys come out there...

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:57.716
there’s no time for smiles or anything 
just come out

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:02.706
and ladies and gentlemen welcome to it
it’s the 2012 Miami Heat

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.853
up against OKC this is the greatest final
we’ve been waiting for in the NBA finals

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:09.673
LeBron James leading his team out here averaging 30 points

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:12.152
double double every single game.
 10 points per game

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.678
Just in assists alone. 
this man is just something else

00:06:14.703 --> 00:06:16.157
90 percent from the free throw line

00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:18.199
he just gone in... He's statistically gotten better

00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:20.058
his team coming in with more... Chris Bosh...

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.672
coming in with more assist
 really doing well in the last game

00:06:22.697 --> 00:06:24.330
just like whaaa!
whaaa!

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.230
numbers, numbers, numbers 
stats, stats, stats

00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.663
you guys know everything
 every stat

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:32.044
well I mean he's got four out of five 
and I mean if you look at that statistic alone

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:34.638
it looks like he should be getting four

00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:38.138
and then, and then, and then it’s just crazy 
you know everything

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:41.039
and then you switch over to your
business channels and your economy

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:43.471
and you’re like what’s happening
in the economy this year Bob?

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:45.790
well nobody knows... 
I mean

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.374
Nobody knows.... Yeah!

00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:51.932
Ha Ha Ha Ha

00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:54.383
Uh

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:57.729
we thought the housing market was coming up 
but it wasn’t

00:06:57.796 --> 00:06:58.913
Ha Ha Ha Ha

00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:02.306
but hey I mean that’s the economy

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:03.687
you never know right?

00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:05.588
you never know 
What about stocks?

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:08.064
Well I guess stocks, they’re up and down

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.489
I don’t really know they’re up and down 
They could can go anywhere

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:15.008
Those are stocks 
We don’t know

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.774
but the sports you know

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:21.008
you need to flip that around 
get the statistics in the economy

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:23.082
just relax on your sports 
Have fun

00:07:23.503 --> 00:07:25.957
that's.... the sports I watch is relaxed... 
like soccer

00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:28.022
I am a huge fan of soccer

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:30.760
Yea Oh 
there’s some fans here

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.862
I love soccer. 
It’s chilled.

00:07:34.926 --> 00:07:37.420
you hear it in the commentators 
when the game is being played

00:07:37.714 --> 00:07:39.192
there’s no statistics at all

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.884
the game starts off 
the whistle blows

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.791
and welcome ladies and gentlemen

00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:46.920
to this majestic match

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.931
it’s Spain playing against Germany

00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:52.331
Oh and what a wonderful day it is

00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:55.985
look at the crowd really excited

00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:59.180
oh and the atmosphere's amazing 
wonderful weather

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.833
And the guys just like "Oh yea John you can feel it.
and the players look great"

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:04.209
it’s wonderful

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.959
what do you think’s going
to happen today Martin

00:08:05.984 --> 00:08:07.998
Oh nobody knows

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:13.916
I can’t even remember the last
time I saw a game this good

00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:17.015
Americans will remember
 Americans will go back to the finest statistic

00:08:17.048 --> 00:08:24.865
the last time a black man scored using his left
hand jumping over a mixed-race half Indian

00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:27.734
was in 1967 when the

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.459
Okay like what?

00:08:31.072 --> 00:08:32.112
this is madness

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:35.075
I remember the worst encounter I had with the
T.S.A. was out in Burbank, California.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.910
Tiny little airport, I was flying
out and I was coming to New York.

00:08:38.154 --> 00:08:41.430
And so I am in Burbank airport and I go through security.

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:44.252
And for some reason I was beeping, I don’t know why.
I walked to the metal detector.

00:08:44.277 --> 00:08:47.040
And I beep, go out, beep, go out, beep.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:50.221
Every time I have to take something of off I go out
I got a beep and the agent, he’s just losing it.

00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:51.856
The whole time he’s like, “take it off, take it off”

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:54.407
And then the machine goes beep and he’s
like, “take that off, take that off!”

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:56.344
“take that off!”, and he’s like getting more and more angry.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.306
I am basically naked right now
and he’s losing it, losing it.

00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:01.572
I felt like an under-performing stripper, it was horrible.

00:09:01.938 --> 00:09:04.352
He’s like, “take that, no, ahhh!”

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.355
And finally he’s just like,
“get out here, get out here!”

00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:08.896
So I walk to the side and he’s like,
“go ahead and put your hands up”

00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:09.755
So I put my arms up.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.607
Then he whipped out his little
metal, personal metal detector.

00:09:13.632 --> 00:09:17.492
looks like a midget sword, but they call it the wand.

00:09:17.517 --> 00:09:19.955
That’s what they call it, the wand. So he whips that out.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.062
cause that hundred thousand
dollar machine, that’s play, play.

00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.747
Shit just got real.

00:09:27.569 --> 00:09:30.744
So he looks at me and says: ”go ahead and stick
your hands up sir and keep them right there”.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.564
So I put my arms up and he scans me

00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:37.420
*sound of a scanner*

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:43.759
“You got any ah... you got any metal objects on you?”

00:09:47.952 --> 00:09:51.529
And I was like, “then what was that for?”

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:58.440
“If you were gonna ask me anyway, then what was this?”

00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:01.238
“The foreplay to my honesty, what is this?”

00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:06.981
And then as if he can’t do this right, he calls for backup.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.793
He goes, “I’m gonna need you to wait right here”

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.718
“Can we get Velazquez to gate ah gate 10 please? Velazquez to gate 10”

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:16.538
And he calls for a man, by the name Velazquez.

00:10:17.873 --> 00:10:21.340
Who I am assuming was the best wander that they had.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.104
Because he wasn’t even on the floor

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:27.916
They called for him and Velazquez emerged

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:30.991
From the back offices of the T.S.A.

00:10:32.307 --> 00:10:36.123
And he walked out, and the energy changed.

00:10:37.495 --> 00:10:39.978
People bowed their heads as he walk past.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.678
Everyone gave him a little nod.

00:10:42.984 --> 00:10:45.396
You could see he was special,
and he didn’t look like much.

00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:47.882
Velazquez was a little Mexican man.

00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:50.274
Very long mustache, big chest.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.412
And he was very short, really, really short guy.

00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:54.475
But he didn’t feel short.

00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:57.876
He looked short but he didn’t feel
short, do you know what I mean?

00:10:58.117 --> 00:11:00.728
Like he had this thing. You know those
short people that are so confident?

00:11:00.753 --> 00:11:03.151
It looks like they just chose to grow low.

00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:07.212
He had that energy.

00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:13.712
And so Velazquez walks down towards
where I am standing with my agent.

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:18.725
My guy tries to apologize, like,
“I don’t know what’s going on”

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.791
He silenced him with one move
of his hand like, “No, I go”

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.312
He stepped up and looked me in the eye. He’s like, “Sir”

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:31.176
“jibberish”

00:11:31.663 --> 00:11:33.177
And I didn’t know what he was saying.

00:11:35.032 --> 00:11:36.530
But I knew what he meant.

00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:41.096
And so I stood there. I raised my arms.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.180
And as I did, he whipped out his wand.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.471
And he started using it all over me,

00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:51.647
And as soon as he did, I knew why he was who he was.

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:56.247
It was the most magical thing I have ever come across in my life.

00:11:56.323 --> 00:12:00.053
The way he wielded that wand was unlike
anything I have ever experienced.

00:12:00.104 --> 00:12:03.065
I felt like I was being blessed, I
just stood there with my head down.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.440
As he went all over me, just blessing me with his power.

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:10.373
It was something special. It was like a force, an energy.

00:12:10.398 --> 00:12:13.767
On the outside you still heard that beeping 
*beeping*

00:12:13.823 --> 00:12:16.594
But in my head I heard like a light Sabre, that what I heard.

00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:23.142
*sound of a light sabre*

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:25.739
Because he was, he was to me.

00:12:26.386 --> 00:12:27.861
A little Mexican Jedi.

00:12:31.442 --> 00:12:35.646
In fact that’s exactly what he was, he was my Mexican Jedi.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.970
Which by the way I feel would be a welcome
addition to the Star Wars franchise.

00:12:44.192 --> 00:12:46.744
No, I am a big fan, a huge fan of Star Wars. I love Star Wars.

00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:50.250
I was super excited when I found out they were
making another one. I was losing my mind.

00:12:50.275 --> 00:12:51.472
I went back, watched all the movies.

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:56.954
And I came to realize that there’s no
Mexican Jedi’s. Not even one. There's no Mexican Jedi’s.

00:12:57.738 --> 00:13:02.165
Which is weird because when you look at it,
technically speaking. Technically speaking.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:04.485
Star Wars is a vision of America.

00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:06.646
In a distant future.

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:09.905
So

00:13:12.693 --> 00:13:14.385
Surely it would be safe to say.

00:13:14.781 --> 00:13:16.355
Judging by the current trajectory.

00:13:17.023 --> 00:13:18.921
Of Mexican people in America.

00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:21.574
I’m sure we would be safe to say by that time.

00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:23.754
In a galaxy far, far away.

00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:28.820
There would be at least one, just one Mexican Jedi.

00:13:29.054 --> 00:13:32.048
It’s not even like it would spoil the story,
Who knows it might open up a whole new avenue.

00:13:32.918 --> 00:13:35.900
Can you imagine how different that epic scene
between Luke and Darth could have been?

00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:38.712
Them battling it out on the Death Star.

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:40.597
The moment of realization.

00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:45.690
*Light Sabre sound*

00:13:45.715 --> 00:13:48.872
*heavy breathing* “Luke”

00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:51.353
*Light Sabre sound* “what do you want, you evil man!?”

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.657
*heavy breathing* “Luke”

00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:57.249
*Light Sabre sound* “what do you want from me!”

00:13:57.298 --> 00:14:00.338
*heavy breathing* “No...

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:02.142
look man...

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.716
LOOK!”

00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:15.473
“It’s your father, man”

00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:24.562
Cause all over the world they conform to a norm
and that is in airports women make announcements.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.231
It's always a woman, always.

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:27.575
And she's always calm.

00:14:27.788 --> 00:14:28.788
Always monotone.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.776
Always comes over that system, she sits in
a room quietly.

00:14:31.987 --> 00:14:33.335
They bring her the pages one by one.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.218
You can be in Heathrow for instance you'll
hear that woman come on the system.

00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:37.243
*PA system sound effect*

00:14:38.092 --> 00:14:39.761
"Attention all passengers.

00:14:40.534 --> 00:14:43.160
Please note this is an airport announcement.

00:14:43.442 --> 00:14:50.159
No passengers are permitted to leave any items
unattended as this may be seen as a security risk.

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:55.045
Any unattended luggage will be removed by
security and destroyed.

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:56.511
Thank you."

00:14:56.536 --> 00:14:57.536
*PA system turns off*

00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:01.396
Everywhere in the world, even if you go to
like non English speaking countries, they

00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:02.738
still conform to that norm.

00:15:03.248 --> 00:15:05.799
You know you go to places like China where
you wouldn't expect it, you know?

00:15:06.053 --> 00:15:09.564
You think and I see some of you probably thinking
there be like, *Stereotypical Chinese jibberish*

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:10.803
No, don't even laugh, that's racist.

00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:12.017
Don't even laugh.

00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:12.937
Don't, hey!

00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:13.638
Don't, no.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.202
That's racist. You don't even laugh.

00:15:17.097 --> 00:15:18.097
But they're not.

00:15:18.745 --> 00:15:19.605
They're calm.

00:15:19.703 --> 00:15:21.020
It's a woman, still the same.

00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:23.236
She's just another language she'll come on
the PA like,

00:15:23.319 --> 00:15:24.133
*PA system turns on*

00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:35.072
"*Calm Chinese jibberish*"

00:15:35.228 --> 00:15:36.045
*PA system turns off*

00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:38.268
And you know,

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.206
you know they've conformed.

00:15:41.655 --> 00:15:43.287
And then you land in South Africa.

00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:51.788
And you know you've landed, you know that your back
home when you walk into the airport terminal building.

00:15:57.653 --> 00:15:58.511
No, no, no.

00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:01.823
It's almost like who ever is closest to the
mic gets to do it first, you know?

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:03.730
No, you go do it

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:05.381
It's the craziest thing!

00:16:06.177 --> 00:16:08.210
Luckily 99 percent of the time it's a woman

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.752
but she'll come on its the craziest thing
ever as your walking she'll come and be like

00:16:10.777 --> 00:16:11.617
*PA system turns on*

00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:14.319
"ATTENTION ALL PASSENGERS!

00:16:16.617 --> 00:16:19.062
"ATTENTION ALL PASSENGERS!

00:16:19.942 --> 00:16:20.942
HELLO!

00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:22.485
HELLO!

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.510
I'm talking to you! Hello!

00:16:24.482 --> 00:16:27.576
All the people that is flying Kalula.com, the plane is delayed

00:16:30.843 --> 00:16:33.605
Yes, all the people must just take a ticket for
that plane and we won’t have a problem, okay.

00:16:33.808 --> 00:16:36.498
Just to confirm if your ticket says
two it’s going to be three, okay

00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:40.194
Just mustn’t complain when the plane
has left, I am telling you now

00:16:40.284 --> 00:16:42.378
And you must just phone the people to pick you up

00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:44.777
You must tell them: my plane has changed

00:16:44.824 --> 00:16:47.787
And then they start speaking to people the
background and they don't even turn off their mic!

00:16:47.908 --> 00:17:10.054
__________.

00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:10.974
"Okay."

00:17:11.606 --> 00:17:13.699
"Okay all the people that is flying one time

00:17:14.236 --> 00:17:15.613
the gate has changed."

00:17:16.307 --> 00:17:19.078
"It's not D2 it's C15."

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:22.479
"It's not D2 it's C15."

00:17:23.007 --> 00:17:26.673
If you can go to D2, you can find nothing.

00:17:27.593 --> 00:17:28.858
"Okay, bye bye."

00:17:28.883 --> 00:17:31.983
_______________.

00:17:32.388 --> 00:17:33.404
I don't surf.

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:35.287
I sit on the beach and I enjoy it from there.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.787
It looks beautiful, I enjoy it.

00:17:37.392 --> 00:17:41.243
And I'm sitting on the beach in Malibu and
it's during the week so it's really empty.

00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:43.174
There's just one girl surfing out there.

00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:45.898
California babe and she's rocking it, you
know?

00:17:45.923 --> 00:17:49.903
She's got this long blonde hair and tan looking
very fake and just, you know?

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:53.735
She's riding her board and doing her thing
and all those unnecessary surfing moves that

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.227
people do, you know?

00:17:58.618 --> 00:18:02.250
Just stay here, there's no need for...

00:18:02.404 --> 00:18:06.280
And surely, sure enough at the end of it that
she's doing those things and the wave comes

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:08.169
like *Wave crashing sound effect* and I was like,

00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:10.021
"You're dead. Dead."

00:18:10.842 --> 00:18:12.158
But she wasn't.

00:18:12.294 --> 00:18:16.046
She comes out of the water and she's having the time of her life!
And she looks over at me and she's like,

00:18:16.071 --> 00:18:18.189
*surfer girl accent* "Heeeeeey there!

00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:20.500
Are you like gonna come in?

00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:23.764
The water is like super ahhh-mazing!"

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:28.591
I said, "Uh, No. no, Thank you. No, thank you.
I'm just going to sit here.

00:18:28.623 --> 00:18:30.393
I'm just going to sit here and watch you.

00:18:30.418 --> 00:18:32.379
You're very good. Keep it up, keep it up!"

00:18:32.465 --> 00:18:35.024
She's like, "O-M-G!

00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:38.171
You talk funnyyyy!"

00:18:38.515 --> 00:18:40.895
"No I don't talk funny, you talk funny."

00:18:41.372 --> 00:18:43.010
"Where are you frommm?"

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.021
"I'm from South Africa."

00:18:44.046 --> 00:18:46.235
She's like, "Oh, wowww!

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.856
Like Africaaa?

00:18:48.402 --> 00:18:50.527
How did you get here?"

00:18:51.585 --> 00:18:52.418
What?

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.817
I used my monkey grip under the plane!

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.010
How did you get here?

00:18:57.822 --> 00:18:58.837
She doesn't even wait for my answer.

00:18:58.862 --> 00:19:03.046
She runs, she's in the water she's doing her thing
and surfing having a good time doing those things.

00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:05.638
She comes back out and now all of a sudden
we're best friends.

00:19:05.802 --> 00:19:08.957
She runs out onto the beach and she's like,
"Hey, Africaaaa!"

00:19:10.954 --> 00:19:12.731
I'm like, "Hey, Americaaaa..."

00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:17.016
"So like you don't surf at all?"

00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:19.502
I said, "no, I don't. I don't. Where
I'm from we don't really surf."

00:19:19.527 --> 00:19:21.536
Johannesburg, there’s no surfers out here,
you know?

00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:23.983
She's like, "Aww, that's too baaad.

00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:27.215
"Like, do you guys have waves in Africaaaah?"

00:19:28.347 --> 00:19:29.743
Do we have waves?

00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:35.811
A grown human being asks me if we have waves
on a continent.

00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:38.910
Like no, no, we don't, we don't.

00:19:39.128 --> 00:19:43.782
Yeah, by the time the water gets to our side of
the world it's just so tired, it's just you know?

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.808
It's so worn out from all the traveling.

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:46.903
It tries but it's just

00:19:46.928 --> 00:19:48.064
"Aaaaughhh!"

00:19:55.252 --> 00:19:56.834
Do we have waves?

00:19:58.505 --> 00:20:00.361
She's brilliant she says this and she runs

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:01.570
back into the water.

00:20:01.595 --> 00:20:04.811
And every time she goes out there, it's she
comes back more stupid.

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:05.836
It's like...

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.989
it's almost like she's fishing for stupidity
out there!

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:13.978
It's almost like there is a shark just like,
"Yeah ask him this now, ask him this! Ask him this!"

00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:18.364
Because she comes back and I'll never forget this until
the day I die, I will not forget this conversation.

00:20:18.389 --> 00:20:22.266
She comes back onto the beach and she stands next to
me and she's taking off her wet suit and she goes,

00:20:22.329 --> 00:20:24.293
"So like, Africaaa,

00:20:24.783 --> 00:20:27.050
can I like, ask you a questionnn?"

00:20:28.534 --> 00:20:30.640
I said, "Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead."

00:20:31.294 --> 00:20:32.991
"If you're like, from Africaaa...

00:20:33.412 --> 00:20:34.081
have you like...

00:20:34.106 --> 00:20:35.819
ever had AIDS?"

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.024
You know what's funny?

00:20:42.716 --> 00:20:44.925
Is I wasn't offended by the fact that she
said AIDS...

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.888
but I was offended by the fact that she said,

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.501
"ever HAD

00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:50.811
AIDS".

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.674
Like AIDS is something you could've "had" like
a passing flu, you know?

00:20:56.093 --> 00:20:59.963
"Hey Jonah, I didn't see you at work last
week Thursday Bro, where were you?"

00:20:59.988 --> 00:21:02.315
"Yeah Bro, I had a bit of AIDS there, I just

00:21:03.005 --> 00:21:04.088
it hit me hard, eh?

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:06.654
You know, I took some Corenza, now I'm back Bro."

00:21:09.055 --> 00:21:10.404
Ever "had"!

00:21:11.892 --> 00:21:16.736
And you know, I know, I know as a child of a continent
that's ravaged by this disease it's my job,

00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:19.063
it's my duty to educate people when I meet
them, you know?

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.553
It really is a part of who I am, but...

00:21:23.258 --> 00:21:26.595
but you know when you look at someone in their
eyes and...

00:21:28.124 --> 00:21:29.353
there's no hope?

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:33.650
It's just that old SABC tone just like

00:21:33.675 --> 00:21:36.669
*SABC ringing sound effect*.

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:39.576
It's only two of us...

00:21:39.873 --> 00:21:42.133
and I'm bored. I figured why not have some fun?

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:44.287
So I look at her and I'm like,

00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:46.487
"Yes.

00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:48.888
Yes, America.

00:21:49.465 --> 00:21:53.184
I've had AIDS many, many times."

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:56.958
She's like, "Oh wow, reallyyyy?

00:21:57.277 --> 00:21:59.728
Oh mah gaaaahd!

00:22:00.342 --> 00:22:04.438
So, aren't you gonna be like,
super skinny and dead or somethinggg?"

00:22:04.629 --> 00:22:05.552
I said, "No, no, no!

00:22:05.577 --> 00:22:08.578
AIDS is not as bad as you think.
It's just like chocolate, you know?

00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:10.407
You just shouldn't have too much at one time!

00:22:16.508 --> 00:22:17.685
And then you stop for a bit and then after
you're like,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.026
Wooo hoo, more AIDS! you know? You just chill."

00:22:20.087 --> 00:22:21.863
She's like, "Wowwww, AIDS are like chocolate?"

00:22:21.888 --> 00:22:23.619
I said, "Yeah, yeah! You should try it sometime."

00:22:23.657 --> 00:22:25.828
She's like, "Noooo. That's disgusting!

00:22:26.307 --> 00:22:29.711
'Cuz then if it's like, chocolate... then
it's gonna get all melty and Ima be covered

00:22:29.743 --> 00:22:32.134
in like, AIDS chocolate and I'll be all stickyyy

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:33.939
and I'll be all dirtyyy!"

00:22:33.963 --> 00:22:36.234
I was like, "Yeah, then you just take a shower.

00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:41.269
*Audience laughing*

00:22:41.294 --> 00:22:44.247
No, what are you guys? what do you...?

00:22:44.272 --> 00:22:46.656
Oh no! Don't you laugh at my president!

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.247
DAMN YOU PEOPLE!

00:22:48.272 --> 00:22:49.272
DAMN YOU!

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.731
I don't accept your laughter!

00:22:50.756 --> 00:22:51.756
DAMN YOU!

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:53.640
Don't you laugh!

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:55.402
This has nothing to do with that great man!

00:22:56.358 --> 00:22:57.699
Turning my jokes against me!

00:22:57.724 --> 00:22:58.262
NO!

00:22:58.639 --> 00:23:00.582
I will not participate in this madness!

00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:02.116
How else do you get clean?!

00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:07.036
Good evening

00:23:08.862 --> 00:23:09.666
or not.

00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:15.818
Sorry I get nervous when I start a comedy set

00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:20.607
I find comedy is very similar to sex for me

00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:21.474
Um

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.613
Well it is exactly like sex when you think about it, you know...

00:23:24.647 --> 00:23:26.907
just me the comedian playing the role of the man

00:23:27.594 --> 00:23:29.356
and you the audience the role of the woman

00:23:30.469 --> 00:23:32.954
because it my job to satisfy you

00:23:34.818 --> 00:23:36.435
and you just have to sit there

00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:45.151
and then just like sex my success
or failure is somehow determined by

00:23:45.386 --> 00:23:46.825
how much noise you make

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:49.861
during my performance.

00:23:51.242 --> 00:23:53.493
You are just faking it now, thank you.

00:23:55.683 --> 00:23:57.292
It's a one sided afair.

00:23:58.108 --> 00:24:00.165
So I hope you aren’t the quite types

00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:01.720
*sound of giggeling'*

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.058
No, no, you where great really.

00:24:04.773 --> 00:24:08.331
*Loud laughter*

00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:15.864
makes it worse when a guy laughs in the middle of it.

00:24:18.935 --> 00:24:20.384
It is not meant to be funny.

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:25.701
This is my first time in Australia
and I must say, I'm enjoying it

00:24:25.726 --> 00:24:28.434
after two days of traveling to get here

00:24:28.459 --> 00:24:32.301
I finally arrived and it is quite a quaint place

00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:35.019
it wasn’t supposed to take me that long, we where delayed.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.135
First delay was I got to the airport in Johannesburg

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.376
I was on a Quantis flight and they said,
sorry Sir there is a bit of a delay.

00:24:42.693 --> 00:24:44.731
I said how long,
they said 24 hours.

00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:47.818
I said well that is not a delay, that is cancellation.

00:24:48.601 --> 00:24:50.646
I said it is another day, so
they said come back tomorrow.

00:24:50.704 --> 00:24:52.657
I came back the next day and we tried it again

00:24:52.682 --> 00:24:54.056
and this time we where on the plane

00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:56.542
and there was another delay of about 4 to 5 hours

00:24:56.617 --> 00:24:58.227
where we are stuck on the tarmac

00:24:58.359 --> 00:24:59.785
and the plane couldn’t take off

00:24:59.883 --> 00:25:01.953
because the airplane was not balanced.

00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:04.059
I have never heard of that in my life.

00:25:04.645 --> 00:25:06.244
that is what the pilot said

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.765
and like because he is a pilot we
believed him, he just said it.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.095
Because the pilot sounds serious when
they are saying, he came on and he said:

00:25:13.214 --> 00:25:15.192
"Ladies and Gentlemen I got a bit of a problem on the plane"

00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.091
" I don’t kno0w what it going on,
it seems like it is not balanced"

00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:21.635
"but we will have to check on what is going on"

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.344
"we will get back to you as soon as we know."

00:25:25.448 --> 00:25:26.792
Hell of a flight.

00:25:30.553 --> 00:25:33.495
As soon as he said that I looked at the fat people

00:25:35.323 --> 00:25:37.650
but not in a bad way, not in a bad way

00:25:37.861 --> 00:25:41.562
Just in a objective manner, like
hey you guys cant sit together.

00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:45.527
You need to sit one, yeah the plane

00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:48.154
probably you, it's probably you.

00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:55.679
Speaking of fat people, is Biggest
Loser the biggest show in Australia?

00:25:55.704 --> 00:25:58.313
That what I see on T.v
the Biggest Loser.

00:25:58.537 --> 00:25:59.930
I ,ove that show, it is fantastic

00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:01.041
it is always on T.v

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.075
What a fantastic show. For those who
don’t know, The Biggest Loser is a show

00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:06.768
where they try to help fat people lose weight

00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:09.854
through torture basically.

00:26:10.114 --> 00:26:12.060
Yes, both emotional and physical

00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:16.175
Yeah, the do horrible things like leaving
food in the house that they are living in

00:26:16.217 --> 00:26:17.670
then ask them why they are eating it

00:26:17.805 --> 00:26:20.952
"Why did you eat the food Kevin,
why did you eat the food?"

00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:23.922
because it is there and he is
fat, that is what he does.

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:27.490
This is like his specialty, you know this before he came

00:26:27.522 --> 00:26:29.393
why are you now acting shocked?

00:26:31.202 --> 00:26:34.425
they should do a show about the people that make
the show and call it "The Biggest Assholes"

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:35.983
that is what they should say.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.652
The show is not helping anybody.

00:26:40.113 --> 00:26:43.005
I love it, what an amazing show.

00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:48.192
But yes we are flying, so we flew from Johannesburg to Sydney

00:26:48.217 --> 00:26:52.450
Sydney you come in and then you have to leave the
airport and then go back into the airport to fly

00:26:52.757 --> 00:26:54.973
you go through border control, very friendly I must say

00:26:54.998 --> 00:26:56.774
Australia I am very impressed, you
guys have very friendly border control

00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:58.657
you guys are very chilled out, very cool

00:26:58.835 --> 00:27:02.580
Like visa is not really need, it is but not like

00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:03.362
"Do you have your visa?"

00:27:03.387 --> 00:27:03.816
No.

00:27:03.816 --> 00:27:05.751
"Oh, alright"

00:27:05.776 --> 00:27:08.230
You know. I learned the secret to getting through

00:27:08.273 --> 00:27:10.242
from a few Chinese men that where ahead of me

00:27:10.267 --> 00:27:13.993
is that you just have to irritate the
border police and they just let you in

00:27:14.089 --> 00:27:16.082
There was a guy ahead of
me and the woman asked him

00:27:16.107 --> 00:27:18.868
"Excuse me Sir, where are you staying
in Australia, where are you staying?

00:27:18.893 --> 00:27:21.039
He went, "Kangaroo, kangaroo!"

00:27:21.332 --> 00:27:22.961
"No Sir, where are you staying?"

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:24.439
"Kangaroo, kangaroo!"

00:27:24.634 --> 00:27:27.241
"No Sir, you cant, where are you
going to be staying? How long?"

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.999
"Kangaroo, kangaroo!"

00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:31.374
She is like, "Okay, just
go in, just go in."

00:27:31.756 --> 00:27:33.979
and he just came in and he was like

00:27:34.504 --> 00:27:36.213
It was fantastic, it was fantastic.

00:27:36.344 --> 00:27:38.335
Yes and he had this look when
he got to the other side like

00:27:38.353 --> 00:27:40.019
It works every time, you know.

00:27:40.737 --> 00:27:42.593
He had this knowing look about him

00:27:42.602 --> 00:27:44.092
So we, you come in

00:27:44.117 --> 00:27:46.294
and it seems too easy, because it is

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:48.114
because the border control is very chilled

00:27:48.184 --> 00:27:49.931
but then you get to the customs

00:27:49.976 --> 00:27:52.705
which is the most hardcore place in the world.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.470
I don’t know what happened in Australia but
you guys need to chill out when it comes to fruit.

00:27:58.836 --> 00:28:00.778
People are standing there being strip-searched

00:28:00.803 --> 00:28:02.264
"Where did you get the apple!"

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.433
"I don’t care if you cant speak English, you
gonna spend a week in quarantine mate!"

00:28:06.573 --> 00:28:08.167
"Where did you get the apple?!"

00:28:08.498 --> 00:28:11.438
"I don’t care, I don’t care!
Where is the apple from?"

00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:15.721
You see people, there was a
guy that got stopped for weed

00:28:15.746 --> 00:28:17.636
He's like: "Is that meruana?
don’t do it again"

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:21.234
"but you with the apple, back
to where you came from!"

00:28:23.595 --> 00:28:26.701
What did fruit do to your country?

00:28:29.353 --> 00:28:32.176
It is such a weird place getting used to
Australia, because you finally come in

00:28:32.346 --> 00:28:35.265
and then you cant understand anybody,
you really really cant because

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.405
because you guys say you speak English but it's not

00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:40.210
it is like you try but then I could not tell

00:28:40.235 --> 00:28:42.218
because sometimes it actually sounds like Chinese

00:28:42.343 --> 00:28:44.482
I used to hear people making jokes about
Oh there are all all these Chinese people

00:28:44.507 --> 00:28:47.129
but then when you come you don’t know if
the Australians are Chinese or not Chinese

00:28:47.285 --> 00:28:48.448
because it sounds the same to me

00:28:48.473 --> 00:28:51.230
especially like a very deep
Australian accent is very, like people say

00:28:51.255 --> 00:28:57.693
*Chinesse jibberish*

00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:00.547
Oh yeah, Shushini, shushini

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:03.566
No, I don’t know what is going on here man.
This is very

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.678
and then the phrases that I do understand don’t make sense

00:29:05.722 --> 00:29:07.825
like positive phrases. Like apparently

00:29:08.028 --> 00:29:08.974
apparently she'll be right.

00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.307
I don’t know who she is
and how she applies to me

00:29:11.422 --> 00:29:13.936
but this is very important to say in Australia.

00:29:14.091 --> 00:29:17.351
You also feel it is very important to
tell everybody that you have no worries.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.282
Yes, I did not ask you about your life philosophy

00:29:20.315 --> 00:29:22.491
I just asked you how you where on the day

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:23.955
"No worries, no worries."

00:29:23.989 --> 00:29:26.066
Really not even one, not even one worry?

00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:27.862
Really in Australia, are things that good here?

00:29:27.887 --> 00:29:30.079
not even one worry, not even prostate cancer?

00:29:30.104 --> 00:29:32.454
not even one, not even North Korea?

00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:34.480
because those guys are close, I am just saying.

00:29:34.505 --> 00:29:37.185
Not even one worry?
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:39.344
and the strangest one, and this is something I have learned

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:41.312
that you should teach people before they come is

00:29:41.545 --> 00:29:44.276
The correct answer to the phrase, "How you going"

00:29:44.498 --> 00:29:46.114
Is not, "By airplane."

00:29:46.371 --> 00:29:49.798
I feel it is strange asking people this while they are traveling

00:29:49.823 --> 00:29:51.403
I was flying, we where in Sydney

00:29:51.428 --> 00:29:53.477
going to Melbourne and I got to the counter

00:29:53.502 --> 00:29:56.019
I said to the woman: "hi I am going to Melbourne please"

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:57.846
and she said: "Oh yeah, how you going?"

00:29:58.306 --> 00:29:59.888
and I said: "by airplane."

00:30:00.645 --> 00:30:03.407
that is why I have chosen this building over here

00:30:04.147 --> 00:30:05.409
to be traveling in.

00:30:05.912 --> 00:30:07.850
and she said no, I was greeting you.

00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:09.358
and I said: "oh, no worries."

00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:12.050
You guys have been great, thanks for having me.

00:30:12.213 --> 00:30:16.202
This is so amazing, so many of you here,
to see me.. huh!?

00:30:22.126 --> 00:30:24.831
That was like the most amazing
experience. I didn't know that the Royal Wedding

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:28.080
was going to be this weekend.
I didn't know it was gonna be today.  I planned my

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:33.720
show long before them... I knew that I
loved you before he knew... that's what I'm saying...

00:30:34.313 --> 00:30:36.938
I planned our big day long before
they planned theirs...

00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:40.731
and then now everyone was like... Are you going to
London, are you go for the Royal Wedding?

00:30:40.762 --> 00:30:44.040
Are you here for the Royal Wedding? Are
you here for the Royal Wedding?

00:30:45.316 --> 00:30:48.604
It's quite an event, I have to say... like
everything.. everyone... everyone is watching...

00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:51.677
everything about you! All the stories
people would talk about...

00:30:51.702 --> 00:30:54.204
Cause you're watching it all over the world.
They're like... yes Megan Markle...

00:30:54.318 --> 00:30:59.511
Yes, she isn't she isn't the typical
royal! Yes... she's not the typical royal...

00:30:59.536 --> 00:31:02.124
what we mean is... (mouthing) "BLACK" Yes!

00:31:02.925 --> 00:31:06.320
Typical Royal, she's comes from an
unconventional (mouthing) "BLACK" family!

00:31:15.357 --> 00:31:18.703
I was like... yeah man she
does, she comes from an unconventional family...

00:31:18.999 --> 00:31:21.583
just like Harry... Same thing. Come on!

00:31:27.602 --> 00:31:29.137
And they look good together.

00:31:30.372 --> 00:31:31.315
It was beautiful!

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.857
Everyone was stressed out about it... Megan
Markle's family was in the tabloids...

00:31:34.923 --> 00:31:38.624
The Daily Mail trying to destroy their lives!
Man, when the Daily Mail comes after you...

00:31:38.649 --> 00:31:43.080
They do not mess around! They will find
that one Uncle in your family who's an

00:31:43.112 --> 00:31:45.245
alcoholic and shits his pants!!!

00:31:45.863 --> 00:31:47.801
Meet Trevor's Uncle Bobby...

00:31:47.826 --> 00:31:50.144
I didn't even know I had an Uncle Bobby!!

00:31:50.796 --> 00:31:53.909
Well now you do....
and he shits his pants!!

00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:57.317
and they'll always find a way to try and link it to you...
like it's your fault!

00:31:57.571 --> 00:32:02.734
They'll be like... Megan Markle's,
Uncle's, son Donny didn't pay his bills!

00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:04.492
she doesn't even know him!

00:32:04.764 --> 00:32:09.148
Doesn't matter...
It shows that her family is unconventional.

00:32:11.838 --> 00:32:15.264
I'm not gonna lie... I was
glad that it was the white side of Meghan's family

00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:18.102
That was a.... I'm not gonna lie...

00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:19.169
I'm....

00:32:19.169 --> 00:32:21.517
We could not handle that as black people!

00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:24.695
That is the last thing we needed!

00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:28.676
Can you imagine if that was the
black side of the family?? Really!?

00:32:28.793 --> 00:32:31.210
If Megan's dad was on TV and he was like....

00:32:31.254 --> 00:32:33.570
Oh noooo, I'm not coming to their wedding.

00:32:33.825 --> 00:32:34.825
Noooo!

00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:38.949
Here we see Meghan's father posing for photos....

00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:44.644
Ahh you caught me again... oh
no, you have caught me! ahhh!

00:32:46.309 --> 00:32:47.348
Black people would have never...

00:32:47.373 --> 00:32:49.636
Cause that's the hard thing
about being a minority... whether you're black...

00:32:49.738 --> 00:32:52.249
whether you're in your... whether you...
you know whether you're Arabic...

00:32:52.274 --> 00:32:55.117
whatever it is... like if you're a minority...
if you if you have a certain skin tone...

00:32:55.142 --> 00:32:58.866
you know that every action you commit,
every action you commit, like.... taints your

00:32:58.891 --> 00:33:02.401
whole... your family. It taints your
everything! White people are individuals...

00:33:02.498 --> 00:33:04.477
that's white people... that's like the best
thing in the world!

00:33:04.597 --> 00:33:06.820
That's what white privilege means to me, you're an individual...

00:33:07.383 --> 00:33:09.490
Let's look at Dave... he is excellent!

00:33:09.804 --> 00:33:11.436
He's a mass murderer!!

00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:16.306
As Trevor, if I killed half of you
tonight... they'd be like...

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.816
Ahhh...

00:33:18.082 --> 00:33:19.699
Those mixed breeds!!

00:33:21.276 --> 00:33:23.170
I take everyone down with me!

00:33:24.994 --> 00:33:26.230
So much stress.

00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:27.629
So I was glad... I was glad...

00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:30.994
Like her mom was there... uh no, fly...
looking beautiful as well!

00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:33.681
The wedding went off without a hitch...

00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:36.011
And my favorite thing was how like...

00:33:36.055 --> 00:33:39.609
how like, the British media talked about...
How black the event was...

00:33:40.798 --> 00:33:42.272
and they weren't... I understand and here's the thing...

00:33:42.334 --> 00:33:45.061
This is like one of those things,
where I understand... like, they want to talk about it...

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:47.704
because you're not used to
having like a black wedding, right?!

00:33:47.876 --> 00:33:51.041
And so like everyone today... I'd had like CNN...
contacted me and they're like... Trevor!

00:33:51.125 --> 00:33:57.000
Would you mind speaking about...umm..The
wedding.. and, and rarely all the black performers?!

00:33:57.171 --> 00:33:58.738
There was a black cellist...

00:33:58.983 --> 00:34:00.819
and, there was a black choir...

00:34:00.844 --> 00:34:02.440
and a black Pastor!

00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:04.220
How do you feel??

00:34:04.548 --> 00:34:05.548
Black?!?

00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:07.931
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel...

00:34:07.956 --> 00:34:08.400
What are you...

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.605
How do you respond to that question?!

00:34:10.687 --> 00:34:12.955
How do you feel about...
I don't know how I feel, it's a wedding!

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.417
I don't know... what do you want me
to say?

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:15.721
that's a normal wedding...

00:34:15.746 --> 00:34:18.237
I wasn't watching that wedding being like...
Whoa that's black!

00:34:19.243 --> 00:34:20.194
So much black...

00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:21.535
Another one!

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:24.508
It's a wedding...

00:34:24.533 --> 00:34:26.295
what do you want me to say... It's people!

00:34:28.085 --> 00:34:31.490
And also... I feel like people go too far, like you
know that's where you realize that

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.655
there's enough.... there's not enough like
diversity in your world. Is if you think

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.567
that... THAT made it a black wedding!!

00:34:38.388 --> 00:34:39.365
Let me tell you something...

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:42.502
A black cellist... has canceled itself out!

00:34:44.836 --> 00:34:46.912
If have a black person playing the cello...

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.131
It's safe to say, that you've canceled
out the blackness of that event!

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:55.961
That's the safest way to introduce blackness into your family...

00:34:56.115 --> 00:34:57.789
Daddy!! I'm dating a black man!!

00:34:57.814 --> 00:34:58.189
What?!?

00:34:58.189 --> 00:34:59.189
He plays the cello!

00:34:59.214 --> 00:35:00.902
Alright, bring him in, bring him in!

00:35:01.932 --> 00:35:04.280
Even white people think a cello is white.

00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:07.236
You walk in with a cello?! White people are also like...

00:35:07.261 --> 00:35:09.196
What the hell is that man?

00:35:10.696 --> 00:35:13.185
like it was a black wedding... It wasn't a black...
It was just a wedding!

00:35:13.887 --> 00:35:15.888
It was a beautiful, beautiful
wedding!

00:35:16.539 --> 00:35:18.715
If it was a real black wedding, it wouldn't have ended!

00:35:20.942 --> 00:35:22.386
That's a REAL black wedding!

00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:25.064
It would NEVER end!

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:29.092
If it was a real black wedding... Prince's Nigerian Uncle...

00:35:29.602 --> 00:35:31.134
You would've found like Harry's Nigerian Uncle

00:35:31.159 --> 00:35:33.033
He would have been in the carriage
with them...

00:35:33.356 --> 00:35:35.184
I'm not paying for this carriage...

00:35:35.209 --> 00:35:36.853
And not riding in it, ahh?!

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:41.191
you want to ride alone Harry?? You want to drive alone?!

00:35:41.216 --> 00:35:43.218
Let me tell you something.. Ah!?

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:45.641
Let... me... tell.... you something!

00:35:45.927 --> 00:35:49.320
We are all getting in this carriage! Ah?! Every single one of us!

00:35:49.495 --> 00:35:50.965
_______, get in the carriage...

00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:53.372
There is space for everybody! Don't be like
that Harry! huh?!

00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:56.327
This is your family's day! This is not just your day ah?!

00:35:57.174 --> 00:36:00.151
When you were a little boy.... Who was there for you?!

00:36:00.176 --> 00:36:00.873
Huh?

00:36:01.215 --> 00:36:03.748
Who was there? That... I was here! ah!?

00:36:04.008 --> 00:36:05.008
I was there!

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.593
Uncle _______ was there for you Harry!

00:36:07.878 --> 00:36:10.175
Don't be like that, huh?! Don't be
like that!

00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:13.002
Where do you think you get your bald spot from? Ah?!

00:36:13.395 --> 00:36:15.204
Where do you think you got that from?

00:36:15.819 --> 00:36:17.352
That's a black wedding!

00:36:18.859 --> 00:36:22.665
This was just a wedding... a wedding that
included black people, that's all it was.

00:36:23.209 --> 00:36:24.209
And it was beautiful.

00:36:25.132 --> 00:36:26.132
It was beautiful to see...

00:36:26.495 --> 00:36:27.765
All the celebrities showing up.

00:36:27.979 --> 00:36:30.052
All the famous people... they
sang God Save The....

00:36:30.161 --> 00:36:33.452
I never noticed... that when they sing God
Save The Queen... The Queen doesn't sing.

00:36:35.411 --> 00:36:37.610
which I understand... I mean, I feel like
that would be a little bit weird

00:36:37.635 --> 00:36:41.335
Like she knows... like which is... like that's
what I like about the Queen, I'm not gonna front

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.435
Like she has a gangster vibe about her.
Like... she's gotten to that point where she's like...

00:36:45.475 --> 00:36:47.794
Yeah I'm the Queen, I'm over it! Let's keep it moving...

00:36:48.972 --> 00:36:50.908
She doesn't act like someone who's the Queen anymore...

00:36:50.933 --> 00:36:52.910
She's just like I'm over it... I'm the Queen!

00:36:53.026 --> 00:36:59.314
And so everyone standing there like God, (gibberish)

00:36:59.339 --> 00:37:02.046
She's like... yeah yeah, I know, I know... Save Me, I know!

00:37:03.035 --> 00:37:04.271
I'm not going to sing it for myself!

00:37:04.296 --> 00:37:09.659
Can't be like.... Saaa, aaaa, aaaaave, me!

00:37:09.684 --> 00:37:11.437
I don't need you assholes to save me!

00:37:13.855 --> 00:37:15.402
I drive myself!

00:37:16.805 --> 00:37:17.805
Ha ha ha ha

00:37:19.484 --> 00:37:21.934
It was such a beautiful day... every single piece of it.

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:23.826
It was wonderful, seeing the people in the streets...

00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:25.643
Everyone had a smile on their face...

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.257
You know, everyone was happy!

00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:30.671
Cause like Harry's popular! He's popular in
southern Africa. He's popular in the UK

00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:35.208
He's got that cool vibe about him... you
know Meghan Markle as well... has inspired people

00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:38.333
The only weird thing in the wedding for me was...
they had a black Pastor.

00:37:38.666 --> 00:37:40.595
African Pastor, and...

00:37:41.177 --> 00:37:43.244
and.... This was like... It was weird in a good way!

00:37:43.316 --> 00:37:44.633
He started giving a sermon...

00:37:44.927 --> 00:37:46.738
And he started talking about Martin Luther King.

00:37:46.976 --> 00:37:48.812
And then he started talking about slavery.

00:37:50.122 --> 00:37:51.402
And I could see, in that moment...

00:37:51.427 --> 00:37:54.673
There were people in the audience who were like...
God Save The Queen! God Save The Queen!

00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:58.146
Somebody STOP this man! God Save The
Queen!

00:37:58.813 --> 00:38:00.672
That is why Jacob has been different because

00:38:00.797 --> 00:38:02.857
because a lot of people panic in
South Africa, they panic you know

00:38:02.882 --> 00:38:05.922
when it comes to our politicians because of this.
They just don’t understand them

00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:09.584
Especially around election time, that is when
you see the most panic in South Africa.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.020
It has always been the case

00:38:11.285 --> 00:38:13.766
for our first democratic election in 1994

00:38:14.307 --> 00:38:14.967
Remember that?

00:38:15.277 --> 00:38:17.300
Nelson Mandela was about to become president

00:38:17.535 --> 00:38:19.995
most of the country was over joyed, a few people where worried.

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:21.521
you heard them whispering

00:38:22.283 --> 00:38:24.118
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:26.565
"I am going to Australia Mary."

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.799
"I am going, it has been fun
but it is time to go hey?"

00:38:32.123 --> 00:38:34.450
"because you know now they are going
to take over, it is time to go."

00:38:35.149 --> 00:38:37.010
"I am leaving, I am going to Australia."

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.076
Then Nelson Mandela became president

00:38:40.486 --> 00:38:41.486
and they all stayed.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.668
"He is a wonderful man!
Wonder full man, ah!"

00:38:45.237 --> 00:38:47.963
"If it was not for him I would have left."

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:51.285
"Wonderful man, he is amazing yeah"

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.724
"He is really great, I love him.
He is amazing."

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.720
You thought they where over it but
next elections people panicked again.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.640
Thabo Mbeki about to become president and people lost it.

00:39:01.065 --> 00:39:03.706
"I am leaving, I am going to
Australia Mary. I am going."

00:39:04.353 --> 00:39:07.956
"This time I am going. You know that now that
Mandela is gone they are going to eat us hey?"

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.000
"It is only a matter of time"

00:39:11.964 --> 00:39:14.061
"I am leaving, I am going to Australia!"

00:39:15.867 --> 00:39:18.888
But once again, Thabo became president

00:39:19.297 --> 00:39:20.297
and they all stayed.

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:22.289
He left.

00:39:24.539 --> 00:39:26.539
No shame, no no shame.

00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:31.720
Then we had Kgalema Motlanthe, wasn’t that crazy?

00:39:31.745 --> 00:39:33.397
Kgalema Motlantheeeee

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.185
He is like our interim president,
didn’t want to touch anything.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.210
He was that guy, hey?

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.642
No one knew what to get of him, it was just like crazy

00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:40.954
and they lost their minds even worse.

00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:43.390
"I cant believe it!
I didn’t even vote!

00:39:44.286 --> 00:39:45.998
"I didn’t even vote!"

00:39:46.929 --> 00:39:48.921
"What the hell!
One minute I go to PEP"

00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:50.898
"and Thabo Mbeki is our president"

00:39:51.392 --> 00:39:54.102
"and the next thing you know,
I wake up and we have"

00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:56.925
"Kgalema Mmmmglanti!
I cant believe it!"

00:39:57.404 --> 00:39:59.965
"I am going to Australia, I am going!"

00:40:06.254 --> 00:40:08.180
But then once again thankfully they stayed,

00:40:09.183 --> 00:40:10.404
and then it got interesting

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.081
because it was the turn of Jacob Zuma.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.845
OOOOHHH

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.443
The original boogeyman.

00:40:20.175 --> 00:40:22.608
People panicked again, although it was different

00:40:23.001 --> 00:40:25.198
for the first time in South African
history you heard black people going

00:40:25.233 --> 00:40:25.833
"Eish!"

00:40:26.944 --> 00:40:29.018
"How much is that ticket to Australia again?"

00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:37.347
Jacob knew he had to go
big, go big or go home

00:40:39.323 --> 00:40:42.574
he knew there was only one way from
where he was and that was down

00:40:43.504 --> 00:40:45.546
Jacob was like, "They will remember me"

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.356
"One way or another"

00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:57.698
"Mandela might be the father of the nation
but I will be the father of a nation

00:41:07.362 --> 00:41:10.737
I wanted Jacob to be a mad man, I
wanted him to be totally crazy you know?

00:41:11.254 --> 00:41:13.583
I wanted him to not give damn, walk into parliament

00:41:13.608 --> 00:41:16.988
4 hours late, his top undone, belly hanging out

00:41:17.307 --> 00:41:19.048
walk in like nothing is wrong in the world

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.382
Everyone has been waiting for him, him running and singing

00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:34.695
*Jacob humming and dancing*

00:41:34.816 --> 00:41:35.973
Helen Ziller in the corner

00:41:35.998 --> 00:41:37.544
"Jacob, you are late Jacob"

00:41:37.724 --> 00:41:40.467
"Jacob we have been waiting for you for 4 hours, you cant come..."

00:41:40.492 --> 00:41:42.162
"Hey, shut up you!"

00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:45.226
"Shut up. Late for
who, late for who!"

00:41:45.565 --> 00:41:48.045
"It is my time not, shut up you!"

00:41:48.233 --> 00:41:50.145
Jacob Zuma, unlike the rest of us does not conform

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.170
he does not conform

00:41:51.479 --> 00:41:52.623
to the norms, you know?

00:41:52.907 --> 00:41:55.723
He does not conform the laws of gramar and
punctuation as we mere mortals

00:41:55.748 --> 00:41:56.423
No.

00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:57.654
No.

00:41:58.302 --> 00:41:59.302
Not our President.

00:42:00.738 --> 00:42:02.213
"Comma? For who?"

00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:05.837
"for you maybe not me"

00:42:07.995 --> 00:42:09.515
"comes out there confident

00:42:09.728 --> 00:42:11.430
Cadence wherever he pleases.

00:42:12.295 --> 00:42:13.295
Reading out

00:42:18.476 --> 00:42:19.476
"We"

00:42:21.893 --> 00:42:23.297
"have and"

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.879
"always will be"

00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:28.843
"Proud members"

00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:30.315
"of the A"

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.159
"NC"

00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:37.703
"and as such"

00:42:39.053 --> 00:42:41.403
"we are proud supporters"

00:42:42.667 --> 00:42:43.996
"of the devil"

00:42:44.158 --> 00:42:45.158
"opment"

00:42:51.405 --> 00:42:52.405
"of"

00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:54.539
"rural errors"

00:42:56.037 --> 00:42:59.813
"and as such, it is of utmost imopince"

00:43:01.794 --> 00:43:05.628
"to note that 2011"

00:43:06.223 --> 00:43:08.178
"is the year for us all"

00:43:08.584 --> 00:43:10.088
"to party"

00:43:10.113 --> 00:43:12.121
"Yay!"
"tisipate"

00:43:20.773 --> 00:43:23.314
"and so forth"

00:43:25.189 --> 00:43:28.596
"let it not be a blame game"

00:43:30.036 --> 00:43:34.068
"Let us understand that I, Jacob Zuma"

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:36.932
"am not a cunt"

00:43:36.941 --> 00:43:37.941
"tree on my own"

00:43:38.026 --> 00:43:46.853
*Loud aplause*

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.034
Zuma comes out and says, hey I am not perfect

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:53.092
I am human, I make mistakes. 
Just like you

00:43:53.684 --> 00:43:55.334
now and again I will make a mistake

00:43:56.169 --> 00:43:58.088
and another one, and another one, and another one

00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:00.822
and another one, but hey! Who is perfect?

00:44:02.382 --> 00:44:05.160
I look at Jacob Zuma and he strikes me as the kind of person who

00:44:05.335 --> 00:44:07.400
is on Facebook, he just has that vibe to him

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.642
Well you can see Facebook people. Some people
look like Facebook people, some people don’t.

00:44:11.024 --> 00:44:14.371
He just strikes me as a Facebook person,
he strikes me as that kind of guy you know.

00:44:14.486 --> 00:44:17.553
In the presidential office in the morning, he is sitting there

00:44:17.881 --> 00:44:18.881
getting everything ready

00:44:19.313 --> 00:44:20.640
and then he gets into it

00:44:20.673 --> 00:44:22.735
*computer mouse clicking*

00:44:23.698 --> 00:44:30.741
www.Facebook.com

00:44:30.766 --> 00:44:31.766
*computer mouse clicking*

00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:33.034
*phone ringing*

00:44:33.154 --> 00:44:35.502
"Hello? No,  I am very busy now, very busy."

00:44:36.135 --> 00:44:38.869
"Yeah, I am writing a speech."
"Yeah"

00:44:39.685 --> 00:44:42.484
"about the world okay, bye bye.
 Bye bye!"

00:44:42.725 --> 00:44:43.423
*hanging up the phone*

00:44:44.936 --> 00:44:46.522
"Log-in"

00:44:47.225 --> 00:44:48.478

00:44:49.412 --> 00:44:50.797

00:44:51.709 --> 00:44:52.709
"Zu..."

00:44:53.272 --> 00:45:04.401
*Searcging for letters on the keyboard*

00:45:04.529 --> 00:45:05.752
"Julius!"

00:45:11.946 --> 00:45:12.946
"Julius!"

00:45:13.396 --> 00:45:14.180
"Yeah"

00:45:15.016 --> 00:45:16.016
"Where is U?"

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.517

00:45:19.254 --> 00:45:21.631

00:45:23.156 --> 00:45:23.853

"U!"

"Log in!"
"How!"

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.149
"Status update"

00:45:31.705 --> 00:45:34.602
"Jacob is feeling"

00:45:35.185 --> 00:45:37.286
"Frisky!"

00:45:37.327 --> 00:45:40.256
"send!"
"Now all the single ladies put their hands up"

00:45:41.214 --> 00:45:43.763

00:45:44.264 --> 00:45:45.979
"a mention, an intention"

00:45:46.642 --> 00:45:49.211
"a friend request! Except, except, except"

00:45:49.631 --> 00:45:51.096

"Hey, Hellen Ziller!"
"Ignore!"

00:46:01.797 --> 00:46:03.014
"Never!"

00:46:05.752 --> 00:46:07.446
"Just now she sees my photo's"

00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:10.736
"Coming here with"

00:46:11.437 --> 00:46:12.437

00:46:13.421 --> 00:46:15.550
"Julius, invitation"

"No man Julius, I don’t want to be a vampire"
"Decline!"

00:46:18.658 --> 00:46:19.658
"Eish, this guy!"

00:46:20.702 --> 00:46:23.534
"What, obviously team Jacob. 
Stupid question"

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:29.635
"come in here with this things"

00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:33.839
"Okay, Mbeki is online now"

00:46:35.455 --> 00:46:38.500
"Okay, check the status"

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:41.553
"Mbeki is an African"

00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:44.655
"Comment"

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.812
"Mbeki is unemployed"

00:46:49.846 --> 00:46:55.091
*Jacob Zuma laughing*

00:46:55.116 --> 00:46:55.711
"Send"

00:46:55.736 --> 00:46:58.720
*Jacob Zuma laughing*

00:46:58.745 --> 00:46:59.356
"Like"

00:46:59.545 --> 00:47:03.788
*Jacob Zuma laughing*

00:47:03.813 --> 00:47:05.531
"Poke, poke, poke!"

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.858
*Jacob Zuma laughing*

00:47:06.883 --> 00:47:08.009
"Super poke!*

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:08.993
*Jacob Zuma laughing*

00:47:09.018 --> 00:47:10.840
"That guy man, what is happening here?"

00:47:10.865 --> 00:47:13.300
Barack, still no response.
This guy is not serious.

00:47:13.796 --> 00:47:15.580
"Hide, doesn’t send Barack

00:47:15.605 --> 00:47:19.440
"Friend request all the time, don’t even message"

00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:21.501
"Dear"

00:47:21.969 --> 00:47:23.350
"Barack"

00:47:24.716 --> 00:47:25.716
"it's"

00:47:25.818 --> 00:47:26.818
"me"

00:47:27.492 --> 00:47:28.492
"Jacob"

00:47:30.962 --> 00:47:31.962
"Why"

00:47:32.607 --> 00:47:33.607
"don’t"

00:47:34.154 --> 00:47:35.154
"you"

00:47:36.009 --> 00:47:37.905
"want to be"

00:47:37.945 --> 00:47:46.658
*Laughter*

00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:49.162
"my friend"

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:50.594
"Huh?"

00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:53.874
He looks like he could type that huh?

00:47:54.182 --> 00:47:55.908
H, U, H
Huh?

00:47:57.432 --> 00:48:01.420
For some reason I feel like this is a great
portrayal of Jacob, I feel like this is

00:48:01.798 --> 00:48:03.228
This seems like he would type on a keyboard

00:48:03.253 --> 00:48:04.427
I have never seen him but I don’t know

00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:05.452
like, you know?

00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:06.945
He seems like this type of guy.

00:48:08.022 --> 00:48:09.151
Like a finger typer

00:48:09.225 --> 00:48:12.177
* typing with 2 fingers*

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.101
Because, I don’t know with like
standard 2 I don’t think he is like

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:16.406
*typing on a keyboard*

00:48:17.627 --> 00:48:18.727
No, no, I didn’t mean it  bad

00:48:18.752 --> 00:48:20.084
who was like woa?

00:48:20.792 --> 00:48:21.713
I am just saying I...

00:48:21.738 --> 00:48:23.784
because by saying woa you are saying

00:48:24.038 --> 00:48:28.431
Trevor I disagree with you, I think it is pretty
reasonable to assume Jacob Zuma types like this.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.159
He is a 70 word per minute kind of guy, you know

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.344
Is like that what you?

00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:35.021
Oh mind you, what you
are also saying is

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.396
the guy who speaks like

00:48:37.891 --> 00:48:38.891
"Thous"

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:39.900
"O one"

00:48:40.491 --> 00:48:41.909
"two"
That guy

00:48:42.634 --> 00:48:43.983
What you are saying is

00:48:44.148 --> 00:48:45.755
all of the sudden when he gets on a keyboard

00:48:46.894 --> 00:48:47.640
then

00:48:48.751 --> 00:48:50.061
then he goes from

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.891
"those work"
and then when he is on a keyboard

00:48:52.916 --> 00:48:54.359
all of the sudden magically he is like

00:48:54.418 --> 00:48:56.351
"Hey gang, how you guys doing!"

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.387
"OMG, being President is like super hard"

00:49:01.692 --> 00:49:04.726
"Why is Hellen Ziller always on my case? Wtf loser"

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.334
"and ________ said the funniest thing
the other day and I was like LMFAO"

00:49:09.945 --> 00:49:11.886
"He is like super hilarious, anyway got to go"

00:49:11.911 --> 00:49:14.307
"got to get back to work
 okay, smiley

00:49:14.659 --> 00:49:15.983
No, he is here that guy.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.619
He is here.

00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:24.857
We got the cutest president in the
world and you guys don’t respect him!

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.106
you don’t appreciate him

00:49:26.335 --> 00:49:27.923
He has got that cute face with that grin

00:49:27.948 --> 00:49:28.948
he is just like, you know

00:49:30.279 --> 00:49:33.927
He looks like he could have been one
of those kids in the Jet magazine, just like..

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.530
*smiling and posing*

00:49:36.794 --> 00:49:37.802
He is super cute man

00:49:37.827 --> 00:49:39.423
how can you hate on Jacob Zuma?

00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:41.886
he is like a little Zulu ninja turtle man

00:49:45.018 --> 00:49:46.295
I can see him in the crew doing this

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.409
*Ninja turtle theme song*

00:49:48.473 --> 00:49:49.457
Leonardo!

00:49:49.545 --> 00:49:50.545
Raphael!

00:49:50.617 --> 00:49:51.617
Michelangelo!

00:49:52.093 --> 00:49:53.093
Jacob!

00:49:55.276 --> 00:49:56.440
"Cowabanga!"

00:49:58.005 --> 00:50:00.920
Ha Ha Ha Ha

00:50:01.919 --> 00:50:04.329
Oh, I miss Jacob so much

00:50:06.387 --> 00:50:08.279
and you people where torturing
him while I was away

00:50:08.304 --> 00:50:09.907
You are torturing him!
How could you do that?

00:50:10.308 --> 00:50:12.727
painting horrible pictures of Jacob Zuma

00:50:13.209 --> 00:50:14.382
you guys are disgusting.

00:50:14.883 --> 00:50:15.794
The man...

00:50:15.995 --> 00:50:18.953
Jacob on the mountain with the wind blowing

00:50:19.133 --> 00:50:20.495
through where he would have hair.

00:50:22.128 --> 00:50:23.848
Just him, J.Z

00:50:24.498 --> 00:50:25.987
and mini me.

00:50:30.003 --> 00:50:32.113
Altough it wasn’t that mini, you have to admit

00:50:32.253 --> 00:50:35.953
that was a pretty solid picture. Well
not solid but you know what I mean because

00:50:36.303 --> 00:50:38.483
I am just saying if it was me,
I would not be offended by that hey

00:50:38.516 --> 00:50:41.120
I would have been there at the gallery everyday, just like posing

00:50:41.145 --> 00:50:42.281
and waiting for people.

00:50:42.465 --> 00:50:44.844
Maybe like,
"hello ladies, hallo, hallo"

00:50:45.234 --> 00:50:46.618
"Hallo, nice, hallo"

00:50:46.651 --> 00:50:48.687
"Take a picture, take a picture there, take a picture"

00:50:49.073 --> 00:50:50.218
"they must know"

00:50:50.258 --> 00:50:54.818
*Laughter*

00:50:54.923 --> 00:50:57.074
So strong and so confident.

00:50:58.672 --> 00:51:02.017
He's like: "This picture is racist,
this picture is disrespectful!"

00:51:02.042 --> 00:51:04.576
It wasn’t even that disrespectful, I know you might not like it

00:51:04.601 --> 00:51:07.064
and that is your personal opinion, but it wasn’t that...

00:51:07.136 --> 00:51:09.945
even the name of the picture was
strong and powerful you know?

00:51:10.213 --> 00:51:12.489
Jacob Zuma, thew spear.

00:51:13.463 --> 00:51:15.983
The symbol of the Zulu nation for hundreds of years

00:51:16.033 --> 00:51:17.741
made famous by king Shaka him self

00:51:17.766 --> 00:51:20.538
conquering army after army with the spear.

00:51:20.791 --> 00:51:22.376
______________________.

00:51:22.457 --> 00:51:25.280
The spear of the nation,
the spear.

00:51:25.629 --> 00:51:28.053
It is not like that guy called it 
"The pocketknife"

00:51:29.229 --> 00:51:31.698
The Spear, big and manly.

00:51:32.483 --> 00:51:35.488
That is why our president didn’t complain,
Jacob Zuma did not complain once

00:51:35.513 --> 00:51:37.452
because he understands art, he is cultured.

00:51:38.397 --> 00:51:40.806
The guys around him complaining on his behalf

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:43.070
I hate it when people do that, he was not even offended

00:51:43.228 --> 00:51:46.032
they ran to him like little kids tattle taliing.

00:51:46.097 --> 00:51:48.822
"Jacob!"
"Jacob!"

00:51:49.046 --> 00:51:49.911
"Yes"

00:51:50.848 --> 00:51:53.056
"What happened now?"

00:51:55.672 --> 00:51:57.964
"Jacob, it is disgusting!
It is disgusting!"

00:51:58.155 --> 00:52:01.284
"Did you see what they did? They painted you, they painted you!"

00:52:02.644 --> 00:52:05.013
"There is no paint on me"

00:52:06.099 --> 00:52:07.099
"I am fine"

00:52:07.892 --> 00:52:10.369
"No sorry, they painted a picture of you"

00:52:10.394 --> 00:52:11.974
"They painted a picture of you, just show him the picture!
just show him the picture!"

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.547
and they came running with the
picture and they showed it to him

00:52:13.572 --> 00:52:15.889
but Jacob Zuma is a chilled out guy,
he does not have time for these things

00:52:15.914 --> 00:52:17.168
He probably didn’t even see
anything and was just like

00:52:17.193 --> 00:52:18.654
"I don’t see"

00:52:19.502 --> 00:52:21.086
"anything wrong"

00:52:21.997 --> 00:52:23.650
"with this"
"Oh"

00:52:26.302 --> 00:52:32.983
*Jacob Zuma laughing*

00:52:34.605 --> 00:52:37.983
Giggling Casanova has no time for these trivial pursuits

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:42.837
I would not be shocked if Jacob is having the time
of his life right now in the presidential bedroom

00:52:43.434 --> 00:52:46.612
finding himself a new romantic game to play with the ladies

00:52:47.043 --> 00:52:49.267
You know he is romantic,
many kids, many wife’s

00:52:49.292 --> 00:52:50.689
he knows what it is about, you know?

00:52:51.539 --> 00:52:54.302
He is there, covered him self in body paint

00:52:55.738 --> 00:52:57.465
Playing Barry White in the background

00:52:57.498 --> 00:53:05.452
*Barry White music playing*

00:53:05.586 --> 00:53:08.071
Just in the bedroom
door looking all sexy

00:53:08.573 --> 00:53:10.916
looking in the door at his wife

00:53:12.033 --> 00:53:13.888
"Number two"

00:53:15.762 --> 00:53:17.144
"are you ready?"

00:53:18.066 --> 00:53:19.649
"for the spear?"

00:53:20.936 --> 00:53:21.714
She is there like,

00:53:21.749 --> 00:53:24.119
"WHOOO!"
"I am not ready!"

00:53:24.249 --> 00:53:26.740
"I am not ready!"

00:53:27.312 --> 00:53:29.586
and he is like,
"ready or not"

00:53:30.668 --> 00:53:32.495
"here I come"

00:53:35.427 --> 00:53:37.723
Jacob Zuma was on the balcony waving at everybody

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.265
because the elections are coming up, so
you are going to see him everywhere now.

00:53:41.335 --> 00:53:43.404
Waving. Yeah, you are going to
see him in the streets waving

00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:45.310
You will see him at the rally's dancing

00:53:45.502 --> 00:53:47.661
He is going to be out shaking hands, kissing babies

00:53:47.686 --> 00:53:48.987
mostly his babies, but still

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:50.304
*kissing*

00:53:50.769 --> 00:53:51.769
"Vote for me"

00:53:54.659 --> 00:53:56.228
Because you know he has to connect with the people

00:53:56.373 --> 00:53:57.808
the ANC is having a tough time right now

00:53:58.454 --> 00:54:01.201
this is one of the worst times in ANC history

00:54:01.767 --> 00:54:04.521
Highest levels of corruption,
lowest level of service delivery.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.493
The ANC is just a shadow of it's former self

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:10.296
Yeah, people in the ANC are disgusted by the ANC

00:54:11.171 --> 00:54:12.824
They stand there like,
"Nah, ANC"

00:54:13.052 --> 00:54:15.173
"No man, no man,
 no man"

00:54:15.414 --> 00:54:18.239
"no man, enough man
no, come on ANC"

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.874
They say this while looking in the mirror

00:54:19.918 --> 00:54:21.477
"Come on ANC"

00:54:22.005 --> 00:54:24.210
"you can do better, come on man"

00:54:27.377 --> 00:54:28.377
It's gotten bad

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:32.257
It is so bad Kgalema Motlanthe does not go
anywhere with Jacob, have you noticed this?

00:54:32.552 --> 00:54:34.251
Vice president but you never see them together.

00:54:34.722 --> 00:54:35.309
because Kgalema is like

00:54:35.334 --> 00:54:36.698
"I don’t want that guy around"

00:54:37.714 --> 00:54:38.614
always tells Jacob,
Jacob is like,

00:54:38.638 --> 00:54:40.267
"let's go Kgalema"

00:54:40.292 --> 00:54:42.071
He is like,
"I will meet you in front, go"

00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:46.501
___________________.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.989
It has gotten bad, who do you vote for?

00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:51.706
Mampele, Rampele

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.018
It is a funny name, wont
make me vote for you though.

00:54:56.242 --> 00:54:56.824
Yes.

00:54:56.874 --> 00:54:58.032
Doctor Mamphele.

00:54:58.286 --> 00:55:00.835
Used to date Steve Becko, so
she knows about the struggle.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:03.179
She is an intelligent elderly black woman

00:55:03.603 --> 00:55:05.556
and she came out, she denounced the ANC

00:55:05.581 --> 00:55:08.135
she said,
"the ANC is not what it used to be in this country"

00:55:08.977 --> 00:55:12.369
"as black people we must stand up
and realize that change is needed"

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.169
"vote for a hung world and vote for change"

00:55:16.293 --> 00:55:18.131
We are like,
"Yeah, you go girl"

00:55:20.095 --> 00:55:21.422
and then she made a big mistake

00:55:21.794 --> 00:55:23.670
she challenged Jacob Zuma directly.

00:55:23.794 --> 00:55:24.678
Yeah, head to head

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.768
but she used money as her platform

00:55:27.056 --> 00:55:27.817
big mistake.

00:55:28.219 --> 00:55:30.431
Never bring money up around Jacob, ever.

00:55:31.018 --> 00:55:33.640
Look, because I don’t know if you have noticed.
Our president admits to money

00:55:34.232 --> 00:55:36.095
there is always money around him but it is never his.

00:55:36.942 --> 00:55:39.033
Always, oh it is the Sheiks money,

00:55:39.058 --> 00:55:40.212
it is the Gupta’s money,

00:55:40.235 --> 00:55:41.450
it's never his money, he is always there like,

00:55:41.475 --> 00:55:42.847
"No, it's not mine
It's not mine"

00:55:43.167 --> 00:55:44.065
"It's not mine, 
it's not mine"

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.803
"I don’t know, it's not mine
it's not mine"

00:55:46.605 --> 00:55:47.228
Yeah.

00:55:47.323 --> 00:55:50.047
Building a house for two hundred and fifty million rand.

00:55:50.334 --> 00:55:52.420
Jacob, where the hell is that money coming from?

00:55:52.539 --> 00:55:54.107
"I have a bond"

00:55:56.092 --> 00:55:59.674
"for eight hundred thousand with FNB."

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:02.027
I go, eight hundred thousand?

00:56:02.061 --> 00:56:03.251
two hundred and fifty million

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.610
"That is not my problem"

00:56:06.509 --> 00:56:08.634
"my calculator says it is fine"

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:14.644
Ramaphele tried to challenge him,
she came out one day, she said

00:56:14.717 --> 00:56:17.450
"Jacob Zuma has not declared
his income as our president"

00:56:17.573 --> 00:56:19.992
"He does not tell parliament how much money he has"

00:56:20.116 --> 00:56:23.169
"we want to know how much he has and
how much he gets from other people"

00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:24.975
"I will lead by example"

00:56:25.172 --> 00:56:28.413
"I as Ramaphele have fifty five million rand"

00:56:28.699 --> 00:56:30.494
"Jacob, how much do you have?"

00:56:30.705 --> 00:56:31.705
People where like,
"Yeah!"

00:56:32.061 --> 00:56:35.642
"how much do you...
Woah, woah, woah, woah"

00:56:36.804 --> 00:56:37.804
"How much again?"

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:40.878
"Fifty five million?"

00:56:41.486 --> 00:56:42.793
"Where did you get that money?"

00:56:43.844 --> 00:56:46.422
She is like,
"I am on the board of many companies, I work very hard"

00:56:46.447 --> 00:56:49.186
"even me I work very hard, but fifty five million?"

00:56:49.987 --> 00:56:51.436
"how much overtime is that?

00:56:51.487 --> 00:56:54.295
_____________________.

00:56:54.526 --> 00:56:55.616
She is like,
"No, I worked for it

00:56:55.641 --> 00:56:56.941
"but we want to know where
does Jacob get his money"

00:56:56.996 --> 00:56:58.953
"Hey, don’t worry about that guy lady, don’t worry"

00:56:58.978 --> 00:57:00.469
"we know he stole it"

00:57:00.494 --> 00:57:04.696
but you, where did you get fifty five million?"

00:57:11.033 --> 00:57:12.239
I don’t know who to vote for anymore.

00:57:12.308 --> 00:57:15.469
You cant make jokes about Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe,

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.441
if you do this you get arrested and sent
to prison for mocking the president right?

00:57:19.763 --> 00:57:23.000
so I know I would go there and I would not be able to resist.

00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:24.107
like I would just be like,

00:57:24.132 --> 00:57:25.522
"Ha, ha mustache"

00:57:25.618 --> 00:57:27.357
and I am in jail.

00:57:28.575 --> 00:57:30.042
which normally would not be such a bad thing

00:57:30.067 --> 00:57:31.671
because what would happen with an
international incident like that is

00:57:31.696 --> 00:57:33.498
normally your president would just come there

00:57:33.672 --> 00:57:36.174
and he would ask for you to be released
and taken back to your country

00:57:36.232 --> 00:57:37.707
that’s all, but now

00:57:37.797 --> 00:57:38.797
I don’t know

00:57:40.786 --> 00:57:42.022
if that guy

00:57:42.054 --> 00:57:45.442
*Laughter*

00:57:45.509 --> 00:57:46.781
will come and fetch me.

00:57:46.895 --> 00:57:52.667
*Laughter*

00:57:52.734 --> 00:57:55.377
I can see him sending Mugabe the e-mail now

00:57:56.103 --> 00:57:58.617
"It's fine Rob"

00:57:59.897 --> 00:58:00.897
"keep him."

00:58:01.004 --> 00:58:05.530
*Laughter*

00:58:06.415 --> 00:58:08.105
Jacob Zuma has not smiled in months.

00:58:09.836 --> 00:58:11.641
He was our laughing president,
do you remember that?

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:12.681
He was that guy

00:58:12.779 --> 00:58:17.096
*Zuma laughing*

00:58:17.751 --> 00:58:18.751
I have not seen him laugh

00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:21.320
for months his been there in parliament, in the corner

00:58:21.624 --> 00:58:24.616
*Zuma crying*

00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:28.588
and the funny thing is he introduced us to Julius Malema

00:58:28.635 --> 00:58:30.885
that is the craziest thing about this whole situation, huh?

00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:32.530
It is a thin line...

00:58:33.278 --> 00:58:34.667
between love and hate.

00:58:35.848 --> 00:58:37.528
He introduced us to Julius Malema

00:58:37.553 --> 00:58:38.553
that was his guy

00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:41.213
he came with him and we where
the one's asking questions

00:58:41.578 --> 00:58:43.366
we saw Julius in thew
beginning, it was almost like

00:58:43.392 --> 00:58:45.662
Jacob Zuma brought us a puppy, a little ANC puppy

00:58:46.325 --> 00:58:49.126
He was like,
"Hey guys, this is my little puppy Julius"

00:58:49.838 --> 00:58:50.994
and we where like, wow 
this is interesting

00:58:51.057 --> 00:58:53.694
Hey Jacob, your puppy
took a shit on the carpet

00:58:54.194 --> 00:58:56.609
and he was like,
"Oh, that is not my problem"

00:58:56.674 --> 00:58:57.674
"Ha, ha, ha"

00:58:57.837 --> 00:58:58.837
"good dog"

00:58:59.892 --> 00:59:03.643
We are like, hey Jacob your puppy is chewing our shoes

00:59:03.694 --> 00:59:07.651
and he was like, "ha, ha
it is not my problem, good dog"

00:59:08.695 --> 00:59:10.164
Now the puppy is grown up

00:59:10.945 --> 00:59:12.078
biting the owner

00:59:13.943 --> 00:59:15.037
Zuma's leg is there like,

00:59:15.164 --> 00:59:18.855
"Hey, hey!
Voetsek man, voetsek!"

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.825
"Pay back the money!"

00:59:21.188 --> 00:59:22.995
"Hey man voetsek!
Voetsek!"

00:59:23.076 --> 00:59:24.916
"Voetsek! Guys help me!"

00:59:24.941 --> 00:59:27.087
and we are there like,
"That is not our problem"

00:59:27.328 --> 00:59:29.867
"ha, ha, ha, ha, ah"

00:59:30.704 --> 00:59:31.704
"Good dog"

00:59:33.582 --> 00:59:36.936
Have you guys seen our president,
have you guys seen him lately?

00:59:37.437 --> 00:59:39.599
Oh man, he is back.

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.802
He is back and better than ever before, you know?

00:59:43.042 --> 00:59:44.845
the last few months has Ben so taxing on him

00:59:45.097 --> 00:59:47.472
People fighting with him, people in
parliament shouting things at him.

00:59:47.504 --> 00:59:49.941
He has been stressed sitting
in a corner all to himself.

00:59:50.651 --> 00:59:52.804
and then he found out that he would be paying nothing

00:59:53.067 --> 00:59:55.410
absolutely nothing for the upgrades at Mgangla,

00:59:56.148 --> 00:59:57.983
and he walked into parliament a new man

00:59:59.366 --> 01:00:00.875
had a bounce in his step

01:00:01.904 --> 01:00:03.323
his swag back

01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:05.429
Jacob 2.0

01:00:07.519 --> 01:00:10.018
I mean he is still doing the same
thing, making the same mistakes

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.901
but now he has a certain level of panache

01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:15.438
I saw him mess up a speech the other day,
stumbled on a word like he always does

01:00:16.026 --> 01:00:17.995
this time he didn’t frown, he did not get stressed

01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:20.109
he just worked through it

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:26.902
"and here we can clearly see"

01:00:27.007 --> 01:00:28.007
"the arm"

01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:32.313
"prem, pre , pro, fap rem, Edie"

01:00:32.474 --> 01:00:35.588
"pre, medi, mam,med,medi"

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.407
"red, ray, rem, ma, mabo"

01:00:38.432 --> 01:00:42.989
*Zuma laughing*

01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:47.987
"a pre, med, mabo, redie, mabo"

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:50.238
*Zuma laughing*

01:00:52.714 --> 01:00:54.519
*Zuma lauging*

01:00:54.656 --> 01:00:58.039
"a pre-me meditated"

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:01.504
Just came back and he handled it.

01:01:02.182 --> 01:01:03.736
I love how he just stepped away

01:01:04.517 --> 01:01:05.993
and did the cutest little...

01:01:06.716 --> 01:01:08.805
I don’t even know what he was doing
there, he just does like a little....

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.769
it is almost like he is just moving his
brain to the other side of his head.

01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:15.175
Like he knows when it is in the wrong place, it doesn’t...

01:01:15.403 --> 01:01:16.948
He just shook it up.

01:01:17.817 --> 01:01:18.817
and he came back in

01:01:22.098 --> 01:01:24.265
even the way he handled the scandal

01:01:24.974 --> 01:01:25.974
was powerful

01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:28.723
We thought for sure that Nkgandla would be his downfall

01:01:28.748 --> 01:01:32.059
and yet Jacob Zuma took something so
serious and turned it into a joke

01:01:32.432 --> 01:01:33.432
and threw it

01:01:33.725 --> 01:01:34.725
back in our faces.

01:01:37.336 --> 01:01:40.178
"Well, we are clearly living"

01:01:41.425 --> 01:01:42.425
"in"

01:01:43.376 --> 01:01:47.240
"a place where there is poverty of politics"

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:50.054
"people asking questions"

01:01:50.162 --> 01:01:51.818
"but they don’t want answers"

01:01:51.881 --> 01:01:53.701
"Questions, more answers"

01:01:53.953 --> 01:01:55.489
"Investigating"

01:01:55.975 --> 01:01:57.784
"they ask again questions"

01:01:57.843 --> 01:01:59.189
"more answers"

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.070
Then in parliament we hear"

01:02:02.335 --> 01:02:05.197
"point of order,
point of order"

01:02:05.299 --> 01:02:08.691
"Yes, _________.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.570
"ha, ha"

01:02:13.088 --> 01:02:16.963
________________________.

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.950
Who is this guy?

01:02:21.601 --> 01:02:22.137
Huh?

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.554
He is just shrugging it off, evading

01:02:26.022 --> 01:02:27.022
maneuvering

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.757
Never mind the Ngandla joke, I love
the fact that he rolled his eyes.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.259
that blew my mind, I have never seen Jacob Zuma do that

01:02:33.284 --> 01:02:34.132
He looked over and was just like

01:02:34.157 --> 01:02:35.444
*rolling his eyes*

01:02:38.013 --> 01:02:39.789
When did Jacob Zuma start rolling his eyes?

01:02:40.689 --> 01:02:43.118
That is not something he does, Jacob
Zuma does not roll his eyes guys

01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:45.985
In fact, presidents don’t roll their eyes

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:48.878
it is not a very presidential thing to do

01:02:48.994 --> 01:02:51.356
in parliament, to roll your eyes

01:02:51.608 --> 01:02:54.423
at the position. Even the most deviant rulers in the world

01:02:54.575 --> 01:02:55.575
don’t roll their eyes.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.475
When the UN is telling the leader of North Korea

01:02:57.533 --> 01:02:58.715
to stop making nuclear weapons

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.065
you don’t see Kim Jong-un going,

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.090
"Ag, whatever!"

01:03:04.074 --> 01:03:05.785
You don’t roll your eyes.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:09.951
Jacob Zuma did

01:03:10.049 --> 01:03:11.810
and he did it in style, I want to know where he learned it

01:03:11.835 --> 01:03:13.881
how he learned it, has he been doing it for a while?

01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:15.917
because rolling your eyes is part of an attitude

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:18.704
you don’t just roll your eyes, if you
roll your eyes you got that sass

01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:19.729
you are bitchy, you know?

01:03:20.291 --> 01:03:21.291
is he doing more than that?

01:03:21.886 --> 01:03:23.268
Now I see Jacob Zuma in a totally different light,

01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:26.768
now I am picturing him hanging outwith the rest of
the ANC comrades chatting about these problems

01:03:26.793 --> 01:03:29.188
"Mr. President I want to know where is the money Mr. President

01:03:29.416 --> 01:03:30.416
"where did the money go?"

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.173
and he is like,
"Really guys?"

01:03:33.168 --> 01:03:36.604
"over and over they keep asking me"

01:03:37.072 --> 01:03:40.347
"I mean literally, I am tired now"

01:03:41.391 --> 01:03:44.081
"like, cant they get over it"

01:03:44.525 --> 01:03:47.696
"like that Musi guy, get a life already"

01:03:48.634 --> 01:03:52.033
"just because you hang with white chicks, I mean"

01:03:52.338 --> 01:03:53.338
"Please"

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:54.834
"Whatever"

01:03:56.981 --> 01:03:57.981
Is that what he is doing?

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:00.527
and if he is, where did he learn that?

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:04.254
Where do you learn to roll your eyes at
that age, that is what I want to know.

01:04:05.594 --> 01:04:07.822
It is not your friends, it is not your colleagues.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:11.443
It is probably your kids, yea
you learn bad habits at home.

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:15.073
Jacob Zuma probably learned it from
one of his children in the house.

01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:16.349
one of his daughters maybe

01:04:16.578 --> 01:04:18.260
she was going out for a night with her friends

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:19.874
caught her as she was leaving.

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.455
"Hey, where are you going?"

01:04:22.188 --> 01:04:25.418
"where are you going dressed like that?"

01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:30.311
"Dad, I told you I am going out with my friends.
I am going to a party"

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.166
"First off all, you are already in a party"

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:40.615
"Secondly, no daughter of mine will dress like that"

01:04:40.889 --> 01:04:42.183
"go and change!"

01:04:42.857 --> 01:04:45.105
"Dad, what are doing?
You are killing me"

01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:48.254
"come on, why are you doing this. I can
dress however I want, I am old enough."

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:51.444
"Hey, you will do as I say"

01:04:51.858 --> 01:04:55.059
"as long as you are living under my roofs"

01:04:56.125 --> 01:05:00.492
"which I have paid for with other people's money"

01:05:01.694 --> 01:05:04.546
"you will obey me, go and change!"

01:05:05.225 --> 01:05:06.676
"Dad, come on. Why are you doing this

01:05:06.701 --> 01:05:09.787
"everyone else dress like this, all the other kids do it"

01:05:09.917 --> 01:05:12.253
"are all the other kids my children?"

01:05:13.263 --> 01:05:14.692
"You never know."

01:05:16.071 --> 01:05:18.061
"Huh, what are you doing.'

01:05:18.086 --> 01:05:21.348
"Don't come in this house with that DA attitude"

01:05:22.733 --> 01:05:24.567
"go and change, now!"

01:05:25.877 --> 01:05:27.751
"Ag, whatever!"

01:05:35.784 --> 01:05:37.151
"What was that?"

01:05:40.838 --> 01:05:42.881
"what did you just do?"

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.131
"I didn’t do anything daddy"

01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:49.665
"Don't lie to me, I saw it."

01:05:51.127 --> 01:05:53.662
"you did something with your eyes"

01:05:55.233 --> 01:05:57.039
"it looked like The Undertaker"

01:05:58.272 --> 01:06:01.138
"but they came back, what was that?"

01:06:02.863 --> 01:06:03.863
"I just..."

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:06.032
"I just rolled my eyes dad."

01:06:07.852 --> 01:06:12.782
"That made me feel so insignificant."

01:06:14.273 --> 01:06:21.844
"What you did there made me feel like you did not
acknowledge the seriousness of this situation."

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:29.196
"Can you teach me how to do that?"

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:34.739
"Yeah, like..."

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.129
"It's easy, you just roll your eyes like"

01:06:37.154 --> 01:06:38.787
"if someone says something you
don’t like you just go like"

01:06:38.812 --> 01:06:40.187
"Ah, whatever"

01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:43.349
"Ah, whatever"

01:06:44.807 --> 01:06:46.949
"Wow, wow dad. That is too much"

01:06:46.974 --> 01:06:49.671
"you have just got to loosen up and be like
Ah, whatever"

01:06:51.405 --> 01:06:53.040
"Ag, whatever"

01:06:53.914 --> 01:06:55.234
"I think I got it."

01:06:55.818 --> 01:06:57.396
"No you don’t have it dad, you are rolling your head"

01:06:57.421 --> 01:06:58.936
"you are supposed to roll your eyes."

01:06:59.408 --> 01:07:01.018
"and my eyes are where?"

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:03.837
"exactly"

01:07:06.893 --> 01:07:07.893
and he was off

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:10.019
ready to roll baby.

01:07:13.292 --> 01:07:16.028
and he did, he rolled straight into parliament.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:17.782
Shut it down.

01:07:18.086 --> 01:07:20.967
Turned Ngandla into a joke, you
Ngandla up anymore. It is over now.

01:07:21.346 --> 01:07:23.170
You say Ngandla in parliament
and people laugh at you.

01:07:23.351 --> 01:07:26.187
Yeah, immediately.
"and what about Ngandla"

01:07:27.561 --> 01:07:28.319
It's done.

01:07:28.683 --> 01:07:29.366
it's done.

01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:31.245
Just, you know.

01:07:31.895 --> 01:07:34.442
I love it so much, you know what I
love most about the Ngandla thing?

01:07:35.035 --> 01:07:36.262
a lot of people do not realize this.

01:07:36.896 --> 01:07:39.010
Jacob Zuma was making a joke out of Ngandla, yes.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.491
but what was more interesting to me was the fact

01:07:43.028 --> 01:07:46.409
that he was mocking Vusi Mangmani, the leader of the DA.

01:07:46.558 --> 01:07:47.949
A lot of people did not pick this up.

01:07:48.205 --> 01:07:50.498
When he is doing the whole "Ngandla"

01:07:51.482 --> 01:07:56.401
He is mocking Vusi Mangmani's model C English accent.

01:07:57.105 --> 01:07:58.772
That is what he is doing.

01:07:59.287 --> 01:08:04.328
Jacob Zuma thinks that he speaks funny.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:10.494
*Laughter*

01:08:10.688 --> 01:08:12.198
That is priceless.

01:08:13.065 --> 01:08:16.129
Jacob Zuma is sitting in parliament
watching Vusi Mangmani speak

01:08:16.185 --> 01:08:18.488
like, "I would like to know about the allocation of funds"

01:08:18.513 --> 01:08:19.944
"more especially regarding"

01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:23.275
"the homestead at Mgandla and whether.."
and he is like,

01:08:23.427 --> 01:08:26.688
*Zuma laughing*

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:29.015
"This guy talk so funny"

01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:30.853
*Zuma laughing*

01:08:30.892 --> 01:08:32.316
"Ngandla"

01:08:33.503 --> 01:08:37.262
"Ngandla, would you like some tea with your crumpets?"

01:08:37.976 --> 01:08:39.879
"mash, mash, mash, mash"

01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:42.101
"mash, mash, mash, mash-mellow"

01:08:44.472 --> 01:08:46.470
Jacob Zuma is just laughing at him, that’s just beautiful.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.204
I don’t know how much of it is true or not

01:08:49.814 --> 01:08:50.814
what I do know is

01:08:51.424 --> 01:08:55.634
If Jacob Zuma was allowing the Gupta’s to
control our country and choose our ministers

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:59.160
then it was not my president being corrupt to me

01:08:59.193 --> 01:09:00.715
it was the Gupta’s telling him what to do

01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:01.942
It is like Julius said

01:09:02.122 --> 01:09:05.821
"The Gupta’s where in his ear all along"

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.182
"They where inside his ear all along"

01:09:10.815 --> 01:09:13.868
and you know the way Julius sounded, it sounded amazing because

01:09:13.893 --> 01:09:15.848
Like I get the phrase when they go they where in his ear

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.080
but he said they where inside his ear.

01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:22.124
It sounded like the Gupta’s where actually inside

01:09:22.531 --> 01:09:23.531
Jacob Zuma's ear.

01:09:23.736 --> 01:09:26.120
when actually would have made sense if you think about it.

01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:29.250
what if they where inside his ear the entire time?

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:34.509
how do we know that every single time
Jacob Zuma was speaking to us as a nation

01:09:35.022 --> 01:09:37.190
he was actually telling us
what the Gupta’s was saying

01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:40.200
like he had one of those
earpieces that they have

01:09:40.498 --> 01:09:41.941
on those hidden camera shows

01:09:43.204 --> 01:09:46.443
like he was there in parliament 
outside parliament

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:50.304
there was a van with a
Gupta sitting inside of it

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.475
*tapping on microphone*

01:09:54.238 --> 01:09:55.177
Hello Jacob?

01:09:56.994 --> 01:09:57.994
Jacob?

01:09:59.881 --> 01:10:03.190
Jacob
 I have activated your earpiece

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.717
you are going to repeat
everything that I tell you okay

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:08.730
Jacob?
Jacob?

01:10:08.986 --> 01:10:10.731
Can you hear me Jacob?
Can you hear me?

01:10:11.948 --> 01:10:13.776
Roger Roger Roger

01:10:14.261 --> 01:10:15.705
No 
No it’s Atul

01:10:17.477 --> 01:10:18.669
this is Atul here Jacob

01:10:19.528 --> 01:10:22.116
I know who it is guys 
I got it

01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:23.655
I know who it is

01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:25.652
okay lets just make sure
levels are correct Jacob

01:10:25.677 --> 01:10:28.542
one two, one two, one two?

01:10:29.356 --> 01:10:30.768
okay what you want to do

01:10:31.929 --> 01:10:35.018
no one two like three one two like three

01:10:37.329 --> 01:10:38.451
Oh okay 
okay

01:10:38.849 --> 01:10:40.271
I’ve got you guys so

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.932
I must just repeat
everything that you say

01:10:43.443 --> 01:10:45.617
yes you are going to
repeat everything Jacob

01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:49.138
okay this is going to be very complicated I

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.774
trying to listen to you while also speaking

01:10:52.027 --> 01:10:56.088
we understand Jacob but you know we
have already made a plan you and us

01:10:56.326 --> 01:10:58.409
so repeat everything that I say okay

01:10:58.985 --> 01:11:00.918
okay I will repeat everything

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.445
and that is probably why things went wrong.

01:11:03.965 --> 01:11:06.832
because I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to
listen to someone while talking to someone else

01:11:06.951 --> 01:11:07.951
your mind jams

01:11:08.502 --> 01:11:10.922
Jacob Zuma could never deliver a speech

01:11:11.537 --> 01:11:13.521
its not that he couldn’t read 
He couldn’t listen

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.997
he couldn’t listen and speak at the same time

01:11:16.768 --> 01:11:18.638
I used to watch him and think
what’s going on Jacob?

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.115
YouTube is buffering
 What’s happening here?

01:11:22.288 --> 01:11:23.784
this is why data must fall

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:29.591
but it turns out he was just
listening the entire time

01:11:30.267 --> 01:11:31.674
there he was in parliament

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:34.575
the press saver said his name as it came

01:11:34.605 --> 01:11:42.326

01:14:17.909 --> 01:14:25.705
*Aplause*

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.088
They where in his ear the entire time.

01:14:32.646 --> 01:14:34.015
I miss South Africa man.

01:14:34.532 --> 01:14:36.587
I miss it, I watch parliament now again.

01:14:36.938 --> 01:14:39.384
I went straight into it, watching the vote of no confidence

01:14:39.432 --> 01:14:40.879
I was so stressed.

01:14:41.548 --> 01:14:43.206
I don’t know about you, but I was so stressed.

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:45.343
I was like please, please, please

01:14:45.368 --> 01:14:47.234
don’t let Zuma go, please.

01:14:47.798 --> 01:14:50.334
Don't let Zuma go, my jokes.
All of my jokes.

01:14:50.359 --> 01:14:53.183
Please1!

01:14:53.618 --> 01:14:54.618
I did go to Zambia though.

01:14:55.238 --> 01:14:56.668
Fantastic place Zambia.

01:14:56.933 --> 01:14:58.549
Went there, visited the
place and had a good time.

01:14:58.574 --> 01:15:00.742
While I was there I had a chaperone
who really made my trip.

01:15:00.767 --> 01:15:02.467
His name was Alinani, sweet guy.

01:15:03.137 --> 01:15:05.931
And his job was to get me
accustomed to the Zambian culture.

01:15:06.495 --> 01:15:10.125
And every day he would give me a new piece of
information, some more interesting than others.

01:15:10.395 --> 01:15:11.514
Like one day he looks at me and goes,

01:15:11.539 --> 01:15:15.890
“Trevor, you know Zambia is a
very, very conservative nation."

01:15:16.614 --> 01:15:17.419
I said, “Oh, okay Ali.

01:15:17.455 --> 01:15:20.602
He says, “Yea, so please stay away from profanity.”

01:15:21.343 --> 01:15:24.623
And I said I can do that, I assumed he meant swearing.

01:15:25.325 --> 01:15:28.653
But I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t
sure if he meant a person or swearing.

01:15:29.355 --> 01:15:31.964
No, no, because in Zambia people have names like Profanity.

01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:36.445
So, that’s how I laughed when I met Screwdriver.
It’s the same way I laughed.

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:38.230
Yea, because you see

01:15:38.411 --> 01:15:40.997
In South Africa we have African names you can translate.

01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:44.406
Like Happiness, Blessing and Hope. Those kinds of names.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.707
But then in Zambia

01:15:46.187 --> 01:15:49.063
People give their names, like they give their children names

01:15:49.088 --> 01:15:51.342
of everyday English words, anything.

01:15:51.525 --> 01:15:54.559
So like, table, chair, car, house.

01:15:54.786 --> 01:15:56.984
You see, like you just have to get used to it.

01:15:57.151 --> 01:15:58.968
It’s very hard, but you have
to keep a straight face.

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:03.162
Which was difficult because I met a mechanic,
who had sons named Brake and Clutch.

01:16:04.676 --> 01:16:08.141
And that was not, especially when Brake
was running around causing chaos.

01:16:08.372 --> 01:16:11.670
And his dad was there like, “stop it Brake,
stop it Brake, stop it, stop it Brake.

01:16:11.695 --> 01:16:14.291
And I was like, “Hey, stop it Brake. Ha Ha.”

01:16:16.546 --> 01:16:19.520
But you have to get used to it, it’s a cultural thing.

01:16:19.735 --> 01:16:20.910
And so, you have to respect it.

01:16:22.279 --> 01:16:25.104
And the second warning Ali gave me, was even stranger.

01:16:26.116 --> 01:16:27.711
We are driving thru Lusaka, the capital.

01:16:29.114 --> 01:16:31.461
And Ali looks over at me in the car and goes,

01:16:32.107 --> 01:16:35.379
“Trevor, you know here in Zambia
we are a very God loving nation.”

01:16:35.828 --> 01:16:37.588
I said, “Oh, okay Ali. That’s
a good thing to know.”

01:16:37.613 --> 01:16:41.590
He says, “Yes, so while you are here don’t be gay.”

01:16:45.494 --> 01:16:46.352
I said, “What?”

01:16:46.424 --> 01:16:48.765
He says, “I know it can be tempting
sometimes but don’t do it.”

01:16:49.664 --> 01:16:50.664
“Don’t be gay.”

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:52.710
“Don’t be gay?”

01:16:53.152 --> 01:16:55.559
I have never been warned of this in my life, don’t be gay?

01:16:55.591 --> 01:16:57.440
“Hey bru, don’t be gay. Don’t be gay.”

01:16:58.801 --> 01:16:59.801
“Don’t be gay?”

01:17:01.065 --> 01:17:02.866
Crazy, crazy warning to get.

01:17:03.321 --> 01:17:05.275
But then I found out why Ali was warning me.

01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:09.628
Turns out in Zambia being gay is illegal.

01:17:10.813 --> 01:17:12.337
If you are found to be gay

01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:14.770
you will be arrested and sent to prison

01:17:15.421 --> 01:17:18.050
for more than thirty years, yea.

01:17:19.497 --> 01:17:21.443
Which is a bit of a weird punishment.

01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:27.605
When you think about it.

01:17:30.335 --> 01:17:32.764
I mean I am not saying that gay guys would enjoy prison,

01:17:33.489 --> 01:17:34.988
I am just saying if I was gay

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.863
That’s not the worst thing
you could do to me.

01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:39.645
They would be like, “you
are going to jail!”

01:17:39.863 --> 01:17:41.155
I would be like, “Oh no.”

01:17:45.815 --> 01:17:47.129
Don’t be gay?

01:17:48.138 --> 01:17:51.101
I couldn’t believe this, gay is a crime in Zambia.

01:17:51.443 --> 01:17:55.677
Which got me thinking. If gay is a crime,
that means the police have to monitor it.

01:17:56.024 --> 01:17:57.845
They actually have to police gay. Yeah.

01:17:58.681 --> 01:18:01.953
Which means in their police force, they have a gay division.

01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:04.965
It’s a crime, it’s a crime.

01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:08.697
So that means they have a murder unit, a
robbery unit, a white collar crimes unit.

01:18:08.848 --> 01:18:10.294
And then they got a gay unit.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.020
Yea, they have got a little G unit in their police force.

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.313
That’s responsible for all things gay.

01:18:16.326 --> 01:18:18.317
That must be the most fun police
force to be in, in the world.

01:18:19.375 --> 01:18:21.456
You get to go under cover, dress up really nice.

01:18:21.573 --> 01:18:24.477
Get in touch with your flamboyant
side, have a good time.

01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:27.397
I bet the sergeant’s there every
morning, briefing his detectives.

01:18:27.733 --> 01:18:29.320
“Good morning Detectives.”

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:33.928
“Welcome everybody, today we will
be launching a sting operation.”

01:18:35.468 --> 01:18:39.226
“We have just been informed of a fashion
show that will be taking place.”

01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:43.097
“And as you know, the gays cannot
resist the latest fashion trends.”

01:18:44.228 --> 01:18:47.130
“Therefore we will be in full attendance
to apprehend each and every one of them.”

01:18:47.177 --> 01:18:48.527
“Let us make sure we are here.”

01:18:49.037 --> 01:18:50.304
“Detective Chepoa?”

01:18:50.696 --> 01:18:51.426
“Present!”

01:18:52.376 --> 01:18:53.422
“Detective Table?”

01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:55.311
“Present!”

01:18:56.196 --> 01:18:57.511
“Detective Mongai?”

01:18:58.331 --> 01:18:59.545
“Present!”

01:19:02.034 --> 01:19:03.541
“I think he's in too deep.”

01:19:09.643 --> 01:19:11.636
How do you police gay?

01:19:12.783 --> 01:19:15.261
Do they stop you if you look suspiciously gay in the streets?

01:19:15.474 --> 01:19:19.772
I mean, gay doesn’t have a look. But maybe you
have a bounce about you, like a bit of pizazz.

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:21.061
Do the police pull up there and is like,

01:19:21.086 --> 01:19:23.196
*police siren*
“You, over there!”

01:19:23.853 --> 01:19:25.970
“What is the purpose of that flamboyant scarf?”

01:19:29.801 --> 01:19:31.135
“Put your hands up!”

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:36.546
“Turn around! Don’t tempt
me, don’t tempt me!”

01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:38.373
“You are going to jail.”

01:19:41.386 --> 01:19:42.655
How do you police gay?

01:19:44.182 --> 01:19:45.834
Do they have roadblocks?
Like for drunk driving?

01:19:46.144 --> 01:19:47.226
Do they have gay roadblocks?

01:19:47.607 --> 01:19:48.925
They are just like stopping people in they’re cars.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.759
“Good evening Officer”

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:50.911
“Good evening Sir”

01:19:51.975 --> 01:19:53.108
“License Please?”

01:19:53.744 --> 01:19:55.898
“Thank you very much, Mr. Stylish. Hey?”

01:19:57.148 --> 01:19:59.615
“Tell me Sir, have you been gay this evening?”

01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:05.114
“No, I have not been gay. In fact, I don’t gay at all.”

01:20:05.808 --> 01:20:07.356
“I see, not even one or two?”

01:20:07.381 --> 01:20:09.697
“No, No. No gays for me. No gays for me.”

01:20:10.047 --> 01:20:11.047
“Okay”

01:20:11.449 --> 01:20:13.528
“Then tell me Sir.”
*sniffing*

01:20:14.088 --> 01:20:15.468
“What is that I can smell on your breath?”

01:20:16.702 --> 01:20:17.819
“Is that balls?”

01:20:20.755 --> 01:20:23.167
“No, no, no, I”

01:20:23.668 --> 01:20:25.828
“I don’t even eat Chutney, No”

01:20:27.205 --> 01:20:28.205
“A ha”

01:20:29.587 --> 01:20:30.539
“So you are not gay?”

01:20:30.579 --> 01:20:31.872
“No, not gay at all”

01:20:32.403 --> 01:20:34.403
“Then Sir, can you please blow into this?”

01:20:40.787 --> 01:20:41.598
Ahh

01:20:45.683 --> 01:20:46.881
Don’t be gay.

01:20:49.394 --> 01:20:51.857
I was not gay while I was in Zambia, so I had a good time.

01:20:52.675 --> 01:20:53.809
Went around and saw the people.

01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:56.289
The highlight of my trip
came when on my day off

01:20:56.845 --> 01:20:58.434
I asked Ali for suggestions.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.698
Ali said to me, “Maybe you should travel
around Lusaka, meet some of the people”

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:02.994
“just have a good time.”

01:21:03.028 --> 01:21:04.724
I said to Ali I want to do something special.

01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:06.672
He said, “Oh well, in that case”

01:21:06.998 --> 01:21:09.565
“Maybe you can go to the Mall and if you are lucky”

01:21:09.693 --> 01:21:11.414
“maybe you can ride the escalators.”

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:14.808
I said, “What?”

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:16.713
“Hey, I am not promising anything”

01:21:17.408 --> 01:21:19.590
“but if you are early, maybe you can go once or twice.”

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.434
I said, “Escalators?”

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:22.704
“I know, mind-blowing ha?”

01:21:24.998 --> 01:21:26.138
I thought he was messing with me.

01:21:27.759 --> 01:21:30.251
Until I found out people in Zambia go to the mall

01:21:31.112 --> 01:21:33.604
just to ride the escalators.

01:21:35.353 --> 01:21:38.892
It seems ridiculous until you understand the back-story.

01:21:39.539 --> 01:21:44.253
When we were in Zambia there were
only five public escalators.

01:21:44.979 --> 01:21:47.312
Five, in the whole country.

01:21:48.277 --> 01:21:50.697
The first escalator was built in August.

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:54.296
Not August 19??

01:21:54.321 --> 01:21:57.411
No, no. You remember August. Past August?

01:21:57.553 --> 01:21:59.493
They built they’re first escalators, ever.

01:21:59.803 --> 01:22:02.966
Yea, and so now it is all the rage. People
go to the Mall just to ride escalators.

01:22:03.705 --> 01:22:05.730
But now, I don’t want you to
picture some dusty village.

01:22:05.763 --> 01:22:07.606
That’s not what Zambia is,
it’s a beautiful place.

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:09.917
They are developing just as we are, they have roads.

01:22:09.956 --> 01:22:12.269
They got airports, the have beautiful hotels.

01:22:12.381 --> 01:22:13.381
Stunning shopping Malls.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:15.471
They’ve got everything we
got, even faster internet

01:22:15.575 --> 01:22:18.109
The have just never had escalators.

01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:20.024
And now they started building them.

01:22:20.341 --> 01:22:23.463
And because of that people go there, and
they just spend a day riding escalators.

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:26.214
Yea, Dads will go home and fetch their children.

01:22:26.239 --> 01:22:27.928
“Children, we are going to the Mall.”

01:22:28.278 --> 01:22:29.333
“To do what Daddy?”

01:22:29.589 --> 01:22:32.589
“To do shopping, and to ride the escalators!”

01:22:32.679 --> 01:22:34.474
“Yay!”

01:22:36.055 --> 01:22:37.968
We couldn’t believe this so
we went to the Mall, right.

01:22:38.106 --> 01:22:40.558
We get to the Mall. The Mall is empty.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.674
Escalators are packed!

01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:47.214
People are standing in lines going
around, doubling back on themselves.

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.819
There’s old people, young people, even couples.

01:22:48.844 --> 01:22:51.623
There were couples. Guys that
actually picked up woman by saying:

01:22:51.648 --> 01:22:53.919
“I am going to take you to the escalator girl.”

01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:57.161
“Oh, you are so fancy hey?”

01:22:59.633 --> 01:23:03.294
Escalators. Some people didn’t even
know how to ride the escalators.

01:23:03.662 --> 01:23:06.328
Kids were easy, they just jumped on. Old people would panic.

01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:09.291
There was one guy who got on the escalator, and it was going up.

01:23:09.316 --> 01:23:12.065
And I guess to compensate for
something in his mind, as it went up

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.989
He started leaning.

01:23:15.225 --> 01:23:17.904
He fell down!
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

01:23:18.044 --> 01:23:21.780
He fell down!
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

01:23:22.545 --> 01:23:25.071
Oh, it was fantastic to watch.

01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:29.448
We spent like three hours doing this,
watching people riding escalators.

01:23:30.594 --> 01:23:34.524
And you know what? Our patience paid off, because
in hour three the most fantastic thing happened.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.867
A school brought a class of children to the Mall.

01:23:39.923 --> 01:23:42.852
And their excursion was just to ride the escalators.

01:23:44.528 --> 01:23:45.354
It was magic.

01:23:45.999 --> 01:23:50.972
Thirty kids, about five years old. Cutest things,
they were in their black and white uniforms.

01:23:51.344 --> 01:23:53.038
And they are standing there together holding hands.

01:23:53.136 --> 01:23:56.046
And they were so excited, they were shining.

01:23:56.549 --> 01:23:58.598
Not from excitement, that Vaseline.

01:24:04.367 --> 01:24:08.346
And there is two teachers with the children,
and they grab their hands on either end.

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:14.034
And as they do the start singing at the
top of their lungs like little angels.

01:24:14.579 --> 01:24:16.483
“Escalator”

01:24:16.764 --> 01:24:18.604
“Escalator”

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:20.686
“Escalator”

01:24:20.921 --> 01:24:24.609
“Oh, Oh, Ohhhhhhoh Escalator”

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.653
“Escalator”

01:24:26.885 --> 01:24:28.496
It was the sweetest thing ever.

01:24:28.521 --> 01:24:30.687
People are waving at them, smiling.

01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:32.762
And these kids see the escalators.

01:24:33.105 --> 01:24:36.447
And they lost, their minds.

01:24:37.188 --> 01:24:39.029
These kids went crazy.

01:24:39.079 --> 01:24:42.637
They’re not holding hands, they
start screaming and running around.

01:24:42.727 --> 01:24:44.449
It looked like a zombie movie, or something.

01:24:44.687 --> 01:24:46.778
They are jumping, but then you see the smiles on their faces.

01:24:46.803 --> 01:24:49.905
It’s like the end of Saraphina. You are
like, “What the hell is going on here?”

01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:53.416
These kids are screaming. They are
jumping around doing cartwheels.

01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:55.326
The teacher can’t control them.
She’s panicking like,

01:24:55.387 --> 01:24:56.739
“Hey! Get back! Get Back!”

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.836
“Two-by-two! Two-by-two!”

01:24:59.003 --> 01:25:00.880
Two-by two was one of the
kids, I didn’t know.

01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:04.691
She’s like, “Two-by-Two! Next to
me, next to me! Single file, single file!”

01:25:05.115 --> 01:25:07.212
Other kids are still jumping, she can’t control them.

01:25:07.231 --> 01:25:10.231
There was one fat kid. He couldn’t
jump so he just shook himself.

01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:12.781
“Escalator!”

01:25:14.522 --> 01:25:15.958
“Escalator!”

01:25:19.859 --> 01:25:22.249
It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.

01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:25.236
It's like I had gone in a time machine

01:25:25.699 --> 01:25:27.228
to a time when escalators were new.

01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:28.333
Brand new

01:25:28.358 --> 01:25:28.929
and popular

01:25:29.256 --> 01:25:30.256
So popular...

01:25:30.456 --> 01:25:32.980
that people were taking pictures of the escalators

01:25:33.778 --> 01:25:35.112
using their iPhones!

01:25:38.447 --> 01:25:40.593
Tempiwa, technology eh?

01:25:40.673 --> 01:25:41.673
Ah ah ah!

01:25:42.485 --> 01:25:43.963
Who even thinks of these things eh?

01:25:43.988 --> 01:25:44.828
Can you imagine?

01:25:44.933 --> 01:25:46.250
Eh we are in the future now my man!

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:47.695
Mechanical moving stairs ah?

01:25:48.054 --> 01:25:49.482
What are we going to see next?

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.030
I don't even know, I don't even know!

01:25:51.478 --> 01:25:52.684
I wonder how it works, ah!?

01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:53.709
Let me just check...

01:25:53.886 --> 01:25:55.517
Siri, how does an escalator work?

01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:58.401
I don't know
