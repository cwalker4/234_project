00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:08.849
Nobody from the show has ever once inspired me. I I met I've only seen maybe one or two episodes at the most

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.550
I mean, I'm not a big fan of the show

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.549
- Why are you then the next American Idol ?
- Because I can hit the high pitch notes

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.500
I think I am what they are looking for it's not that many redheads you see on TV this day and age

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:37.889
- It's true
- That a fact that I look like carrot, a sort of, but do you know something ? Everyone says I'm way cooler than him

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.140
Steven what's up, man?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.199
How you doing sir okay? So you're known as red. Yes, sir. I am and your real name is Steven

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.390
Yes, sir okay Steven why?

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.680
Did you enter this competition? I like competition I?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320
Figured what what the heck take a chance?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.690
Yeah, have you seen the show I?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.400
Honestly, I've only seen it a couple of times. I try to keep busy as much as possible

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
I don't know that much, but you know what it's all about yes, sir

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.389
Okay, who you as good as in your opinion the lead singer from Queen pretty much. Yes, yes, sir

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.229
Okay

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.229
And what are you gonna sing today?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.599
Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen all right

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.250
I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030
Counsel new country as well Oh

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.220
Stephen

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.089
I've heard some weird auditions in my life

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.800
But I've got to tell you that is possibly the weirdest I've ever heard in my life. I mean it was

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.100
It was like a one-year-old singing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.449
No, I'm not being harsh Stephen if that's what it was like I mean it was

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.140
Weird oh I'm also a lot of practice as well ii mean last time. I took formal lessons was back in high school

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.199
All right, I would have been struck to say

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.859
Back, then I was getting always annoying concert

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.959
Choir you think that would win you this?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.959
competition actually with some practice and what with

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.089
Some coaching I can actually win it I think there is just lack of practice and coaching which is the problem yes, sir

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.660
Who should be your coach? Well of course I Minh thinks that he knows it all and knows what the hell

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.630
He's talking about bring it on what I do bring it on come on you think you're so damn

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.929
Hot yeah coach me I couldn't

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.259
it would be like coaching a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.070
One-legged man to wind a hundred meters sprint

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.669
You know I may be a great coach, but if you haven't got it. You haven't got it

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.929
Hey the way I see it. Don't don't be about it, or don't hey

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.149
Don't think about be about it. All right. Don't sing just bring it all right

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.049
This is just ridiculous. If you don't mind me saying

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.320
And I'm not being rude

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.550
Yes or no Simon no Paula

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.470
Thank you very much, thank you Steve

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.169
Lean on me when you're not strong

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.169
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.790
on

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.169
No

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.499
It won't be long

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.229
Till I'm gonna need somebody

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.489
to me you know oh

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.929
This has been one of the worst days. We've ever had and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.750
You are probably the worst

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.650
We've had today

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.130
But the locals were defiant well the reason I tried out for American

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.939
Idol is I feel that it's a good way to show off your talent. My mom is here today

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.219
She's been very supportive, Mischa. How you feeling about the audition I'm excited yeah

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.349
Yeah, I think it's gonna go. I think it's gonna go well. Well. You know part of it singing part of its image

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.909
Tell me about your style here. You look too, sexy. It's sexy yes mm-hmm

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.919
To me the reason I'm sexy is is more of an attitude in my opinion. It's not just your look

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.169
That makes you sexy it's confidence. It's an attitude. That's just something that you project to people

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.220
Does she get her any of her talent or her sense of style from you? Oh?

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.038
Maybe I studied music I played in the high school band, and I used to say me myself

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.649
No, so you brought sexy once and she's bringing it back

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.999
