00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.620
“The city is awake.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.125
Across the length of
its five boroughs,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:09.930
a vast stream of
humanity will move.”

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.140
This was what a New Yorker’s
commute looked like in 1961.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.274
“— can be seen the daily miracle
that is the New York City

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:16.900
transit system.”

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.700
But that was then.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.536
And this is now.

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:21.964
[screaming]

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:25.109
“Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.”

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.650
Subway riders demanding an end
to their commuting nightmare.”

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.140
“So fed up with all the
delays and cancellations

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.439
that they are suing the M.T.A.”

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.170
The New York subway now has
the worst on-time performance

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.000
of any major rapid transit
system in the world.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.841
And commuters are pissed.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.900
This woman’s commute
has gotten so bad,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.100
she’s considering leaving
a job she really likes.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.600
“No.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.920
I got a new job.”

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.250
This rabbi was sent into a panic
when his train stalled just

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.384
before Shabbat.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:53.800
And then there’s
this guy, who was

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.810
stuck underground for
so long, commuters

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.980
sang to pass the time.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.480
“... Gonna make
me lose my mind up in here ...”

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.967
“It’s been two hours.”

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.550
They ended up making
a Facebook group.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.507
They’re still in touch.

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:05.590
“Yeah.”

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.690
“The mornings where every
single line is delayed —”

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.690
“It was like cruel or arbitrary.”

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.230
But it really
wasn’t that long ago

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.780
that New Yorkers would laugh
at other city subway systems.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.030
Four lines in Boston, two in L.A.?

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.260
That’s cute.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.060
In New York our trains run 24/7.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.770
We have 665 miles of track,
472 stations, 27 subway lines,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.805
and almost six million
riders every single day.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.770
“Does it really have
to be this way?”

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.840
“Also, has it always
been this bad?”

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.085
Turns out the M.T.A. has recovered
from a transit crisis before.

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:47.480
“Ladies and gentlemen, we
are being held momentarily

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.370
by the train’s dispatcher.”

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.547
These were the
trains in the 1970s.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:59.240
“Poor maintenance, high crime
and widespread graffiti.”

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.870
“It was kind of scary.”

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.650
And that’s Jim.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.380
He’s been reporting on the
subway since before I was born.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.360
“He wrote the book about
the subway, literally.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.479
In the ’70s, it was
really, really bad.”

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.140
“Maintenance really had suffered.”

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.431
So officials poured money into
the system, and it improved.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:19.931
[cheering]

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.404
“They are working on it.

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:22.877
They’re doing the best they can.”

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:23.750
“They’re fixing the tracks.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.041
Well, they’re fixing the track.

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:26.770
They put in a new
escalator downstairs.”

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.480
“They improve it in the ’80s.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.800
“Today we got better equipment,
better parts and better tools.”

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.940
“In the ’90s it gets to be
the best it’s ever been.”

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.250
The 1990s were the golden
era of subway functionality.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.860
“So if you want to
prove to someone

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.550
that New York has it all, just
show them your MetroCard Gold.”

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.770
New York’s governor at
the time, George Pataki,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.960
called it a transit renaissance.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.360
But then, that city
that has it all started

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.565
taking the system for granted,
starting with Mayor Rudolph

00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:54.065
Giuliani.

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:55.660
“Cut down the size
of city government.”

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.580
Just a year into his
first term, the mayor

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.890
cut the city’s contribution
to the M.T.A.’s budget

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.405
by millions of dollars.

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:04.190
Then, Governor Pataki
followed Giuliani’s lead.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.800
And so began a trend
of mayors and governors

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.390
diverting part of their
budgets away from the M.T.A.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.765
and toward their own
priorities. And then blaming one

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:13.390
another for the
problems that followed.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.890
“Right.”

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.470
So while the city and
state contributions

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.560
got smaller and
smaller and smaller,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.800
subway ridership went
up, and so did the fares.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.620
But fares still weren’t enough
to make up for the budget cuts.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.100
So a group of Wall Street
executives came to the M.T.A.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.650
with a deal.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.430
[cash register ringing]

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.010
These Wall Street execs, they
went to the head of the M.T.A.,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.565
also known as the governor,
and said, give us your debt.

00:03:39.565 --> 00:03:41.850
We’ll pay you cash.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.540
Pay us back later.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.000
Pataki agreed to the deal
to refinance the M.T.A.’s debt.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.930
“Basically, they used the Amex
to pay off the MasterCard.”

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.390
And these bankers, many
of whom were donors

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.350
to Governor Pataki’s campaign,
walked away with $85 million

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.290
in commissions and fees.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.941
And that debt lives on today —

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:05.630
“... finally reaches
its destination.”

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.970
— even if some of the equipment
we’re still paying for

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.470
does not.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.192
“Great habitat enhancement
for fish and shellfish.”

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.952
Then —

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.250
“It was a fiscal crisis globally.”

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.730
“That was a really big
turning point for the M.T.A.”

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.892
“Maintenance was withdrawn.”

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:26.600
“You’re checking the
cars less frequently,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.150
you’re repairing the
cars less frequently,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.700
then they’re going to
break down more frequently.”

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.410
“So basically —”

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.790
“The trains became
slightly less reliable.”

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.860
But there were millions
of dollars draining

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.730
from the M.T.A.’s budget that could
have been used for maintenance.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.690
“So what happened was —”

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.850
This summer Governor
Cuomo’s administration

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.640
forced the M.T.A. to bail out
some upstate ski resorts

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.710
after an unusually warm winter.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.170
“So we set out to
try and find out

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.830
if there were a lot of other
examples of the M.T.A. being

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.260
forced by the state to spend
money on things that had

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.060
nothing to do with the subway.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.180
And we found out about
these bond issuance fees.”

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.306
Bond issuance fees may
sound a little boring.

00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:06.180
So I hired a busker to
write a song about it.

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:42.295
“Let me put it this way — the
M.T.A. brings in a lot of money.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.620
The state has used that
money as a piggy bank

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.171
for other priorities.”

00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:52.440
“The next stop is Fulton Street.”

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.500
“Fulton Street was
the pet project

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.750
of a guy named Sheldon Silver.”

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.300
He wanted Fulton Street
to be the Grand Central

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.730
Station of downtown Manhattan.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.160
So construction started,
the years went by,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.020
and the day of the
grand opening arrived.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.580
“Oh, that’s way over budget.”

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.820
At this point, the M.T.A. board
wants to scale things back.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.110
And one of the board members —

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.120
“Nancy Shevell, wife
of Paul McCartney,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.600
said, we’re not
building cathedrals here.”

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.474
But the next day,
Sheldon Silver demanded —

00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:23.890
”You’re going to build this
thing the way it was originally

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.870
supposed to be
built, or else I’m

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.040
going to veto your
capital budget.”

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.440
So the M.T.A. complied.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.990
“A billion and a half
dollars on one station.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.590
It didn’t get an extra subway
car, an extra foot of track,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.810
nothing.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.490
Did I say it was
in his district?”

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.069
Fulton Street was
just one example.

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.610
“These politicians
really wanted to be

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.070
able to have a big project
they could champion,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.247
mosaics and artwork and
everything is brand new.”

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:54.455
“Clean, shiny subway stations.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.570
This is exciting, right?”

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.500
I did this for you.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.878
Here is my gift to you.

00:06:58.878 --> 00:06:59.378
“Yeah.

00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:00.842
And I feel good about that.”

00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:03.770
“Of course you should.”

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.590
“You can’t really do that with
replacing some ancient subway

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.650
signal system that people
don’t even know exists.”

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.371
“No one wants to talk
about the signals.”

00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:16.680
“I don’t think I understand
how the signals even work.”

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.670
And neither did I. So I
watched a documentary released

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.640
by the M.T.A. to learn more.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.530
“People know that
the system is old,

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.650
but I don’t think they
realize just how old it is.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.940
It’s not just the architecture
that’s 100 years old.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.380
It’s a lot of the basic
technology as well.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.710
We never really know
where the train is.”

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.620
“Um —”

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.380
“Yeah.”

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.960
“The workers don’t actually know
where the trains are exactly,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.460
precisely, on the tracks.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.500
They know what
section they are in.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.750
So they have to keep
them a safe distance

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.296
apart as they go
through the system.

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.420
You can’t just go to Best
Buy and pick up something

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.090
to replace this 1930s
piece of equipment.”

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.760
New signals would mean more
trains running more efficiently

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.290
and closer together.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.500
But it’s been two decades since
the M.T.A. first began its push

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.730
to upgrade its signals.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.790
And so far, they’ve
completed just one line.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.190
“If you don’t focus on the
core needs of the system,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.724
bad things can happen.”

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:21.700
“So the trains were not
as well taken care of,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.840
the signal system
deteriorated, and there was

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.750
very little margin for error.”

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.450
And then that margin gets even
smaller with Hurricane Sandy.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.414
“The worst disaster in the
history of the subway system.”

00:08:33.414 --> 00:08:35.010
So this is the part
of the story where

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.943
all of those bad
decisions of the past

00:08:36.943 --> 00:08:38.110
really start wreaking havoc.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.990
“The M.T.A. is openly violating
its own safety directives.”

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.080
A tunnel wall in Brooklyn
collapses onto the track.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.935
“We just boarded
the rescue train.”

00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:47.460
“There have been 22 derailments.”

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.260
Overcrowding is
definitely a problem,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.520
but the M.T.A. can’t blame
everything on overcrowding.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.511
“The issue is there’s
not one person to blame.”

00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:56.010
There’s been a lot
of back and forth

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.468
between the governor
and the mayor.

00:08:57.468 --> 00:09:00.125
“Blame everybody who has
been in power in New

00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:01.560
York in the past 25 years.”

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.250
A train careens off the tracks
in Harlem, injuring 34 people.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.980
And in summer of 2017,
the waiting and crowding

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.170
and derailments reach
a breaking point.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.050
And at long last, Governor Cuomo
declares a state of emergency.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.550
“I mean

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.460
there is some light at
the end of the tunnel.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.510
No pun intended.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.720
I actually did not
intend that pun.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.300
There are some signs
that politicians are now

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.165
taking the maintenance of
the subway system seriously.”

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.720
“Elected leaders are finally
expected to come out

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.632
with a plan to pay for the M.T.A.

00:09:35.632 --> 00:09:37.590
And I think there’s a
consensus they can’t just

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.450
rely on debt anymore.”

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.836
“I believe in you, subway.

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:43.860
But you’ve got to
get it together.”

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.370
“We want to do this.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.890
We need to do this.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.100
We will do this.”

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.870
“I think delay is,
in a messed up way,

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.290
our way to bring
people together.”

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.970
“There’s no New York City
without the subways.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.032
I regard it as the great
public commons of New York.”

00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:02.270
“Yeah, it’s good.”

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.605
“Nice meeting all of you.”

00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:05.250
“They ride together.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.960
And in this journey can be
seen the daily miracle that

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.260
is the New York City
transit system, upon which

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.620
the very existence of the
city and its people, depend.”
