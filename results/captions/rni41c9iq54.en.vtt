00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:11.641
I grew up with my identical twin,

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:15.374
who was an incredibly loving brother.

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:19.555
Now, one thing about being a twin
is it makes you an expert

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.140
at spotting favoritism.

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:28.500
If his cookie was even slightly bigger
than my cookie, I had questions.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.271
And clearly I wasn't starving.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:35.235
(Laughter)

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.360
When I became a psychologist,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.434
I began to notice favoritism
of a different kind.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:45.817
And that is how much more
we value the body than we do the mind.

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:51.448
I spent nine years at University
earning my doctorate in Psychology,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.554
and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say,

00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:00.483
"Oh, a psychologist,
so not a real doctor."

00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:05.454
As if it should say that on my card.

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:08.307
(Laughter)

00:01:09.372 --> 00:01:13.621
This favoritism we show
the body over the mind,

00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:15.417
I see it everywhere.

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.077
I recently was at a friends' house,

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.559
and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.982
He was standing on a stool
by the sink brushing his teeth,

00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:27.661
when he slipped, and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell.

00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:30.797
He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up,

00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:34.743
got back on the stool
and reached out for a box of Band-Aids

00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:37.256
to put one on his cut.

00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:41.392
Now this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces,

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:45.590
but he knew you have to cover a cut,
so it doesn't become infected,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.425
and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day.

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.605
We all know how to maintain
our physical health

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:55.658
and how to practice dental hygiene, right?

00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:58.998
We've known it
since we were five years old.

00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:03.905
But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health?

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:06.178
Well, nothing.

00:02:06.178 --> 00:02:09.568
What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.402
Nothing.

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.639
How is it we spend more time

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.087
taking care our teeth
than we do our minds?

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:24.762
Why is it our physical health
is so much more important to us

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:27.599
than our psychological health?

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.703
You know we sustain psychological injuries

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:33.249
even more often than we do physical ones.

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.930
Injuries like failure or rejection,
or loneliness,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.804
and they can also
get worse if we ignore them.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.266
And they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:47.750
And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.656
we could use to treat these kinds
of psychological injuries, we don't.

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:56.715
It doesn't even occur to us
that we should.

00:02:56.966 --> 00:03:01.517
"Oh, you're feeling depressed,
just shake it off, it's all in your head."

00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:04.555
Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg,

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:07.759
"Just walk it off, it's all in your leg."

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.008
(Laughter)

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:15.208
It is time we close the gap between
our physical and our psychological health.

00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:18.310
It's time we made them more equal.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.513
More like twins.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.999
Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist.

00:03:25.013 --> 00:03:28.096
So he's not a real doctor, either.

00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:29.952
(Laughter)

00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:31.963
We didn't study together, though.

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:35.822
In fact, the hardest thing I've ever done
in my life

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.012
is move across the Atlantic
to New York city

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:41.756
to get my doctorate in psychology.

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:44.690
We were apart then,
for the first time in our lives,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.071
and the separation
was brutal for both of us.

00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:51.542
But while he remained
among family and friends,

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:54.185
I was alone in a new country.

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.453
We missed each other terribly,

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.473
but international phone calls
were really expensive then,

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:03.778
and we could only afford
to speak for 5 minutes a week.

00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:06.456
When our birthday rolled around,

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:08.826
it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together,

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.216
we decide to splurge,

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.575
and that week
we would talk for ten minutes.

00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:16.250
I spent the morning pacing around my room,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.043
waiting for him to call,

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:19.771
and waiting,

00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:22.045
and waiting,

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:23.985
but the phone didn't ring.

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:26.136
Given the time difference, I assumed

00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:28.808
"OK, he's out with friends,
he will call later."

00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:31.456
There were no cell phones then.

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:33.271
But he didn't.

00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:38.082
And I began to realize,
after being away for over ten months,

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:41.421
he no longer missed me
the way I missed him.

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:44.525
And I knew he would call in the morning,

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:49.602
but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.678
I woke up the next morning,

00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:54.874
I glanced down at the phone,

00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:57.621
and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook

00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:59.959
when pacing the day before.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.657
I stumbled out of bed,

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:04.428
I put the phone
back on the receiver,

00:05:04.428 --> 00:05:06.012
and it rang a second later,

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:09.331
and it was my brother,
and, boy, was he pissed.

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:11.528
(Laughter)

00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:14.968
It was the saddest and longest 
night of his life as well.

00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:17.560
I tried to explain what happened,
but he said,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.650
"I don't understand,
if you saw I wasn't calling you,

00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:24.892
why didn't you just pick up the phone
and call me?"

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.031
He was right.

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.038
Why didn't I call him?

00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:34.518
I didn't have an answer then,
but I do today, and it's a simple one.

00:05:35.298 --> 00:05:37.411
Loneliness.

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:41.926
Loneliness creates
a deep psychological wound.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.225
One that distorts our perceptions

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:46.652
and scrambles our thinking,

00:05:46.652 --> 00:05:48.002
It makes us believe

00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:51.892
those around us care much less
than they actually do.

00:05:51.892 --> 00:05:54.476
It makes us really afraid to reach out,

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:58.613
because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache,

00:05:58.613 --> 00:06:02.268
when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand?

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:05.538
I was in the grips of real loneliness
back then,

00:06:05.538 --> 00:06:08.203
but I was surrounded by people all day,

00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:10.345
so it never occurred to me.

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:14.051
But loneliness, is defined purely,
subjectively.

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:17.932
It depends solely on whether you feel

00:06:17.932 --> 00:06:21.415
emotionally or socially disconnected
from those around you.

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:23.226
And I did.

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.322
There's a lot research on loneliness

00:06:26.322 --> 00:06:28.822
and all of it is horrifying.

00:06:29.863 --> 00:06:34.128
Loneliness won't just make you miserable,
it will kill you.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.463
I am not kidding.

00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:38.687
Chronic loneliness increases your
likelihood of an early death

00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:40.792
by 14 percent.

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:42.913
Fourteen percent.

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:46.756
Loneliness causes high blood pressure,
high cholesterol,

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:50.559
it even suppresses
the functioning of your immune system,

00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:54.672
making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases.

00:06:54.672 --> 00:06:58.167
In fact, scientist have concluded
that taken together,

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.990
chronic loneliness poses
a significant a risk

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.488
for your longterm health and longevity
as cigarette smoking.

00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:11.061
Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you."

00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:13.290
But loneliness doesn't.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.232
And that's why it's so important

00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:18.564
we prioritize our psychological health.

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:21.444
That we practice emotional hygiene.

00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:24.611
Because you can't treat
a psychological wound

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.733
if you don't even know you are injured.

00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:28.806
[Pay attention to emotional pain]

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.303
Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound

00:07:31.303 --> 00:07:34.178
that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us.

00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:35.713
[Failure]

00:07:35.713 --> 00:07:38.128
Failure does that as well.

00:07:38.128 --> 00:07:42.110
I once visited a daycare center
where I saw three toddlers

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.782
play with identical plastic toys.

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:49.494
You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggy would pop out.

00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:54.535
One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it,

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:57.358
and then she just sat back
and looked at the box

00:07:57.358 --> 00:07:59.450
with her lower lip trembling.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.346
The little boy next to her,
watched this happen,

00:08:02.346 --> 00:08:04.786
then turned to his box,
and burst into tears

00:08:04.786 --> 00:08:06.839
without even touching it.

00:08:07.132 --> 00:08:10.778
Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of

00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:12.747
until she slid the red button,

00:08:12.747 --> 00:08:17.429
the cute doggy popped out,
and she squealed with delight.

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:20.619
So three toddlers
with identical plastic toys

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:23.609
but with very different
reactions to failure.

00:08:24.227 --> 00:08:28.468
The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button.

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:32.176
The only thing that prevented them
from succeeding

00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:36.473
was their mind tricked them
into believing they could not.

00:08:36.473 --> 00:08:40.599
Now, adults get tricked this way
as well all the time.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.453
In fact we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs

00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:50.024
that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks.

00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:53.168
Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure?

00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:54.890
You need to be.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.483
Because if your mind tries to convince you

00:08:57.483 --> 00:08:59.290
you're incapable of something

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.770
and you believe it,

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.130
then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.894
and you'll stop trying too soon
or you won't even try at all.

00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:11.617
And then you will be even more convinced
you can't succeed.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.328
You see, that's why so many people

00:09:13.328 --> 00:09:15.865
function below their actual potential.

00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:19.349
Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure

00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:21.889
convinced them they couldn't succeed,

00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:23.483
and they believed it.

00:09:23.483 --> 00:09:26.016
Once we become convinced of something,

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:28.626
it's very difficult to change our mind.

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:30.626
I learned that lesson the hard way.

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.901
When I was a teenager with my brother.

00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:36.510
We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.262
when the police car stopped us.

00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:41.544
There had been a robbery in the area,
they were looking for suspects.

00:09:41.544 --> 00:09:43.050
The officer approached the car,

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.595
and he shined his flashlight
on the driver.

00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:49.134
Then on my brother in the front seat,
and then on me.

00:09:49.134 --> 00:09:51.736
And his eyes opened wide, and he said,

00:09:51.736 --> 00:09:54.375
"Where have I seen your face before?"

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:56.463
(Laughter)

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:59.615
And I said, "In the front seat."

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:03.157
(Laughter)

00:10:03.157 --> 00:10:05.510
But that made no sense to him whatsoever.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.629
So now he thought I was on drugs.

00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:09.010
(Laughter)

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.413
So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me,

00:10:11.413 --> 00:10:13.603
he marches me over to the police car,

00:10:13.603 --> 00:10:16.913
and only when he verified
I don't have a police record,

00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:20.841
could I show him I had a twin
in the front seat.

00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:24.761
But even as we were driving away,
you could see by the look on his face,

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:28.254
he was convinced
I was getting away with something.

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:33.575
Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced.

00:10:33.575 --> 00:10:38.525
So it might be very natural to feel
demoralized and defeated after you fail.

00:10:38.714 --> 00:10:42.451
But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed.

00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:46.037
You have to fight
feelings of helplessness.

00:10:46.037 --> 00:10:49.039
You have to gain control
over the situation,

00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:53.132
and you have to break this kind
of negative cycle before it begins.

00:10:53.134 --> 00:10:55.228
[Stop emotional bleeding]

00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:57.371
Our minds and our feelings,

00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:01.059
they are not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were.

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:03.863
They are more like a really moody friend,

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:09.027
who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next.

00:11:09.027 --> 00:11:11.015
I once worked with this woman

00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:14.836
who after 20 years of marriage
and an extremely ugly divorce,

00:11:14.836 --> 00:11:17.383
was finally ready for her first date.

00:11:17.383 --> 00:11:21.580
She had met this guy online,
he seemed nice and successful,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.706
and most importantly,
he seemed really into her.

00:11:25.052 --> 00:11:28.078
So she was very excited,
and she bought a new dress,

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:31.878
and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink.

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:35.795
Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says,

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:38.903
"I'm not interested", and walks out.

00:11:38.903 --> 00:11:40.867
[Rejection]

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.523
Rejection is extremely painful.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.442
The woman was so hurt,
she could't move.

00:11:46.442 --> 00:11:48.662
All she could do is call a friend.

00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:53.176
And here's what the friend said,
"Well, what do you expect,

00:11:53.176 --> 00:11:56.722
you have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say,

00:11:56.722 --> 00:11:59.683
why would a handsome,
successful man like that

00:11:59.683 --> 00:12:02.296
ever go out with a loser like you?"

00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:07.239
Shocking, right,
that a friend could be so cruel.

00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:09.747
But it would be much less shocking

00:12:09.747 --> 00:12:12.651
if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that.

00:12:12.651 --> 00:12:15.528
It's what the woman said to herself.

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:18.153
And that's something we all do.

00:12:18.153 --> 00:12:20.200
Especially after a rejection.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.603
We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings

00:12:23.603 --> 00:12:25.951
what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't,

00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:27.438
we call ourselves names.

00:12:27.438 --> 00:12:29.809
Maybe not as harshly,
but we all do it.

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:34.419
It's interesting that we do, because
our self-esteem is already hurting.

00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:38.381
Why would we want to go
and damage it even further?

00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:41.017
We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose.

00:12:41.017 --> 00:12:43.523
You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide,

00:12:43.523 --> 00:12:47.409
"Oh, I know, I am going to take a knife
and see how much deeper I can make it."

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:50.943
But we do that with psychological injuries
all the time.

00:12:50.943 --> 00:12:54.168
Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.

00:12:54.168 --> 00:12:57.619
Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health.

00:12:57.619 --> 00:12:59.396
We know from dozens of studies,

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:01.379
that when your self-esteem is lower,

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:04.473
you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety,

00:13:04.473 --> 00:13:07.630
that failures and rejections hurt more,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.348
and it takes longer to recover from them.

00:13:10.348 --> 00:13:13.434
So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing

00:13:13.434 --> 00:13:15.911
is to revive your self-esteem,

00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:19.001
not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp.

00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:22.456
When you are in emotional pain,

00:13:22.456 --> 00:13:25.296
treat yourself with the same compassion

00:13:25.296 --> 00:13:28.211
you would expect from a truly good friend.

00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:30.357
[Protect your self-esteem]

00:13:30.357 --> 00:13:34.042
We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them.

00:13:34.128 --> 00:13:38.380
One of the unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination.

00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:41.499
To ruminate, means to chew over.

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:43.640
It's when your boss yells at you,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.522
or your professor makes you
feel stupid in class,

00:13:46.522 --> 00:13:49.113
or you have a big fight with a friend,

00:13:49.113 --> 00:13:52.929
and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days,

00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:55.072
sometimes for weeks on end.

00:13:55.072 --> 00:13:58.394
Now ruminating
about upsetting events in this way

00:13:58.394 --> 00:14:01.865
can easily become a habit,
and it's a very costly one.

00:14:01.865 --> 00:14:03.941
Because by spending so much time

00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:06.815
focused on upsetting
and negative thoughts,

00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:10.552
you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk for developing

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.631
clinical depression, alcoholism,

00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:17.081
eating disorders
and even cardiovascular disease.

00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:20.337
The problem is, the urge to ruminate

00:14:20.337 --> 00:14:24.429
can feel really strong, really important,
so it's a difficult habit to stop.

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:27.179
I know this for a fact.

00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:31.300
Because little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.128
You see my twin brother was diagnosed

00:14:34.128 --> 00:14:37.451
with stage III non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:39.786
His cancer was extremly aggressive,

00:14:39.786 --> 00:14:43.037
he had visible tumors all over his body.

00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:47.355
And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy.

00:14:48.494 --> 00:14:52.577
And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through,

00:14:52.762 --> 00:14:56.054
I could't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering.

00:14:57.255 --> 00:15:00.785
Even though he never complained, not once.

00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:03.820
He had this incredibly positive attitude.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.918
His psychological health was amazing.

00:15:06.918 --> 00:15:11.345
I was physically healthy,
but psychologically I was a mess.

00:15:12.014 --> 00:15:13.563
But I knew what to do.

00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:16.933
Studies tell us
that even a two minute distraction

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:20.867
is sufficient to break the urge
to ruminate in that moment.

00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:24.305
And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought,

00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:28.664
I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed.

00:15:28.698 --> 00:15:33.263
And within one week,
my whole outlook changed,

00:15:33.263 --> 00:15:36.251
and became more positive
and more hopeful.

00:15:36.693 --> 00:15:38.505
[Battle negative thinking]

00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:42.649
Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan,

00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:45.880
and I was by his side
when he got the results.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.497
All the tumors were gone.

00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:51.654
He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go.

00:15:51.654 --> 00:15:53.731
But we knew he would recover. 

00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:57.716
This picture was taken two weeks ago.

00:16:00.682 --> 00:16:03.587
By taking action when you're lonely,

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:06.595
by changing your responses to failure,

00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:09.157
by protecting yourself-esteem,

00:16:09.157 --> 00:16:11.649
by battling negative thinking,

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:14.957
you won't just heal
your psychological wounds,

00:16:14.957 --> 00:16:18.174
you will build emotional resilience,
you will thrive.

00:16:19.673 --> 00:16:23.704
A hundred years ago,
people began practicing personal hygiene.

00:16:23.768 --> 00:16:28.423
And life expectancy rates rose
by over fifty percent

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:30.584
in just a matter of decades.

00:16:30.584 --> 00:16:34.468
I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically

00:16:34.468 --> 00:16:38.272
if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene.

00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:42.182
Can you imagine,
what the world would be like

00:16:42.182 --> 00:16:44.476
if everyone was psychologically healthier?

00:16:44.476 --> 00:16:48.427
If there were less loneliness,
and less depression?

00:16:48.427 --> 00:16:51.099
If people knew how to overcome failure?

00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:54.413
If they felt better about themselves,
and more empowered?

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:57.652
if they were happier, and more fulfilled?

00:16:57.652 --> 00:17:00.826
I can, because that's the world
I want to live in,

00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:06.021
and that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well.

00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:10.654
If you just become informed,
and change a few simple habits,

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:14.352
well that's the world we can all live in.

00:17:15.071 --> 00:17:16.813
Thank you very much.

00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:19.568
