Hello, hello, hi what's your name sir my name is ma that's? Why? You want britain's got talent i?

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.120
Am desperate to perform magic to an audience just

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.420
like that and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.260
Magic has always been a dream of mine and last, year i decided to take the plunge and to do it full-time

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.890
Now if i was to show. You all something

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.209
Up here on stage with, this, rubik's cube i'd be worried that because our judges are a little far away, they might actually

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250
Miss the moment

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.510
The cube solves itself so if it's. Okay with you please when i come down, and show. You this close-up yes thank you very much

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.729
Now, a rubik's cube turn them and mix them up they get jumbled up real fast and then the only way to

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.049
Get it back to the beginning is to get all the colors to come

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.489
Back together i want you to look just here for me and watch

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.199
One by one you can actually see those colors start to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530
reassemble themselves

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.809

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.299
