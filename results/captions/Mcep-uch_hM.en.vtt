00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:06.764
(both laughing)

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.060
- Do you laugh when you're nervous?

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.893
- Yes.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:15.647
- I am!

00:00:15.647 --> 00:00:17.899
Can you just hold your horses?

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.030
("In the Hall of the Mountain King")

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.423
My name is Bjork.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.870
- I'm guessing stuff, but I
don't know what I'm guessing.

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:30.742
- Whew, okay.

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:33.592
(Bjork laughs)

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:35.350
- A little.
(Bjork laughs)

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.427
Hello!

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:37.260
- Hi.
- I'm Bjork.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.030
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- So good to meet you.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.863
What is your name?

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:41.696
- Carolyn.

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:43.110
- Carolyn, okay.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.593
So I can see you have a hard time walking.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.240
This is like, really
hard, and I don't want her

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.959
to have to stand for this long, you guys.

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:53.792
- No, you're fine.

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:54.960
(both laughing)

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.950
Is it in your muscles?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.220
- It is.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.250
That's not like, the primary system.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.740
It's like a secondary effect.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.320
A lot of the stuff that it
affects is like my balance.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.600
Like, sometimes my hands

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.190
will just randomly stop doing things.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.280
- Oh, okay.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.170
I got nothing, dude, nothing.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.110
What is your disability?

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.390
- I have cerebral palsy, which
is commonly abbreviated CP.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.650
- How does that affect your life?

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.180
- Well, neurological disorders
can be kind of patchy,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.930
so I'll have really good
days, and then other times,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.880
I'll have really bad days, but
that doesn't necessarily mean

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.000
that I feel like I'm unable to do things.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.446
- Sorry I didn't even get close.

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:40.279
(Bjork laughs)

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:41.450
- You're totally fine.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.560
If I hadn't spent my entire
life in the medical system

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.170
and somebody just sprung this on me,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.044
I would be like, what the fuck?

00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:48.877
(both laughing)

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:50.839
Like, I wouldn't know
what it would be, so.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:51.730
- Yeah, I guess.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.563
Hello.

00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:54.580
- Hey.
- I'm Bjork.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.450
- I'm Lonnie, nice to meet you.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.540
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
So, tell me how your disability
affects your daily life.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.950
- Because of it, I don't really do much.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.880
I kind of prefer to isolate myself.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.639
- Do you prefer that?
- Yeah.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.810
- Hmm.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.180
I've struggled with anxiety my whole life,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.520
and that's kind of how I feel.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.980
I like being alone, but I
also like being with people,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.260
so that's what I would think.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.470
- I mean, I do have anxiety.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.480
It's kind of a part of it.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.600
I have BPD.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.433
- What is that?

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.050
- Borderline Personality Disorder.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.150
- When did you realize?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.820
- After I left high school,
I moved out and everything,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.620
and I was like, you know,
maybe I need some help,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770
'cause I'm kind of all over the place.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.000
And I kept trying to kill
myself, which isn't fun.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.490
- I never would have guessed.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.676
- Oh, thanks, I think.

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:41.740
- And I guess it's just
one of those things

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.290
that it's just like, you just
never know someone's story.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.240
- I'm Rachel.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.200
- Hi.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.330
- I have multiple disabilities, so.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.150
- How does it affect your work?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.090
- The onset only happened
my senior year of college,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.748
so these kind of prohibited my
original professional goals.

00:02:58.748 --> 00:02:59.581
- Mmhmm.

00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:00.420
Why do you have a chair?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.320
'Cause you just get tired, or?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.325
- It has to do with
one of my body systems.

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.670
- Ah, got it, okay.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.640
I don't know what this would be called,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.280
but maybe your nervous
system just has a hard time

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.123
communicating with another
system, is my guess.

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:19.040
I think that's my final guess.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.873
- Okay.

00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:23.140
But yeah, my conditions
aren't very common.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.470
I guess the top three would be something

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.320
called Postural Orthostatic
Tachycardia Syndrome,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.620
which basically means when I'm upright,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.580
my heart rate goes up really fast.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.670
So that's why, you know, if
I'm using my transport chair,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.840
it's a lot easier for me
to go out and do things.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.673
- Right.

00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:43.610
- Second is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.160
and then the third one you
probably know, narcolepsy.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.700
- Thank you for sharing that.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.223
I appreciate it.
(Bjork laughs)

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.780
I am sweating.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.490
I'm nervous, and I'm anxious,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.460
and this is a lot.
(Bjork laughs)

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.700
Hello.
- Hi.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.300
- How's it going?
- It's good.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.540
I don't want you to be nervous.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.950
I guarantee you, there's
nothing you're gonna ask me

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.190
that hasn't been asked or said.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.814
- Do you have many limitations?

00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:10.790
(woman laughs)

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.040
- My personality, I'm gonna say no.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.470
I can do anything I wanna do.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.140
I've been living with
this for like, 38 years.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.050
So I don't know any different.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.670
- Were you teased when you were younger?

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.830
- Severely.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.950
- Do you feel like people

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.970
with your disability are commonly teased?

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.500
- I think because there
is a stereotype around it,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.500
you do hear a lot of jokes from
comedians, from television.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.640
It really paints this disability
in a really bad light.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.690
- Oh, is it Tourette's?

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.340
That's just what comes
to mind because of what

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.590
you're explaining, but I
wouldn't have thought that.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.324
So, did I guess you right?

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.040
- You did guess it right!

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.570
- I would have never
thought with what I know

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.160
from TV and movies and all that stuff.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.330
- What do you know from TV and movies?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.040
- Just the way it's depicted,
it's like, you know,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.540
blurting out random stuff.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.107
Not at all, like, not at all.

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:08.053
- I'm holding back my tics a little.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.788
When I leave here, I'm gonna
let loose and just not.

00:05:11.788 --> 00:05:12.621
(Bjork laughs)

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.430
So like, when you were saying limitations,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.320
like, going to the movies, for example.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.200
I love to go to the movies,
but I don't go by myself,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.143
'cause I've been kicked
out of a theater before.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.130
Medications don't work well for me.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.340
I end up with every side effect.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.980
And so, it's kind of a question
of, do I take the medication

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.880
to make the world comfortable.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.713
- Or do I not?

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:37.210
- Or do I not take it,
and I'm comfortable?

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.810
- Well, thank you for
educating me on that,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.390
because I just, I can't get over that.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.370
Like, completely.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.203
- Different.

00:05:45.203 --> 00:05:47.520
- Different than what
I thought or imagined.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.466
So, I'm so grateful, thank you.

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:52.270
Thank you so much.
- Mmhmm.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.040
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.463
- How's it going?
- Good.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.350
- [Bjork] So nice to meet you.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.500
Bjork, what was your name again?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.333
- Emilina.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:00.990
- Emilina, beautiful name.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.430
All right, so, you're wheelchair-bound.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.670
Have you been this way your whole life?

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.393
- Actually, what do you mean by this way?

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.930
- Have you not been able to walk

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.910
your whole life is what I mean.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.260
- There was a small window
where I was able to walk,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.723
but I've always had a disability.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.790
- Okay.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.990
Does this have to do
with your spine at all?

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.970
- Yes.
- It does?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.110
I think I know what this is,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.010
but I can't remember what it's called.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.870
- No, but I just, I feel
like I know this one

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.330
for the first time since I
started this whole thing,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.630
and so I feel like I want to be right.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.970
I'm so blanking on the word.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.312
It's like, hurting my feelings.

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:47.950
(Bjork laughs)

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.400
- You're not hurting my
feelings if you don't remember.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.520
- Thank you so much.
(Bjork laughs)

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.400
I think you have a problem
with your spinal cord?

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.640
- Is that your final answer?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.720
- Yes.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.220
- I was born with spina bifida.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.092
- Yes, that's what I thought.

00:07:02.092 --> 00:07:02.925
(Emilina laughs)

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:03.758
Give me an example of some

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:05.430
of the stupidity that you encounter.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.560
(Emilina laughs)

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.550
I do makeup and I'm a voice actor.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.440
I get a lot of, how do you
do makeup from a chair?

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.120
- What?
(Bjork laughs)

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.670
- Really?

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.835
How do you do voiceovers sitting down?

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:23.803
I wasn't aware that I
needed my butt up, you know?

00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:26.610
- They're like, almost
limiting you, you know?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.180
It's like, they put those limits on you.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.013
- [Emilina] Right.

00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:30.846
- Right?

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:32.327
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.910
(Bjork laughs)

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.840
- Hello.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.673
- I'm Sean.

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:40.380
- I'm Bjork, nice to meet you.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.680
Is it more of like an internal thing?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.800
- It's an internal thing.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.470
- What do you do for work?

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.700
- I am a mechanic now.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.640
- Where did you used to work before?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.410
- I worked in the Air Force.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.110
- You were in the Air Force?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.390
PTSD?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.223
- Why do you say that?

00:07:55.223 --> 00:07:56.650
- Just like being in that environment

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.023
I feel like can cause PTSD.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.090
- Being at home can cause PTSD.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.970
- I guess that's true.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.850
That's fair.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.310
Okay, I don't know, that's
still my final guess,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.508
just because I don't know.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:08.341
(Sean laughs)

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:09.740
Okay, so I know I got you wrong.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.573
- No, you got me right.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:11.511
- Oh, I did?

00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:12.344
- Yeah, you were absolutely right.

00:08:12.344 --> 00:08:13.177
- Oh.

00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:15.873
- I have physical triggers,
which are loud noises,

00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:17.810
and then I have subconscious triggers,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.680
which I didn't even know that
I had until late last year.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.260
So if I'm driving in the car, and the sun

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.600
is coming through the window just right

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.860
and it heats the side of my
face, I'm back in Afghanistan.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.693
- Wow.

00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:31.430
- So for years, I thought
I was just going crazy,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.330
until, you know, I see a
psychiatrist in a VA hospital.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.277
- [Bjork] Yeah.

00:08:35.277 --> 00:08:36.110
- And so, you know,
this is because of this,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.430
and this is because of this.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.404
- Thank you for sharing.

00:08:38.404 --> 00:08:39.492
(Sean laughs)

00:08:39.492 --> 00:08:40.641
- Nice to meet you.

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:41.880
- Nice to meet you, I'm Bjork.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.930
- I'm Gray.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.046
- Let's start with your
social interactions.

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:47.206
- Ah, what social interactions?

00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:48.750
- Do you not have social interactions?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.010
- Very, very little.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.953
- Because of pain or just your heart?

00:08:53.953 --> 00:08:55.040
(Bjork laughs)

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.000
- It's pain mostly, but
there is a lot of fatigue.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.080
- Were you born with this, or no?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.130
- Huh, I'm gonna say yes,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.550
and the reason it's a little unclear

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.100
is there's not a ton of
research behind that.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.283
- Is it something that only affects women?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.500
- Men do not have the necessary organs

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.910
for this to happen to them.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.320
- Is it endometriosis?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.700
Because I know there's not
too much research about it,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.160
and men don't have the organs,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.988
so I imagine that it
would be some lady bits.

00:09:22.988 --> 00:09:24.060
(Bjork laughs)

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.130
Did I guess you right or wrong?

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.920
- You got me right, which
was like, I was shocked.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.990
Medical professionals
don't even know what it is.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.823
- Right.

00:09:31.823 --> 00:09:34.590
- They think that if you have a baby,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.293
it will cure your endometriosis.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.480
- What?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.440
- This is still being told.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.490
In fact, I've heard
about an 18-year-old girl

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.100
who was told to get pregnant.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.050
A lot of women, when they're pregnant,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.700
they often don't have as many symptoms,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.880
mostly because they're not on their cycle.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.070
And then my other favorite
is having a hysterectomy,

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.945
'cause that'll cure it too,
which is also not true.

00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:57.778
- Wow.

00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:01.080
- Yeah, 'cause endometriosis
is not inside the uterus.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.913
- Oh.

00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:05.280
- It grows on the organs
outside the uterus.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.550
And so, pregnancy, hysterectomy,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.370
no, that doesn't cure endometriosis.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.440
There is no cure.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.840
- That's crazy.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.673
- Tada!

00:10:13.673 --> 00:10:15.435
(both laughing)

00:10:15.435 --> 00:10:16.435
- Oh my God.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.023
I can't imagine that.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.930
- I feel like I learned a lot.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.970
I felt like I was pretty
uneducated on like,

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.503
just different disabilities,
and I get anxious, and so,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.995
it's happening now, but
yeah, I have severe anxiety.

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:39.412
(Bjork sobs)

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.923
- I don't know.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.330
I never have, but it is something

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.960
that keeps me away from a lot, like,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.240
just affects how I
work, and I've left jobs

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.213
because I just get too
overwhelmed or things like that.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.380
So, yeah, I mean, it affects my life,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.020
but I guess I just feel like
some people have it worse

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.223
than me, and so I don't, I
just never considered it that.

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:14.521
(crew applauds)

00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:17.104
(Bjork laughs)
