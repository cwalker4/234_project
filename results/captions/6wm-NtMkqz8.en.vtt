00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.940
So the wall will get built,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.360
but we may not, we may not
have an agreement today.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.130
We probably won't.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.800
But we have an agreement
on other things

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.730
that are really good.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.350
Nancy, would you like
to say something?

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.770
-Oh, thank you Mister President

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.600
for the opportunity
to meet with you,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.050
so that we can work together
in a bipartisan way

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.510
to meet the needs
of the American people.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.820
I think the American
people recognize

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.010
that we must
keep government open.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.830
That a shutdown
is not worth anything.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.660
And that you should not have
a Trump shutdown.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.830
You have the White House --
-A what?

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.580
You said Trump?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.660
-A Trump shutdown.
-Oh.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.670
-You have the White House.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.480
-Now it's gonna go
all over the place.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.800
-You have the Senate.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.970
You have the house
of Representatives.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.750
You have the votes.
You should pass it right now.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.850
-No, we don't have the votes,
Nancy,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.610
because in the Senate
we need 60 votes.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.820
-No, no, but in the House.
-And we don't have --

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.890
-And you could bring it up
right now today--

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.530
-Yeah, but I can't -- excuse me.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.380
But I can't get it passed in
the House if it's not gonna pass

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.470
in the Senate,
I don't want to waste time.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.840
-Well, the fact is you can get
it started that way.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.200
-The House we could get passed
very easily and we do.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.140
-Okay, then do it.
-But the problem is the Senate,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.230
because we need 10 Democrats
to vote and they won't vote.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.490
-That's not the point,
Mister President.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.170
The point is, is that
their equity is to be weighed.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.240
And we're here to have
a conversation the careful way,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.560
so I don't think
we should have a debate

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.600
in front of the Press on this.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.570
But, the fact is the Senate --
the House Republicans

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.270
could bring up this bill
if they had the votes,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.490
immediately and set the town
for what you want.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460
-If we thought we were gonna
get it passed in the Senate,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.220
Nancy,
we would do it immediately.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.900
We'd get it passed very easily
in the House.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.520
-No, that's not the point.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.590
-Nancy, I'd have it passed
in two seconds.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.540
It doesn't matter though,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.190
because we can't get it passed
in the Senate

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.910
because we need
10 Democrat votes.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.410
That's the problem.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.090
-Again, let us have
our conversation

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.050
and then we can meet
with the Press again,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.170
but the fact
is is that legislating,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.730
which is what we do,
you begin, you make your point,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.360
you state your case,
that's what the House

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.520
of Republicans
could do, if they had the votes.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.140
But there are no votes
in the House,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.980
majority votes for a wall.
No matter where you start.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.090
-That's exactly right,
you don't have the votes.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.300
-You don't have the votes.
-If I needed the votes

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.250
for the wall in the House,
I would have them

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.280
in one session,
it would be done.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.420
-Well then, go do it.
-It doesn't help

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.380
because we need
10 Democrats in the Senate.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.170
-No, don't put it on the Senate,
put it on the negotiation.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.350
-Okay, let me ask you this,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.450
and we're doing this
in a very friendly manner.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.020
It doesn't help for me
to take a vote in the House,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.130
where I will win easily
with the Republicans.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.630
-It will not win.
-It doesn't help

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.880
to take that vote,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.710
because I'm not gonna get
the vote of the Senate,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.690
I need 10 Senators,
that's the problem.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.750
-Mister President, you have
the White House,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.370
you have the Senate, you have
the House of Representatives --

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.650
-I have the White House,
the White House is done.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.950
And the House would give me
the vote if I wanted it.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.760
But I can't because I need,
Nancy,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.920
I need 10 votes from Chuck.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.390
-Mister President let me
say something here.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.210
-Mister President,
let me undermi--

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.600
let me just say one thing.
-All right.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.130
-The fact is you do not have
the votes in the House.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.550
-Nancy, I do.
And we need border security.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.470
-Let's take the vote
and we'll find out.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.170
-Nancy, we need border security,
it's very simple.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.130
-Of course we do.
-We need border security.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.240
People are pouring into our
country, including terrorists.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.800
We have terrorists.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.940
We have caught 10 terrorists
over the last --

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.160
very short period of time.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.560
Ten!
These are very serious people.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.980
Our border agents,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.150
all of our law enforcement
has been incredible,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.640
what they've done,
but we caught 10 terrorists.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.260
These are people
that were looking to do harm.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.340
We need the wall.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.250
We need -- more important
than anything --

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.330
we need border security of which
the wall is just a piece.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.090
But it's important, Chuck,
did you want to say something?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.970
-Yeah, here's what
I want to say.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.070
We have a lot
of disagreements here.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.550
The Washington Post today,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.120
gave you a whole lot
of Pinocchios

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.150
because they say
you constantly mis-state

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.040
how much the wall is --
how much of the wall is built

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.660
and how much is there,
but that's not the point here.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.910
We have a disagreement
about the wall,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.440
whether it's effective or not.
-The Washington Post.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.710
Not on border security,
but on the wall.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.330
We do not want to shutdown
the government.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.560
You have called 20 times
to shutdown the government.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.000
You say, "I want to shut down
the government."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.750
We don't.
We want to come to an agreement.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.080
if we can't come to an agreement
we have solutions

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.430
that will pass the House
and Senate right now,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.860
and we'll not shutdown
the government

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.900
and that's what we're
urging you to do.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.950
Not threaten to shutdown the
government, because you can --

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.280
-You don't want to shutdown
the government, Chuck.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.580
-Let me just finish --
cause you can't get your way.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.700
-Let time you shut it
down you got killed.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.630
-Yeah, let me just say
something,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.020
Mister President, you just say,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.970
"My way or we'll shutdown
the government."

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.400
We have a proposal that with
Democrats and Republicans

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.150
will support to do a CR

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.610
that will not shutdown
the government.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.630
We urge you to take it.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.570
-And if it's not good border
security, I won't take it.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.180
-It's very good border security.
-And if it's not good

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.970
border security,
I won't take it.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.210
-It's what the bor--
-'Cause when you look

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.500
at these numbers

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.560
of the effectiveness
of our border security,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.610
and when you look at the job

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.880
that we're doing
with our military.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.800
-You just said it is effective.
-Can I be --

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.630
Can I tell you something?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.730
-Yeah, you just said
it's effective.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.390
-Without a wall --

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.970
these are only areas
where you have the walls.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.400
-We want to the s--
-Where you have walls,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.520
Chuck, it's effective.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.800
Where you don't have walls,
it is not effective.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.260
-Let's call a halt in it.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.640
We've come in here,
the first branch of government.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.070
Article One,
the legislative branch.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.310
We're coming in, in good faith,
to negotiate with you

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.100
about how we can keep
the government open.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.590
-Open.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.890
-We're gonna keep it open
if we have border security.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.820
If we don't have
border security, Chuck,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.160
we're not gonna keep it open.
-I'm with you.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.250
We are gonna
have border security.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.160
-And it's the same bord--
You're bragging

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.070
about what has been done.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.170
-By us.
-We want to do the same thing

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.900
we did last year, this year.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.010
That's our proposal.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.120
If it's good then,
it's good now,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.520
and it won't shutdown
the government.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.170
-Chuck, we can build a much
bigger section with more money.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.810
-Let's debate, let's debate
in private, okay?

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.330
-Okay.
-Yeah, let's debate in private.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.170
-Okay.
-We have taken this conversation

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.650
to a place that is devoid,
frankly of fact.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.730
And we can dispel that.
-We need border security.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.830
I think we all agree
that we need

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.170
border security, is that right?
-Yes, we do.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.890
-Good.
-We do.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.960
-See?
We get along.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.580
-Thank you, everybody.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.440
-You say border security
and the wall,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.830
can you have border security
without the wall?

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.460
-You need the wall.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.850
The wall is a part of security.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.400
-Are you redefining what it
means to have border security?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.080
-Yes.
-We need border security,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.720
the wall is a part
of border security.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.260
You can't have a very
good border security

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.230
without the wall, no.
-That is strictly not true.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.080
That is a political promise.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.790
Border security is a way

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.550
to effectively honor
our responsibility t--

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.720
-And the experts say you can do
border security without a wall,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.220
which is wasteful
and doesn't solve the problem.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.860
-It totally solves the problem.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.370
And it's very important.
-But I don't want to take this.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.960
Unfortunately this has
spiraled downward,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.280
when we came at a place to say,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.620
how do we meet the needs of the
American people, who have needs.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.220
The economy has --
people are losing their jobs,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.900
the market's in a mood.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.090
Our members are left--

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.530
-Well, we have
the lowest unemployment

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.010
that we've had in 50 years.
-Okay.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.590
-Fifty people of the
Republican party have lost --

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.250
are losing their offices now
because of the transition.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.310
People are not,
the morale is not up.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.560
-And we've gained in the Senate.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.210
Nancy, we've gained
in the Senate.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.150
Excuse me, did we win
the Senate?

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.250
We won the Senate.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.520
-When the President brags that
he won North Dakota and Indiana,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.290
he's in real trouble.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.600
-I did.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.350
We did win North Dakota
and Indiana.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.770
-This is the most
important thing.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.770
We came in here in good faith
and we are entering into a,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.560
this kind of a discussion
in the public view.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.700
-But it's not bad, Nancy.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.320
It's called transparency.
-I know.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.530
But it's not transparency

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.620
when we're not stipulating
to a set of facts.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.020
And when we want to have
a debate with you

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.270
about saying we confront
some of these facts,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.180
without saying
to the public, this isn't true.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.760
-You know what,
we need border security.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.120
That's what we're gonna be
talking about, border security.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.480
If we don't have border security
we'll shutdown the government.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.230
This country
needs border security.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.630
-We agree to that.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.380
-The wall is a part
of border security.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.150
-Not the wall.
-Let's have a talk.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.200
We're gonna get the wall built,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.610
and we've
done a lot of wall already.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.500
-How big a part of border
security is the wall?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.080
-It's a big sec--
it's a big part of it.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.420
-Is it everything that you need?
-It's a big part of it.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.420
We need to have effective
border security.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.560
We need a wall in certain parts,
no not in all parts,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.540
but in certain parts

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.910
of a 2,000-mile border,
we need a wall.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.770
-How much money?

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.340
-Uh, we are doing it
much under budget.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.110
We're actually way under budget
on the areas

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.710
that we've renovated
and areas that we've built.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.290
I would say if we got,
if we got $5 billion

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.550
we could do
a tremendous chunk of wall.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.120
-Are you willing to accept
less, though?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.470
-Well, we're gonna see,
we're gonna see.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.540
Look, we have to have the wall.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.380
This isn't a question,
this is a national emergency.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.450
Drugs are pouring
into our country.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.920
People with tremendous medical
difficulty and medical problems

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.840
are pouring into and, in many,
may cases it's contagious.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.510
They're pouring
into our country.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.010
We have to have border security.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.370
We have to have a wall
as part of border security.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.360
And I don't think
we really disagree so much.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.280
I also know that, you know,
Nancy's in a situation

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.200
where it's not easy for her
to talk right now.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.230
And I understand that.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.740
And I fully understand that.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.460
We're gonna have
a good discussion

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.990
and we're gonna see
what happens.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.490
But we have to have
border security.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.200
-Mister President, please don't
characterize the strength

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.910
that I bring to this meeting

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.580
as the leader
of the House Democrats,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.840
who just won a big victory.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.580
-Elections have consequences,
Mister President.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.260
-That's right.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.570
And that's why the country
is doing so well.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.560
-Let me just say this, what the
president is representing

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.200
the terms on his cards
over there are not factual.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.500
We have to have
an evidence-based conversation

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.150
about what does work,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.800
what money has been spent,
and how effective it is.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.030
This isn't deba-- This is about
the security of our country.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.850
We take an oath to protect
and defend.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.310
And we don't want to have
that mischaracterized by anyone.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.510
-I agree with that.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.200
No, no I agree with that.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.220
-So let us have a conversation
where we don't have to

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.160
contradict,
in public,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.250
the statistics
that you put forth.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.210
But instead can have
a conversation

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.830
about what will really work

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.610
and what the American people
deserve from us

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.120
at this uncertain time
in their lives --

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.770
-One thing I think
we can agree on

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.510
is we shouldn't shutdown
the government over a dispute.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:28.720
-Yes.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.420
-And you want to shut it down,
you keep talking about it.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.020
-I want -- no, no, no.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.710
The last time, Chuck,
you shut it down.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.330
-No, no, no.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.180
-And then you opened it up
very quickly.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.660
-Twenty times.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.810
-And I don't want to do
what you did.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.230
-Twenty times.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.500
Twenty times
you have called for it.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.910
-Chuck.
-I will shutdown the government

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.170
if I don't get my wall.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.710
None of us of have said --
-You want to know something?

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.140
-You've said it.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.840
-Okay, you want to
put that on my -- -You said it.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.170
-I'll take it.
-Okay, good.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.300
-You know what I'll say?

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.760
Yes, if we don't get what
we want one way or the other,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.990
whether it's through you,
through military,

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.790
through anything
you want to call,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.580
I will shutdown the government,
absolutely.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.870
-Okay, fair enough.
We disagree.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.260
-And I am proud.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.810
-We disagree.
-I'll tell you what, I am proud

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.750
to shutdown the government
for border security, Chuck.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.870
Because the people of this
country don't want criminals

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.480
and people
that have lots of problems

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.230
and drugs
pouring into our country.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.300
So, I will take the mantle.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.980
I will the one to shut it down.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.360
I'm not gonna blame you for it.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360
The last time, you shut it down,
it didn't work.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.200
I will take the mantle
of shutting down.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.520
-That is no--

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.830
-And I'm gonna shut it down
for border security.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.590
-But we believe you
shouldn't shut it down.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.030
-Okay.
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.230
[indistinct chatter]

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.240
-Press, let's go,
make your way out.
