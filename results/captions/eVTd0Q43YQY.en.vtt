00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:03.842
(strumming guitar music)

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.046
- There's a Mustang.

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:21.061
There's some pickup truck cabs.

00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.396
Oh yeah, there's some stuff there.

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:26.128
'57 Ford. Some kind of convertible.

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:26.961
Oh yeah!

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:30.402
This is all a result

00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:32.702
of talking to a guy

00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:34.148
while we're eating lunch.

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:35.926
We were having lunch at a deli.

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:39.623
This is the fourth location
that he's turned us on to.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.040
We had no idea who he was and

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:44.802
look at another Starliner.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:46.135
A '60 Starliner.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.403
So Tom Cross doesn't know about this.

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:51.409
I gotta check this out.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.992
(lively music)

00:00:59.078 --> 00:01:00.898
Pretty good stuff here.

00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:02.242
We wouldn't even know about this

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:05.938
if we hadn't talked to that guy at lunch.

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:07.415
I called him up last night and thanked him

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.182
and I'm gonna do it again today.

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:11.855
But now we're gonna go see a guy

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.182
who we heard about yesterday.

00:01:13.182 --> 00:01:16.375
We made an appointment to
go back and visit today.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.264
Boy, these roads are rough.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:22.931
And this is where our
first stop's gonna be.

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:32.677
So what we try to do in the show,

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:33.677
give people encouragement

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.548
that there's still old cars to be found.

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:37.793
Well, let's see what
you have if that's okay.

00:01:37.793 --> 00:01:39.992
- Well, we can work inside
or we can start outside.

00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:43.242
Yeah, I got a '47 International pickup,

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:45.812
firetruck.

00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:47.027
- Wow, this is quite a building.

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:48.194
Holy mackerel.

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:50.995
Is this where you live when
your wife kicks you out?

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:53.002
- Oh yeah. No, I live in the house.

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.181
(laughs)

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.495
It's still a work in progress,

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:59.078
But I have a upstairs loft with

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:02.073
just a place to gather and everything.

00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:03.694
Pool table, bar,

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:05.547
work out place over here on this side.

00:02:05.547 --> 00:02:06.762
But right now it's full of junk.

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:07.960
You know how it is.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.584
And I'm still working on it

00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:11.261
day by day you know how it goes.

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:14.022
- So tell me about this fire truck

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:16.412
- It's a '47 International.

00:02:16.412 --> 00:02:18.143
We go to car shows and stuff.

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.672
We don't have anywhere to sit
and eat except for in chairs

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.187
so I'm gonna make a bar
over on that side there with

00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.024
some stools, swivel stools

00:02:26.024 --> 00:02:27.103
that way I have a place

00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:27.936
I'm gonna put umbrellas on it

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:30.452
and all that, but it's still
gonna look like a fire truck.

00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:32.535
It's actually an '85 Ford

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:36.478
E-350 ambulance chassis.

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:39.909
So the engine bay and
everything offset in there

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.283
which worked out good

00:02:41.283 --> 00:02:44.462
because of the power
breaks and everything.

00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:45.526
- So is it diesel?

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:47.840
- It's gotta 464 in it.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.837
- Geez.

00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:49.670
- Yeah.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.707
- So it's automatic,

00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:52.155
a big block with automatic power steering.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:53.619
- Yup.

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.359
- In the fact that the
engine's offset makes this

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.192
- Made it easier
- brake

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:57.025
- for the power brake booster
- booster.

00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:58.004
- and everything.

00:02:58.004 --> 00:02:58.953
- It worked out great.

00:02:58.953 --> 00:03:00.260
- Of course you know I
hadda build the firewall

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.818
and everything because
it had sinken into it.

00:03:02.818 --> 00:03:04.427
But I still got plenty of
leg room and everything

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:06.760
as far as how I built it anyways so.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.229
- Yup.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.170
- But you know I'm trying to fix up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.003
the inside a little bit

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:11.442
(Tom laughs)

00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:12.621
- That's cool, man.

00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:13.521
- And this roads tires

00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:14.354
- Did you build this?

00:03:14.354 --> 00:03:15.187
- Yes.

00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:16.939
A friend of mine had it.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.695
- I'm looking at this.
I'm looking at this.

00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:20.594
That's pretty cool stuff connecting rods.

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:22.320
- Well, this is where
they chopped the top at.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.241
I didn't do the chop.

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:25.368
It's kind of rough and everything

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:27.782
and I wanted a way to kind of mask it.

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:28.615
- So that's your idea?

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:29.448
- That's my idea.

00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:30.762
I just used some copper wire.

00:03:30.762 --> 00:03:32.387
I stripped the insulation off of it

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:34.325
and I just weaved it in and out of it.

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:35.572
- Man.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:36.546
- It's a tool theme.

00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:38.496
We work in oil field around here.

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:39.329
I got a tool theme on it.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.146
I got all kinds of tools. Sockets.

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:42.837
- Alright. So I saw the
stuff in your backyard.

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:44.633
- Yeah, let's go to the backyard.

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:46.899
We can check that out for sure.

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.998
- So we're going to see Roland's tomorrow.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.395
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Mustang guy.

00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:53.787
And then you got a guy
right on the corner,

00:03:53.787 --> 00:03:55.248
right behind you here?

00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:56.688
- Yeah. Yeah.
- With some Mustangs?

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:58.464
I haven't talked to him yet

00:03:58.464 --> 00:03:59.498
- So out here I've got

00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:02.942
of course we have the
old chassis for that '63.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.128
That belongs to a friend of mine.

00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:05.554
And I got an old T-Bucket here.

00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:07.203
I guess about a '26.

00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:09.193
It's in real rough shape.

00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:10.679
Got a frame for it and everything.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.294
It's gonna be a true rat rod.

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.501
I got a little V6 came out
of an S10 I wanna put in it.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:16.745
- So you're going to build this?

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:17.934
- Yeah, eventually.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:21.217
- Alright. So that's not a T frame though.

00:04:21.217 --> 00:04:23.290
That's not a Ford frame.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.123
- The bottom one innit.

00:04:24.123 --> 00:04:25.957
This one is. It's original to the--

00:04:25.957 --> 00:04:26.790
- This one.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.623
- Yeah, and that ones not.

00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:29.587
It's a home-made frame.

00:04:29.587 --> 00:04:30.475
- But this ones not.

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:32.266
Because Ford never had steering like that.

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:33.099
- Really?

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.290
- They never had leaf spring.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.660
That could be a Chevy frame.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.915
That ain't a Ford frame.

00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:38.081
- They told me it was a--

00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.924
- A Ford frame woulda hadda

00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:41.853
a leaf spring running across the side

00:04:41.853 --> 00:04:43.691
and bolting underneath here.

00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.115
- Cool. Good to know.

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:46.155
- But what difference it make?

00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:47.371
A rat rod this...

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:50.337
- Got a '53 model Plymouth Cambridge.

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:52.094
Got a flat-head six in it

00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:53.175
It actually runs.

00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:54.008
- Oh really?

00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:55.616
- To be honest with ya.

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:56.473
But I've had it so long,

00:04:56.473 --> 00:04:57.837
it's just sittin' out here.

00:04:57.837 --> 00:04:59.554
I paid a thousand dollars for that car.

00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:01.188
I hadn't never done anything with it.

00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:02.373
I've had it for over two years

00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:04.108
and just been sittin' here.

00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:05.595
Everything's still six volt.

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:06.683
- I wonder if you can
just make it road legal

00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:07.872
the way it is.

00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:09.371
- Yeah, you can.

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.305
- You'd get a lot of
attention at the car show.

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:14.679
- I actually have a van over here

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:16.552
that I was gonna put that body on

00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:17.508
and put the air conditioning

00:05:17.508 --> 00:05:19.177
and the dash and everything,

00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:20.738
incorporate it in here.

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:22.563
But I decided against that

00:05:22.563 --> 00:05:24.361
and like you said, I
think I'm gonna try to,

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:25.194
one of these days,

00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:26.408
just get it back together the way it is

00:05:26.408 --> 00:05:27.241
and just drive the way it is--

00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:28.074
- So it's got three on the column?

00:05:28.074 --> 00:05:29.452
- Yeah, three on the tree

00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:31.411
- And if you went through the
hydraulic brakes and stuff,

00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:32.509
I bet you can make it a good car.

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.343
- Oh, yeah. Of course
you'll have to go through

00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:36.516
all the brakes and all that and

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:37.681
- Yeah, this thing is

00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:38.514
- And course the window.

00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:40.116
I got the window in the back seat.

00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:40.949
- Oh, no kidding.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.947
- Yeah, it lying back here in the back.

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:45.654
I think these two windows
need to be replaced

00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:48.122
but they're flat so
they'll be easy to cut.

00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:49.680
- Alright. Whaddya got a '40?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.785
- Yeah, over here I gotta

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:51.793
it's a '40 model--

00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:52.626
- Pontiac?
- Pontiac

00:05:52.626 --> 00:05:53.705
- Silver Streak Deluxe.

00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:56.216
- So you're neighbor's
got a '40 Pontiac Coupe.

00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:57.049
Aubrey.

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:58.670
- Yeah, that's a little hot rod style

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.503
and everything.

00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:00.486
- Right.

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:01.796
- Actually, he still has the engine

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:02.949
and everything that this one does.

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.379
It's all locked up.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.626
And I got it from him.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:06.459
And this one,

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:08.273
the interior's all original.

00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:10.184
There some tore up stuff,

00:06:10.184 --> 00:06:12.082
but the headliner's still in it.

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:14.847
The seats are still good.

00:06:14.847 --> 00:06:15.680
- Oh yeah.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.996
- Suicide doors.

00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:20.152
Looks like cat's been in there. (laughs)

00:06:20.152 --> 00:06:23.554
But the material and
everything is still just...

00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:24.952
- 54 thousand miles.

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.762
- Still got the original
dash and everything.

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:27.851
The clock.

00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:28.970
Got all the bezels and everything--

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.128
- So that's never been a hot rod?

00:06:30.128 --> 00:06:30.961
- No.

00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:32.865
- That's the original car.

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.266
- The way it sits is the
way it's gonna be rollin'.

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.328
Once I get it goin'.

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:39.614
I have a 350 engine and
all that I wanna put in it.

00:06:39.614 --> 00:06:41.087
- On that chassis. Just
leave it the way it is.

00:06:41.087 --> 00:06:41.992
- And just leave it the way it is.

00:06:41.992 --> 00:06:44.374
Cause it's a stout chassis and all that.

00:06:44.374 --> 00:06:46.247
The big engine was in it.

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:48.080
It'll handle a 350.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.431
- This has been last on the road,

00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:50.917
I guess, in 2009

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:52.203
- Yeah.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.738
- That's a good selling point.
Apparently someone had it

00:06:53.738 --> 00:06:54.571
going and

00:06:55.694 --> 00:06:57.163
and of course I got everything to it.

00:06:57.163 --> 00:06:59.332
All the plates and everything.

00:06:59.332 --> 00:07:02.534
I have the original fuel tank in it, too.

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:03.367
Believe it or not

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:06.256
it's clear and free of rust.

00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:09.653
It's pretty and shiny as you
can see on the inside of it.

00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:11.226
I couldn't believe it.

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:12.481
This actually, this front end

00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:13.587
is just sitting on this.

00:07:13.587 --> 00:07:15.006
It's not bolted down.

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:16.101
The hood or anything.

00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:17.789
- So this car was tan originally.

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.055
- Apparently, it was tan, yes.

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.572
And someone has redone it.

00:07:21.572 --> 00:07:23.552
I did a little bit of work
to it on the back side.

00:07:23.552 --> 00:07:25.884
Took the back bumper off of it.

00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:27.559
Finished in the holes and everything on it

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:28.392
and all that

00:07:28.392 --> 00:07:29.853
and to make it smooth.

00:07:29.853 --> 00:07:31.047
I don't want any bumpers on 'em.

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.973
I think it takes away from the look of it.

00:07:33.973 --> 00:07:35.062
- And finally you have a

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:37.288
- A friend of mine has
this stored out here.

00:07:37.288 --> 00:07:38.121
It's a...

00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:41.449
I can't tell you what year model it is.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:42.313
I forgot.

00:07:42.313 --> 00:07:43.800
But it has a V6 in it.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.909
- That's a weird engine.

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:45.742
- Yup.

00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:50.237
He's got it stored out here really.

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.577
Just to help him out

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:53.797
because he don't have any place to put it

00:07:53.797 --> 00:07:55.916
and it's his grandpa's truck.

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:58.147
It's been in his family forever.

00:07:58.147 --> 00:07:59.393
- Well, that's cool.

00:07:59.393 --> 00:08:00.852
So nothing here's for sale.

00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:01.685
These are all projects.

00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:02.732
- No everything's for sale

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.815
(laughs)

00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:09.108
- I sell, trade, horse
trade, whatever, barter.

00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:10.266
- So someone might watch this

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:12.686
and wants to buy ones of these cars.

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:14.157
Give me a price on that.

00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:17.125
- This one here is far as I understand

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.805
is probably the way it sits,

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:22.268
it's probably a five to
seven thousand dollar car.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:23.426
- It's a '40 Pontiac.

00:08:23.426 --> 00:08:26.070
- '40 Pontiac. Silver Streak Deluxe.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.433
- So what do you want for that one?

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:29.268
Now that we know what you paid for it.

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:31.510
- I'd take any offer for right now

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.200
as far as I'm concerned.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.128
Someone wanted to give me
five hundred bucks for it

00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:35.961
I'd take it from 'em.

00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:36.794
- And you got a title for that?

00:08:36.794 --> 00:08:38.072
- Yeah. I got a clear title to it.

00:08:38.072 --> 00:08:39.936
It's a New Mexico title but it is a title.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:43.234
But I got clear titles
for all these vehicles.

00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:44.973
- So it's a running
car. Five hundred bucks.

00:08:44.973 --> 00:08:45.806
- Yeah.

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:46.639
- Shoo!

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:47.472
- It's crazy.

00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:48.582
Wow. Can I drive it
back to North Carolina?

00:08:48.582 --> 00:08:49.415
- Yeah.

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:50.248
(laughs)

00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:51.424
Just jump in it and go.

00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:53.508
But this is about all my junk I got.

00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:54.341
- That's cool.
As far as cars

00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:56.044
and chassis and stuff.

00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:58.570
- You are the second person we've met

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.907
from Dennis yesterday, just
meeting him in the diner,

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:01.907
in the deli.

00:09:02.774 --> 00:09:03.894
- Dennis's a great guy.

00:09:03.894 --> 00:09:04.744
- Great guy.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.008
He went home and went
through his phone book

00:09:06.008 --> 00:09:07.416
and says yeah, this guy, this guy.

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:09.220
He starts sending me these names.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.053
Thanks for seeing us

00:09:10.053 --> 00:09:11.716
on Sunday afternoon, man.
- You bet.

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:12.549
- Thank you.

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:13.382
- No problem. Thank you.

00:09:13.382 --> 00:09:14.882
- This is a blast.

00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:17.410
This is Jeff Roland, guys.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.289
Can you guide us around

00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:20.112
and tell us what's going on here?

00:09:20.112 --> 00:09:21.231
So did you build this?

00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:22.064
- Yeah.

00:09:22.064 --> 00:09:25.136
(engine rumbles)

00:09:25.136 --> 00:09:26.680
- We've gotta see the helicopter.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.800
Oh, that's huge.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.633
I wanna buy this one.

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:30.251
What would you say?

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:31.679
25 hundred.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.535
I like that one. That's pretty cool.

00:09:33.535 --> 00:09:34.642
Okay, so where's this K-Code?

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.142
You have any idea?
