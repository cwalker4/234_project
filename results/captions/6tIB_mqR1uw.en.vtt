IN SCIENTOLOGY WE BELIEVE THAT

ALL ACCIDENTS AND ILLNESSES STEM

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:05.227 line:92%

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN I DID THE SECURITY

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:13.669 line:92%
CHECK, I THINK THE FIRST THING I

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.870 line:92%
WENT OVER WAS MY OWN SEXUALITY.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:17.639 line:92%
BUT I WOULD PUSH THOSE THOUGHTS

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:21.043 line:92%
DOWN AND I WOULD BE A GOOD

WITH HER HUSBAND WAS ROCKY AND

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:35.157 line:92%
SAYS SHE TURNED TO SCIENTOLOGY

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:36.558 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FOR HELP.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:37.225 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVERY TIME I TRY TO REACH OUT

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:38.894 line:92%

ME.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:47.269 line:92%

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:54.676 line:92%
BUT AFTER 14 YEARS, SHE HAD HAD

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:56.645 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ENOUGH.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.979 line:92%
SHE DEMANDED A DIVORCE, DESPITE

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:59.247 line:92%
THE CHURCH'S LACK OF SUPPORT.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:00.882 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I SAID, IF YOU DO NOT GET ME

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:02.985 line:92%
OUT OF SESSION AND START THIS

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.619 line:92%

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:25.687 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
INTRODUCED TO IT.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:26.555 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
AT WHAT AGE?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:27.322 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT 18.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:28.156 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AT 18.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.890 line:92%
YOU WRITE IN YOUR BOOK ABOUT

" --

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:36.364 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
"PERFECTLY CLEAR."

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:37.265 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S A PUN ON CLEAR AND LOVE

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:39.734 line:92%
MADE THINGS PERFECTLY CLEAR FOR

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.970 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ME.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:42.237 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WRITE ABOUT THE AUDITING

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:44.906 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
SESSIONS YOU DID.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.540 line:92%
THIS IS A PART OF SCIENTOLOGY,

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:47.742 line:92%
SAYS EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN A

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:48.843 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
PART OF IT.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:49.511 line:92%
WHAT IS AN AUDITING SESSION?

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:51.846 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU AND I ARE TALKING.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:53.315 line:92%
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS AND WHAT

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:55.917 line:92%
MAKES IT SO STRANGE IS THERE'S

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.719 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
AN E-METER.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:59.387 line:92%
IT'S A ROUND DIVORCE WITH AN

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.389 line:92%
ELECTRODE AND I WOULD BE HOLDING

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:03.959 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
CANS.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:04.426 size:88% position:44% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LIKE SOUP CANS?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.860 line:92%
THEY KIND OF LOOK LIKE THAT.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:07.295 line:92%
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES TO FIT

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:09.931 size:78% position:39% line:92%
DIFFERENT HAND SIZES.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:10.865 line:92%
AND YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:14.135 line:92%
E-METER AND YOU WOULD ASK ME A

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:16.004 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
QUESTION.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:16.371 line:92%
IF IT REACTED ON THE METER, YOU

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:18.073 line:92%
WOULD ASK ME MORE ABOUT THAT

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:19.774 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
QUESTION.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:20.141 line:92%
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A LIE DETECTOR

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.610 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
IS THE BEST WAY.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:23.578 line:92%
CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY BELIEVES

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:25.213 line:92%
THAT YOU HAVE SUBCONSCIOUS

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:27.249 line:92%
THOUGHTS THAT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:28.883 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
AWARE OF.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:30.885 line:92%
THIS METER IS TO HELP DETECT

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:32.687 line:92%
THOSE SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:36.291 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE SOUP CANS HAVE THE

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:37.926 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ANSWER.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.260 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:40.028 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
RIGHT NOW.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:40.495 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A LOT OF RELIGIONS HAVE WEIRD

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:42.264 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
BELIEFS.

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:42.597 line:92%
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:43.498 size:88% position:44% line:92%
THERE'S A DEBATE WHETHER

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:45.233 line:92%
SCIENTOLOGY IS A RELIGION AT

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:46.801 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ALL.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:47.202 line:92%
THE IRS IS SAYING THEY QUALIFY.

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:50.205 line:92%
YOU LIKED THE E-METER, RIGHT?

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:51.806 size:88% position:44% line:92%
YOU TALKED ABOUT FEELING

EUP

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:56.778 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EUPHORIC.

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:57.145 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I LIKED THE SESSION.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:57.746 line:92%
WHEN YOU'RE 18 YEARS OLD AND

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:59.581 line:92%
TRYING TO FIG YOURSELF OUT,

00:06:55.382 --> 00:07:00.382 line:92%
ANYONE YOU TALK TO, IT FEELS

00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:01.816 line:92%
GOOD TO TALK ABOUT YOURSELF OR

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:03.118 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
YOUR CONCERNS.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:04.085 line:92%
YOU FORGET THAT THE E-METER IS

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:06.421 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
THERE.

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:06.721 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND TO BE ACCEPTED, RIGHT?

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.790 size:88% position:44% line:92%
THESE ARE NOT JUDGMENTAL

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:10.425 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
SESSIONS.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:10.792 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:11.226 line:92%
YOU DON'T GET ANY OPINION IN THE

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:12.827 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
SESSION.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:13.161 size:88% position:44% line:92%
THEY ASK YOU A QUESTION.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.229 size:88% position:44% line:92%
YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION.

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:15.363 line:92%
AND THEN, THEY ASK YOU AN

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:17.832 line:92%
EARLIER TIME THAT THIS HAPPENED

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:18.833 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
TO YOU.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:19.434 line:92%
AND THEN, AN EARLIER TIME IT

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:21.202 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
HAPPENED.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.569 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY GIVE YOU USEFUL LIFE

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:23.672 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
TOOLS.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:24.972 line:92%
I HEARD THIS FROM A LOT OF

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.710 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EX-SCIENTOLOGISTS.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.210 line:92%
THE REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:31.212 line:92%
ATTRACTED TO SCIENTOLOGY, IS NOT

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:33.815 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ALL ODD STUFF.

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:35.983 line:92%
THE ADVICE IS PRACTICAL AND THEY

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:38.353 size:78% position:39% line:92%
HELP WITH YOUR LIVES.

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:40.422 line:92%
THIS IS PRACTICAL IF YOU'RE 18

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:43.425 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
AND 19 YEARS OLD.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.160 line:92%
AND THEY REQUIRE YOU TO WORK.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:47.028 line:92%
MOST RELIGIONS DON'T REQUIRE YOU

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:48.496 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
TO WORK FOR THEM.

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:49.331 line:92%
TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF WORK

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:51.299 size:88% position:44% line:92%
AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:53.635 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT DEPENDS.

IF YOU'RE IN THE C-WARD, YOU

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:58.606 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%

EFFORTS.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:21.262 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY DID.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.730 line:92%

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:26.488 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WAS GAY.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:27.755 line:92%
THE CHURCH DENIES ALL OF THIS.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.390 line:92%
YOU WERE MARRIED TO A MAN.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:30.859 line:92%
IT WAS A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP.

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:32.327 line:92%
AND YOU DECIDED YOU WANTED A

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:33.862 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
DIVORCE.

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:34.395 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:34.996 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU SAY YOU GOT CONSIDERABLE

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:37.098 line:92%
PUSHBACK FROM THE CHURCH ON THAT

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
REQUEST.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:39.033 line:92%
I MEAN, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO --

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:41.736 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
LISTEN.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.070 line:92%
I'M CATHOLIC, THEY'RE NOT IN

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:44.172 line:92%
FAVOR OF DIVORCE, EITHER.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:45.373 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:46.107 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.710 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
SCIENTOLOGY?

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:49.110 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I TRIED TO DIVORCE FIVE TIMES

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:51.546 size:88% position:44% line:92%
IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:52.847 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
MARRIAGE.

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:53.214 line:92%
EVERY TIME YOU GO IN, YOU'RE

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:54.949 line:92%
REQUIRED TO DO A MARRIAGE

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:56.184 line:92%
COURSE, WHICH IS MORE AUDITING,

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:58.386 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WITH YOUR PARTNER.

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:59.287 line:92%
AND THEN, AFTER THAT, YOU GO

00:10:56.256 --> 00:11:01.256 line:92%
THROUGH COUNSELING WITH THE

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.690 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
CHAPLAIN.

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:03.057 line:92%
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO, IF YOU

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:04.626 line:92%
MADE A COMMITMENT TO SOMEONE,

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:08.096 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WO

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:08.796 line:92%
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AGAINST THAT

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:09.898 line:92%
PERSON THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:11.032 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WANT TO LEAVE THEM?

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:12.433 line:92%
AND SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.370 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
COMMUNICATION?

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:15.803 line:92%
IT NEVER, FOR ME, WAS ABOUT WHAT

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:19.507 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WAS HE DOING TO ME.

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:20.808 line:92%
IT WAS, WHAT WAS I DOING OR

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:22.977 line:92%
WITHHOLDING FROM HIM THAT I

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:23.978 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WANTED TO LEAVE.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:24.579 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:26.681 size:78% position:39% line:92%
THAT'S ABOUT PERSONAL

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.950 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:29.417 size:88% position:44% line:92%
ALWAYS LOOK AT YOURSELF.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:30.585 line:92%
WHAT CAN I DO TO CHANGE MY

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:32.887 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:33.321 line:92%
HOW ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN YOUR

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:34.556 size:81% position:41% line:92%
MARRIAGE DID THEY GET?

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:35.456 size:81% position:41% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EVERY DETAIL.

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:36.324 line:92%
YOU CAN SAY THAT, AND THAT'S

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:37.825 line:92%
FINE IN A NORMAL MARRIAGE.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.160 line:92%
NOT WHEN YOU'RE BEING ABUSED.

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:40.562 line:92%
AND SO, WHEN YOU GO TO THE

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:42.163 line:92%
CHURCH AND ASK FOR HELP, AND

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:44.799 line:92%
THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:47.569 line:92%
DOING YOUR WIFELY DUTIES ENOUGH,

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:50.572 line:92%
AND SEND YOU BACK HOME TO HAVE A

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.440 line:92%
CHILD, THEN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.910 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
PROBLEM.

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:56.277 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WIFELY DUTIES MEANING SEX?

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:58.046 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:58.713 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY WOULD GET THAT INVOLVED.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:12:00.381 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:12:00.715 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EVERY DETAIL.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:04.819 line:92%
YOU CLAIM YOUR EX-HUSBAND -- HE

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:07.121 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ABUSED YOU?

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:08.289 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.990 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:10.658 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
REACH HIM.

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:11.192 line:92%
YOU DIDN'T REPORT THE ABUSE AT

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.460 line:92%
THE TIME TO THE AUTHORITIES.

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:18.366 line:92%
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO VERIFY

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:21.769 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
THAT.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:22.737 line:92%
THE CHURCH SAYS THEY HAVE A ZERO

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:25.506 line:92%
TOLERANCE POLICY ON PHYSICAL AND

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:27.241 line:92%
SEXUAL ABUSE AND REPORTS SUCH

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:29.877 line:92%
ABUSE WHEN REQUIRED BY LAW.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:31.112 line:92%
THEY'RE NOT BUYING THEY WERE

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:32.513 line:92%
EVER INFORMED OF ANY ABUSE IN

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:34.449 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
YOUR MARRIAGE.

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:34.983 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M NOT REALLY AWARE OF

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:36.718 line:92%
ANYTHING THAT THE CHURCH OF

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:38.653 line:92%
SCIENTOLOGY TAKES RESPONSIBILITY

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:40.254 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FOR.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:40.588 size:81% position:41% line:92%
THEY'RE BUILT ON LIES.

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:41.656 line:92%
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO SAY

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.890 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ANYTHING ELSE.

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:43.524 line:92%
YOU KNOW, I HAVE WITNESSES.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.260 line:92%
MY SISTER WITNESSED MANY THINGS.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:48.529 line:92%
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT WORKED FOR

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:51.866 size:75% position:38% line:92%
ME WITNESSED THINGS.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:53.267 line:92%
AND IT WAS NOT A GOOD LIFE TO

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:55.803 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
LIVE.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:56.104 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU -- AS WE DOCUMENT THE

00:12:56.743 --> 00:13:01.743 line:92%
PIECE, THE LIGHTBULB MOMENT

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:03.077 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
HAPPENS FOR YOU.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:03.578 line:92%
AND YOU REALIZE, I'M ATTRACTED

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:05.246 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:05.913 line:92%
AND I MIGHT BE A LESBIAN.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:06.948 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.120 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS, TOO, DID NOT GO OVER

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:14.389 size:78% position:39% line:92%
WELL IN THE CHURCH OF

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:15.923 line:92%
SCIENTOLOGY, AS YOU SAY IN THE

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:17.258 line:92%
BOOK, THAT L. RON HUBBARD WAS

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:19.861 size:81% position:41% line:92%
AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:20.928 line:92%
HE THOUGHT THAT HOMOSEXUALS WERE

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:23.231 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
CRIMINALS.

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:23.598 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:24.098 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CHURCH DENIES THAT, TOO.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:28.002 line:92%
THEY SAY CONTRARY TO THEIR

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:30.304 line:92%
CLAIMS, YOUR HOMOSEXUALITY WAS

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:32.407 line:92%
NEVER AN ISSUE WITH THE CHURCH.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:35.643 line:92%
BUT MICHELLE WAS INVOLVED IN

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:39.947 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
INFIDELITY.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:40.348 line:92%
WHAT DO YOU SAY WAS THE PUSHBACK

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.750 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
ON YOU BEING GAY?

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:43.951 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'M HOLDING BACK NOT REALLY

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:46.854 line:92%
LAUGHING AT THAT STATEMENT.

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:47.522 line:92%
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:49.857 line:92%
WHAT L. RON HUBBARD SAYS ABOUT

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
GAY PEOPLE.

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:53.561 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:55.997 line:92%
HE CONSIDERS THEM THE LOWEST OF

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:56.798 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
THE LOW.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:57.198 line:92%
HE FEELS THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:58.866 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
OUT OF SOCIETY.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.500 line:92%
HE STATES IT IN "DIANETICS."

00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:02.704 line:92%
HE STATES IT IN THE CHART OF

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:05.873 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
HUMAN EVALUATION.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:07.041 line:92%
I TRIED TO COME OUT AT 19.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:10.244 line:92%
I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:12.013 size:78% position:39% line:92%
RELATIONS WITH WOMEN.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.880 line:92%
AFTER I WAS DIVORCED, LEFT MY

00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:15.483 line:92%
EX, I FELL IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.820 line:92%
AND I KNEW THAT THAT WAS RIGHT

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:20.922 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FOR ME.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:21.789 line:92%
IT WAS THE GREATEST THING I'D

00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:23.925 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EVER KNOWN.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:25.626 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MICHELLE TALKS ABOUT HOW THE

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:27.195 line:92%
CHURCH ALLEGEDLY FORCED HER TO

00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:30.932 line:92%
GO AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO WERE

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:33.234 line:92%
STRANGERS TO HER WITHIN THE

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:34.469 line:92%
CHURCH, TO OFFER HER ATONEMENT

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:42.510 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.910 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE'RE BACK, NOW, WITH

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:44.178 line:92%
MICHELLE LeCLAIR, WHO WAS A

00:14:41.314 --> 00:14:46.314 line:92%
SCIENTOLOGIST FOR DECADES UNTIL

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:47.882 line:92%
SHE FINALLY LEFT THE CHURCH AND

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:49.817 line:92%
SAYS TROUBLE BEGAN FOR HER, AND

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:51.953 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
HOW.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.220 line:92%
BEFORE WE GET TO THE TROUBLE,

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:54.088 line:92%
WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT YOU WERE

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:58.259 line:92%
HAVING LESBIAN THOUGHTS, YOU SAY

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:59.594 size:84% position:42% line:92%
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH A

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.230 line:92%
MULTISTEP PROCESS TO ATONE FOR

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:03.731 line:92%
THOSE THOUGHTS, INCLUDING GOING

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.600 line:92%
AROUND TO PEOPLE WITHIN THE

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:06.501 size:84% position:42% line:92%
CHURCH AND APOLOGIZING?

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:07.935 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIGHT.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:08.569 line:92%
SO, THEY BELIEVED THAT I CHOSE

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:10.571 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
THE WRONG GROUP.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.840 line:92%
IF I WAS GOING TO TEND TO BE

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:14.342 line:92%
PART OF A GROUP THAT WAS SO LOW,

00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:16.544 line:92%
I HAD TO CHOOSE TO BE PART OF MY

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:20.047 line:92%
SCIENTOLOGY GROUP AGAIN AND I

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:23.417 line:92%
HAD TO ASK TO BE ACCEPTED.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:24.485 line:92%
I TOOK A LIABILITY FORMULA

00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:26.521 line:92%
AROUND WITH ALL OF THE DETAILS

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:27.889 line:92%
OF MY THOUGHTS AND I HAD TO WALK

00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:29.557 line:92%
UP TO YOU AND SAY, I AM IN

WAS DOING SOMETHING WRONG, THE

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:31.172 line:92%
MOMENT HE LEFT FOR EUROPE AND

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:32.807 line:92%
CAME BACK AND SAID, THE COMPANY

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:37.111 line:92%
WAS BANKRUPT, I DIDN'T GO TO

00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:37.812 line:92%
ANYBODY TO PROTECT MYSELF.

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:39.013 line:92%
I SET UP A TRUST FOR MY CLIENTS.

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:41.716 line:92%

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:51.392 line:92%
I LOST MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:52.693 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
