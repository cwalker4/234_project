00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.240
This is the iconic actor John Wayne,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.900
born Marion Robert Morrison on 26 May, 1907

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.440
in this modest four-room house

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.760
located at 216 Second Street,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.080
Winterset, Iowa.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.660
He was the oldest child of Clyde Leonard Morrison and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.720
Mary Alberta Brown Morrison.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.700
His father was a pharmacist

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.400
and his mother was a housewife.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.400
When Marion was four, his brother Robert was born.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.500
This is a picture of Marion, Robert, and their mother Mary.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.800
Now here they are with their father Clyde.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.360
When Marion was six, the family moved to southern California;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.960
Clyde had developed a lung condition, believed to have been tuberculosis,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.400
and needed to move to a drier climate.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.640
In 1916, the Morrison family was living at this location

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.740
at 404 North Isabel Street in Glendale.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.060
Morrison attended Wilson middle school.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.380
This is Morrison, Robert, and their parents,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.280
along with Duke, their Airedale Terrier.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.540
Marion always had Duke, his dog,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.760
with him wherever he went.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.480
On his way walking to school with Duke by his side,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.760
firemen at a local fire station began calling the pair

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.200
"Little Duke" and "Big Duke."

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.820
The nickname stuck, and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.160
everyone began referring to Marion as "Duke."

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.800
It is said that John Wayne kept this picture

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.940
on his wall of his den

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.200
at his home in Newport Beach for years.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.940
At the age of 12, Duke was delivering packages

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.700
for his father, who had opened a drugstore.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.720
He attended Glendale High School, making all As;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.960
where he had excelled in sport,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.300
and went in a football scholarship

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.000
to the University of Southern California.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.040
During his first year at college,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.440
his parents filed for divorce,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.340
and Duke was so angry with his parents

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.420
that he refused to return home during school break.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.900
Instead, his coach, Howard Jones,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.720
arranged a job for Duke at Fox Studios.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.260
Coach Jones would exchange tickets to football games

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.900
to stars and studio executives

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.260
if they would hire his players

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.340
part-time to supplement their scholarships.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.720
Duke was assigned as a prop man,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.660
moving furniture around on movie sets,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.780
and then later

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.320
he was assigned to a western star, Tom Mix, as a trainer.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.840
During this time, director John Ford took a likin' to the young football player,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.760
and their friendship developed through the years.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.900
Duke loved body surfing,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.400
and while at Balboa Beach he injured his shoulder,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.820
and it grew worse during Football practice,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.460
causing him eventually to lose his scholarship.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.320
Unable to continue schooling,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.720
he asked John Ford for work.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.880
He began getting small, unaccredited parts.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.340
In that same year, in 1926,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.760
John Wayne meets Carmen Saenz,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.380
daughter of the Consul General of Panama.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.400
Although he first met Carmen,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.680
it was her sister Josephine that will eventually steal his heart.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.560
In 1930, John Wayne got his first leading role

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.520
in "The Big Trail,"

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.260
directed by Raoul Walsh.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.800
Raoul decided that Marion Morrison was not a good name

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.280
for a leading man.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.120
It was Walsh that gave John Wayne his new name.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.400
The next year it will be "Arizona,"

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.740
starring John Wayne and June Clyde.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.100
There will be five other films in 1931.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.220
The next year, in 1932, Wayne will play

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.980
supporting roles to Western stars

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.520
such as Tim McCoy and Buck Jones;

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.940
In 1933, it'll be "Sagebrush Trail" with Nancy Shubert.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.120
Wayne had met Carmen Saenz

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.520
in 1926, while at USC.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.860
However, it was Carmen's younger sister Josephine -

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.200
or "Josie," as she was called -  that stole his heart.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.180
Josie's father was a wealthy businessman, and

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.200
Consulate-General for Panama.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.480
The family discouraged the romance

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.400
between the 19-year-old college student,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.620
with no apparent future, and the 16-year-old socialite.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.220
After a long on-and-off romance,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.180
with Josie's father forbidding his daughter to see him,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.880
finally, on the 24th of June, 1933,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.300
John Wayne and Josie Saenz married at the home of Loretta Young.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.440
In 1934, John Wayne starred with Sheila Terry

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.520
in "'Neath the Arizona Skies."

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.680
Wayne will star with Sheila Terry

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.060
in several early westerns.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.520
Terry will leave the movie business after a decade.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.160
Her last days will be spent

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.140
in a small apartment in New York.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.560
She will pass away on January the 19th, 1957,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.560
from an overdose of sleeping pills, at the age of 46.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.860
She said that her only regret was:

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.020
she would watch her old movies on television,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.980
and didn't receive a dime in royalties.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.740
At the end of 1934,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.920
on the 23rd of November,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.360
John Wayne and Josie will have their first child, a boy,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.980
Michael Anthony Morrison.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.460
He'll be best known as Michael Wayne.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.900
Michael will become a film director and actor.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.900
He will have five children with his wife, Gretchen.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.960
Michael will pass away, April the second, 2003,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.340
at the age of 68, from heart failure

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.180
associated with lupus.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.860
A year or so after Michael's birth,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.380
the couple will have their second child, a daughter,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.780
Mary Antonia Morrison.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.100
She will be born February the 25th, 1936.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.460
She will appear in several unaccredited films of her father's,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.380
such as "The  Quiet Man" and "The Alamo."

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.100
She will marry Donald LaCava in 1956,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.420
and have eight children.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.720
She will live a private life as a mother and housewife.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.700
"Toni" will pass away

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.840
December the 6th, 2000,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.540
from battling lung cancer, at the age of 64.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.460
One year after Tony's birth,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.860
John Wayne will lose his father, Clyde Morrison.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.260
He will succumb to a heart attack

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.660
on the 4th of March, 1937, at the age of 52.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.640
John will describe Clyde as being the kindest, most patient man

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.340
that he ever knew.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.280
Clyde Morrison had married Florence Buck

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.760
after his divorce from Mary.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.200
Wayne said he came to love his stepmother.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.560
Two years after his father's death,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.560
John Wayne will become a major star

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.920
in John Ford's iconic 1939 Western,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.940
"Stagecoach,"

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.640
also starring Claire Trevor.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.620
In July of the same year,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.400
John and Josie will have their third child,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.840
another boy, Patrick John Morrison.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.640
Patrick will become an actor like his father.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.680
He will appear in 40 movies, 11 with his father.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.700
One year and five months after Patrick was born,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.280
the Waynes will have their fourth child, a daughter,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.400
Melinda Ann Morrison, born 3 December, 1940.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.340
This is Sunday at home with the Morrisons.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.940
On the left is Patrick, Melinda, Tony and Michael.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.980
Melinda was 4 when her parents divorced. The kids lived with their mother,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.160
but they spoke to their father every day by phone.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.800
"He would rent these big houses

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.020
and let us come visit him while he was on location."

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.880
By 1943 John Wayne and Josephine had separated.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.500
However, it'll be two more years, 1945,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.000
before the final divorce.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.120
It's been said that Josie was not interested in her husband's career.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.880
He was always surrounding himself with film world associates,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.900
and they also disagreed on how to raise their children.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.240
During the war years,1941 through 1945,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.180
Wayne made several patriotic movies,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.380
such as "The Fighting Seabees" in 1944,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.540
and "Back to Bataan" in 1945.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.640
He was criticized for not serving during the war;

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.100
he was deferred for having four kids.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.540
He wrote John Ford

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.940
to see if he could serve under his command.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.100
By the time the officers' ranks were full,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.880
and he believed that he could serve the country better

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.060
by making patriotic movies

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.560
than picking up cigarette butts as a private.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.840
On January the 17, 1946,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.240
less than one month after his divorce from Josephine,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.500
John Wayne will marry Elizabeth Diaz Baur.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.920
They had met to Mexico back in 1941

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.400
when he was on vacation.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.820
"Chata," as Esperanza Baur was called,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.000
was from Mexico City

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.200
and had starred in several Spanish-language films.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.940
Their marriage will be very rocky from the very beginning.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.480
Wayne will say that Chata was jealous of his four kids

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.300
and jealous of him,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.040
even accusing him of having an affair with his young co-star Gail Russell

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.320
in "The Angel and the Outlaw" in 1947.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.800
Both Russell and Wayne denied the affair.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.220
While married to Chata in 1948,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.740
Wayne will star in "Red River"

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.020
with Montgomery Clift and Joanne Dru,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.700
and then it'll be "Fort Apache"

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.980
with Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.780
In 1949 it'll be "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.080
with Ben Johnson and again with Joanne Dru.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:16.600
Also in '49, it'll be a war film: "Sands of Iwo Jima."

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.680
This is the Duke with Chata, at home, with their dogs,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.220
"Fearless" and "Stagecoach."

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.640
The next year, in 1950,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.960
it will be "Rio Grande" with Maureen O'Hara.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.920
O'Hara stated that she met John Wayne through John Ford

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.060
not long after coming to the United States

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.760
to star with Charles Laughton

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.840
in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in 1939;

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.400
they were friends early on,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.740
but it grew stronger after making their first of five movies together, "Rio Grande."

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.414
Duke always said that Maureen O'Hara was his favorite actress,

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:55.540
and she always said

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.380
that he was her favorite co-star.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.800
A few weeks before John Wayne's death,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.140
O'Hara actually flew from her home

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.220
in St.Croix, the Virgin Islands,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.400
to Washington to testify in behalf of her best friend

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.420
so that the president would strike a

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.700
commemorative gold medal in his honor

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.060
It was important, O'Hara said,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.900
for people to know what kind of man John Wayne was;

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.500
his love for his family, his loyalty to his friends,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.860
and how he helped others.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.220
She said, "When he came to visit me and my husband,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.540
we would always try to get him to try new island dishes,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.780
but he always ordered steak."

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:46.120
Two years later, in 1952, John Wayne will again star with Maureen O'Hara

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.560
in John Ford's movie, "The Quiet Man."

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.900
"The Quiet Man" was filmed in Ireland,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.640
so Duke would rent a huge house

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.680
and invite his children to come and stay.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.080
He allowed his kids to serve as extras on the film.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.280
That same year

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.640
John Wayne and his second wife, Esperanza, will separate.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.380
It'll be two more years before a nasty divorce will be granted.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.760
While being separated from Chata, and before their divorce was granted,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.120
Wayne was in Lima, Peru scouting movie locations when he meets

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.340
Peruvian actress Pilar Palette Weldy.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:30.540
Pilar was from a socially prominent family and her father was a Peruvian Senator.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.700
At the time she was married to big-game hunter Richard Weldy.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.920
They will divorce the next year, in 1953.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.600
That same year, she came to Los Angeles to dub a film in English.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.620
While in Los Angeles,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.820
she will meet John Wayne the second time.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.620
They'll become romantically involved. At the same time,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.940
he will be starring in "Hondo" with Geraldine Page.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.680
On November the 1st, 1954,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.040
the same day John Wayne gets his divorce from Chata,

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.340
he will marry Pilar Weldy.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.300
Chata will eventually return to Mexico

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.700
and pass away in 1961 from a heart attack,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.740
at the age of 37.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.480
Wayne and Pilar were married at Kona, Hawaii,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.660
and, unlike his first two wives,

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.160
Pilar will take an interest in his career.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.740
At the time of their marriage John Wayne was 46

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.680
and she was 26.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:38.100
In 1956, John Wayne will travel to the beautiful Monument Valley

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.320
where his career first started

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.940
in "Stagecoach" in 1939.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.400
It's located on the Arizona - Utah border.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.900
He went there to film "The Searchers,"

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.660
that starred Ward Bond,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.200
Natalie Wood, Jeffrey Hunter, and Vera Miles.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.200
The film will be a commercial success,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.360
and it was considered one of the great Western films

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.820
by the American Film Institute in 2000 &amp; 8.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.940
On March the 31st, 1956,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.460

In later years, Aissa will become a family attorney in Malibu.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.060
In 1959, John Wayne will appear in "The Horse Soldiers"

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.060
with William Holden and Constance Towers.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.660
Also in '59 it'll be "Rio Bravo,"

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.560
with Dean Martin,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.600

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.360
In 1960, John Wayne will act in and direct "The Alamo."

Lawrence Harvey,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.860

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.820
He will invest much of his own money.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.300
The movie set that he built for "The Alamo"

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.220
is said to be the most accurate set ever built in the movies.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.760
The movie will cost so much

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.420
that it will take years to recuperate his investment.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.740
Wayne's wife Pilar stated

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.240
the whole family lived in a small town

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.780
close to the set.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.160
It was a family affair, and it was wonderful.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.900
On February the 22nd, 1962,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.780

He goes by Ethan Wayne.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.400
His name, Ethan, was chosen in direct relation

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.560
to John Wayne's character in "The Searchers,"

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.300
Ethan Edwards.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.380
Ethan will become an actor and appear as the grandson

He will later serve as head

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.520

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.520

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.080
John Wayne will play in two major films:

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.920
"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.480
with Lee Marvin and Jimmy Stewart.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.440
John Wayne was already suffering from lung cancer,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.660
but it will not be diagnosed

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.860
until two years later, in 1964.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.280
He will also play as Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.460
in "The Longest Day."

The next year, it'll be "McClintock"

with Lee Marvin and Elizabeth Allen,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.620
filmed on location in Hawaii,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.800
directed by John Ford.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.140
Back in 1955,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.940
John Wayne had starred with Susan Hayward

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.060
in "The Conqueror," produced by Howard Hughes.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.880
The filming location was Snow Canyon,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.220
close to St. George, Utah.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.320
Snow Canyon was picked for filming

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.420
because the red sand there

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.340
was the same as the original location.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.740
Although the crew was aware

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.220
that Snow Canyon and St. George

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.920
was in a direct line a hundred and thirty-seven miles

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.440
south of Yucca Flats, Nevada,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.900
where the government, in 1953,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.680
had exploded eleven Atomic Bombs.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.520
It was known that wind currents had carried

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.360
radioactive dust south to the filming location; however,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.080
the government assured the film crew

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.340
and the people of St. George

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.700
that it was perfectly safe.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.580
The cast and crew spent 13 weeks filming in the canyon dust.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.700
For close-ups they hauled 60 tons of red sand

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.400
to the Hollywood lots,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.660
so it would match.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.460
The first sign of trouble

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.760
was sheep and livestock in large numbers

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.400
beginning to die.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.460
Seven years after release of "The Conqueror,"

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.100

He will follow his doctor's orders

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.220
and have his left lung and several ribs removed.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.420

Marissa will remember that between movies

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.080
Duke would spend as much time with his family and friends

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.600
as he could on his hundred-and-thirty-seven-foot yacht,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.560
The Wild Goose.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.640
He said he needed a large boat

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.620
in order to entertain his expanding family.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.820
He only sold The Wild Goose

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:15.040

there was demonstrations against the war,

and the movie critics came out against the film;

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.500
so much so that it made the public want to see it!

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.720
It made the expenses back in the first three months;

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.580

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.360
On 17 March,1970, John Wayne

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.060
will lose his 84-year-old mother,

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.940
Mary Morrison, or "Molly," as she was called by family,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.240
after a long illness.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.780
Molly had been living with Duke's younger brother,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.440
Robert, in Long Beach.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.520
John Wayne said of his mother

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.820
that she always belittled him

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.440
and gave him no credit for any of his successes.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.100
She always favored Robert and made no bones about it.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.960
All his life, he tried to please her,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.280
but she would have no part of it.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.980
He naturally turned to his father for comfort.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.400
Four months after his mother's death

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.300
on July the 25th,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.520
he will lose his brother Robert to lung cancer.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.220
Robert was 58 years old.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.460
Duke said he always had a good relationship

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.880
with his brother.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.780
Wayne will make two movies in 1970,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.860
"Rio Lobo" with Jennifer O'Neil,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.780
Jack Elam and Christopher Mitchum,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.800
who is the son of veteran actor Robert Mitchum.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.160
"Chisholm" will be filmed in Durango, Mexico.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.620
Co-stars will be his friends Forrest Tucker

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.720
and Ben Johnson.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.180
While filming, Ben Johnson received word

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.040
that his sister had passed away

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.600
in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.060
Wayne had Ben Johnson flown to Oklahoma

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.560
for the funeral by his private plane.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.940
In 1971, it'll be "Big Jake"

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.040
with Maureen O'Hara and Richard Boone.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.220
Duke's youngest son Ethan

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.900
plays his grandson in the movie,

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.100
and his son Patrick and Robert Mitchum's son Christopher

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.900
will play Big Jake's two sons.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.080
The next year, in 1972, it'll be "The Cowboys."

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.020
John Wayne's character will have to hire young boys

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.780
on a cattle drive.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.520
Bruce Dern will be the outlaw leader

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.460
who tries to steal the cattle herd.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:05.080
Roscoe Lee Brown will add a bit of class to the cast.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:11.020
In 1973, John Wayne will star in "Cahill, US Marshal,"

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.740
with George Kennedy and Gary Grimes.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.200
Also in November, 1973,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.220
John Wayne and his third wife Pilar

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.980
will announce their trial separation.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.640
She complained about his absence from home

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.860
even when he wasn't working.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.720
She'll move out of their waterfront home

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.960
located at 2686 Bayshore Drive, Newport Beach.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.340
Although they separated, they will never divorce,

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.440
and still be married at his death.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.120
Duke will set up a trust fund to take care of her financially.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.760
She will marry twice more after his death.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.140
In 1975, it'll be "Rooster Cogburn"

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.100
with Katharine Hepburn.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.880
Although Wayne and Hepburn

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.040
were both veteran actors for many years,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.840
"Rooster Cogburn" will be the only time

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.340
for the two stars to work together.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.660
the high altitude, during filming,

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.180
caused Wayne to use oxygen often,

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.780
and he contracted pneumonia in his only lung

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.020
close to the end of the film.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.700
Marissa Wayne, Duke's nine-year-old daughter,

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.020
went to the golf range with her dad during the break

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.940
while 'Rooster Cogburn" was being filmed.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.380
While learning to swing a golf club,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.720
Marissa accidentally hit her dad in the eye,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.740
sending him to the doctor.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.160
She said he was very gracious about it,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.580
but in the movie, you can tell -

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.600
he began wearing a bigger eye patch.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.840
She said her father, up to that time,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.740
always called her "Princess;"

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.000
after that he called her "Nine-Iron,"

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.780
as in "Nine-Iron, go clean your room!"

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:03.180
In 1976 John Wayne would star in his last movie, "The Shootist."

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.240
He will request Lauren Bacall and James Stewart.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.040
Stewart had been retired for five years

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.460
and only agreed as a favor to Duke.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.900
The problem was: James Stewart couldn't hear,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.300
So he couldn't tell when he was supposed to say his lines.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.880
The scene in the Doctor's Office went on so long,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.500
the Director got plumb mad.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.000
This will be James Stewart's last appearance in films.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.980
John Wayne was so ill during filming,

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.020
he was hospitalized for two weeks

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.520
with influenza and pneumonia.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.500
Production was shut down,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.640
and it was uncertain if the film would ever be completed.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.880
The doctors didn't want him to continue.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.720
Duke was determined to finish his last film.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.540
He wanted to pay tribute to his horse, "Dollar,"

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.120
that he had rode in several of his movies,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.820
so he had it entered into his contract

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.740
that he could mention the name of the horse

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.180
several times.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.100
That's why he told Ronnie Howard's character,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.740
"I'm giving you old Dollar",

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:17.480
and he called Dollar's name several times in the scene.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.020
In March, 1978, John Wayne will be hospitalized

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.940
for heart valve replacement.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:30.660
On January the 12th, 1979, Duke will be informed that his cancer is back

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:36.180
and had metastasized to the stomach, Intestines, and spine.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.660
For the last few years

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.300
Wayne had been living with his secretary, Pat Stacey.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.220
Their romance had received little or no publicity.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:53.080
John Wayne appeared in over 150 films during his career.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.400
He's one of the most successful and most recognized actors ever.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.980
His last public appearance was at the 51st Academy Award Ceremonies,

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.120
where he presented the Best Picture of the Year.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.720
Two months earlier, in January, 1979,

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.140
he had underwent cancer surgery.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.340
One month after his last public appearance

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.140
his old friend, Maureen O'Hara,

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.220
visited Duke at his Westport Beach home

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.680
only a few weeks before his death.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.760
O'Hara was a cancer survivor herself.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.700
She said they laughed and cried for two days.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:38.320
36 years later, Maureen O'Hara would pass away at the age of 95

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.260
on the 24th of October, 2015.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.100
On June 11, 1979,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.940
John Wayne, The Duke,

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.080
will succumb to stomach cancer

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.040
at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.580
He is buried at the Pacific View Memorial Park,

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.020
Newport Beach, California.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.040
John Wayne was 72 years old.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.540
Before his death he told his son Michael, "Remember,

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.720
I would not be who I am, or you who you are;

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.700
we would not have the lifestyle we have

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.020
if it were not for the public.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.160
Only use my name for their benefit."

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.600
The children of John Wayne took his words to heart

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.820
and helped form the John Wayne Cancer Institute.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.920
Now, a personal note:

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.120
I have a friend that had cancer and was being treated

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.180
at Duke University Center in North Carolina.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.760
She was losing the battle.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.300
Someone mentioned John Wayne Cancer Center in California

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.780
might be able to help.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.820
She believes to this day

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.600
that she would not be here

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:03.100
if it had not been for John Wayne and his children.
