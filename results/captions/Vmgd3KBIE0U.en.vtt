00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.220
Ok we are now obviously going to look at the driver's cab on Tiger 1.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.130
The first thing that is very noticeable, certainly for me when you get in,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.070
there is the fact that the hatch is offset which is quite unusual and also it actually looks quite comfy.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.090
Directly in front is also a steering wheel,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.290
again quite unusual for any tank design to have a steering wheel there.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.250
And what Ian is going to do now is quickly take us round and point out some of the major controls

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.040
that you find in the driver's cab.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.000
Basic controls on the driver's compartment are, as you can see we have got a steering wheel.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.100
That’s hydraulic inner power-assisted steering.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.070
And also a secondary form of steering is like the old traditional way is the tiller sticks,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.220
located by my right knee and my left knee.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.050
Driving the Tiger, it’s quite hard to actually see out within the vision slot up here.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.180
You cannot see any of the track guards or the front of the tank so I'm solely relying on people guiding me,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.240
but once we are in the area if we have a display it's not too bad but in close quarters it can be a bit tricky,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.010
so that's why we always have people on the ground so that I can visually see and in radio contact.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.140
You've got to keep one eye on what's going on within the vision block outside

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.260
and the other eye you've got to keep an eye on the temperature, oil pressure and the revs.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.130
Most important thing is the oil pressure.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.200
We've got an oil pressure gage in here.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.110
As soon as the tank starts it should be more or less off the scale so we’ve got a good pressure.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.130
Another important factor is coolant.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.100
Other controls are, to my right the choke lever.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.040
Majority of the time we do give it a bit of choke and also when you go to start the tank,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.060
I'll show you later on, in the firing compartment there is a priming unit for fuel.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.220
Also in the driver's cab you've got the pedals down here.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.040
Very close together almost like a Formula One sort of car, it's so tight,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.280
if you've got big boots on it's quite awkward to drive.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.140
You've got the accelerator pedal, brake, clutch just like on a car and also running right in front of you,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.010
you've got the output shafts the drive shafts on the gear box through the steering assembly, 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.010
braking assembly, out to the final drives.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.140
On my left we have got the hand brake.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.250
I'll just pull on.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.210
So you've got the main hand brake so that's there.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.080
Also on the Tiger, when selecting gear what we have is a transfer lever which is situated here by my right knee.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.190
Which indicates neutral, reverse or forward.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.220
Also above that is an engagement knob.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.050
You'd depress the knob in on the transfer box then you can engage forward or reverse.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.130
Also here is the gear ratios.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.180
On a Tiger you can pull away from 1 to 4, anything in between those are gear ratios, but depending on the terrain.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.290
Normally, but, the Tiger has eight forward gears and four reverse.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.290
Also in the driver's compartment as opposed to the other side where the machine gunner sits and the radio operator,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.140
you have these filler necks.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.100
These are for the final drives that I was showing you from the outside during the First Parade.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.200
This is where you fill them the up, through these.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.010
They are just vented.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.110
They've got like a little vent tube on the top, but, that is where they are filled up from.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.010
So, you know, they obviously thought of everything, to do, to make it so much easier to work on this tank.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.170
Where we are now, we are in the fighting compartment.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.040
Underneath our feet is the turret floor and housed underneath there is the batteries.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.210
Normally on the original Tiger there would have been about four batteries, but this one,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.090
we've been modified this one just to run on the two batteries.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.070
So they would be under the turret floor.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.140
They would be re connected and checked obviously to make sure they had enough charge to start the Tiger.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.180
The secondary bit for the starting sequences.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.160
Here we have a primer, a fuel primer, which can fill the carburators up with fuel

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.140
so what it usually takes is about six to eight pumps on the primer

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.190
then it gives it enough fuel within the carbs to start the engine.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.060
So there’s the primer.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.110
Down on into the right here is the fuel valves for the fuel tank.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.190
There is one on the right here and there is also another one on the left over there,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.150
but we do not use those two tanks.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.110
It is just solely the ones on the right hand side.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.000
So they would be switched to position 3.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.180
Which is the main fuel tank.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.160
Position 2 is reserve and position 1 is fully off so the fuel valves are always,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.290
we always keep them off all the time until we use the vehicle.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.010
So that would be turned on, number 3 to start the tank and also the main switch of it all is the master switch.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.010
The main power.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.280
So once that's initiated and turned on then it's down over to the driver to start the tank.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.000
If there's any problems or there's anything that's going to happen or there is a suspect a fuel leak or a fire,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.090
you turn the master switch off straight away and kill the fuel.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.220
That's why when we first parade it and start the tank we've always got two or three people with you to help you out,

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.110
fire watch and for safety reasons.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.270
So, right, if we take it from the master switch is on and the fuel is turned on

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.080
the next point of call is for me to start the tank itself.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:34.160
So the first thing you've got to do obviously is check, make sure the steering is centralised and I depress the clutch with my foot,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.080
making sure the tank does not move at all hand brake is applied as well.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.060
On the side of the gear box here is a little black knob and that engaged,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.170
when you push that can engage the forward or reverse motion of the tank for the transfer lever.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.180
What I do is, I make sure the transfer lever is in neutral and then what I do is we've got the ignition panel here.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:04.050
Hence the ignition key and then I click twice; one, two and then the ignition should come on and be ready for start.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.050
Also there is a choke lever down to my right hand side.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.180
I would give the tank a little bit of choke.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.080
The guy in the back as well, they would prime the engine with a few pumps on the fuel primer

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.210
so the engines got plenty of fuel in it ready to fire up.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.060
And then you press the ignition switch and then the tank would fire up.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.020
Usually I take it up to about 1,000 rpm.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.210
If I let the tank idle too much it, it sort of like clogs itself up, it starts to choke.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.040
So it is nice to start up and give it a good 1,000 revs then it clears it out and it warms the tank up a lot quicker.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.090
And then eventually I'll take the choke off and then she hopefully, she'll start warming up nicely then.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.220
Just to get all the oils up to temperature because it is important that on the gear box on the transmission side,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.090
that the oils are up to temperature.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.110
If they are not up to temperature then it makes the gear selection very hard.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.070
So basically that's it.
