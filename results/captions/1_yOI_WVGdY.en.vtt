[MODEM CONNECTING]

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.760
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: We first
met Ben Anderson when we

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.150
started VBS, actually.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.630
We went to Spike Jonze, our
creative director's, house

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.820
along with some of the most
talented editors and shooters

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.680
and talent that Spike
had put together.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.200
All we did was watch Ben
Anderson footage from Africa,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
North Korea-- which I then
ripped off when I went to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.250
North Korea--

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.470
Iran, Iraq.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.000
It was just fascinating stuff.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.260
He ended up getting in a fight
and Johnny Knoxville had to go

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.360
save him and sneak
him into a club.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.920
And since then, we've been
wanting to work with Ben, and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.180
we knew that he had been working
in Afghanistan for the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.490
past three years on making
a documentary there.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.980
And lately, Afghanistan's
been in the news.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.250
And you know, we're spending
more and more money there.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.090
We're losing more
and more ground.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.800
And generally what we've found
with VBS is what you hear the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.090
mainstream media versus what is
actually happening are two

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.210
completely different things.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.210
So what he showed us
blew our minds.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.060
I mean, it's completely
insane.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.790
And it's also very complex.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.190
So we wanted him to come over
and explain to us what we're

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.440
about to see.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.075
BRITISH SOLDIER: You'll want
to keep the bottles.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.370
You can fill the bottles up
using either stream water, or

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.405
when you go into compound
from the well.

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:32.630
Yeah, this is normally
confusion.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.110
They all gather round.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.190
He wants a lot of water for
himself, and he says he's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.640
going to sort it out, but if you
give it to him, he'll just

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.135
fuck off with the lot.

00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:41.961
So nothing would
get sorted out.

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.550
He'll just fill his vehicle
and noone will get none.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.830
So you have to sort it
out between them.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.970
Like kids.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: That
guy's the British Army and the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.080
other guys are--?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.390
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING:
Afghan National Army.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.590
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:
Afghan National Army.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.090
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING:
And that's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.970
basically our exit strategy.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.330
The idea is when these guys
can stand up and provide

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.510
security on their own,
we can all get out.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.580
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: But
they can't even give them

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.060
water without them
taking it away.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.240
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: No, they
can't even get them to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.264
wear their helmets
and flak jackets.

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:10.885
BEN ANDERSON: Seems like quite
a chaotic start, then.

00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:11.650
BRITISH SOLDIER: This is good.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.500
BEN ANDERSON: Is it?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.605
BRITISH SOLDIER: This is
fucking squared away.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.590
They've got vehicles
and everything.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.894
It's well done.

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:22.130
BEN ANDERSON: How difficult is
it to organize these guys?

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.200
BRITISH SOLDIER: It just
takes a bit of time.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.770
They're all mad.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.220
They all want to go on the
mission, but they're not fully

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.220
functioning yet.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.910
They need us to mentor them and
make sure they've got all

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.145
the kit and equipment
they need.

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:31.910
They'll go without water
and without food and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.042
hope for the best.

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:34.480
They think we can manage--

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.370
magic things up, just invent
things and produce a fuel

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.670
truck for them.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.900
But we can't.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.350
When we come into contact with
the enemy, sometimes you need

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.170
to put them on a lead and hold
them back, 'cause they'll just

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.460
go and go and go until they kill
more and more Taliban.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.470
That's what they want to do.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.250
That's what their life is.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.440
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So I
know there's problems in

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.450
Pakistan with Muslim
fighting Muslim.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.520
Why would the ANA fight
the Taliban?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.950
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: I think
to them, it's work.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.070
It's not ideology at all.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.080
And there's an old saying--

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.746
I think you can hire an
Afghan army, but you

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:06.990
can never buy one.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.150
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Right.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.742
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING:
So loyalty is

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:09.350
never taken for granted.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.240
BRITISH SOLDIER: They
are excited and

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.580
they are brave soldiers.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.650
And they're like children.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.060
Their attention span doesn't
last very long.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.326
They soon get bored.

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:22.020
At the moment, I think
they're all here.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.712
Clint Eastwood is.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:25.128
BEN ANDERSON: In
the cowboy hat?

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:25.600
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.488
BEN ANDERSON: How you doing?

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:31.570
Have you given up on making them
wear uniform exactly the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.365
way they're supposed
to wear it?

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:33.230
BRITISH SOLDIER: No,
I don't care.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.210
As long as they go and do the
job and do what they're told

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.800
and they toe the line.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.790
You know, they enjoy wearing
their shemaghs and t-shirts

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.700
and looking like Rambo
when they go out.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.980
I'm not bothered.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.577
As long as they've got their
weapon, their ammunition, all

00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:45.920
the stuff they need to sustain
themselves, I'm not bothered.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.136
BRITISH SOLDIER: They're so--

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:50.780
so bright and colorful,
all of them.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.050
It's a wonderful
sight, really.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.930
They're a very sort
of visual army.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.180
It's great.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.270
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So in
the past, the problem and the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.106
criticism has always been that
the Brits, Americans, whoever

00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:07.170
it is, just control towns or
bases, and they're isolated.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.335
Isolated from the community,
and the Taliban can roll

00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:11.217
around freely in the rest
of the country, apart

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.040
from these big bases.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.650
The aim of this mission was to
actually clear ground of the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.490
Taliban and then hold on to it
for the first time, actually

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.959
keep hold of that land
and stop the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.709
Taliban from coming back.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.750
BRITISH SOLDIER: With this
amount of manpower, we should

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.806
have enough, tomorrow, to commit
to a good scrap with

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:32.560
the enemy if they choose
to take on with us.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.375
We aim to destroy the enemy and
take the ground this time,

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.741
and not cede it again.

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:39.290
BRITISH SOLDIER: If they can
get forward, destroy the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.010
Taliban, and hold that ground,
it's a massive morale booster

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.420
for the ANA and for our boys.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.670
So, you know, that's what we're

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.920
looking forward to doing.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.155
BEN ANDERSON: Did they know
exactly where they were going?

00:04:55.155 --> 00:04:57.310
BRITISH SOLDIER: They know the
general region, yeah, because

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.870
they have to know.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.990
But we try and keep security
to a minimum so we can--

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.640
otherwise they'll get on the
mobile phone, start phoning

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.671
everyone around the [INAUDIBLE]
they know, and

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.940
then they'll pass it
on to the Taliban.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.490
BEN ANDERSON: So there's a worry
that some of the solders

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.890
might intentionally be giving
information to the Taliban?

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.610
BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah, people
have been caught out

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.360
before in the ANA.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.680
And they've been disciplined
in their own chain.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.020
BEN ANDERSON: And remained
within the ANA?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.550
BRITISH SOLDIER: No, they've
been kicked out of the ANA.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.010
They probably went and joined
the Taliban, but.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.490
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: The ANA,
the Afghan National Army,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.300
they can't tell them where
they're going because they'll

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.800
call the Taliban and
let them know?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.100
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: And tell
them where they're going,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.890
what the plan is.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.450
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Why in
god's name would they do that?

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.930
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Because
the Taliban pay much

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.450
better salary than any
government job-- police, army,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.930
whatever it is.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.820
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So they
pay them, and then they say,

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.520
oh, we're coming here now.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.940
Kill us.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.820
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.520
So this is what all of Helmand
is like, just desert.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.450
But then the area where the
fighting is, is called the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.195
green zone.

00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:52.860
And completely opposite to the
Iraq green zone, it's the most

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.275
dangerous place, because it's
the one fertile strip of land

00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.460
there, and there are so many
hiding places for the Taliban

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.920
that that's where they
love to fight.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.620
And that's where the British and
the ANA have to go looking

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.110
for the Taliban.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.907
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:
Green zone, bad zone.

00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:06.220
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.250
BRITISH SOLDIER: They've watched
us so far, last hour

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.440
and a half, two hours.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.210
BEN ANDERSON: Everyone
knows we're here?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.140
BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.140
They knew there was an upcoming,
because they're used

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.790
to it, and they'd have
gone, right, OK.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.750
Seeing us go that way, Taliban
go that way to

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.350
their fall-back positions.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.330
And it's a waiting game.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.520
We'll outnumber them, we'll
out-firepower them.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.240
And they know that.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.370
And they will stand and fight
sooner or later, because

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.660
they'll have to.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.680
Because that's what they do.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.440
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: The
Taliban have got a really

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.295
sophisticated network
of dickers.

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:38.090
It's a phrase that comes
from Northern Island.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.450
Local people with mobile phones,
as soon as they see

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.975
us, as soon as they see the
soldiers coming, they'll tell

00:06:42.975 --> 00:06:43.840
them exactly our movement.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.790
So the Brits take it for granted
the Taliban know their

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.880
every movement.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.675
You see us walking through
this town, and

00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:53.160
it's completely deserted.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.960
That's-- every single time
we got ambushed,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.780
this happened first.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.060
You'd walk around, completely
deserted.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.380
Because the civilians
are very streetwise.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.790
They know where the
Taliban are.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.190
They see the British
soldiers coming.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.600
They know there's going
to be a fight.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.930
So they get out of there.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.720
So as soon as you find an area
that's deserted, you know

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.820
there's going to be fighting.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.680
BRITISH SOLDIER: All these
compounds make up

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.150
the village of Kakara.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.310
We're just clearing
through them.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.200
It's a painstaking process.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.220
Did you expect it to
be this quiet?

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.250
BRITISH SOLDIER: It swings
around about.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.500
Sometimes it is this quiet.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.940
Other times you might meet
one or two people.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.320
By and large, because this area
has seen quite a bit of

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.880
fighting over the last couple
of months, a lot of the

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.230
families have moved out.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.750
But hopefully after the next
couple of days, we will have

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:45.250
taken this area properly,
secured it, and sent a message

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.215
that people can move back
into their compounds.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.060

that poppy, right there?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.950

Everywhere you go.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.000
I mean, without exaggeration,
just about every single house

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.340
we went into had a pile of
harvested opium poppies as

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.330
tall as you.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.970
Over 90% of our heroin,
Britain's heroin, comes from

MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE ON RADIO]

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.605
BEN ANDERSON: The Afghan
National Army can use their

00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:16.314
radios to get on the same
channel as the Taliban and

00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:20.710
listen to what they're saying.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.370
What are they saying?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.500
MALE SPEAKER: They're saying
they are about to attack.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.860
They are getting ready for
attack, to attack us.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.800
BEN ANDERSON: Attack us here?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.730
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.510
BEN ANDERSON: Do you know
where they are?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.835
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:33.100
Their location is not known.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.669
Just they are asking where
[INAUDIBLE] located, where

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.124
that relocating in
the morning.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.159
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: He's
saying that he knows that the

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.880
Taliban are going to attack
you right then.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.500
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.292
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:
Were you scared?

00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:50.100
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah,
you're scared, but you get

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.410
used to it very quickly.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.280
This is everyday life for
these guys out there.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.775
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: How does
he know the Taliban know?

00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:56.370
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: He's
just got a normal CB and he

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.480
finds the same channel the
Taliban are speaking on.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.900
He hears them saying, OK, I can
see them, as soon as they

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.530
come out of that street, as soon
as they come from behind

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.590
that wall, we'll attack.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.840
SHANE SMITH NARRATING:

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.332

00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:11.582
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.810
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So we'd
walked through the entire

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.470
town, cleared the whole town.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.540
Really surprised not to see any
civilians, any Taliban.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.180
And almost the last building we
could see, there's a team

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.550
of Taliban waiting there
to fire up on us.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.390
So as happens every single time,
the fight happens where

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.550
they want it to happen.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.410
BRITISH SOLDIER: Possible
positive identification of two

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.610
times Taliban.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.720
We're going to engage with RPGs,
see if it provokes a

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.990
response, and if so, assault
that enemy possession.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.950
Over.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:51.460
That side.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.450
OK, get the RPG up
there, yeah?

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.430
firing these RPGs.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.255
BEN ANDERSON: So we think it's
a sighting of two Taliban.

00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:07.230
And apparently what they'll
often do is send foot patrol

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.720
down to harass, then run away
and lure British forces into a

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.156
trap where they can be attacked
by 360 degrees.

00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:17.447
Just wait and see if there's a
response to the RPG that's

00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:18.410
just been fire.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.820
They're loading another
one now.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.490
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah you
get a lot of stuff about

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.927
how our poor soldiers
are getting bogged

00:10:22.927 --> 00:10:24.220
down in this quagmire.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.050
And the Brits know exactly
what's going on,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.825
and go ahead anyway.

00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:28.080
SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Right.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.256
Why?

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:30.560
BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Well,
they're quite happy to go

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.580
there and have a fight
with them.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.540
They know they're walking
into a trap, but

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.120
they're looking for it.

Where the fuck are
they coming from?

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.600
BRITISH SOLDIER: I'm stuck.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.660
BRITISH SOLDIER: Six
three alph--

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.460
six three alpha, that's enemy
trying to move, as I said, to

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.010
the north of our current
position.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.340

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.622

trying to [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:20.622 --> 00:11:23.082
push forward [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.332

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.810
were going to send
their friends.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.892
So what I'm thinking is probably
happening is that the

00:11:40.892 --> 00:11:42.910
original four Taliban are trying
to push forward to the

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.650
compound that's 50 meters just
to our right, and that the

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.105
friends are the ones
who are now off in

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:48.247

it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.080

arrived, firing straight at

and assault that compound.

but there's no smoke.

the field next

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.100
to us has been strafed.

We thought it was the compound
over here somewhere where the

00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:09.999
Taliban were fighting from.

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.702

this compound here, where

watched this happen.

And again, no smoke rises from
the Taliban positions.

see that the compound that

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.010

have stormed has been hit by

The Hellfire missile came in,
blew up their house, and

are a number of compounds

which aren't very clearly
identifiable on the air

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:25.480
[INAUDIBLE], we called in the

in, according to the GPS fixed,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.610
corresponded, they thought
that was the

in, it came in on
