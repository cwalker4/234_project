00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
Hey, I am Jonathan Lucas and welcome back to Japan Treasure Hunters. Today on Iwo

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.290
Jima were we're going around to a few caves and stuff and such like that

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.949
So right now we just found one that was in the boonies. We just came across it

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.599
Obviously, it's already been excavated because you can see a few things hanging out

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.330
You're gonna see trash and and let me emphasize that as the trash is there for a reason, you know,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.850
like the can the beer cans the water bottles.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.369
A short explanation is

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.679
during the time when we were attacking they didn't have a lot of water. So this is kind of like a

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.689
An offering to them so that way they can have water and we all know why alcohol is there because everybody likes alcohol

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.629
So we're fixing to go in this cave. So

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.270
I'll see you in there.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.729
All right, as you can see it's really really tiny not sure where it goes or how far back it goes

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.460
Obviously, I'm a little too big for these things Wow, I'll tell you comes up on the other side

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.148
Maybe get over here. I can stand up a little bit

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.199
Yeah, I can move a little bit so I get

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.599
That comes right back up on the other side, but it goes down here

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.710
So maybe we can

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.319
Check that out. But as you can see there's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.049
Not my favorite items

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.509
spider webs right here

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.620
All right, let's try it only live once right

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.420
Stuff moving down, okay. It just gets really really tiny and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.380
There's spiders everywhere. So yeah, let's roll roll back out. I'm not crawling down there

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.990
Okay

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.990
Well, that's a short cave

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.910
Yeah, maybe the next one will be a little bit better. All right, so here we are at the general's cave

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940
We're gonna go through this one again. I know a

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.129
while ago on the past few videos we did this is some we're gonna take our time go through it and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.449
hopefully we can get to the other side of the road which is really interestingly cool, but it's nice and dark down there and it's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.390
Kind of scary but let's go. Alright, so here's the entrance you go on down into this cave

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.760
It looks nice and cool and easy to get into because there's steps

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.169
and it looks like they actually clean out the steps a little bit from the last time I was here so

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.750
It's a little bit easier than always before

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.480
There used to be a generator

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.089
Up here that you could use to

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.969
Turn the lights on but they moved it to the next  cave that we're going to go to

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.220
So as you can see there's rope in here and this is just to help guide you through

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.310
Because it is quite a maze

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560
once you get in here then

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.669
Gotta go through all your hands and knees a few spots

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.829
You can see how tight it is in here

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.019
Almost stand up on your knees

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.989
There's two ways to go once you get in here.  Go this way which is the way we're gonna go and then also

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.470
go back this way which comes straight up where we're gonna meet on the other side anyway, so

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.630
Let's go this way

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.910
So this is the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.710
little

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.270
memorial for

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.270
General Kuribayashi

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
And it looks like he's got some friends here

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.970
No, actually we steamed up didn't we?

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.990
Yeah, there we go

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.560
So you got somebody's got company.  This is a picture of him and

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.788
Offerings for him. Alright, let's continue on

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.849
It's another little room here

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:50.169
And then once you get in here you can stand up and move a little bit more wait, let's see

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.389
Tunnels everywhere

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.210
So

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.210
Listen, here's the main cavern

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:06.969
The cave it just got like about five degrees 5-10 degrees warmer in here

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.740
But you look around in the cave

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.969
There breathing a little hard cuz it's a little bit hard to breathe in here

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:28.899
I wish they had the lights on then it's a lot easier to see what's going on for some reason

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.229
staying blurry

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.000
All the offerings and shrines this used to be a generator

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.919
Alright, so we're just gonna continue on a

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.729
Little red sign right there. I don't know if you can shine the light on the white sign

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.490
right there that says a

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.950
Kikken which means

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320
dangerous.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.960
So let's continue walking

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.870
Yeah

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.910
See some rebar and it just got like even warmer in this spot right here

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.180
kind of crazy

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:29.580
That goes back a little ways not sure where that one goes because you can see starting to fog up because in the warmer

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.140
And then this goes up to where he actually slept was up here

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.959
If I can get up there without knocking myself out

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.299
Actually, we're not gonna go up there just because the footing is not so great

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:13.750
See how it's getting really tight. Sorry, sorry about the fogging up

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.059
Then there's little spaces like this

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.800
There's a other passageway around here somewhere

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:35.149
Yeah

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:36.860
Right here

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.940
I've never gone all the way down to the bottom of this so I have no idea

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.940
What's down here,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.570
but

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.570
it looks like it just

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.149
Goes to the bottom and it caves in

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:52.209
That's what it kind of looks like. So I'm

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.630
not going to go down there any further than we have to

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.779
So you can see how they scrape these out

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.300
Dug in well

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.139
Just mind-boggling. How much work

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.810
was put into

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.910
Digging these tunnels out

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.570
So as you can see it's getting a little bit

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:32.740
Lower in here hands and knees work here then we're gonna be on

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.190
Another side lost my lights to get up here

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.600
Let's get up here up on my light back on and it's really hot up in here

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.830
Got warm didn't it? Yeah..

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.099
It's kind of hard to see up, let me wipe off the lens again

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:26.589
So we're leaving the General's cave actually now

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.510
And we'll go over to the Medical Officer's cave which that was probably it there

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:36.489
Now we're just going to be creeping out the other side of that cave over here

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.250
hopefully

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.950
See machine parts here junk just left

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.479
Some more radio parts it looks like

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.150
Alcohol bottle is an offering

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.119
And me being a big guy like I am I got a crawl this spot throughout

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.510
We're actually almost out the other side you can see

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.370
Things left in

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.059
Kind of feel it's getting a little bit cooler fresh air around

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.190
See the exit right here.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.470
That was the General's Cave

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.079
That came up on Medical Officer's side

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.350
Actually

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.340
So here we are at the Medical Cave

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:55.160
There's a generator. So there's actually some pretty decent lighting in here and again in the cave

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.469
you're going to see some water bottles some beer bottles and

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.319
Trash on the side. It does for

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.799
Offering so don't be surprised is there for a reason so all right, let's roll

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:18.740
So as you can see

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.180
There's a lot of stuff left over they did that because this is one of the main tourist cave

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.199
That is totally okay for anybody to come into that comes out here

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.309
so

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.899
Nobody's walking on graves

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:37.458
Nobody's doing anything like that has already been excavated as much as it can be excavated and deemed safe for entry. So

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.159
See there's barrels in here. There's all types of

00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:47.749
Old stuff

00:13:49.499 --> 00:13:55.489
We're gonna walk around the corner up here and you're gonna be totally surprised that the temperature difference because it goes from a

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.159
Probably a balmy eighty degrees right here to a balmy hundred and ten up around the corner

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.929
It seem to used to have more lights it seems like but

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.219
You can see there's a lot of people that have come up in here

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:20.239
But this is the old medical cave for the Japanese. So whenever wounded soldiers that come in here for

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.800
medical

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.859
Yeah, get right here. It starts getting hot

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:29.959
Around here to another

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:38.569
Monument for offerings little shrine for offerings just so the dead can go peacefully

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:47.149
Come back here

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.079
When it comes up

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:51.079
Right here, and that's it. And

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.389
Actually here. It's cooler then right here

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.100
And so so that was this cave I'm sure it was a lot larger than this day before some of the cave-ins it's happened

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:11.378
He had little partners a little warm a little warm

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.050
it looks like actually they

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.309
Stacked up these rocks along the wall higher than they were the last time I was here. I

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.610
wonder why

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:32.349
It's just really interesting to see

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:42.248
All right, so here we are we're standing in front of the Last Stand Cave

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:46.178
It's called the Last Stand Cave because this is actually the last real

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:47.929
battle

00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:49.929
cave that there was

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:55.419
30 soldiers jumped out at the Americans and it was that it was like their last Banzai charge

00:15:55.819 --> 00:15:58.748
So we're gonna walk through the cave right shortly

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:03.099
You're gonna see some stuff that looks like trash and it is true

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:09.730
Some of it is trash but it's also offerings and there's some artifacts are better left over some helmets some guns

00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:11.949
from the time that this cave was

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.730
excavated so let's hit it.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.779
Alright, so we're gonna go walk down the middle

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.819
Cave here and they all actually kind of link in together as you can see

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:28.178
But I want to get a good get a good look at the items that are left over here

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.208
So kind of interesting

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:38.169
Here's here's some helmets from soldiers some guns

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.570
Some sake bottles, water bottles you see a lot of water bottles and that's because they were in

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:57.490
Dehydration mode at this time water was running, low food running, low supplies running low

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.450
So that's why you see a lot of water bottles

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:14.558
You can see the caves not too small really I mean, I I can almost stand up in it

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.470
goes this way

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.480
this way

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.119
once you come in here though, it gets kind of deep and

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.600
If you go this way

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.809
This little sign right here says that there's a there's well Oh over here

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.339
Well opening so you got to be careful

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:40.809
Mm-hmm

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:49.300
Yeah, it's right here so I'm not gonna get too close but you can see down

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.309
Kind of dangerous so so that's really

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:02.530
Amazing to see and just come around here and then it stops right here

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.070
So odds are

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.950
this

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.350
Little hole right here

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.150
had some ladders going down so that way they could have more places to

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.919
Yeah, that's really far down oh, yeah you can see down

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.509
And then as we go back out we're gonna go to the left here

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:44.149
Both food people brought out food for offerings and stuff

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.450
Let's see on their way up right there

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.420
Come over here

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.849
Not not too much in this cave actually then it comes up right here

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.550
Went down here, but it looks like it's all caved in. Here's

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:32.360
This this comes down to where we came down into the tunnel and then come on on out
