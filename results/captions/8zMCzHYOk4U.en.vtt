00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.300
D'you know, this is the only comedian I've ever found funny.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.020
Well, look Gatis. Welcome back. The stage is yours.
- Good luck.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.840

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.220
So you know that now is after few cold days, it's getting warm outside

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.840
and I like the warm weather

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420
because it makes me warmer

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.140
That's my warm-up joke

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.200
When my chicken has a birthday, I don't tell him

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.960
because he would not understand.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.320

-Three..

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.060

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.890
Yeah let me hear it... 
- woof, woof, woof, woof.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.500
I'm not sure they're gonna understand

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.640
can you try with my accent? 
- vouf, vouf, vouf, vouf!

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.680
thank you for making me sound so sexy

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.760

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.940

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.780
well i do!

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.580
and every time I do I always walk to them and  I stare directly at them

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.420
and usually they stopped and then they ask me:

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.940
Do you mind? and I'm like: I don't mind

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.760

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.580

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.640
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.370
face the mu... 
(ahem)

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.810
the Impressions

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.840
actually doing the the x-factor guy

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.840
all we have to do is right at the very end

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.760
roar like a lion

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.100
Simon Cowell

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.900
Thank you and shh

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.020
here we could work with a whole plethora

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.650
of strange and fascinating creatures and

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.740
That's good. Nice

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.460
Yeah! Yes!

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:13.580
the obligatory wild pack of street dancers and the balding middle-aged car enthusiasts

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.780
To the body on this i love the sexy

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.310
curvers. The exquisite contours but

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:28.000
most importantly the two big air bags

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.040
So actually to do Jeremy you just have to

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.170
get a few key points in you have to

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.810
start low go up like this

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:40.450
pause and go back down like this

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.000
So once you've got your Jeremy it's very

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.840
easy to slip in to Gok. It's all

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.060
about workin it and twerkin it and lookin good.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.540
Eh Eh. Big boy. Yes. Look at me eh

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.300
well done yes. To do Gordon you have to jump

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.470
up and down as if you're absolutely

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.340
busting for the toilet. Yes?

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.890
and the other guy that also talks in

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:11.080
quite a breath manner who's not a million

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.460
miles away. There he is, a gentleman.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.000
To do an impression on Declan..
 What are you doin?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.549
he also talks very pointed and staccato

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:22.490
is this guy now to do your Declan

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.159
Donnelly what you have to do is always

00:25:25.159 --> 00:25:27.230
look like you're on the verge of

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.770
laughing out loud

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.860
whilst sharing a cheeky little in joke with

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.980
members of the crew. Gary on camera two

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.680
he gets it.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.620
No one ever tries to do me.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.780
Who's this?

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:54.400
If Declan Donnelly ever decided..

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.940
if Declan decided to go into politics

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.160
what you have to do is send him to Eton

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.770
lower his voice and then you would have um...

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.750
this chap. Now to do your Boris you have to

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.750
talk at different speeds whilst looking like

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.950
you've been up all night

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:19.800
downing tequila in a bush. Good night. Thank you.
