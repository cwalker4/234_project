00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.700
Trump voters: two years in, here’s an updated
list of Trump’s 30 biggest broken promises.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.060
1. He told you he’d cut your taxes, and that
the super-rich like him would pay more.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.539
You bought it.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.560
But his 2017 tax law has done the opposite.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.480
By 2027, according to the nonpartisan Tax
Policy Center, the richest 1 percent will

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.180
have received 83 percent of the tax cut and
the richest 0.1 percent, 60 percent of it.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.539
But more than half of all Americans — 53
percent — will pay more in taxes.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.149
As Trump told his wealthy friends at Mar-a-Lago
just days after the tax bill became law, “You

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.820
all just got a lot richer.”

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.400
2.He promised that the average family would
see a $4,000 pay raise because of the tax

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.420
law.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.650
You bought it.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.680
But real wages for most Americans are lower
today than they were before the tax law went

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.880
into effect.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.200
3. He promised to close special interest loopholes
that have been so good for Wall Street investors

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.110
but unfair to American workers, especially
the notorious “carried interest” loophole

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.550
for private-equity, hedge fund, and real estate
partners.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.840
You bought it.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.740
But the new tax law kept the “carried interest”
loophole.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.960
4. He promised to bring an end to Kim Jong-Un’s
nuclear program.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.159
You bought it.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.500
Kim Jong-Un hasn’t denuclearized.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.280
5. He told you he’d repeal Obamacare and replace
it with something “beautiful,” including

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.070
“insurance for everybody.”

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.450
You bought it.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.540
But he didn’t repeal and he didn’t replace.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.420
Which is just as well: His plan would have knocked
at least 24 million Americans off health insurance,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.600
including many of you.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.490
Instead, he’s doing what he can to cut it
back and replace it with nothing.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.700
According to the Commonwealth Fund, about
4 million Americans have lost health insurance

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.980
in the last two years.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.780
6.  He told you he wouldn’t “cut Social Security
like every other Republican and I’m not

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540
going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.”

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.560
You bought it.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.110
But now he’s planning such cuts in order
to deal with the ballooning deficit created,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.500
in part, by the new tax law for corporations
and the rich.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.860
7. He promised to protect anyone with pre-existing
conditions.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.980
You bought it.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.840
But in June, his Justice Department told a
federal court it would no longer defend provisions

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.430
of Obamacare that protect patients with pre-existing
conditions.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.640
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the decision
was made with Trump’s approval.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.300
8. He said he’d build a “wall” across the
southern border.You believed him.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.480
But there’s no wall.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.280
9. He told you he’d invest $1 trillion in our
nation’s crumbling infrastructure.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.400
You bought it.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.239
But after his giant tax cut for corporations
and millionaires, there’s no money left

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.120
for infrastructure.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.660
10. He said he’d drain the Washington swamp.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.390
You bought it.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.019
But he’s brought into his administration
more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.500
than in any administration in history, to
make laws that will enrich their businesses,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.129
and he’s filled departments and agencies
with former lobbyists, lawyers and consultants

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.100
who are crafting new policies for the same
industries they recently worked for.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.860
11. He promised to reinstitute a five-year ban
on all executive branch officials lobbying

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.370
the government for five years after they leave
government.”

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.489
You bought it.

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.470
But the five-year ban he signed applies only
to lobbying one’s former agency, not the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.080
government as a whole, and it doesn’t stop
former officials from becoming lobbyists.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.140
12. He said he’d use his business experience
to whip the White House into shape.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.140
You bought it.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.269
But he has created the most dysfunctional,
back-stabbing White House in modern history,

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.720
and has already fired and replaced so many
assistants that people there barely know who’s

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.360
in charge of what.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.480
13. He told you he’d “bring down drug prices”
by negotiating “like crazy” with drug

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.640
companies.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.080
You bought it.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.140
But he hasn’t.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.860
14. He told you he’d “stop foreign lobbyists
from raising money for American elections.”

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.860
You bought it.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.780
But foreign lobbyists are still raising money
for American elections.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.460
15. He promised “six weeks of paid maternity
leave to any mother with a newborn child whose

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.600
employer does not provide the benefit.”

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.540
You bought it.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.240
But the giant tax cut for corporations and
the rich doesn’t leave any money for this.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:24.280
16. He said he’d create tax-free dependent care
savings accounts for younger and elderly dependents,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.520
and have the government match contributions
low-income families put into their savings

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.040
accounts.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
You bought it.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.500
He’s done neither.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.060
17. He said that on Day One he’d label China
a “currency manipulator.”

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.680
You bought it.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.440
But then he declared China is not a currency
manipulator.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.960
18. He said he “won’t bomb Syria.”

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.160
You bought it.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Then he bombed Syria.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.420
19. After pulling out of the Paris accord, he
said he’d negotiate a better deal on the

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.860
environment.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.040
You bought it.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.800
There have been no negotiations.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.900
20. He promised that the many women who accused
him of sexual misconduct “will be sued after

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.900
the election is over.”

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.580
You bought it.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.240
He hasn’t sued them, presumably because
he doesn’t want the truth to come out.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.500
21. He said he would not be a president who took
vacations, and criticized Barack Obama for

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.340
taking too many.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.780
You bought it.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.580
But since becoming President, he has spent
a quarter of his days at one of his golf properties.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.100
22. Trump vowed to “push colleges to cut the
skyrocketing cost of tuition.”

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.130
You believed him.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.440
But he hasn't.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.040
Instead, he's made it easier for for-profit
college to defraud students.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.940
23.  He said he’d force companies to keep jobs
in America, and that there would be consequences

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.020
for companies that shipped jobs abroad, especially
government contractors.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.580
You believed him.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.400
But never before in U.S. history have federal
contractors sent so many jobs overseas.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.840
There have been no consequences.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.340
24. He promised to end DACA.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.660
You bought it.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.770
Then in January 2018 promised that "DACA recipients
should not to be concerned...

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.640
"We're going to solve the problem,” he said. Then
he reversed himself again and vowed to end

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.800
the program by March, 2018.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.920
Currently, the federal courts have stayed
any action on it.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:04.960
25. He promised to revive the struggling coal
industry and bring back lost coal mining jobs.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960
You bought it.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:13.360
But coal is still losing customers as utilities
turn to natural gas and renewable power.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.380
26. He promised to protect American steel jobs.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.000
You bought it.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.110
His tariffs on steel have protected some steel
jobs.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.750
But industries that use steel -- like automakers
and construction -- now have to pay more for

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.000
the steel they use, with the result that their
jobs are threatened.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.630
The Trade Partnership projects that 400,000
jobs will be lost among steel and aluminum

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.640
users.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.380
27. He said he’d make America safer.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.450
You believed him.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:56.200
But mass shootings keep rising, and Trump
has failed to pass effective gun control legislation.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.020
After 17 died in Parkland, Florida, Trump
promised “immediate action” on gun safety

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.840
in schools, but has done nothing.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.700
28. He promised to make two- and four-year colleges
more affordable.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.920
You bought it.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.490
But Trump's most recent budget contains deep
cuts in aid for low-income and first-generation

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:26.200
college students, reduces Federal Work Study,
and eliminates the 50-year-old Federal Supplemental

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.970
Educational Opportunity Grant program, which
goes to more than a million poor college kids

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.380
each year.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.700
29. He promised to eliminate the federal deficit
and bring down the debt.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.780
You bought it.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.880
Yet due to his massive tax cut mostly for
corporations and the rich, and his military

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.710
spending, the deficit is set to rise to $1
trillion, and the debt has ballooned to more

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.200
than $21 trillion.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.700
30. He said he’d release his taxes.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.700
“I’m under a routine audit and it’ll
be released, and as soon as the audit is finished

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.550
it will be released,” he promised during
the campaign.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.540
You bought it.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.600
He still hasn’t released his taxes.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.240
What do you think?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.160
Are there any broken promises I missed?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.810
