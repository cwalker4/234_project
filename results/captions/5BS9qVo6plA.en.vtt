00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.920
The remote town
of Urique, Mexico,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.960
has a famous ultramarathon
called the Caballo Blanco.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.160
The course is 50 miles long
through an unforgiving terrain

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.800
unlike anything I've
ever experienced.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.560
What makes this
ultramarathon so unique

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.960
isn't just the distance and
terrain, but the runners--

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.880
local villagers who
consist of anything

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.080
from elderly women
running in sandals

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.800
to teenagers running
in boots and jeans,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.480
all without proper training.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.920
Joining them are visitors
from around the world,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.160
who travel thousands of miles
to run alongside the Rarámuri.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920
I am here to discover
the passion that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.720
drives these superhero athletes
to run such an intense race.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.960 line:0%
My name is Colin O'Brady.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.520
I'm a professional
endurance athlete.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.400
I'm a two-time world record
holder in mountaineering.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.440
I'm on the summit
of Mount Everest!

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.520
I've come here to
Mexico to compete

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.240
in the famous ultramarathon,
the Caballo Blanco,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.360 line:0%
named after an American runner
who came to the Copper Canyon

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.960
many years ago.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600
One of the most
famous Tarahumara who

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.440 line:0%
ran with him, Arnulfo, has
come to race once more,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.040 line:0%
and I'm lucky
enough to meet him.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.800
Before Caballo Blanco passed
away, did you know him?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.840
Was he a friend of yours?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.160
Yes I knew him,
he was the one who

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.760
first invited me to run here.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.400
I liked him a lot.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920
He was really supportive.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.360
I won three times when
he invited me here.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.560
I'm gonna run with
shoes on,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280
but are you going to be
running in these?

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280
Huarache lunas

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.520
-Huarache lunas
-Ay.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.600
And tell me about
running in those.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.640
Is it difficult?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.040
Running shoes cramp my feet.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080
Yeah, I like
huaraches a lot more.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.120
And do these ever
break when they run,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.960
or are they very strong?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.640
No, they last one day.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880
It's only one piece of string.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.000
Yeah, you wrap it around.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.320
Wow.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.960
I've been a big fan, and you're
a huge inspiration for me.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.520
So it's a dream come
true to meet you.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.560
-Uh-huh.
-Thank you very much.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.680
Thank you very much.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.160
Miguel, who was the winner
of last year's competition,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800
lives just a few
miles from here.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.680 line:0%
My name is Miguel
Lara Viniegras.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.680
I'm from the Poroche
community here in Urique.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.400
And, well, I'm a Tarahumara.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.160
So I've always run.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.720
I like to run with other people
to learn from what they know.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.640
I also like to win.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.240
I counted my medals last
year and there were 57.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.720
Almost all of them were
in first or second.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.200
It's only a short walk
for us to get to Urique.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.240
I think it's about
50 kilometers.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.000
It's normal for us to run
100 kilometers, or 80 or 60.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240
Como estas?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.960
-Good, you?
-Me llamo Colin.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.440
I've heard that you've
won this race before.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.480
Is that right?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.200
Yeah, I won three times.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.240
-Three times?
-Sí.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.240
How many hours does
it take to finish the race?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.440
About six and a half hours.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.920
That's my best.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.560
How long do you think
it's going to take me?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.600
This is my very first time.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.840
Honestly, I don't know.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.040
I'd have to see how you walk.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.040
For me, it's a great
honor to be here with you.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.720
Hopefully I'll learn
some of your tips

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.520
and be able to complete
the race tomorrow.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.120
I noticed that you are
actually wearing

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.520
the huarache sandals right now.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.760
So are you going to plan
to run in those tomorrow?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.840
No.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.440
I just bought these from
here because these epitomize

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.400
the resilience and
the determination

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.600
of the local people here.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.800
So no, I thought
I'd give it a go.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280
-They're really comfortable.
-All right.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.480
I think I'm gonna
try on a pair.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480
Let's give it a go.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.680
Yeah, they feel
pretty good, right?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.560
Should we give it a
little bit of a test run?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.000
-I think that's a good idea.
-All right.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.800
Let's do this.
Let's get a little jog.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.360
But they're surprisingly
comfortable.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.200
They're really light,
really comfortable, yeah.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.560
I can see how they
could be good.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560
I know my front foot is used
to having a little more, like,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.160
shock absorbing coming down.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.680
Hey, good luck on
the race tomorrow.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.760
-We'll see you out there.
-Yeah, see you there.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.040
It's 5:00 AM.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.480
Headed to the race.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.720
Going to be
an epic day out here

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.000
running with the Tarahumara.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.280
What a dream come true.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.480
I'll see how the day goes.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.040
The course is hilly
and kind of winding.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.160
Some big steep hills
fall in this river here.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.560 line:0%
People have tripped and fallen.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.880 line:0%
There was a little
bit of a stream cross

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.200 line:0%
where people were just
jumping over rocks.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.440
But the Tarahumara
seem to not be phased,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.000
running straight through
the stream in their sandals.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.040
I'm feeling kind of soft
compared to them, to be honest.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.920
Man, that was steep up there.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.000
It was a tiny little
single-track trail,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.600
switchbacking all
the way up to the top

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.720
and then running
all the way down.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.400
The downhill's kind
of crushing my legs.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.600 line:0%
But I think, what,
three hours, 15 minutes

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.480 line:0%
in, we've done almost 20 miles
or so, so definitely starting

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.680
to feel the fatigue.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.240
It's hot and
challenging and hard,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.360
but the environment and
being here in this place

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.200
is just keeping me
motivated to keep going.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.880
Wow.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.280 line:0%
Crushing it in first
place for the 80K.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.520 line:0%
This is where it goes from
the physical to the mental.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.600
It's up here.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.160
We have a champion!

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.080 line:0%
It's a local champion!

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.280 line:0%
Miguel Lara!

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.000 line:0%
Eighty kilometers!

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.040
Last mile.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.040
Coming into town.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.600
Woo.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.320
The course is hard.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.480
Mental toughness,
physical toughness.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.040
I've seen it all today.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.480
Number 490 is saying
hi to his audience!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.960
Oh, just finished the marathon.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.760
What an incredible experience.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.360
Really tested me today,
but so inspired being here.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360
Like I said, a dream come
true to be out running

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.520
with the Tarahumara.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.120
I'll remember this for
the rest of my life.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.440
Welcome to this awards
ceremony for the winners.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.120
Congratulations, my friend.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.360
How do you feel?

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.520
Not too bad, just recuperating
a little from feeling tired.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.600
Yeah, I broke my
personal record.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.760
The time I had before was 6:25
and this time I broke 6:18.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.600
It was amazing to run with you.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.840
For me, it was such an
inspiration to see you running.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.760
A very good job
to you, my friend.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.280
Congratulations to you
and to your family.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.640
I've competed in
triathlons professionally

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.920
all over the world,
completing the Iron Man,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.800
but the challenge
today was truly unique.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.000
Just having the opportunity
to run through the Copper

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.880
Canyon, this beautiful
place, was incredible enough.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.640
But having the opportunity to
run alongside the Tarahumara,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.560
some of the world's
greatest runners,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.680
was something I
will never forget.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.480
The way they competed with
such poise, humility, strength,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.280
I really don't know
how they do it.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.280
The journey today was something
I will never forget and cherish

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.480
as I compete in other endurance
events around the world.
