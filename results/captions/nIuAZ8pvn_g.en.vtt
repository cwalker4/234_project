00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.720
The most credible threat to U.S Navy surface
combatants like destroyers and supercarrier

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.140
comes from the anti-ship missile.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.370
One of the most potent anti-ship missiles
is the Brahmos missile.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.730
The BrahMos cruise missile is produced by
India-based BrahMos Aerospace, set up in 1998,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.820
and is a joint venture between India’s Defense
Research and Development Organization (DRDO)

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.420
and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyenia.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.720
India is an ally of US and Indo-American relationship
has been getting stronger in the last decade.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.750
But this is not the case with Russia which
is a rival.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.649
In this video Defense Updates, analyzes if
U.S Navy can defend against Brahmos missile?

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.100
Let's get in the details.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.759
Brahmos weigh in at 3000 kg, has a length
of 8.4 m and diameter of 0.6 m.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.320
It has a solid fuel rocket booster for the
first stage and liquid-fueled ramjet for the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.880
second stage.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.250
Brahmos can be launched from aircraft, land
installations and warships.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.120
It is being tested for induction into submarines
also.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.759
A hypersonic version of the missile, BrahMos-II,
is also presently under development with a

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.260
speed of Mach 7-8 to boost aerial fast strike
capability.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.100
It is expected to be ready for testing by
2020

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.780
Brahmos is currently considered to be one
of a most deadly anti-ship missile.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.979
The reason is its unique features.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.020
Let's check them.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.580
1. It has a supersonic speed of Mach 3 or 1 km
per second providing very little time to intercept.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.360
2. Brahmos uses a 300 kg Semi-Armor piercing
warhead and also has very high Kinetic energy

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.840
since Kinetic energy is directly proportional
to the square of velocity.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.260
Brahmos actually has about 9 times the Kinetic
Energy of conventional subsonic missile

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.480
like Tomahawk.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.220
The combined destructive force of massive
warhead and kinetic energy is lethal for even

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.630
the biggest surface combatants.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.960
Brahmas has been known to break ships in half
in several tests.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.860
3. It can perform S maneuvers in final stages
of flight.The missile basically doesn’t

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.800
move in straight line, making it very hard
to intercept.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.340
4. There are lots of redundancies in the guidance
system - right from the INS, GPS, GLONASS

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.840
and GAGAN making it hard to jam.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.520
5.The accuracy of around 1 square meter makes
it apt for a precision strike on high-value targets.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.420
6. Russia is a signatory of the MTCR (Missile
Technology Control Regime) and India was not.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.840
According to the MTCR guidelines Russia could
not help or jointly develop a missile with

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.719
a none MTCR nation, whose range is more than
300 KM.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.090
This is why Brahmos range had to be limited
below 300 KM initially.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.249
But last year India has entered MTCR and both
countries are now working to increase the

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.470
range to 600 km.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.860
The excellent range will enable it to be launched
from standoff distances.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.170
The best defense against the Brahmos missile
is to destroy the launch platforms before

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.900
the missile could be launched.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.459
The diverse launch platform makes this task
difficult but not impossible.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.400
Once the Brahmos gets launched successfully,
it's a totally different ball game.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.020
The normal procedure is to direct fighter
jets from nearby aircraft carriers towards

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.239
the incoming missile and shoot it down.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.139
But this is not a viable option against Brahmos
because of its Mach 3 speed.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.380
US Navy will mainly depend on the onboard
weaponry for defense and there are 3 of those.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.540
1. The Medium range defense is provided by Evolved
Sea Sparrow Missile which is quad packed and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.300
has a range of 50 km range.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.180
2. RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile is present
for point defense in U.S supercarrier and

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.900
not on destroyers.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.320
These have a speed of Mach 2 and range of
9 km.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.580
3. Phalanx CIWS is a close-in weapon system is
present for last-ditch defense.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.620
It has 3,000 rounds/minute rate of fire and
has a maximum firing range of 3.5 km.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.080
For the analysis, we are considering a salvo
of 8 Brahmos, half of what a new generation

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.040
of Russian frigates carries.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.000
There are potentially 2 scenarios.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.400
1. Solitary warship like an Arleigh Burke-class
destroyer is targeted.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.460
2. A U.S Carrier Battle Group is attacked.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.910
When a warship is alone and not having AWACS
cover then the BrahMos will be detected at

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.570
about 35-40 km from the ship when it is in
its sea-skimming terminal phase and on the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.360
verge of employing evasive S maneuvers.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.770
The warship will have 35 - 40 seconds to react.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.020
The 2 layer defense of Arleigh Burke theoretically
be able to defend against all missile but

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.770
practically it may be able to intercept only
3-4 of the missile.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.421
It is highly likely that the warship will
be knocked out.

00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:34.840
A U.S Carrier Battle Group always has an AWACS
cover and Brahmos will be most likely be detected

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.900
at around 150 km range.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.100
The flotilla will have around 150 seconds
to react.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.260
The Carrier Battle Group with multiple destroyer
and frigates travel in such a formation that

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.390
supercarrier is not directly in the line of
fire.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.250
The ships will also be able to coordinate
the defenses.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.020
In this case, the outer layer of destroyer(and
frigates) will be able to intercept most of

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.370
the missiles or could also maneuver to take
hits to protect the supercarrier.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.710
Still, it is not impossible that 1-2 may sneak
in and home in on the supercarrier.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.110
The 3 layer defense of the supercarrier may
be able to take those out all of those on

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.610
some occasions and may not on some other.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.580
So, it is difficult to predict and results
will vary but the potential of Brahmos can

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.890
be judged by the fact that few of these launched
in salvo has the capability to challenge multi-billion

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.260
dollar warships of the U.S Navy.
