00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
most people wouldn't consider never 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
missing a basket while playing 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
basketball to be a superpower players in 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the NBA do this on a nightly basis this 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
does however become a superpower when 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the person who is never missing a basket 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is only 18 months old not years months 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this little boy uses a plastic 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
basketball hoop like most kids his age 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and he doesn't use an earth ball he uses 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a regulation ball at regulation height 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and he never misses a shot number 2 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Elizabeth Barrett Elizabeth Barrett can 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
read just about any book that you put in 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
front of her if she were ten years old 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this would be impressive but nothing 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
major 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
what makes Elizabeth so amazing is that 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
she is only 17 months old both her 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
parents are speech pathologists and her 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
mother believes that the fact that she 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
used sign language to speak to her 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
daughter since birth is the reason that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
she can read better than many adults 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
she's not just memorizing the words of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the books either she's actually learning 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
them compare that to the atrocious 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
grammar and spelling you'll see in the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
comments of this video and you'll see it 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
is a superpower number three Brock brown 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Brock brown is a very tall teenager when 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
he was just five years old he was 5 feet 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
2 inches tall when his parents took him 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to see a doctor they diagnosed him with 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
cerebral gigantism the condition is very 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
rare and kids with this condition often 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
don't typically live longer than 10 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
years old so far Brock has defied the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
odds he's 19 years old he currently is 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
not the tallest man in the world however 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
considering that he has been growing 6 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
inches per year that will probably 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
happen soon he's so big that traditional 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
furniture is too small for him and his 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
parents have to order his furniture 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000

Shapiro is still in high school yet he 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
may be one of the strongest people in 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the world pull-ups can be very difficult 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
for most people even avid weight lifters 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
can 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
tire out quickly andrew is a different 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
story he's broken plenty of world 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
records for his amazing strength and his 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
insane ability to do pull-ups in a span 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of 18 hours he was able to do 7306 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
pull-ups during a span of six hours he 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
was able to do over 3500 pull-ups his 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
most recent record was broken when he 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
did over 5700 pull-ups in just over 12 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
hours for most people breaking any of 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
those records would be absolutely 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
impossible my arms are aching just 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000

in just nine point eight four seconds he 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
has a huge future and running and it's 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
only a matter of time before he wins a 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
gold medal at the Olympics be watching 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000

ELISA is able to read words backward 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
just as easily she can read them forward 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
she can even rearrange words in her head 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
so quickly that you would think it is 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
the simplest task in the world well it 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
