00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.389
Read instead of reading the newspaper. I have to read a biography and fit it in hmm. You know it

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.949
Wow an amazing process. Hey, I think that leads really well into my first question if you're ready to roll. I'm ready to roll

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.950
Sure. Oh, all right

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.299
And where do I look look at you?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.639
That'd be great. Let's move other direction. No

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.279
Conversation

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.279
Here's a time when being aggressive is good

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.260
You want to be aggressive with your work? You want it to succeed you want to be persistent?

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:38.909
When something is unjust in this world when you think something is unfair you want to be aggressive in finding it? Okay?

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.139
I know I'm aggressive here. I can show so awareness of your nature is

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.049
So much better than denial and repression

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.739
So Robert, my first question is

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.230
The relationship of mastering something and time. How do you navigate that?

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.369
Are there shortcuts are there ways to to get there a little quicker things like reading maybe

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.820
Well, I'm of the belief

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.729
That if you want a shortcut

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.879
You're already not very well-suited for becoming a master

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.249
Your need for a shortcut is a bad ideas already a sign of trouble

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.720
To master anything you need patience

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.989
You need to know about the 10,000 hour rule

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.000
Which is a bit of a cliche now everyone sort of spouts talks about it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.479
Nobody really understands or has gone into very few. People have gone into depth about what that means

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.539
It's a great study that pretty much

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.529
demonstrated that after 10,000 hours of

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.119
repetition and

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.119
practicing a particular skill set

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.360
something literally happens to the human brain a

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.469
transformation occurs and the study was based on

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.229
simple things that you could study like chess

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.089
where you're basically playing the same game and you've put in 10,000 hours and you have a mastery of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.770
The board and the process you're not having to think anymore. And so after studying great chess players and musicians

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.059
It was determined that reaching at 10,000. Our mark was something magical now it could be

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.729
9,000 9,500 hours. It could be 10,000. It depends there's a little leeway, but it's it's great science. So

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.689
To answer your question. You have to be willing to go through that process and go through those hours

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:38.379
Every field is different some fields require several skills. You're not just learning chess

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.349
You're learning business and you're learning the tech certain technical aspects and etc

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:52.209
You're combining skills. So that might require a little bit more than 10,000 hours. But the idea that I can somehow

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.509
Short-circuit the process is a bad

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.509
Psychology, you're already setting yourself up for failure and impatience. I say that there's one

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.149
Shortcut that I will be willing to acknowledge and that is having a great mentor. Mhm. So

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.729
if you have somebody who is an expert in the field or you respect and has already put in the 10,000 or

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.079
20,000 or 30,000 hours that person can steer you they can say look Brendon

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.669
you you were

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.969
Pretty good at this skill, but you have this weakness

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.029
start working more on that and normally if you didn't have a mentor you might our

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.569
Tendency in practice and practicing a skill is to prat over practice what we're already good at

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:48.789
So let's just take basketball. For instance. You have a great outside shot. It's three-point shot, but you really suck

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.370
when it comes to

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.379
taking your you're the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840
defender off the dribble and

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
you know being able to

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.159
Create some space for a shot or a layup

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.709
Your tendency will be to practice that outside three-point shot because you're already good at it and it feels good

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.578
and it's fun and you don't want to have to practice taking someone off the dribble because it's

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.279
Hard you have to work with a defender. It's it that

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:18.339
you have to overcome that and practice exactly what you're not good at and it's not easy a

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.309
mentor will tell you well, look at you and say you were weak here practice that

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.840
Also say avoid this don't waste time here

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.009
They could cut that

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.989
$10,000 down to nine thousand maybe if they're really good. They're really smart or

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.399
Instead of wasting your time and you having to go to twelve thousand hours. They'll bring it down closer to that target level

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.500
That's the only shortcut I will acknowledge

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.050
but in general

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.600
Relying on that crutch thinking in your mind goddamn if I can find an alga

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.049
Shortcut it you're already a loser. Yeah in my book. Yeah, so get over that

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.709
Embrace the pain is what I say

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.690
Pain is good for you. It's great for you when you workout

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.720
We all like to work out. I'm a fanatic working out and particularly swimming is my thing

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:20.279
It's painful. Yeah, you know I swim long distances. I used to swim several miles now

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.280
I can only do my can mile and a half at the most

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.000
But you know you reach the half a mile or three-quarters a moment

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.599
It's like this is no fun. But when you finish and you go through weeks and months you feel

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.119
Some you the value that you get is much greater than the pain

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.369
That pain that resistance is good for you and the idea that you want to

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.429
Sweet, you're sweeten the pot and or a short cut or get something, you know, like a sugar high

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.309
You're already and you're already on dangerous ground

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.010
Yeah

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.010
So were you naturally?

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.759
inclined to do things like these long swims and and take on pain and

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.709
Go through a rigorous writing process or did you have a way to build into taking pain?

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:13.380
I probably have a high tolerance for pain. I kind of probably built up. I don't know what that mean. It's a good question

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:21.959
Some of it I think is slightly genetic. It's hard to say. I know my father for instance was very meticulous

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.690
He was not an intellectual or by any means he was somebody really good with his hands

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.280
I told he was a mechanic in the Navy. He loved building models and he would build

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.760
elaborate models of ships

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.690
You know 18th century 17th century galleys galleons, etc

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.969
And I didn't watch him and he's just incredibly patient for that kind of detail

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.630
I had no patience for working with my hands. I'm not very good at that

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.929
So, but maybe I kind of inherited that a little bit

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.830
and

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.100
some of it, you know, when you're younger when you're in your 20s, I probably didn't have

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.510
Nearly as much patience as I did you've got that youthful energy

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.440
You're bursting you want to try many different things, you know

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.179
It's so I'm sure when I was in my 20s. I was a bit scattered and trying different things

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.159
But I found working on books

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.490
The kind of books I write was actually the perfect thing for me

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.389
If I never found the kind of book like the 48 laws of power

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.810
I might not have amounted to much because I am a little bit

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.230
Scattered by nature and having to write a book made me focus

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:45.909
made me it it worked into all of my strengths mmm because I love reading so I think

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.860
writing the books has kind of altered my brain and made me a

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:57.100
Lot better able to withstand that but when it came to exercise, I've always sort of liked

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.650
long distances

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.790
cross-country running I can't do that anymore, but I used to run I

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.250
don't know why but I liked the distance type things where you had to overcome your

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.679
Your own mind you had to kind of discipline your own that those levels of pain

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.759
So I always sort of enjoyed that kind of thing. Maybe I have a masochist at all

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.970
Well, maybe I have to I was a cross-country runner in college

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.780
Yeah could completely relate

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:30.639
Well, also those two things like cross-country running or the sweat of swimming distances, very meditative. Mhm

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.970
You kind of zone out after several miles running

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.119
It's kind of nice you get a little bit of a high from it. You think that high gets addicting? Yeah, absolutely

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.110
so so to this idea of shortcuts and maybe a mentor being

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.749
The shortcut there is one you've talked to mastery about how you can you can learn from a book

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.920
how you can kind of see a book as

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.779
A mentor and you can even have a conversation with the author you can read in a more active way

00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:58.179
How how should someone go about that process?

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.869
Well god that's a good question, I talked a little bit about it in my new book a

00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:12.249
Lot of the time when you're reading a book. It depends on on what the book is about. Really? I mean

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.920
You're kind of

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.529
the material that you're reading is you tend to make it dead and I'm

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.318
Thinking what you want to do is to make it all come to life

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.229
So reading a book is like bringing something dead to life. It's like taking

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:31.370
Frankenstein and

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.669
Imbuing it with life. Now. What do I mean by that? Well, you're kind of reading it

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.229
Mechanically just the words. You're not paying great attention

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:45.729
You don't realize that the writer if it's a good writer

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:53.289
When they had those thoughts that they're writing about it was something very exciting to them at the moment

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.699
very alive

00:09:55.699 --> 00:10:00.639
And they tried to put it on paper and and whenever you write an idea

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.939
Down something is lost in the translation

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:09.878
Like when it was in your mind, he was very exciting and but it came onto paper

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.219
it's not quite it your process is to kind of get inside the writer and

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:22.299
Feel that excitement feel it's it's what I call empathy. It's partly empathy. It's in mastering

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.199
I call it thinking from the inside out you go inside the book

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.410
Inside the spirit you try and recapture

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:38.558
What they were feeling not just what they were writing. I know that's abstract and we could talk for three hours about the process

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.509
but for instance

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:44.469
On another level. Let's say a biography. Mm-hmm

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:52.120
Napoleon Bonaparte was the hero of the 33 strategies of war one of my favorite people to study

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.439
I call him the Mozart of warfare he

00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:02.139
Went well beyond the 10,000 hours when it came to strategy. He was absolutely a genius

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.790
I

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.050
Read

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.419
Maybe 4,000 pages worth of material on Napoleon to prepare for this book

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:16.269
Particularly one great book called the campaign's of Napoleon by I believe it's David Chandler

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.229
it's about thirteen fourteen hundred pages and it it's

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:27.220
Deep incredible detail about every battle with great maps I highly looks way out of print

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:33.910
I'm quite expensive but it's if you're loving to Polina and you're into battles and maps this is the book for you

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.350
Anyway, my goal was I want to bring Napoleon to life

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:45.040
I want to I want to feel like he's in the room with me here. I want to know what how he thought

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:53.079
You know what made him a genius so I go into it and I'm trying to dig it up and come to terms with

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:59.739
What's alive about Napoleon and I found that the books I read were missing

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.790
His genius they were they were not quite getting at it

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:10.209
I'm not saying I'm the only one that did but I felt like at a certain point I understood him

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:16.629
I understood how his brain worked and I came to the conclusion that what made Napoleon's so great

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.100
Was he had a mind?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.100
for organizing information

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:27.790
that was vastly superior to anybody else before the invention of computers and it was his ability to

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.449
assimilate vast amounts of information and

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:40.330
Create strategies in the moment that made him feel so superior. That's the kind of reading that I'm talking about

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.639
Where you're not just on the surface not just reading the words

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:53.500
but you're thinking you're analyzing it you're bringing it to term in relation to your own life your own experiences and

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.760
You're making

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:03.189
Frankenstein come to life. Yeah, is there any mean it's very abstract. I can go into more but that's that's sort of my method

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:08.710
Yeah, I'd wonder if you have any any specific tactics on that. I know like when I read mastery

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.819
I held a pen and I was all over circling dog-earing

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.640
jotting notes in the margins and

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.790
That helped me

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.790
To engage with the ideas in a deeper way than I would have if I'd been sort of more passive

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:27.310
Do you have anything specific I mean you just hit on it? You're it's versus the passive form of readings. So you're active

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.269
So you're arguing

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:31.869
With the with the writer as well. I'm this is one

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:39.249
Idea, yeah, so I always write in the margins. Some people hate that they feel like writing in a book is

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:41.300
sacrilegious like you're

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.010
You know you're spoiling it or you know, yeah

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.589
But I'm not like that. I write a lot and if I don't like a writer and that happens often

00:13:51.139 --> 00:13:54.939
And I get angry. I start putting giant X's and I say fuck you

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.740
I get really angry. Yeah

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.179
But otherwise usually I like it and I putting exclamation mark great

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:10.388
Yes, and I'm I ain't gay. So you're engaging with the material not app. As you said you're not a passive reader

00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:13.629
You're arguing with it. You're thinking

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:17.979
So the problem here is it slows you down, you know

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:22.449
You're not unless it's a bad book bad books or mediocre books

00:14:22.449 --> 00:14:29.109
I kind of can skim but it's a really good book it engages you you're arguing with it. You're writing and it slows you down

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:36.579
That's for sure. But I I maintain it's better to read one. Juicy book that grabs you that really?

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:40.629
Engages you that really makes you think then to read ten

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:44.889
You know kind of trivial books that don't have it. So

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.620
writing in the margins

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.990
Arguing with the book

00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:53.589
Trying to think more deeply about what the writer is saying

00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.339
Analyzing instead of just reading it and

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.300
Bringing it to your own life

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.610
so if I'm talking about

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:12.429
like in mastery just to bring in the war aspects cesar rodriguez the the

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.459
Fighter pilot. Yes, who's the last?

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:20.888
Decorated, what do you call it? An ace ace in the

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.510
Airforce in the airforce of the Marines Air Force the Air Force. Thank you God

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:35.140
You know, you're I'm talking about he was someone who was not your typical ace he wasn't a golden boy

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.840
He's like five foot five

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.970
He didn't look like a fighter pilot, mm-hm and

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.729
He felt like he was had three strikes against him the moment he started he was a slow learner

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.060
He wasn't a natural at it

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.770
And so he had to learn I call it trusting the process

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.950
That if he practiced harder than the golden boys

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:10.450
If he spent more hours on the simulator than they did if he didn't take for granted his skill he would catch up with them

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.670
Now you're reading that and you're going

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:19.179
Love love then you're you know everything but if you're smart you're going. All right, when did that happen to me?

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.909
Hmm, you know when if I like in a sport I felt like this wasn't good for me

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.020
Maybe I gave up too early

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:34.150
I talked about the frustration and how frustration is a good thing for you if you're frustrated it shows

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:39.310
your body is telling your body and your mind is telling you that you can actually

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:45.189
Overcome something and the moment you're feeling frustration is actually a turning point a good moment

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.530
Relate that to yourself don't still read about Cesar

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.760
Rodriguez and thinking of the BLA

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:58.629
Relate that to your own experience when you felt frustration and you either gave up or you push through it. That's

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.919
Active reading that's making something come to life. Yeah, so

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:10.089
Frustration as a good thing. It's something that we want you saying. It's it's a it's a trigger. It's something to look for

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
definitely

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.910
If you don't feel frustrated when you're learning something

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:24.819
You're not learning. Okay, and you're in here you're deluding yourself and you're probably going so they call that practice that I mentioned before

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.430
Where you practice what you're a week at?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:35.260
Deliberative practice in in the business when people talk about skills. You're deliberately working on what you're not good at

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.680
Your tendency is to try and make things easy for you because you don't like pain humans don't like pain

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.940
So if you're going through your practice and things at Wow, things are really easy. I'm enjoying it's fun. You're probably not learning

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.100
You're probably doing this lopsided

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.690
Practice that we're talking about and you're avoiding your weaknesses

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.350
and

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.350
Things are going too smoothly

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.100
it's the frustration isn't just the fact also that

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.389
You're not mastering it it's also that it it's kind of

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.469
It seems like a mystery. You don't quite know what you need to do. Something is eluding you

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.999
and I maintain and it's a little bit you have to

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.739
Believe me because there's not rigorous science behind this

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:33.220
I usually like to have things back by rigorous science is based more on things that athletes talk about

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.889
but that moment of frustration actually

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.810
mathematicians have talked about it that moment of deepest frustration is

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.690
Actually a signal from your body physically a signal that you're actually on

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.600
the way to a breakthrough

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.490
that you feel

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.229
You're it's telling you it's a signal that

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.049
Something is churning up inside it inside you and you're not yet aware of it

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.320
So a lot of that is based on anecdotal evidence

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.610
like a

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:14.979
Great music mathematician like this man jacques hadamard that I talked about he would say his greatest breakthroughs or einstein

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.910
came just at that moment where I were about to give up and

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.150
there's the great instance of

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:29.680
Anecdote about the composer of Brahms and he was so frustrated with this one symphony that he was trying to write

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.870
That he said I'm giving up

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.550
I can't write that's it and the moment he gave up the next day

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.629
All this the solution the perfect solution came to him

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.450
so there's a lot of and

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.340
Athletes talk about that so I'm basing it on anecdotal Emmons and my own experience

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:54.769
When I'm writing a chapter, I could solve frustrated and so annoyed my girlfriend

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.109
I'm like driving her at the wall, you know

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.329
I'm just like yelling at the cat. I can't take it anymore. I'm the worst writer

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.299
I'm about to give up and like it's almost

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.059
Mechanical the next day or two days later it all comes to you know it all fits

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.289
so

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:14.870
If you go through that enough

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.260
you know that that frustration is a good thing and once you know that

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:24.380
It's very liberating because you're able to wait for them for the breakthrough a moment

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.439
That will come you don't give up you give up

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:34.009
Maybe but you're kind of kidding yourself knowing that the moment you say I give up

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.650
Tomorrow or the next day?

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.500
the great idea will come to you so

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:46.069
It's a little bit of faith, but frustration if you don't have the frustration, you're not on the right

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.960
You're not on the right path. Well, it's a there's a fascinating. Take class. Yeah

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:56.510
I wish I had more science, but maybe it's another book to write something about maybe yeah, but yeah

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.179
I think I think most of us tend to go with what's comfortable

00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:04.158
We tend to follow the path in of least resistance and to go where it feels good. So amazing

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:08.569
Robert you you talked about Cesar Rodriguez and and being a golden boy

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.299
and so many people

00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:11.190
Go follow sort of a predetermined

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.950
Track in career and I see this in the military all the time people talk about in their particular line of work

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.460
They want to follow the golden path

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.470
You go to this job and then to this job and then you you become a commanding officer one day

00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:25.069
For people who want to develop mastery, though

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.470
How how can they navigate?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.679
while still wanted to progress and rank and things

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:36.289
But also meeting what's going to be best for them and true to that life's task that you talk about

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:44.150
Well, you know, I'm not in the military. So I don't know exactly what you're facing or the different options that you have

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:48.739
And I'm a practical person so I never tell people

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.749
Just go follow whatever you want to follow, you know, it's because that's bullshit

00:21:54.390 --> 00:22:00.140
You have to make a living you have to fit in to the structure of the military. There are only so many

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:04.399
different kinds of positions you could go after but within

00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:08.658
Those constraints of the field that you're in

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.020
There's some room right? Yeah and the problem that most people have is

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:22.279
They follow what other people are doing or they follow the career path that leads to the most money

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.159
the most attention the most glory

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:33.290
That seems like the most excite the sexiest thing is that's what other people are doing and they don't

00:22:33.929 --> 00:22:40.639
They're not actually looking at what their their inclination what I call your own inclinations are who you are

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:43.159
What you actually really love

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.439
So within the constraints of a military career, and that's what you want

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:55.579
There are let's say eight different paths. You can go on career paths. I could there be something like that. Yeah, okay

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:02.419
So your job is not you know, it's like in in in in ecology

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.540
when you have a

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.459
An ecological landscape. I don't know what the word is an eco sphere

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.010
The animals that survive are the ones that find a niche

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:24.229
There's no other animal that has a beak this long that can suck that kind of flower and get the nectar out

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.669
it can now survive the animals that try and be like

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.929
become like other ones that are follow all the other animals succeed at

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:36.379
Don't usually survive because they have to be the best at it. I'm kind of

00:23:36.929 --> 00:23:43.759
Simplifying it. But there there's there's truths. Yeah, it's the same in the career world where if you follow what everyone else is doing?

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:47.719
What seems like the most the sexiest most attractive?

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:53.929
Position it's going to be crowded. It's going to be crowded with a lot of people who are vying for the same thing

00:23:53.929 --> 00:23:57.469
We're probably better at it. It's best to find

00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:00.270
What you love?

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.130
and

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.809
combine it with

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:07.099
something that already exists out there a career path and

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.590
To adapt it to your spirit and to not go where everyone else is going

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.819
You know that it depends on on

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.709
the specifics of the military but I can say

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:25.638
Let's say for writing. Mm-hmm, you know for me

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:28.279
Just it's easier for me to talk about that

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.579
You know everybody in Los Angeles is a screenwriter, you know

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:41.269
You go to a cafe and all the waiters and waitresses are screenwriters. Yeah, right. It's disgusting. You know, they like

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:46.038
How can they be? How can there be so many screenwriters if there's only so many films being made?

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:51.559
What are they you know, but it's true and I used to work in Hollywood and everyone's trying to write a screenplay

00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:59.779
Well, it's it's so crowded your chances of success are so slim you're like those

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.860
Five million salmon swimming upstream in Oregon and only two are gonna make it right. That's what it's like

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:15.528
okay, and I was in that pool with the 10 million other salmon trying to write a screenplay and it wasn't working and

00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:19.789
Because I wasn't suited for it. It wasn't me. I don't actually like

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.470
Hollywood that much I don't I like movies, but I don't like that much

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.610
I like history and I like philosophy and I like science

00:25:29.399 --> 00:25:32.569
So I found my way by listening to myself

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:38.659
by listening to what I hated and kind of gravitating towards it to create a

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.730
Write a form of writing that suited me where there were note was no competition

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:51.829
You know, I mean that's a self-help look but there's nobody really out there writing books like it so I have it all to myself

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.620
you know, it's like finding a

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.389
field a meadow

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:04.789
Where you hit solve for you as opposed to that other meadow where there's like 10,000 people crowded on it. It's great and

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.919
So that's what it's like it's not gonna be quite the same in the military

00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:15.469
Obviously, you're not gonna find that one niche that you buy yourself, but you're gonna find something more suited to you

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:21.528
How you find what's more suited to that's a whole other question and I talked about it in the book

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.559
we go into that if you want, but

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:30.889
And it's probably the most important question of your life is to find out what you really want to do

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:34.039
Well with that kind of endorsement then I'd love to go further into it

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.850
Okay

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.200
Well

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.260
You know, it's the jits Chapter one of mastery. It's called discover your life's task

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.250
Your calling in life your vocation. However, you want to describe it

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.929
And I say it's the most important decision that you'll ever make

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.049
Because it won't no not only will it determine

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.230
Your career your success

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.790
How much money you make?

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.040
It will also determine how happy you are no fulfills you feel in life

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.670
I

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:15.610
Have numerous quotes from people like da Vinci Leonardo da Vinci and others that the worst thing is to be turning

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.000
50 60 years old and to feel like you never

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.180
Realized your potential you never did

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.919
What you felt like you could have done. Yeah, it's like that's the worst feeling

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:33.520
So you don't want to have that feeling particularly if you're younger in your 20s and you have more options or even in your 30s

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.490
So it's a question of knowing yourself

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.250
You know

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.440
The the

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.770
Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.540
Which was the center of all wisdom the priestess and the Oracle of Delphi

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.609
was supposedly in touch with the god Apollo who would tell her the truth of anything in the universe and

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.029
What was the inscription above the Oracle of Delphi?

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.610
Was know yourself know thyself

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.610
it's the start of all wisdom, so

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.150
Your tendency will be

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:17.590
When you're a child when you're five or six to kind of know that you like this you like sports you like physical activity

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.410
Or you like music or you like words or you like working with your hands?

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.370
You have a feel for it. It's natural and

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.730
As you get older you start to listen to other people

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.410
and

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:39.759
You lose a sense of who you are. You listen to your parents who tell you Brendon?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.310
You've got to become a lawyer you need to go into this field

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.009
your other your friends or all

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.599
Scram to make a lot of money and you lose a connection

00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:53.949
To who you are to what your strengths are to what you love

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.520
and the whole thing about learning is

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.640
Learning has to be fun. I know I I'm contradicting myself in that I said

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.660
Frustration is good, but you need to also love

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.750
What you're studying?

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:15.550
So I give the example I've taught I've said it many times in interviews

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:24.099
That if you're wanting to learn French for instance, this is something that happened to me you in university

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:31.330
You know, you could spend years learning French from a professor and after two years and you go to France

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:38.500
You can't speak a damn word, right? Because you really weren't that interested. You weren't listening. It's not it's not exciting

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.160
It's not fun

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:46.660
But you go to France and you meet a French girl and you're really excited and you want to seduce her you want to whatever

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.630
All right. Now you're motivated in French

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:56.769
You're really motivated and it's fun and you're listening to her nose just others and suddenly in

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.249
two weeks you learn what two years you never learned the

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:06.790
Mind is more receptive when you're excited when you're liking something when you're interested in it

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:12.909
So we were talking about shortcuts. Well, it's not a shortcut but it streamlines the process a little bit

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:19.300
Because when you you know that in your own experience when you're studying math, and you don't like math

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.300
It goes in one ear out the other

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:27.100
but when you love if you love math you're paying deep attention and you absorb things, so

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.390
No

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:35.199
Connecting to the subject loving it. You will learn much faster. So you have to know yourself

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:40.720
You have to know what you're good at what you love there's a book I recommend for people

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.750
I I can't remember the exact time. I think it's called the five

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.570
frames of

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:53.290
Intelligence something like that by I think it's Howard Gardner and he's basically saying there are five forms of intelligence

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.439
One of them is kinetic which has to do with physical

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.020
Motion one is mechanical

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.140
Having to do with

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.770
Spatial things

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.420
One is like music and math one is words, etc

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:14.000
You're gonna tend to have a mind that is has one of these forms of intelligence

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.459
What is it know yourself know what that is for me? It's language and words, etc

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.500
You it's getting in connect in contact with who you are

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:31.040
What you love going back to that child rooting out all the voices of your parents and your friends

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:38.419
Finding those things that when you read a line and you find a subject what

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.719
Your eyes light up at what you want to explore

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:49.459
It's a process it's not gonna happen overnight. It depends on how old you are where you are in life

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.290
It's never too late to make an adjustment or to find who you are

00:31:54.290 --> 00:32:00.109
I didn't write the 48 laws of power or start writing till I was 36 and up until that moment

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:05.599
I was kind of a lost soul. I was kind of unhappy and I was wandering around you can take time

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.949
As long as you're trying as long as you're in exploring it'll probably come but if you're

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:17.089
Only following what other people are doing you're in trouble

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:24.110
You might succeed for a while. You might get that law degree and make money and when you're 28

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.809
Like your mom and dad want you to but by the time you're 34, you're tuning it out

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.830
You're drinking

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:38.929
You're you're you're getting on drugs you're doing you're doing online porn. You're so out of it. You're so disconnected

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:47.030
you you fall into various addictions and it may not be something that destructive but you're not it's not engaging you and

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.630
You might have succeeded for a while, but you're gonna pay a price

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:59.359
I'm telling you. It's the most important decision that you can have is connecting to it and making it practical so

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.290
You're not gonna want to become a poet or a rock musician just because you love music

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.219
All right, I'm gonna start my own band. That's not necessarily practical. Okay

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.240
But you love music. All right find a

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:21.529
Path in music that is practical that you can use and maybe it will end up being a rock band. Who knows?

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.530
I don't want to scourge that but I

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.549
Knew I wanted to write that gave me the latitude to explore this vast area and then find my niche

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:38.750
You know that you love working with your hands. Okay explore this or you love computers?

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:45.530
Explore the whole area and you'll find your niche, but you've got to know what that first overall

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.649
Eco sphere is that you want to explore?

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.600
Brandon we could talk about it for hours. So I'm gonna shut up at this point, but

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.470
you

00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:00.470
Need to read mastery them to know more about it, but it is literally to me

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.049
I want you to look at it as is life and death because

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.489
you can you can spiritually die from

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:13.849
Engaging most of your working hours your mental energy in something that you don't love well

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:21.259
Yeah, and and the and the things you talk about that people would slip into in a situation like that you the drugs pornography

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.849
Alcohol that that is a path to death that that it, you know

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:30.259
Even if you're not dead living where you use those things as crutches to get you through the day

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.400
Yeah, is it path to death and there are a lot of people like that in the world definitely

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:41.030
Definitely. I mean the great thing about the times that we live in is that there's more latitude than ever

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.680
People of color people minorities women

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:51.110
Barriers are falling down. You could choose, you know more latitude for that

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:56.180
We don't have to follow what our Father did I don't have to become one

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.149
You know as in the past you sort of we're kind of more

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:05.180
Pigeonholed into what careers you could have and there's this vast area in on the internet

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.579
It's sort of access to information and knowledge

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.469
So it's it could be a golden era for finding yourself in this way

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.069
But it's also a very dark era in that there are many

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.350
Paths to lose yourself in and so you have to be strong and you have to know

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.649
that this is the path that I want to follow and to follow it with a lot of energy because there are a lot of

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.909
Dangers in that in the world. Yeah, it takes discipline person

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.720
I think to pursue something in the way that you talk about a mastery to keep working at it when there are

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:37.589
so many options and

00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:42.229
and you could you could try to be a doctor and a lawyer and a dentist and all those things all at once and keep

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:48.260
Them open rather than pursuing. Yeah, and I like giving concrete examples

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.109
So I give one more example on the subject

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.010
Is somebody talking about in their Paul Graham who?

00:35:56.369 --> 00:35:58.759
Started a company. Most recently called Y Combinator

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:05.510
I mean, he started 12 years ago and he sold it but his billion dollar company in Silicon Valley

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.679
He's you know, he's a genius he's a master and

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.530
I'd like those historic is the path

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:20.419
He loved computers. He was a compactor. I mean a real hacker when he was 17 years old back in the eighth

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.030
70s when hacking was

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.520
You know there weren't very many of them

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.749
and then so he got into Computer Sciences and

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:36.349
He thought that was his path an AI when AI in the late 70s when AI was not really nobody knew about it

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:42.589
And then it wasn't quite working. He didn't he wasn't happy. You know, it didn't feel right

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.650
He doesn't he hated academia. He hated

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.399
Politics he hated offices. He's a rebel

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.290
He gave it all up and he's decided I want to be an artist

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:58.009
I want to paint and he went to Italy and he went to art school

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.799
And he learned to paint and he really loved that

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.420
And then he came back

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.420
to New York and he was

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:09.799
Kind of an artist in his loft in New York wasn't making any money

00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:17.029
But he was things were okay and then he heard an ad on the radio in 1995 saying that the Internet

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:21.169
The future of the Internet is people will be selling things on the Internet

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.309
now suddenly a light bulb went on in his head in his head because

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.849
Man, all right. I can I've had all these skills

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:35.270
I could make a platform that will allow people to buy things on the Internet

00:37:35.549 --> 00:37:40.309
and I can design it because I've been studying design in other words not just

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.710
Computers and AI and all that

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:50.300
I've been studying what it's aesthetics and what's pleasing to the eye and the psychology of art and how to design things

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.050
So he took all of his experience in hacking in artificial intelligence

00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:00.770
In in art and he created what ended up selling to Yahoo

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:07.789
I forget what it's called Yahoo. Something ruther. It was the first platform for selling things on the Internet. He made a fortune and

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.580
that ended up leading to

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.680
one other venture and then to Y Combinator

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.960
He didn't know what he was doing. He was lost. He tried different things

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.490
And by the time he was 30, he had developed five skill sets

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:27.589
Literally that were so solid that it would come together at some point

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.179
Something would trigger that moment on the end hearing something on the radio

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.159
it may not have been that may not have been Netscape made him in something else, but

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.959
It was it's like a ground the soil. It was so fertile with skills

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.240
Something was great was about to happen. And that's that's a great a path. I think it's really

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:54.409
Rich to to imitate. Yeah, it reminds me of how we we often poeta size the myth of Steve Jobs

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.560
yeah now Steve Jobs studied calligraphy and

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:03.649
Fonts and things like that and that was one more thing that was part of his path to mastering becoming who he was

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:08.929
Yeah, if people don't realize Steve Jobs was actually not much of a computer person

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:16.100
He'd he was quite mediocre in his meeting of computer skills. It was Wozniacki. Who was the it was the the hacker

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:22.579
I mean he wasn't terrible but he wasn't that wasn't his strength his strength was design and

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:32.510
His story is interesting because when he's like five or six years old, he's walking with his stepfather somewhere and

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:37.490
in Silicon Valley where they grew up he grew up in Northern California and

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:44.540
He passes an electronics store with all the gizmos in it of the time their tubes and everything and he goes wow

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.210
He got so excited

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:55.319
By technology, but the design of technology and this is a five year old. That's what I'm talking about when you're a kid

00:39:56.079 --> 00:40:02.429
In a very visceral way something strikes you and that's what he ended up becoming it wasn't

00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:08.369
Technology, it was the design element. That's what his genius was was bringing together a

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.209
pretty good knowledge of technology with a great knowledge of

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:14.849
fonts calligraphy

00:40:14.859 --> 00:40:19.048
Modern design to create his greatest breakthrough

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:25.229
which people don't realize which was the iPod that started all of the changes and that we now have

00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:30.268
So he's a perfect example of what we're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:35.609
And I remember that the first iPod I ever got and it was this masterful piece of technology. It was beautiful

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:42.088
It was fun to touch. It was fun to use. Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah. Yeah, so Robert you're a master strategist

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.160
I want to know

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:51.119
Looking at situations where maybe you come across a tough boss in the workplace. This could be and maybe this could be anywhere. Oh,

00:40:51.759 --> 00:40:54.329
Is this a personal there have been moments?

00:40:55.269 --> 00:41:00.929
I've had people do this before where they try say. I have a friend. Yeah. Yeah, there's another guy

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:09.869
Who once wants to figure out how to navigate these situations and you've talked in mastery about how it starts with

00:41:10.299 --> 00:41:15.268
To gain social intelligence starts with a look at one's self and your own biases and why things are triggering you

00:41:15.269 --> 00:41:17.269
How how can someone use that?

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:23.369
To handle their workplace situations first to look at themselves and then to figure out how to navigate the social sphere of work

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.390
Well, I would tell them to read the

00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:30.359
568 pages of my new book

00:41:31.029 --> 00:41:33.029
Because it's something I go into a lot

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.629
It's kind of scattered throughout the book. Mm-hmm, which is a

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:44.459
basically what I took in that is chapter four and mastery on social intelligence and expanded it into an entire book, you know, I

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:48.240
There's a whole literature about what we call this psychotic boss

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:55.410
We've all dealt with that I've had it it's the boss. We're nothing you can do quite will ever please them

00:41:55.410 --> 00:42:02.879
They're very difficult and it's a really awful situation and then there are gradations where there's the less than psychotic boss

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.869
but there he or she's just

00:42:04.869 --> 00:42:09.129
Just an a-hole and they're just really hard to deal with you know, yeah, we've all been through that

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.910
Well, okay. So what I'm talking about and what you're referencing is

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:20.799
You have to realize the worst thing is to take everything personally and get emotional so people who are

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.800
psychotic bosses

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.450
Their power is in grabbing your emotions and

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:35.200
Entangling you in the in a drama. They're better at it. They're more aggressive

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:41.019
They're nastier. They're more difficult. They're more amoral than you are. You're never gonna win

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:46.390
Playing to their strengths they thrive on on making you emotional

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.330
So you have to learn?

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:56.350
In general in life to stop taking things. So emotionally now it's not everything

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:01.210
I do want you to fall in love and have a family and love your children, etc

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.960
but in the work world it pays to

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:13.719
cool things down and to not real to realize that it is never personal so when you're facing this

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.530
Person this boss

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:23.710
Your tendency is to think is to take it personally to think their anger and their

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:31.689
Difficult nurse and their aggression is directed at you that there's something about you. They don't like whatever definitely this this other guy

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:38.409
He felt like like was trying to pretend it pick on him. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.480
It's never about you personally never hardly ever

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.990
People who are like this I go into the in the book. I delve deeply into their psychology

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:53.979
I give you numerous ways for understanding them, but the gist of it is is

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.030
They're re-enacting dramas from their own troubled childhood

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.510
They have terrible issues

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:09.699
They're reliving things from their horrible father or their mean narcissistic mother or whatever it was

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:15.760
Generally from very early in childhood, maybe a little bit later and you're the target

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.349
They're just simply replaying their old dramas with new actors. It's not personal

00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:26.389
Thing to do with you. Don't take it personally see them for what they are

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.529
understand

00:44:28.529 --> 00:44:29.910
That they are

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:31.910
twisted people with some kind of

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.999
Issues and I talked about what these various issues are I go into it

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:40.910
in all the different types of

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:47.119
Horrible people that there are in this world and there are there are good many types of them from the passive-aggressive

00:44:47.999 --> 00:44:49.289
to the

00:44:49.289 --> 00:44:51.289
the narcissist

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:55.429
To the control freak to all those types, you know

00:44:56.849 --> 00:44:58.849
knowledge will will

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.539
liberate you

00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:06.319
Knowing that this is what is motivating them. All right. Now I have options

00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:08.839
I don't have to react I don't have to get emotional

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:13.699
I can retreat I can withdraw I can play

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:19.849
Certain games on them that'll in if you want to infuriate them and imbalance them. So they'll leave you alone

00:45:20.579 --> 00:45:22.969
You have more than enough material to do that

00:45:22.979 --> 00:45:30.169
You have deterrent strategies from deterring them from being aggressive you have options when you have knowledge

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:32.839
The other thing is you cut them down to size

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:36.859
You see them as the little child stomping their feet

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:39.630
in

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.349
The war book I having to read

00:45:43.049 --> 00:45:45.228
Joseph Stalin is sort of my

00:45:45.779 --> 00:45:53.089
Quintessence of the awful psychotic boss. There's nobody worse in history than Joseph Stalin imagine

00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:57.949
You have a boss that if you anger you're sent to the gulag and you're gonna die

00:45:58.349 --> 00:46:03.498
So you have a boss that is holding life and death over you. He's terrible. He's horrible. I

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:09.559
Talked him war about Shas the the great Russian composer Shostakovich

00:46:10.289 --> 00:46:12.289
Who suddenly is?

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:17.988
Meeting face to face with Stalin. He's so intimidating. He's got this look where he's just like

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:24.649
People were like, I'm so serious people would literally shit in their pants, but he looked him at this certain way

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:28.579
You know, he he looked him that way. They're gonna go do it. They're going to the gulag

00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:33.319
They're gonna die. Their life is on the line their life is on the line he gave that look to Shostakovich

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.610
basically

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.610
This other person that was in the meeting

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.250
was saying

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.400
stalling was was upset because this was a meeting about

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:49.760
Who was gonna compose the new national anthem for the Soviet Union after World War Two?

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.280
And Shostakovich had written something and Koch taurine and something and Stalin was

00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:00.649
critiquing these people and this one and he was critiquing this one man's

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:07.070
orchestration and the man said well, you know what I actually didn't orchestrate if this other guy did and

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:13.970
Shostakovich was realizing he just signed the death warrant for that young man. Who did the orchestration?

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:21.350
By saying that he did the faulty orchestration. It would literally was gonna mean that so Shostakovich, you know in a flash

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:29.869
Realized that didn't fall for Stalin's intimidation game. He saw him as a little child as a six-year-old boy

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:31.800
with a

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:37.159
Philandering father and a mother who beat him and a awful childhood and he cut him down to size

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:42.979
I'm not intimidated by this man. He does not intimidate me and in that moment he had

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.830
presence of mind and he said oh

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.420
such-and-such

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:53.600
You're Orchestrator is a very fine Orchestrator. You shouldn't blame him you

00:47:54.180 --> 00:48:00.919
know you should do your own orchestration from now on he sort of saved the situation, but the mental process was

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:08.030
He cut this person down to size. He didn't fall for the myth. He saw them as a human being

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.570
with temper tantrums with issues

00:48:12.359 --> 00:48:14.210
Etc when you fall for the myth

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:19.280
when you start real thinking that they're greater than they are when you start trembling when your

00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:20.119
bowels

00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:24.289
start moving from fear you're in their grasp when you're

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:31.639
Reasonably calm you maintain your presence of mind. You see them as a little baby that's throwing a tantrum

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.400
Or whatever it is

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.830
You've got some control and you have options

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.090
If we're talking about strategy the number one

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:49.099
Strategic principle that ice is the most important of all is the person who has options

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.330
Has more options as the one who will win in a competitive situation

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.570
If you only have one option

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.260
You're generally under the control of your opponent

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.899
But if you create a situation where you're there and you can go here here here or here

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:12.530
That means you can react in the moment and you can take the path. That might be the best for that situation

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.099
You always want options and when you get emotional

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:18.330
when you react

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:22.189
When you get caught in their drama, you have only one option

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.160
anger

00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:29.569
You're you start repeating in your mind the same thing over and over and over again

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:37.520
You've lost you've already lost when you're calm and you can you can not say anything you can quit

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:44.029
You can be a toady for a few moments, but not really feel like you're that's who you are

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:50.419
All right, you can choose you're in control and that asshole boss is not in control because you have options

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.589
amazing

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.589
but you have you have such a knack for

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:59.810
Metaphor and image and so many of the images of power and strategy to use or about water

00:49:59.849 --> 00:50:07.549
There's there's something dynamic whether there's water there's rivers. There's tidal waves. What is it about that idea? That's so appealing and strategy and power

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.160
Well, I swim a lot

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.759
You know, I'm kind of obsessed my girlfriend will tell you I take trips just so I can swim

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:24.770
You know or an ocean or in this city, they have a great swimming pool kind of thing. So, you know, there's one thing but

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:32.000
You know, it's about fluidity and it's

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:37.159
It's a certain philosophy of life of

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.330
flowing with with what you know

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:49.609
Water can wear down the largest Boulder. Give it five hundred years. It'll turn that Boulder into a pebble

00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:52.969
And and it's just through the force of that water

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.690
It's if you've ever taken a dam

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.889
And and released it, you know the power in water is and is intense it can kill you

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.080
It has so many is it has so many it's also the source of life

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:12.100
Without water on this planet. We wouldn't even be here talking a

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:15.190
Planet without water is a dead planet

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.600
and

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.579
It's the name. It's a greatest metaphor for strategy

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.370
in Asian strategy now, I'm a

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.790
Great fan of Asian strategy

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.760
Maybe more than Western strategy

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.789
Because I think they they understand strategy better

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:39.820
And the and the those in the West who do understand strategy are more aligned with Asians

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.940
so von Clausewitz is

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.400
Actually kind of similar to Sun Tzu

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.249
Napoleon was probably the western

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:55.840
general who actually is most like what's the ideal of a Sun Tzu general at least the early Napoleon and

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:58.750
for Sun Tzu and for Asian philosophy

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.350
Water is the essence of strategy

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:06.010
It's adapting to the moment

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:14.919
It's always flowing to where you you can't you can channel it where it's being channeled

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:20.739
It's using the kind of energy of the moment

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:26.590
What sons who calls shit the the kind of

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.380
position of ultimate power

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:34.240
Is like water that's been dammed up and now it can explode

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.389
So the and the formlessness of water, you know, it's

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:49.149
The last law of the 48 laws of power is is it's a pure formless. I forget what the verb is

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:51.680
is

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:58.060
Never taking a form is being fluid in life is people don't know you they can't predict what you're going to do next

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.770
You're always reacting to the moment, you know the word flow for rappers. They

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.470
It's got so many

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.790
Complaints of convergence when it comes to

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.099
Powerful thinking as opposed to rigid

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:19.050
Thinking that thinks in terms of preset concepts

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:25.140
That I'm just drawn to it in from a thousand different directions

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.960
and I've even

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.469
Built it into into my new book. I'm always

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:34.290
somehow returning to water

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.500
But I think it's just the essence

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.660
It describes the essence of true strategic thinking and

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.999
Most people are not fluid in life. They're always coming at life

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:56.340
They're fighting the last battle they have certain preconceptions certain stereotypes, they're not in the moment

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:04.830
That when they are interacting with a stranger or a new person, they're never quite keying into what makes them different. They don't have flow

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.100
So, I don't know I could

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.890
I'm dancing around it, but it's hard to

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:17.610
Put in concrete terms something. That's kind of poetic. Yeah, absolutely. That's kind of the idea. Yeah. Yeah

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:24.870
Yeah, and you said fighting the last battle? I think something that we often talk about in the military is getting frustrated though

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.530
That's the way we've always done it

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:32.370
How how can we protect ourselves from fighting the last battle from getting into doing things to where we've always done them?

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.110
well

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:36.430
You know

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.430
Let's be realistic

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.710
The military is a large organization

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.310
it's

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:46.890
Minoo its bureaucratic. It has to be bureaucratic when you've got

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:53.730
Hundreds of thousands of people in your employ you you can't everyone can't just be flowing and doing their own thing

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.860
You've got to have structure

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:58.830
Okay, we get that

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:05.939
But if you want to be successful, you got to learn to loosen up, you know in the military sense

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:12.510
We were kind of loose in World War two because we didn't have a great military tradition yet

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.089
It was sort of the first instance. I

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:23.490
Mean World War one a little bit but where our military might was on display and we had some great generals

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:30.209
in World War two who were quite fluid in their thinking my favorite happens to be Patton because I think he was

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.770
Quite a brilliant. He maybe wasn't a very good person

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:41.459
But he was great strategist and then after World War two in the military the Pentagon became such a bureaucracy

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:48.030
And it was exactly what George Marshall tried to prevent. It was one of the Defense Department, but he was trying to

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:51.000
Imbue a very open spirit

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:55.050
It became such a bureaucracy it became this complex

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.889
In such rigid thinking as opposed to maneuver warfare, which is a little bit

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:04.650
What was happened in World War two it became attrition warfare

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.610
Let's bomb the Vietnamese. We're gonna bomb them into oblivion

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:15.569
We're gonna pour the American military might in and and and level them and it's very rigid

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.990
Kind of thinking it's very fighting the last war type

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:25.019
Thinking and it led to our greatest disaster to an utter utter catastrophe

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:29.010
the worst military adventurer in our history

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:37.349
And they learned the lesson and after world after the Vietnam War there was a shake-up in the military and there were now Mavericks

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.809
Coming up and there were people who said we have to learn

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:44.340
From terrorists and insurgents and guerrilla warfare and we have to learn

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:51.629
counterinsurgency there were already seeds of that in the 50s, but it really took off after Vietnam and people like

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.330
John Boyd, but there were others and

00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.270
Desert Storm became kind of the model they kind of let go of that Vietnam

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:07.560
Sort of syndrome and they had tremendous success if you want success in life if that's your goal if you want to win

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.900
you've got to let go of

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:13.800
What worked the last time so it simply comes down to?

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:15.870
this formula

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:21.089
Do you really want to win if you really want to win if you're not bullshitting if you're not trying to?

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:26.729
act like you want to win but you're just all into the attention in the ego then go ahead and

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:34.469
use the strategy that worked a year ago and think that it will work again because your ego is tied to that you think

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.570
That that strategy that worked year ago was cuz I'm brilliant

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:44.560
Well, maybe a little bit but also because the luck because of the right moment there were factors

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:48.819
It wasn't just you. You need to adapt so your ego

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.750
intervenes

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.820
And you think I've got to do what I did last time

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:56.620
Because that means I'm great and to try something else means maybe I'm not so great

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.620
That means you're not really into winning

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:05.019
If you really want to win if you really want to see successful you have to be in the moment

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:10.540
You have to look at the circumstances. No, two battles are the same. Yes. There are similarities

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.350
Yes

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:19.420
Hannibal's defeat of the Romans that can I has bears some similarities to some of the

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:27.250
Counter-attack strategies that were used in in world war ii or I don't know exactly what the but there are some parallels

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:32.800
But it's never the same. Right? The technology is different never the same every war is different

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.890
Every battle in life is different. That doesn't mean

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:41.019
You let go of everything you believe it may be the last strategy will work

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:44.559
But you want to do you want to face a new situation?

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:47.350
Let's say you start a job

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:49.150
Alright, it's a new battle

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:56.079
My new job is a new battle and you're gonna refresh yourself like you hit that refresh button on the computer. I'm starting over

00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:02.920
I'm letting go of my preconceptions. I'm in the moment. I'm studying the people that I'm now around

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:07.479
and I'm at square one, or I'm back to zero and

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.469
I'm gonna reassess and fight from that position

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:18.940
When I write a book each book, I go back to zero. I tell myself Robert. You're actually a terrible writer

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.680
This is gonna be your worst book. This book is gonna suck

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:31.749
People are gonna really think that you've lost it your mother's gonna not return your phone calls. She's gonna be ashamed

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.730
You are not great

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:39.640
You in you but you gotta up your game because this book is above you. I'm serious. I'm not neurotic

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:43.059
But it works, you know, obviously

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.830
Julius Caesar had a slave whispering into his ear

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:54.349
You are mortal you as you are mortal everywhere. He went you are not a god you are mortal you

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.439
Need that person whispering in your ear

00:59:58.289 --> 01:00:00.528
Making you realize that you're not so great

01:00:00.569 --> 01:00:08.449
Don't let your ego get involved and if you want to win, you have to look at each situation as different. What are the circumstances?

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.260
What is the zeitgeist what is the element of luck?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.669
And timing that worked the last time that won't work this time, etc

01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:23.119
Yeah, so you talk about your writing process and you have a new book coming out soon on human nature

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:27.229
And it's a parent through all your books that you have a keen understanding of human nature

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:33.169
You could say that so many of them are about human nature. So what what new insights are you coming to in this new process?

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:41.960
Well, I mean the insights ok

01:00:43.799 --> 01:00:47.959
I'm basically of the of the opinion I

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:55.309
Like looking at us as if we are animals, which we are. Ok. And so when you look at zebras

01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:01.279
Or even your pet dog they have certain behavior patterns

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:09.740
they're obvious after a few, you know, they're pretty simple and you could study them and though the zebra will always go to the

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:16.579
Waterhole at this time of day to avoid, you know, your dog will always do this. Well, we're the same

01:01:16.579 --> 01:01:19.429
we're not we think we're so sophisticated, but we're actually

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:28.549
Malaika zebra and like a dog we have patterns of behavior. We're not limitless in what we can do. We're not gods

01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:34.429
We can't suddenly do something that's not in our nature. We have a nature

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:40.939
Where does that nature come but? Well, yes. We're more complicated than a dog or a zebra. I obviously but

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.179
We're not that much more complicated than chimpanzees

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:50.869
Which we are very much related to and I tell people if you want a great experience if you're ever in Australia

01:01:52.289 --> 01:01:59.659
Go to the zoo in Sydney and watch the the chimpanzee compound and you'll think god damn that looks like my office

01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:07.630
You know, there's the alpha male. I'm kind of strutting around and all the other chimps kind of following him and

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.289
Imitating him and you know, it's got sort of looks like your office

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:15.939
So we're not that different from chimpanzees, but we're more complicated than that

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:20.800
But we have a nature it came from millions of years of development

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.580
And there's certain parts of this nature

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.770
That I that are pre verbal and that I like to indicate

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.650
So for instance just to choose one of them and I'm gonna answer your question in a minute. I choose one of them

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.130
We're a social animal

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:43.930
Highly social animal and that's what made us survive. It's made us why we're here today

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.730
and

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:53.050
We were a social animal before we had language. So we were grunting and we were gesturing etc

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:57.070
And we had to communicate on a very high level to survive and to hunt

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:02.980
hunting big game in a group of 10 12 very complicated

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:09.340
Without language you tried some time with like stones and it's not easy. Okay, so

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:15.730
we had to develop forms of communication and one of the forms of communication we developed or

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.949
emotions now emotions all animals have emotions lizards

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:23.470
Have a fear response

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:27.520
But humans develop much more complicated emotions

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:32.560
Hundreds of thousands of years ago and they developed them to show on the face

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:39.999
You could show fear you would show shame you would show love or excitement of animals do but we had more

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.689
gradations we had joy, we had disappointment and

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.690
We use it as a form of communication

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:51.159
What this meant was as a highly social animal

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:53.930
Was that our emotions?

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:58.090
Communicated themselves to other people very quickly and they were contagious

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:04.000
so if one member of the group suddenly felt fear because something was on the horizon, perhaps

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.520
A leopard was nearby

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:13.090
The group would see it and they would all feel fear feel fear together and they would react together

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:20.859
It bonded the group more tightly that allowed them to respond to things quickly. So hundreds of thousands of years ago we developed

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:26.919
Susceptibility to the emotions of other people in a very powerful way

01:04:27.319 --> 01:04:33.969
All right fast forward a million years later to us here today on the internet

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:38.440
Scrolling around Facebook or Instagram or whatever the hell you do?

01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:47.048
You're constantly feeling the emotions of other people. You don't know it you think you have your opinions your ideas

01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:53.199
Because you're just such a smart rational independent person. It's bullshit your ideas

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.869
Your emotions so much of what you think and feel come from other people

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:03.969
Viral affects what everyone's clicking on on Facebook what you're seeing on the screen?

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:10.480
what people are excited about or outraged about go to a rock concert or any concert and

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.960
You feel this wave of emotion everyone bonding

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:20.799
It's the animal part of you now, that's an element of human nature. That's one of them. I have 18

01:05:21.319 --> 01:05:28.329
Okay, it's chapter 14. I talked about the social effect. I talked about our conformity our conformist

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.500
principles

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.779
It's it's a nature

01:05:31.779 --> 01:05:39.129
It's an element that developed before we were aware would that we had language and it operates within you today on the Internet

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:41.349
the most sophisticated

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.349
piece of technology is this has

01:05:44.869 --> 01:05:46.869
elicits the same reaction as

01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:52.149
As Homo erectus a hundred thousand years ago planning a big hunt

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.849
we're not different and so

01:05:55.579 --> 01:05:58.719
Human nature are these forces that operate in us

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:03.910
That we don't control we cannot control they make us feel Envy

01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:10.629
They make us feel aggressive. They make us irrational. They make us have a dark side

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.150
Everybody has a dark side that they try and repress

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.899
It makes us I

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:22.779
Don't know I said I have 18 it makes us afraid of death. It makes us

01:06:25.369 --> 01:06:31.179
Respond to authority figures way and this these forces were said in

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.040
Hundreds of thousands of years ago. Yes, we've progressed. Yes. Things are not the same

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.099
I would be an idiot to think that we're exactly the same

01:06:39.099 --> 01:06:44.259
No, we're we oh there are differences, but they're not as many as you think

01:06:44.869 --> 01:06:47.348
We're not so different from the people in the Bible

01:06:49.099 --> 01:06:52.419
Joseph and his brothers and the envy of the brothers

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:54.970
because he was the favorite of the father and

01:06:55.130 --> 01:07:01.359
They threw him in a ditch to die because they felt Envy and he's a very powerful factor in the world today

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.659
so my insight is

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.020
We're not really aware of who we are

01:07:08.869 --> 01:07:10.869
We think we're this creature

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:14.679
Because we live in the sort of conscious realm with our daily thoughts

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.609
but actually there's this stranger inside of us this

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:23.829
Animal that has these forces from so many so deep in our past

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:30.220
that's actually very powerful and you're not even aware of what how it governs what you do and

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.800
By becoming aware of it

01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:35.900
You have

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:43.450
Something changes. I've noticed it in myself in writing the book. So I have a chapter for instance on narcissism and

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.399
Self-absorption which is clear humans are self-absorbed

01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:53.679
We've gotten worse that way but our tendency is to think

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.010
She's a narcissist. He's a nurses never

01:07:58.099 --> 01:08:04.149
It's not are you kidding? I'm the most loving giving caring person around of course

01:08:05.059 --> 01:08:07.059
In writing the book

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.040
Hell I am a narcissist. I am one come to terms with it Robert

01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:17.229
You think mostly about yourself you are kind of in love with yourself. You think your ideas are great

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.810
You think you know etc?

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:24.519
All right. Now with that awareness I can catch myself I can go

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.009
And I make the case that being a narcissism all bad. It's good to have self-love

01:08:30.679 --> 01:08:32.769
Because if you if you don't have that

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:35.600
Then you become

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.600
what I call a deep narcissist

01:08:37.969 --> 01:08:39.580
Which is very dangerous

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.379
You need self-esteem. You need a sense of self-love to anchor yourself in life

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:48.970
So it's okay to be a narcissist, but there's but it can go too far

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.820
But now with awareness I can catch myself and going

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:57.280
Alright your being that now and and you're closing yourself off from other people and you're not

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.640
this is this is narcissism and you know it and

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:08.109
Here's aggression. Oh, it's always the other person who's aggressive. I'm not aggressive. I'm I'm so peace-loving. I'm a dove

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:13.179
I never start anything the ho it's not true. You're just as aggressive as anyone else

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:20.019
Women are just as aggressive as men. Let's get over that fallacy women have aggressive energy

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.180
They might make it into passive aggressive, but man can be passive aggressive to

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:32.080
Where an aggressive animal? Yeah, we're not violent. Let's let I make a distinction between violence and aggression

01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:35.350
We don't go around killing not most of us

01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:36.980
Don't go around killing people

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:44.740
But we have aggressive energy and it can come out in certain circumstance when you're aware of it. Now it changes

01:09:45.859 --> 01:09:51.549
Instead of trying to repress it and act like you're a saint like wow, man. I'm so PC. I'm so great

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:53.889
And and then what happens is because you're in denial

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.780
You actually become very manipulative because you're denying your true nature

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:05.290
but when you're aware of it, you can channel that aggressive energy into positive things like

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.140
Standing up for yourself

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:14.169
You're in a negotiation situation. Normally you're weak. Normally you don't, you know, you're not so strong

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:16.270
You you let them kind of determine. All right

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:22.660
Now here's a place where I can become aggressive and it's right and you're negotiating you're contrary you want to be grandiose

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:26.050
But here's a time when being aggressive is good

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:31.119
You want to be aggressive with your work? You want it to succeed you want to be persistent?

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:38.709
When something is unjust in this world when you think something is unfair you want to be aggressive in fighting it? Okay?

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.970
I know I'm aggressive here. I can show so awareness of your nature is

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.510
So much better than denial and repression. So those are the those are the best the fundamental insight

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:51.380
You don't know who you are

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:57.819
You have these dark forces you that are governing you awareness of those forces is a very liberating thing

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.899
Yeah back to pressure. We said earlier know thyself. It's yes great starting point. Yeah, Robert. Oh, when are we respectful of your time?

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:11.080
So before I asked my last question Oh is there is there a place where people should look for you online a particular platform?

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.660
Well, you know, I wish I were

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:17.949
Better at this, but I haven't a website that needs some updating

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:27.160
It's called power seduction and war.com power seduction and the an spelled out war.com

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.290
In case people don't know I wrote a book on the art of seduction so it doesn't sound so weird

01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:35.589
it's a little weird seduction in war but actually

01:11:36.739 --> 01:11:38.739
seduction is a form of warfare and

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:44.259
You'll find old blog posts, etc and a link to a mastery page

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:51.730
I do have a website for mastery and we're gonna be a build something new for the new book on human nature

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:58.989
Alright, so and I'm gonna start blogging a little bit more about things in the news. I haven't blogged for years

01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:01.870
And the book will be out

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.010

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:16.299

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.249
Well, Ryan handles my digital marketing. He's kind of a digital marketing master

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:24.010

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.839

But you know look for that in a couple months, you know more clay like in September

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:49.299
closer to the book launch on power seduction and war.com

01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:54.640
Yes, well, there'll be links to the new site from there. Okay, great. So

01:12:55.219 --> 01:12:56.300
Robert my final question

01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:04.000
Yes, you're talking to a young military leader and they're looking for advice to become a more strategic thinker

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.520
What suggestion would you give them?

01:13:07.139 --> 01:13:09.139
well, I mean

01:13:09.869 --> 01:13:17.719
You know strategy is is a combination a the reason why I like strategy is I'm a practical person and

01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:22.428
There's so much bullshit in the world today people just

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:28.789
Talking and talking and talking and talking and they never they don't mean anything. It doesn't mean anything, right?

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:35.989
Strategy is getting results. It's the bridge I call it the bridge between an idea and the result

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:40.639
And if you're not strategic you never get the result that you want

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:43.610
So it's it's a great thing

01:13:43.829 --> 01:13:49.849
So it it has to be a combination of two things. It has to be the idea and

01:13:50.729 --> 01:13:56.239
The bridge to the real is realizing the idea and one without the other is useless

01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:58.998
So if you read a lot of great books and strategy

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.820
It's kind of useless

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920
and if you only

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.820
try and

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.820
Get things done

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:11.119
You don't have a rich enough mind with enough

01:14:11.699 --> 01:14:15.859
Options in your brain to choose from you want to combine the book the two?

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.440
So what does that mean? If you're a young person in the military?

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:25.549
I'm sure you have to read a lot in your in your curriculum etc. So

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:31.789
Read the classics on strategy. There's so many good ones

01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:35.090
It's one area. I

01:14:35.579 --> 01:14:39.018
Happen to think that books now a lot of writers now, not all

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:43.159
But a lot of writers now are not as good as they were 50 60 years ago

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:45.710
But in strategy I'd make an exception

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:47.729
military writing is

01:14:47.729 --> 01:14:51.769
Better than ever some great writers Martin fan crevel Keegan

01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:59.598
I could go on and on a lot of great people writing about Litvak a lot of people writing about strategy that are really top-notch

01:15:01.889 --> 01:15:05.449
But choose your own books don't necessarily read

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.699
What what you're given?

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:13.699
Read things that are more exciting that are more relevant necessarily. I don't know. This is John Boyd

01:15:13.699 --> 01:15:18.949
For instance Colonel Boyd someone that is taught in classes these days. Oh, yeah. Yeah

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:26.560
Who'da loop is is huge - yeah curriculum on situational awareness. I used to teach tremendous. Okay, so I mean I'm operating from

01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:28.490
from

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.490
what I call a

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:33.970
Knowledge asymmetry of

01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:39.999
You know, I don't know as much as you do there's a lot of asymmetries in war and one of them is information

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So I don't know as much as you do

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.160
but

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.570
I'm personally

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:47.890
attracted to people like Boyd who who are outside the mainstream

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:53.740
But now obviously are accepted and there are others and there are other kind of radicals like that who are really interesting

01:15:53.750 --> 01:16:00.370
You know, you can look at my bibliography in war if you want to write to me I have other books that I recommend

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.410
and then prêt and then

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:06.009
Becoming a strategist in your life. So

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:09.070
in a day-to-day this

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:11.230
sense being more strategic

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:13.870
Practicing it not just reading about it

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.690
looking at your

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:21.220
You have a children and and and the boy is acting up

01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:28.779
Applying strategy to that situation and using reverse psychology and using a kind of

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:35.109
Counter-attack or flanking maneuver on your son not hard to do and I can talk about that in another interview

01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:40.629
Being strategic with your boss and your situation with your career

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:47.589
Grand strategy. Well, don't just wait for you becoming a general and being in charge of of

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.740
You know dealing with with terrorism in the Middle East practice grand strategy on yourself

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.670
Where do you want to be in 10 years? That's grand strategic thinking

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:03.819
Ok, I want to be at this point. I want to be you know, this is a person I admire I'm gonna get there

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:11.499
Okay now a plan for where you'll be in five years and then one year in the next month and building that up

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:13.880
strategist in life

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.330
Dealing with your boss dealing with colleagues

01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:19.930
Practicing it every day

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
catching yourself

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:25.120
Getting emotional stepping back and saying no

01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:28.479
remember Roberts number one principle

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.390
options

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:32.459
the person with more options wins

01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:40.109
If you're playing chess and you put it doesn't matter if the other side is decimated if you have less pieces

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:42.630
but if your queen is in a position

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:48.629
That can attack from four directions. You're gonna win hmm, you know options

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.590
think of that

01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:54.090
You're in a new situation. How can I have options to maneuver?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.480
Be a strategist in life not just reading the books

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.510
That'll that'll that's my main advice

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.210
Amazing Robert. Thank you so much. Oh my
