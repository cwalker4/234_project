00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.410
We're back with Amy Schumer.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.450
It's time to play Ellen's
Burning Questions.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.810
I'm going to read a question,
and you will answer.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.032
The first thing that
pops into your mind, OK?

00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:11.490
After you answer the question,
then you will hit the button

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.435
and move on.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.310
The button really doesn't
do anything at all.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.530
It's pointless, but it's
exciting to do that.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.030
All right?

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.440
Finish this sentence.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.480
I feel pretty when--

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.110
I'm nude.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930
Something no one
knows about you.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.320
I am a leprechaun.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.070
I wish I wasn't scared to--

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.570
Try drugs.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.520
Try lots of drugs.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.150
I'm scared.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.650
Yeah.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.330
Why, do you have something?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.200
You should be.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.661
No.

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:51.980
Something you're
obsessed with right now.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.410
The Great British
Baking Show Bake Off.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.300
Something you hate that
everyone else loves.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.895
Rod Stewart.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.848
You hate Rod Stewart?

00:01:06.848 --> 00:01:09.080
How come?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.570
How long has this been going on?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.390
My life.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.626
Have you-- what about "Maggie
May" and "Mandolin Wind," and--

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.000
Can we get back
to the questions?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.600
OK.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.490
Craziest place you've had sex.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.156
My butt.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.540
What is the last thing
Jennifer Lawrence texted you?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.410
Oh, she said do you want
to get dinner tonight?

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.519
Where are you right now?

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:39.810
Never mind, I can't get dinner.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.710
I have other plans.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.630
Before I even sent
her one text back.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.280
Who is your favorite
Kardashian and why?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.550
Oh, they change.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.610
But right now, Kim right now.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.440
I think it's really
cool that she's

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.680
started to help out with
trying to end gun violence.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.320
Is that right?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.820
Yeah.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.810
Good for her.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.387
My spouse gives the best--

00:01:59.387 --> 00:01:59.887
Head.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.950
I just have to tell everyone,
her mom is in the audience.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.590
Listening to all of these--

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.450
Oh that's right.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
Your mom is just--

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:22.270
Did you forget?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.980
I did forget.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.260
Can I take the stuff about
the butt and everything back?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.760
No.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.280
No?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.790
No.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.260
I think she's heard worse.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.070
OK.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.895
Trust me I have.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:33.080
Sorry, Mom.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.780
The last lie you told.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.730
Who my favorite Kardashian was.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.640
What do you think your
dog thinks of you?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.240
I think she thinks that
I should shower more.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.780
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.880
Who was your childhood
celebrity crush?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.140
Joey from The New Kids,
and it still stands today.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.790
Someone you'd like to
do a love scene with.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.520
Joey from The New Kids.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.790
Today.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.700
What would your signature
fragrance be called?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.930
I Should Shower More.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.610
What body part of your
spouse's is your favorite?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.980
It's a tie between his penis--

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.775
no, it's his penis.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.410
What body part of
yours is your favorite?

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.920
My penis.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.840
Oh my god.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.640
"I Feel Pretty" opens Friday.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.500
You should go see it, and take
your people, and daughters,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.320
and women.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.360
It's a beautiful--

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.860
Dogs.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.650
Take dogs.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.102
All of you should go see it.

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:42.810
It's really good.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.530
I Feel Pretty, it opens Friday.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.187
Hi, I'm Andy.

00:03:45.187 --> 00:03:47.520
Ellen asked me to remind you
to subscribe to her channel

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.360
so you can see more
awesome videos--

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.570
like videos of me getting scared
or saying embarrassing things,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.000
like ball peen hammer.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.760
And also some videos of
Ellen and other celebrities,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.950
if you're into
that sort of thing.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.300
