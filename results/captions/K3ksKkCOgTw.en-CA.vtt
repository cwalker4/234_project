&gt;&gt; Certainly I use those words

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:57.944 align:start position:0%
hyperbole, this is the real

Everyone thinks that the bad

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.412 align:start position:0%
deal.
Everyone thinks that the bad
effects of sugar are because

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.181 align:start position:0%
Everyone thinks that the bad
effects of sugar are because
sugar has empty calories.

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.816 align:start position:0%
effects of sugar are because
sugar has empty calories.
What I'm saying is no,

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.418 align:start position:0%
sugar has empty calories.
What I'm saying is no,
actually there are lots of

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:06.586 align:start position:0%
What I'm saying is no,
actually there are lots of
things that do have empty

actually there are lots of
things that do have empty

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.890 align:start position:0%
things that do have empty

necessarily poisons.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.191 align:start position:0%
calories that are not
necessarily poisons.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: Poisonous, he says,

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.226 align:start position:0%
necessarily poisons.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: Poisonous, he says,
because of what too much

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.661 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Gillian: Poisonous, he says,
because of what too much
sugar does in our body.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.396 align:start position:0%
because of what too much
sugar does in our body.
So let's take a look at that.

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:18.664 align:start position:0%
sugar does in our body.
So let's take a look at that.
Sugar is made up of two

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
So let's take a look at that.
Sugar is made up of two
molecules: One called glucose,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.735 align:start position:0%
Sugar is made up of two
molecules: One called glucose,
here in blue, the other

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:25.538 align:start position:0%
molecules: One called glucose,
here in blue, the other
fructose, in red.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.073 align:start position:0%
here in blue, the other
fructose, in red.
When they separate in our gut,

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:28.407 align:start position:0%
fructose, in red.
When they separate in our gut,
the glucose circulates

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:29.909 align:start position:0%
When they separate in our gut,
the glucose circulates
throughout our body feeding

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:32.378 align:start position:0%
the glucose circulates
throughout our body feeding
our muscles and our brain...

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.746 align:start position:0%
throughout our body feeding
our muscles and our brain...
but the fructose goes right to

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:34.780 align:start position:0%
our muscles and our brain...
but the fructose goes right to
our liver.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.048 align:start position:0%
but the fructose goes right to
our liver.
And its in the liver where all

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
our liver.
And its in the liver where all
kinds of problems begin.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.355 align:start position:0%
 
 
&gt;&gt; When you metabolize

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.657 align:start position:0%
 
&gt;&gt; When you metabolize
fructose in excess, your liver

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.559 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; When you metabolize
fructose in excess, your liver
has no choice but to turn that

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.395 align:start position:0%
fructose in excess, your liver
has no choice but to turn that
energy into liver fat, and

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.997 align:start position:0%
has no choice but to turn that
energy into liver fat, and
that liver fat then causes all

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.932 align:start position:0%
energy into liver fat, and
that liver fat then causes all
of the downstream metabolic

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.034 align:start position:0%
that liver fat then causes all
of the downstream metabolic
diseases.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:55.835 align:start position:0%
of the downstream metabolic
diseases.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: We'll tell you

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:56.802 align:start position:0%
diseases.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: We'll tell you
more about those diseases in a

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:57.770 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Gillian: We'll tell you
more about those diseases in a
moment.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.005 align:start position:0%
more about those diseases in a
moment.
But first let's talk about

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.606 align:start position:0%
moment.
But first let's talk about
your brain.

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:01.707 align:start position:0%
But first let's talk about
your brain.
Too much fructose, says

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.175 align:start position:0%
your brain.
Too much fructose, says
Lustig, shuts down the part of

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.077 align:start position:0%
Too much fructose, says
Lustig, shuts down the part of
your brain that tells you when

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.647 align:start position:0%
Lustig, shuts down the part of
your brain that tells you when
you're full.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:08.781 align:start position:0%
your brain that tells you when
you're full.
&gt;&gt; It doesn't get registered

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.349 align:start position:0%
you're full.
&gt;&gt; It doesn't get registered
by the brain as you're having

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:11.984 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It doesn't get registered
by the brain as you're having
eaten.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.386 align:start position:0%
by the brain as you're having
eaten.
So, if you take a kid and prep

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.489 align:start position:0%

So, if you take a kid and prep
him with a soft drink and then

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:17.723 align:start position:0%
So, if you take a kid and prep
him with a soft drink and then
let him loose at the fast food

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.058 align:start position:0%
him with a soft drink and then
let him loose at the fast food
restaurant, does he eat less

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.227 align:start position:0%
let him loose at the fast food
restaurant, does he eat less
or does he eat more?

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:25.898 align:start position:0%
restaurant, does he eat less
or does he eat more?
Turns out he eats more.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
 
&gt;&gt; I think there's a long way

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:29.035 align:start position:0%
 
&gt;&gt; I think there's a long way

I think it's more important

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.018 align:start position:0%

I think it's more important
that we step back and look at

I think it's more important
that we step back and look at

&gt;&gt; Well, how did you figure it
out?

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.894 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, how did you figure it

By the nutrition facts table.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: I figured that out

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:30.596 align:start position:0%
By the nutrition facts table.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: I figured that out
because I've spent a lot of

&gt;&gt; To what end though?

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:11.404 align:start position:0%
sugar.
&gt;&gt; To what end though?
&gt;&gt; Gillian: Well, if they have

&gt;&gt; Well, let me see.

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.780 align:start position:0%
less sugar.
&gt;&gt; Well, let me see.
Then they would use this same

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.351 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, let me see.
Then they would use this same
label.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.118 align:start position:0%
Then they would use this same
label.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: The only

&gt;&gt; Gillian: The only

Do you know what that means?

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:35.795 align:start position:0%
 
 
You shouldn't have to be a

You shouldn't have to be a

You shouldn't have to be a

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.599 align:start position:0%
dietitian to figure out how
much added sugar you're

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:41.634 align:start position:0%
much added sugar you're

Jaclyn Pritchard has added up

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.405 align:start position:0%
all the sugar Jonathon eats in

It's pretty scary.

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.406 align:start position:0%

It's pretty scary.
&gt;&gt; This is your week's worth

It's pretty scary.
&gt;&gt; This is your week's worth

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.211 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; This is your week's worth

So this is equivalent to 245

of sugar intake then.
So this is equivalent to 245

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.850 align:start position:0%
So this is equivalent to 245

&gt;&gt; What we find when we look

&gt;&gt; What we find when we look
at those trials very carefully

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.804 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; What we find when we look
at those trials very carefully
is that as long as you match

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
at those trials very carefully
is that as long as you match
for calories, fructose does

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:09.574 align:start position:0%
is that as long as you match
for calories, fructose does
not behave differently than

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:11.009 align:start position:0%
for calories, fructose does
not behave differently than
does any other form of

does any other form of

Now, that's not to say that

Now, that's not to say that
they're benign, because I

Now, that's not to say that
they're benign, because I
don't think we should be

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:17.816 align:start position:0%
they're benign, because I
don't think we should be

do you believe that sugar

do you believe that sugar

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.785 align:start position:0%
do you believe that sugar
consumption causes cancer?
&gt;&gt; I think yes.

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; I think yes.
I think that eating too much

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.989 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think yes.
I think that eating too much
sugar can definitely increase

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:32.724 align:start position:0%
I think that eating too much
sugar can definitely increase
the probability of cancer, and

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:34.926 align:start position:0%
sugar can definitely increase
the probability of cancer, and
also make the outcome of

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:35.961 align:start position:0%
the probability of cancer, and
also make the outcome of
people who already have

also make the outcome of
people who already have

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:39.998 align:start position:0%
people who already have

&gt;&gt; Gillian: So how?

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.433 align:start position:0%
cancer, uh, worse.
&gt;&gt; Gillian: So how?
Well, let's review what sugar

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.801 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Gillian: So how?
Well, let's review what sugar
is made of: One molecule

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:45.337 align:start position:0%
Well, let's review what sugar
is made of: One molecule
glucose and one fructose.

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:46.371 align:start position:0%
is made of: One molecule
glucose and one fructose.
We know that when there's too

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:48.306 align:start position:0%
glucose and one fructose.
We know that when there's too
much fructose in the liver, it

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.642 align:start position:0%
We know that when there's too
much fructose in the liver, it
sets off a chain reaction.

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:52.010 align:start position:0%
much fructose in the liver, it
sets off a chain reaction.
The pancreas produces more

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.411 align:start position:0%
sets off a chain reaction.
The pancreas produces more
insulin.

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:54.746 align:start position:0%
The pancreas produces more
insulin.
What Cantley now believes is

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:56.615 align:start position:0%
insulin.
What Cantley now believes is
that excess insulin changes

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.683 align:start position:0%
What Cantley now believes is
that excess insulin changes
cancer tumours, telling them to

00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
that excess insulin changes
cancer tumours, telling them to
gobble up the glucose.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.922 align:start position:0%
cancer tumours, telling them to
gobble up the glucose.
&gt;&gt; What we're now learning is

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:06.358 align:start position:0%
gobble up the glucose.
&gt;&gt; What we're now learning is
that some of the cancers,

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; What we're now learning is
that some of the cancers,
particularly those cancers

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.260 align:start position:0%
that some of the cancers,
particularly those cancers
that correlate with obesity

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.363 align:start position:0%
particularly those cancers
that correlate with obesity
and diabetes, often have

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.198 align:start position:0%
that correlate with obesity
and diabetes, often have
insulin receptor on the cancer

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:14.466 align:start position:0%
and diabetes, often have
insulin receptor on the cancer
cell.

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.867 align:start position:0%
insulin receptor on the cancer
cell.
The tumour, by expressing the

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:17.569 align:start position:0%
cell.
The tumour, by expressing the
insulin receptor, tricks the

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:18.803 align:start position:0%
The tumour, by expressing the
insulin receptor, tricks the
glucose into going into the

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
insulin receptor, tricks the
glucose into going into the
tumour, rather than the muscle

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
glucose into going into the
tumour, rather than the muscle
and fat.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.907 align:start position:0%
tumour, rather than the muscle
and fat.
And as a consequence, the

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.609 align:start position:0%
and fat.
And as a consequence, the
tumour can use that glucose as

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:28.546 align:start position:0%
And as a consequence, the
tumour can use that glucose as
a fuel to grow.

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:29.447 align:start position:0%
 
 
&gt;&gt; Gillian: So if sugar can

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:30.949 align:start position:0%
 
&gt;&gt; Gillian: So if sugar can
fuel existing tumours and make

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:33.018 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Gillian: So if sugar can
fuel existing tumours and make
them grow, can it also cause

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.452 align:start position:0%
fuel existing tumours and make
them grow, can it also cause
tumours to form in the first

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:36.187 align:start position:0%
them grow, can it also cause
tumours to form in the first
place?

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:37.155 align:start position:0%
tumours to form in the first
place?
The science on that isn't as

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.490 align:start position:0%

The science on that isn't as

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.994 align:start position:0%
But Cantley is taking no

&gt;&gt; It scares me, yes, I think

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.830 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; It scares me, yes, I think
if definitely -- I don't, you

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.233 align:start position:0%

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:50.435 align:start position:0%
if definitely -- I don't, you

has sugar in it obviously.

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:52.003 align:start position:0%

Uh, but if I can avoid any

Uh, but if I can avoid any
sugar at all, and any drinks

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.807 align:start position:0%
Uh, but if I can avoid any
sugar at all, and any drinks
that I drink, or foods, I try

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.042 align:start position:0%
sugar at all, and any drinks
that I drink, or foods, I try
to avoid processed foods,

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:58.043 align:start position:0%
that I drink, or foods, I try
to avoid processed foods,
'cause it's hard to find one
