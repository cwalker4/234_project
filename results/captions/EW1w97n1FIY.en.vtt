00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.930
In this short video, you are about to see
how an ancient Bible prophecy predicting the

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:25.660
next 2500 years of history in advance impacts
you I, who are living in these end times.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.240
Daniel was written in the 6th century BC.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.710
Skeptics have tried to discredit this book
by placing the date of it’s writing at a

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.010
later time, but archaeological evidence such
as the dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls help

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.820
show that Daniel was indeed written during
the time the Bible claims.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.420
As we turn to the second chapter of this apocalyptic
book, we find ourselves in the courts of ancient

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.760
Babylon.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.580
The great King Nebuchadnezzar has invaded
Judah and taken Daniel and his friends captive,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.579
with the intention of educating them in the
Babylonian system.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.820
The chapter begins with the king being troubled
by a startling nightmare.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.150
He calls for the best and brightest men of
His kingdom to reveal to the king both his

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.860
dream and it’s interpretation.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.500
These pagan men accurately declared to the
king “..There is not a man upon the earth

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.570
that can shew the king's matter.. there is
none other that can shew it before the king,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240
except the gods..”

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.180
-These men new that only a divine power could
actually reveal the unknown.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.540
In his fury, the King then announced that
all the wise men of Babylon should be killed.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.630
The message soon came to Daniel and his friends,
Hebrews who worshipped the God of the Bible.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.240
Rather than panic, Daniel calmly requested
some time, so that he could join his friends

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.979
in prayer, seeking an understanding of the
king’s vision.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.740
His prayer is recorded in Daniel 2:20-23:
“..Blessed be the name of God for ever and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.880
ever: for wisdom and might are his: And he
changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.119
kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom
unto the wise, and knowledge to them that

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.090
know understanding: He revealeth the deep
and secret things: he knoweth what is in the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.470
darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.560
I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God
of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.130
might, and hast made known unto me now what
we desired of thee: for thou hast now made

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.319
known unto us the king's matter.”

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.171
God had revealed the king’s dream to Daniel!

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.870
Daniel is then quickly rushed into the king’s
presence.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.000
The king eagerly asks Daniel if he is able
to reveal the dream to him.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.950
Daniel responds with great wisdom: “The
secret which the king hath demanded cannot

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.360
the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians,
the soothsayers, shew unto the king; But there

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.090
is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets,
and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.160
what shall be in the latter days.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.290
Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon
thy bed, are these..”

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.620
Here Daniel is giving all the credit to God.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.720
He is also showing the difference between
the true God of the Bible and all the other

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.310
false religions which claim to know the truth.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.010
Daniel now reveals the dream:
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.870
This great image, whose brightness was excellent,
stood before thee; and the form thereof was

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.400
terrible.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.010
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast
and his arms of silver, his belly and his

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:56.690
thighs of brass, His legs of iron, his feet
part of iron and part of clay.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.849
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out
without hands, which smote the image upon

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:10.750
his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake
them to pieces.Then was the iron, the clay,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.650
the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken
to pieces together.. ..and the stone that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.120
smote the image became a great mountain, and
filled the whole earth.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.590
(Daniel 2:31-35)
At this time, the king is most certainly on

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.220
the edge of his seat, hanging on Daniel’s
every word.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.860
Daniel then confidently precedes to reveal
the meaning of the dream to the king.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.389
“Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for
the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom,

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.150
power, and strength, and glory..Thou art this
head of gold.”

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.610
(Dan 2:37-38)
Daniel clearly identifies King Nebuchadnezzar

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.840
and his mighty kingdom of Babylon as the head
of gold represented in this dream.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.610
Gold was a fitting symbol for Babylon as it
wealth and greatness were unrivaled in the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.580
ancient world.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.389
Greek historian Herodotus notes that “Babylon
surpasses in splendor any city in the known

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.389
world."

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.210
He goes on to describe the outer walls of
Babylon to be 320 feet high, 56 miles long,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.620
and 80 feet thick – wide enough to race
multiple chariots side by side on top of them.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.220
Babylon could also boast of the hanging gardens
– one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.680
However, much to the king’s dismay, his
kingdom would not last forever.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.020
Daniel 2:39 reads “And after thee shall
arise another kingdom inferior to thee..”

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.530
(Daniel 2:39)
The history books are clear that, sure enough,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.650
Babylon would be overtaken.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.210
The Medo-Persian Empire would become the next
world power.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.120
Before Medo-Persia would come to power, the
Bible identifies this kingdom by name:

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.800
Daniel 8:20 specifically states “..the kings
of Media and Persia.”

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.889
(Daniel 8:20)
The Persian army, led by Cyrus the Great,

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.639
conquered Babylon in 539 BC.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.121
Silver was a fitting metal for this kingdom,
as Medo-Persia was inferior to Babylon, and

00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:13.620
used silver as a primary mode of currency.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.490
Daniel continues to boldly reveal the dream’s
meaning by describing the 3rd metal:

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.430
“..and another third kingdom of brass, which
shall bear rule over all the earth.”

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.259
(Daniel 2:39)
Historians agree that this next kingdom, led

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.850
by Alexander the Great, is none other than
the kingdom of Greece.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.570
The Bible, once again, accurately predicted
this kingdom by name, centuries before it

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.060
rose to power:
Daniel 8:21 mentions “..the king of Grecia..”

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.340
(Daniel 8:21) as being the king who would
conquer Medo-Persia.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.690
Daniel next addresses the legs of iron:
“And the fourth kingdom shall be strong

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.730
as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces
and subdueth all things: and as iron that

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.870
breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces
and bruise.”

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.930
(Daniel 2:40)
A more fitting description could not be given

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.610
for the next kingdom – the powerful Empire
of Rome.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.350
(image with 168 B.C. - 476 A.D.)

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.740
-Known for their dominant army and brutal
power, Rome has been given the fitting nickname

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.759
“the Iron Monarchy”.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.690
This Empire, described in the New Testament
of the Bible, ruled during the time of Christ.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.460
Roman soldiers whipped Jesus with an iron
“cat of nine-tails”, drove iron nails

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.030
into his innocent hands, and pierced His side
with an iron spear.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:37.310
So far, God has revealed, the rise and fall
of 4 powerful world Empires.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.220
The history books confirm the accuracy of
this amazing prophecy.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.790
But Daniel was is not finished.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.759
He goes on to describe the feet of this great
image, and with incredible detail, reveals

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:55.270
their historical significance:
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.380
part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the
kingdom shall be divided..

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.220
..And as the toes of the feet were part of
iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.639
be partly strong, and partly broken.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:12.419
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry
clay, they shall mingle themselves with the

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:18.440
seed of men: but they shall not cleave one
to another, even as iron is not mixed with

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440
clay.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.680
(Daniel 2:41-43)
History affirms the Bible’s account that

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.919
Rome was not overtaken by a single dominant
empire, but was divided up into sections.

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:31.490
These sections are what we know today as modern
Europe.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:37.769
Amazingly, Daniel reveals that these nations
would not “cleave one to another” – that

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:42.279
is, they would never unite into one dominant
kingdom.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:49.760
Incredibly, history reveals that even this
very detailed part of the prophecy is accurate.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.810
The Bible mentioned that they would “mingle
themselves with the seed men” – this intermarriage

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.980
of royalty was widespread.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.179
But, as the Bible predicted, these nations
would not cleave.

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:05.699
Charlemagne tried to unite Europe, and failed.

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:09.079
Napoleon tried to unite Europe, and failed.

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:14.350
Hitler, despite controlling the majority of
the continent at one point, and being poised

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.499
to take control, failed unite Europe.

00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:23.559
Europe has never, and will never, be united
into one Empire.

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:29.779
The Bible’s predictions have always come
to pass, and will never fail.

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:35.569
This prophecy of Daniel has revealed 2500
years of earth’s history with striking,

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:37.300
pinpoint accuracy.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.589
But friends, there is still one part of the
prophecy that is yet to be fulfilled.

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:50.319
But we can be certain, we can have no doubts,
that it will come to pass just as surely as

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:52.749
the rest of this prophecy.

00:09:52.749 --> 00:09:57.499
Speaking of the days of modern Europe, in
which we live in today, Daniel exclaims:

00:09:57.499 --> 00:10:02.889
And in the days of these kings shall the God
of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:07.999
be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but it shall break in

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:12.790
pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and
it shall stand for ever.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.360
(Daniel 2:44)
Daniel clearly states the final event of this

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.329
ground-breaking prophecy.

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:25.519
The God of Heaven will set up a kingdom that
will never be destroyed.

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:29.809
Friend, you can be a part of this kingdom!

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:34.119
You can live forever in paradise with the
God of the universe!
