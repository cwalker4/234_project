00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:00.850
I

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.259
Want to talk to you this morning about the battle that rages for your mind

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.900
And you have to be aware

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.019
That Satan is coming against this generation

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.290
in an unprecedented measure

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.389
He is attacking this generation to take the thoughts of God out of the minds of an entire society

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.189
He's doing it through the school system. He's doing it in our colleges. He's doing it in the marketplace

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.968
He's doing it in the halls of government and he's even doing it in the house of God

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.750
Trying to eradicate

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.329
Everything that comes from the mind of God

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.329
to blind an entire generation

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.899
to take captives as many as he can for the scripture says he knows that his time is short and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.129
We have precedence in history to know that this can happen

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.629
these people in the book of Genesis were not that far from

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.509
the testimony of the creation of God

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.169
They would have the stories they they would have the knowledge

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.409
They they had the lineage just like so many have throughout history

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.309
but they allowed something to take over the fallen nature of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.379
humankind that fallen nature that was sewn into humankind in the Garden of Eden

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.189
That which is resident within you and me

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.779
All of society every man, every woman ever created has this capacity of sin inside that manifests itself

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.699
through the thought that I can be as God and I can determine in

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.890
Myself. What is good? And what is evil? I don't need God to tell me what the parameters of acceptable behavior are

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.409
I can determine that on my own

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.350
that's

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.850
exactly

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.600
The warfare just as Satan came in and tempted Adam and Eve with this thought and they bought into this thought and they stepped outside

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.649
To the parameters of the protection of God and look at the heartache that came into humanity because of it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.439
Look at the heartache that visited their own home. When one of their sons became a murderer and murdered his brother

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.140
although the devil never paints the whole picture

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.959
He only paints a little piece of the canvas and it's always the little piece that's got sunshine in it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.140
he never paints the side that has death the side that has decay in despair and depression and addiction and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.370
Hopelessness and broken families and tears and sorrow he never paints that side of the canvas. He only paints the sunny side first

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.949
Bible tells us in the book of Romans

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.489
Chapter 1

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.019
What a society looks like that falls into spiritual decline

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.959
When people can no longer and will no longer hear the words of God when a rebellion gets a hold of a people

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.569
Whether it's through ignorance or whether it's deliberate or just simply through neglect

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.999
listen to what Paul writes and describes is the spiritual and moral decline of

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.349
Any society that chooses to follow in the same footsteps

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.239
That those in the days of Noah decided to walk in

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.039
Verse 18 of Romans 1 says the wrath of God is revealed from heaven

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.540
against all ungodliness

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.540
And unrighteousness of men who?

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.129
suppress the truth or hold down the truth in unrighteousness

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.449
Because what may be known of God is manifest in them for God has shown it to them folks. Listen to me

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.600
I've been here 21 years in America. I came here in 1994

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.019
at the invitation of pastor David Wilkerson and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.880
I remember

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.899
Coming here thinking what an incredible nation. This is the freedom here. I remember people out on the streets

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.239
dressed in some kind of costume literally cursing people up and down as they walked by and

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.779
I thought where in America would you be allowed to do this?

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.548
Where I've come from you'd be arrested and thrown in a loony bin for what these guys and girls were doing

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.479
But in 21 years, I have witnessed the moral decline of this nation. I

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.209
Witnessed something that terrifies my heart. I've watched a whole generation taken captive by ungodly thought and moved away

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.989
From the very fabric of what makes the nation strong and what makes it people truly virtuous

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.859
Verse 19 says what may be known of God is manifest in them for God has shown it to them

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.229
There is no reason for the spiritual ignorance

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.288
That is being displayed in this nation today

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.849
For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are clearly seen

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.359
being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse because

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.979
although they knew God they did not glorify Him as God verse 21

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.440
Nor we're thankful, but became futile in their thoughts and their foolish hearts were darkened professing

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.180
To be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like corruptible, man

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.329
birds and four-footed animals and creeping things

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.169
Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness in the lusts of their hearts to dishonour their bodies among themselves

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.479
Which changed the truth of God for the lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator who is blessed for every men

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.750
For this reason God gave them up to vile passions

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.699
for even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature and

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.159
Likewise also the men leaving the man use of the woman burned in their lust one for another

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.049
Men with men committing that which is shameful and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.070
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.479
To do things that are not fitting you see here's the opponent. They didn't want to retain God than their knowledge

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.799
They wanted the name of God eradicated from their society

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.960
They wanted the name of Jesus only to be a curse word in g-rated movies

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.390
They this is what they wanted of God

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.359
They wanted everything that would remind them of the one would bless them taken out of their coasts

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.209
We look in the testimony of Scripture and remember the man in the in the gathering

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.309
cemetery that was set free by Jesus Christ from a Thousand Devils a

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.459
Man that nobody could tame and yet when he went into the society and made his testimony of what God had done

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.719
Description says the whole town came out and they encouraged Jesus to leave their borders and do his work somewhere else

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.640
Oh how history repeats itself. God comes sets of people free

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.919
Gives blessing and power gives knowledge and understanding and we do the same

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.309
Thing in ignorance that many before I've done saying thank you for what you did, but would you mind leaving our borders?

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.880
We'll take it from here now

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880
Would you mind letting us alone?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.909
We don't want you interrupting our good lifestyle

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.669
We don't want you interrupting our Commerce our pursuit of life our ideas of liberty and happiness

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.249
we choose to embrace these things as

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:16.239
We envision them to be not as your word says that they are verse 29 says being filled with all unrighteousness

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.109
sexual immorality wickedness covetousness maliciousness

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.849
full of envy murder deceit strife evil mindedness whisperers backbiters

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.239
haters of God violent proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.750
Sounds like the news

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.579
undiscerning untrustworthy unloving unforgiving

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:44.270
Unmerciful who knowing the righteous judgment of God that those who practice such things are deserving of death

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:51.410
Not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them not wanting God in our thoughts

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.070
It will always lead to the same place

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:02.029
You know, the definition of a fool is somebody who does the same thing over and over again and every time for expecting different results

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.959
The pattern is there the history is there

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.930
It's it's not hidden

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.500
Like Paul said in Romans 1 we know it we have history books at least something of history might be left

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.579
We've seen what's happened to other societies who have done exactly what this society is now attempting to do

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.180
You know in the days of Noah

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.620
Said God looked down and it repented him. He was sorry in his heart for what he had created and

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.530
the scripture tells us

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.779
in Matthew chapter 24

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.249
Jesus talks about the days that Noah says but as the days of Noah were so

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.559
We'll also the coming of the Son of Man. He's now talking about the return of Jesus Christ

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.200
And he likens it to the days of Noah

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.259
I want you to listen carefully to this as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.459
giving it marriage until the day that Noah entered the Ark and

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.299
They did not know until the flood came and took them all away. So

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.010
Also, will the coming of the Son of Man be?

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.020
They had no idea

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.020
How short their time was?

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:22.549
Every day passing by this visible testimony of God that was set before them. There was a place of mercy

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.260
Peter in the New Testament calls Noah a preacher of righteousness

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.670
I'm sure he most likely stood there inviting people into this place of safety prepared by God

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.270
but the society around him the thoughts were so

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:45.739
Encapsulated in rebellion against God that even though they could recognize that this was something supernatural

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.249
This was something sovereign they couldn't embrace it

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.909
And they had no idea in their minds. They were marrying their giving in marriage in their minds. They were righteous

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:02.240
They were committed they were committing one to another what possible issue. Could God have with this?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.920
they were

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.849
Feasting as if there was a million tomorrow's folks. Do you know how close we are to the coming of Jesus Christ?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.109
The Bible tells us we don't know the very day or the hour

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.779
But we're not children of darkness that that day should overtake us as a thief. Can you see it?

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:26.059
Do you understand that we're on the threshold of the return of Christ now? He's right at the doors

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:32.899
I can hear his footsteps coming. There's something in my heart. That's saying get your lamp out trim your lamp. Get ready

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:39.020
Behold the bridegroom is coming go up to meet him that's got to be the cry of the church

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.909
Now the bridegroom is coming go out to meet him get oil in your lamp. Get ready

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.170
The son of God is coming the world as we know it is coming to an end

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:54.679
It's all coming to an end this insanity in the Middle Eastern nation now rising against nation

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.070
He's coming upon the earth. Just as Jesus said they want

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:05.309
All leading to this definitive moment folks the ungodly know that Christ is coming

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.890
There's something in the hearts of every man woman and child that knows the hour. We're living it

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:18.719
We're living in the season of Christ's return. I fully expect this event scripture calls the rapture of the Church of Jesus Christ

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.850
I expect it to happen any day now

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.930
Even in the Church of Jesus Christ, there's a dullness in months. Not all thank God

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.989
I'm not standing here to indict the body of Christ

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.920
It's not my job

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:41.969
But I'm telling you there's many places where that people in God's house are just as blind as the people outside of God's house

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.289
The last king of Babylon was called

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.280
belteshazzar and

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.269
Here the history he knew God that God had dealt with one of his forefathers severely to show that man

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.719
that the kingdoms belong to God and he sits on

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:03.749
The throne who he chooses and he takes off for me chooses and that knowledge was not hidden from him

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.719
But yet he chose to take the holy things of God that had been taken out of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:10.990
and he

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:17.340
threw a feast for all of his friends and all of his family and they put wine in these vessels and they began to

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.429
party, and they praised the gods of gold and silver and stoned and wood and

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.520
Then suddenly the writing of a hand

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:34.799
Appears on a wall its sovereign and they know that God's trying to speak but nobody in the room can understand what it says

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.680
And that's what happens when you begin to party with the holy things of God when you take lightly

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:48.060
The cross of Jesus Christ when that kind of a spirit gets ahold of God's people they open the book, but they can't understand it

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.450
The hand of God wrote this book

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.640
Through the Apostle Paul's you Matthew Mark Luke and John it was a human hand

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.579
But it was and of God superimposed over them that wrote the words of this book

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:10.389
And when people take lightly this salvation when Christ is only just an add-on to an already set in motion life plan

00:13:10.819 --> 00:13:16.239
When Jesus is no more than a song on Sunday and fire insurance for the rest of the week when there's no living

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:20.318
Relationship men and women don't read their Bible because they can't understand it

00:13:21.589 --> 00:13:23.739
And that's what happens with the party crowd

00:13:24.589 --> 00:13:29.438
The Jesus party crowd that's what happens to them. So it's happening in this generation. Oh

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:30.980
how

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.579
Unaware they're going to be how caught off guard

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:41.318
Men are going to be when all hell begins to break out and they'd stand in their congregations. They preach you told me

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:47.979
that if I would come to Jesus it would be nothing but wealth and health and happiness and prosperity and a bigger slice of the

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.980
pie

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.000
Your lied to me and

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.600
So they called for the men of God

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:03.909
They knew there was a man of God still left in the kingdom and Daniel stood before Belshazzar in all of his entourage

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.380
And he said here's what God's Word says

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.340
You've been weighed in the balance and you've been found wanting

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.800
And God has numbered the days of your kingdom and finished it

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.149
and even though you stand in the place of power and authority

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.230
Your kingdom is over he's giving it to somebody else another nation is going to take your place

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.040
Now the interesting thing is

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.359
The servant of God stood there in the words of God were clear

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.160
There was no ambiguity. There was no misunderstanding

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:50.280
But this king Belshazzar and possibly many who are with him. They could recognize truth but strangely couldn't hear it

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.560
They could recognize it. You could be sitting here this morning and you can recognize is that man is speaking from God

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.320
The words that he speaks I know they're true, but you can't be moved to change your behavior through it

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:10.379
You can't be moved to bend your knee. You can't be moved to say my ways are not God's ways

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.020
It's a strange affliction of those who've played games with the holy things of God the ability to recognize

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.780
Truth but a lack of ability to embrace

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.100
what they recognize

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.960
Daniel students before Belshazzar and says your kingdom is over your

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.720
Season of a ruling is finished. Your military mind is not going to save you now

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.660
And he stands before Belshazzar and tells him your kingdom is done

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.780
It's been given to somebody else and what this Belshazzar do, he commands his

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.960
Servant surrounded missus promote Daniel to the third highest ruler in the kingdom

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.700
Put a gold chain on his neck and put new robes on his back. So here he is. Daniel's just standing there

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.080
It must have been so incredulous this

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.000
Foolish king was decorating him while the enemies were right at the gate

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:09.280
Recognizing and decorating and honoring a man who spoke the truth, but yet unwilling to bend his knee to what he was hearing

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.620
If you are able to be under conviction

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:28.828
Thank God for it if you are living in sin, and you are bothered by it

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:35.729
Thank God that you are bothered that means God is still in your thoughts. God is still with you

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.959
God is still fighting for you

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.380
The danger is that when God is no longer

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.980
in your thoughts when you've sinned away the deep grace as they used to preach years ago in the house of God when you've so

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.300
Resisted God then finally is withdrawn. And says okey have it your way

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.770
live you way

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.770
Create your own system of right and wrong

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.410
don't

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:04.680
Bend your knee to God and he walks away and a man who lives in evil starts thinking he's doing good even begins to think

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.700
That heaven might be his home when it's all over

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:13.060
God is no longer in any of his thoughts as in the days of Noah his thoughts are continuously evil

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.480
He doesn't think they're evil

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.480
But when you when you have expelled God from the borders of your mind, there's nothing left

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:27.060
But that which is created out of the human spirit which in contrast to the holiness of God of course is evil

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.880
No matter the difficulty of the time

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.000
that's why Hebrews chapter 3 and 4 three times says

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.240
You can still hear God

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.830
Don't harden your heart

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:58.280
If God is in your thoughts of God is fighting against that which wants to occupy your mind if you feel like there's a war

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:04.160
Going on inside of your head. Thank God. There is a war. That means two opposing sides are still there

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.439
When there's no longer war you've either given in to one side or the other?

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.680
But thank God there's a war thank God that those of us who know him

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.819
We we can't do wrong without being convicted of the holy spirit immediately

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.199
That what we're doing is dishonouring to God we can't speak something

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.830
We shouldn't speak without you can't even if I say something I shouldn't say

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.510
I can't get from here to the end of the platform without him suddenly talking. Hey, wait a minute. Get back here

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.229
We got to talk about something. Thank God. Thank God

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.460
We all struggle with our thoughts

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:47.390
We all battle despair knocks on every door depression tries to find lust comes to every mind

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:54.439
The tendency to want to exaggerate embellish your outright lie comes to every person we want to be angry

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.070
We want to hate those that persecute us and speak evil of us

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:05.920
We fight in our minds, but the difference is that the true believer God is in our thoughts

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:12.120
God is with us in our thoughts. He is touched with the feelings of our infirmities

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.540
He's not aloof he's not angry he's not critical he doesn't stand as judge

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:22.009
He stands as the one who says come to me in your time of struggle come quickly to the throne of grace

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.479
That I may help you in your time of need God is with us in our thoughts

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.780
I thank the Lord for that with all my heart and he promises us victory and power to withstand

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:39.340
The downward pall of this fallen generation and there is a huge downward pull

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:46.680
To conform now in this generation. We are living in a time very much like Daniels time when

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:53.260
Statues of our being raised up of what man says this is what the image of society should look like

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.820
And when you hear the music you better bow or you're going to suffer for it

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.340
God is the only one who can give us the power to stand

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.560
God is the one

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:32.840
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal the weapons of our warfare are mighty the weapons of our warfare

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.420
God gives us through faith in the finished victory of Christ on the cross

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:44.260
He gives us the power to pull down these thoughts that would try to rise up and exalt themselves above the knowledge of God

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:51.169
Whether they're coming in from the outside or they're coming in from the inside as Paul said I've got Fighting's without and fears within

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.960
It doesn't matter where they come from God

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.420
Promises me the power to pull them down.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.600
I Can walk in the light of Scripture, I can walk in the truth of God I can stand in an evil day

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.540
I Can be given authority to make a difference

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.680
Even though everything around me looks like it's going the other way

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:16.100
And I might seem you might seem like the only fish in the stream going upstream and everybody else is going the opposite direction

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.940
but God says I've given you weaponry and power to pull down these strongholds and

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.639
To cast down these arguments and all these high things that have exalted themselves

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.089
Against the knowledge of God and to bring these thoughts into captivity

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.500
That's why it's so important to win the battle of the mind

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.680
That is the battleground that we've got to fight on now and that's where the battle must be won

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.000
Because we are all that is left

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:53.140
To stay the hand of God's judgment on this nation hear me on this. We're all that's left

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.540
There's no political party

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.770
There's no new preacher

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.800
There's nothing good to have this nation is on a collision course with Almighty. God himself

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.100
And there's nothing left to stop it from where it's going, but you and me

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:15.880
Coming in boldly as Hebrews tells us to do to the throne room of grace and say God. I'm not here just for myself

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.600
Thank you God for winning this victory, but I'm here for my city. I'm here for my family. I'm here for my friends

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.520
I'm here for my enemies. I'm here God

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.200
For those that don't even know who you are

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:33.740
I'm here to cast down in the name of Jesus Christ the thoughts that are holding them captive and

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:39.859
Keeping them from the salvation. That's freely offered them in Christ Jesus. That's why folks

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.260
We've got to pray like we've never prayed before

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.240
This is not an hour for player to play. It's an hour to pray

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:53.300
It's an hour to come into the throne room of God. It's an hour to be filled with faith. It's an hour to stand

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.409
Moses stood before Pharaoh and say no deals with you

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.000
It's an hour to come to the throne of God not in our strength

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.539
But in our weakness not with a history of our faithfulness

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:14.600
But with a recognition that God's mercy has covered everything that we've done to offend his name

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.100
coming into that throne room of grace in the midst of our

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:26.509
Recognition of our own poverty in our own name not coming in with arrogance not coming in knowing everything but knowing this one thing

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.559
There's only one name given under heaven whereby men might be saved

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:42.019
Coming in and believing that wouldn't we pray God hears us if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.389
I'll hear from heaven. I'll forgive their sin and heal their land

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.279
Jesus said now my eyes will be open in my ears. We'll be listening for the prayer that is prayed in this place

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.830
It's time to pray folks. It's time to pray

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.830
It's not about a program and I'm talking about a program

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.970
It's time to pray it's life or death for people now

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.940
It's time to pray we've come to the very border of becoming a godless nation

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.909
It's time to pray it's time for you and I to go down knees and begin to petition God

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.970
It's time for us to make a decision

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.119
As Joshua said to the people of his day

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:35.930
If it seemed difficult for you to serve the Lord choose this day whom you're going to serve but as for me in my house

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.970
We will serve the Lord choose

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.879
The state choose this day choose to say whom you're going to serve choose to stand

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:50.179
Choose to be alight choose to be a man and woman to prayer choose to be a great relationship with men and God

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.880
Choose to do it God's Way choose to walk inside of the boundaries of the text of Scripture

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.550
Choose it with all your heart

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.319
Only the prayer meeting can save America nothing else is going to make a difference

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.760
We are always left

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.509
As Aaron once did

00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:28.749
With the only thing that stands between a rebellious people and the wrath of a holy God

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.890
We're played away our damn grace in this nation. We have snapped our noses of God too long

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:46.820
We've entered into the fields of the fatherless forgetting that God's Word says 50 million babies have been aborted in this nation and

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.229
We're going into the schools of those we didn't kill in the womb and telling them there is no God

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.539
We have entered into the fields of the fatherless

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.520
And God says when you do that I will rise up and defend them

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.469
We've crossed the line in the society

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.709
The only thing left is the permit the only thing left is you and I

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.580
Going again to our knees

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.209
with lives as much as we know a walking in obedience to

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.440
what God has asked us to do and with hearts filled with faith and

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.670
with a passion, you know hardnesses of God Oh

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.620
God

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.069
This is my prayer. Most every morning now. I

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.590
Said Lord if New York City

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.980
If people in this city go to hell let it be because they had a choice

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.659
Let it be because they knew and rejected the truth

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.079
But don't let anybody end up there who never heart. I

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.889
Pray God for an awakening in the city in every Church

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:54.619
I don't care what names on the door anyone old Jesus son of God visit the people who come to your house

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.909
Visit our parks our businesses our schools

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.109
Visit us God as you've done in the days of old I

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.490
Know what God can do

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:14.119
I know he can visit the society. It looks so big to us look so

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.930
Insurmountable, but that's always the way it's been throughout the course of history

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:26.119
Enemy armies gather they've got the superior armor. They've they've got this the upper side

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.800
Seeming to have all the advantage and all God's people have left his faith

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:40.769
So ironic we start we end up what we should have started we turned to him again

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.219
The only hope for American folks is a spiritual awakening

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:55.350
Where men and women wake up where the Church of Christ wakes up where we begin to realize where we are what we have done

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.850
Begin to understand that it's not God's heart to judge

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:06.990
It's in God's heart to be merciful and His mercy will be there until we reach the point where our thoughts are

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.300
continuously evil

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.579
As the people of God is so important now that

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.919
Our minds become shrouded in this book

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.769
And as Paul said whatever is a virtue, whatever's of good report

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:32.790
Whatever is praiseworthy would have this lovely think on these things and the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.969
It's time to get out of the seat of the scornful

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.229
It's time to stop associating with sinners if we're associating for any other reason but winning them to Christ

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.470
It's time to make the break folks

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.470
It's time to get oil in our laps

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.610
We don't have that long

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.450
Madmen

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:07.720
Are eventually going to get access to weapons of destruction? That's a given it's only a matter of time

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.069
I'm not trying to scare you trying to stir you

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:16.059
We're going home soon

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.249
Soon and very soon we're going to see the king

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:26.699
Whether Christ returns for us or we go to him first, I don't know but soon and very soon

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.700
We're going to see the king. I

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.379
Want to challenge you to pray like you've never prayed before we stand for God like you've never stood before

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:42.479
You have to have a vision of yourself. You have to see how important you are to the kingdom of God

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.719
I'm talking to everybody here you are important to the kingdom of God

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.509
You are the only one that stands between your family and the judgment of God. Do you understand that?

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:59.430
You're the only one that stands between God and this boss that you hate and workers that stab you in the back

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.240
They're going to a Christ as eternity. Do you understand? You're the only one left?

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.629
There's nobody else. They're not going to hear it anywhere else

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.690
There's only one person left standing that can separate them from death, eternally, and it's you

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.490
You
