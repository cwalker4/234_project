00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:11.450
Hey, it’s Marie Forleo, and you are watching
MarieTV, the place to be to create a business

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.889
and life you love.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.620
You know, one of the things I love about what
I get to do is the fact that I meet amazing

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.620
people.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.731
And my guest today has an uncanny ability
to turn impossible dreams into reality, and

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:27.480
I invited her here to share her perspective
on how you can do the same.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.570
Regena Thomashauer, AKA Mama Gena, is a revolution:
an icon, teacher, author, mother, and founder

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.360
and CEO of the School of Womanly Arts.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.000
She believes that women are the greatest untapped
natural resource on the planet and teaches

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.620
them to turn on their innate feminine power
to create a life they love.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.960
The School for Womanly Arts began in Thomashauer’s
living room in 1998 and has since grown into

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.570
a thriving, global movement with thousands
of graduates around the world.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.870
Thomashauer has authored 3 popular books and
has appeared on NBC’s Today show, Late Night

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.080
with Conan O’Brien, 20/20, and more.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.060
Her programs have been profiled in the New
York Times, Elle, New York Magazine, among

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.119
others.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.850
She lives and works in New York City, raising
her daughter, and working with a devoted team

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.380
to run and grow her school.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.590
Regena.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.799
Marie.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.679
Thank you so much for being here.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:23.890
No, don't thank me.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.460
I am so thrilled…

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.299
I am so thrilled to be here.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.329
I’m thrilled and I’m moved.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.899
I’m moved and thrilled.

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.460
That goes… it’s a mutual admiration society.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.170
So one of the reasons that I wanted to have
you on the show is there are so many times

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.719
when I get to meet folks that watch MarieTV,
I work with our B-Schoolers, and I’m talking

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.829
with people who are working to bring their
dreams to life and I use you as an example

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:55.149
so many times because you’re such a beautiful
demonstration of someone who had what could

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.479
be considered a little bit of an out there
dream and you made it real and you continue

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.049
to make it real each and every day.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.310
So tell us about how you started the School
for Womanly Arts and really what that journey

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.819
was like.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.240
Wow.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.380
I would have to say that the School of Womanly
Arts started with just a big, fat desire and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.410
it was my desire really to connect with my
own voice and my own passion and to live that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.880
in my lifetime.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.850
And what kind of galvanized the dream was
after I had Maggie, who is now 17, I was sitting

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.790
there with my little newborn not knowing what
to do, but feeling so much of a sense of responsibility.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.890
I felt responsible to the girls of today,
to the women of tomorrow, to what was I doing

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:04.740
to make sure that the world could understand
and respect and welcome who and what a woman

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.930
is in all of her dazzling brilliance, dazzling
darkness, her every facet of woman.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.040
Because the world doesn't know how to handle
who and what women are.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.710
And so I thought, “I’ve gotta do something
because I wanna make space for this girl to

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.210
fly.”

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.050
So I thought, “I know what I’ll do, I’m
Mama.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.520
See, baby, I’m Mama.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.650
Hm, ok, I’ll be Mama Gena.”

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.340
And did that just come to you like a download
or were you kind of playing around?

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.730
Because you have this character named Mama
Gena and I know you as Regena and you are

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.440
always you wherever you go, but there is a
persona that comes.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.220
Yeah, when I’m teaching.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.720
And thank God because I’m so shy actually
that I’m grateful for the inspiration to

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.001
create the persona so that I could be as effective
in the world as I long to be, and Mama Gena

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:03.930
gives me that courage.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.650
But how it happened was really accidental.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.850
I’d been teaching classes in relationships
and communications to men and women for many

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:20.069
years and then I just wanted to do something
for women only and really it was just a lark.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.780
I thought it was funny.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.169
I thought it was kind of… like Mama Gena,
I don't know, it sounded like something that

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.669
should be on Broadway.

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:36.840
And so I thought, “I could do that, because
I’m an actor, I’m a singer, educator,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840
writer.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.480
I can be Mama Gena.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480
That’ll work.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.590
And so I will write this character into existence
and she will assist me at awakening the culture

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.749
in the way I most long to.”

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:56.800
So I wrote my first class and it was… took
place in my living room with a handful of

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800
women.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800
Like, how many?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.439
It was like 6 or 8 women.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.300
Ok, I’m gonna pause you there because this
is really important.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.110
I often talk with a lot of folks who get very
excited about sharing a message with the world,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.740
whether they’re women or men, and many of
their aspirations include speaking to tens

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.520
of thousands or millions or billions of people.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.379
And I always try and tell them, that’s awesome.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.539
We don't want to squash that dream, but some
of my most successful friends, and successful

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.900
in the sense that they live their work, they
do their work consistently, they’re happy

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.600
doing their work, generally speaking.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.400
We all have those creative struggles, but
they’re really in it, most of them started

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.810
with, like, a few people in their living room
and they stairstep built it.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.620
And I think when people have impossible crazy
dreams, it’s important to hear these origin

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.009
stories because you can look from the outside
and think, “Oh, they just went there.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.599
Now they’re speaking to tens of thousands
and hundreds of thousands.”

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.629
So that’s why I wanted to really just fine
tune that point for folks.

00:05:53.629 --> 00:06:00.349
The… the hugely important thing is to live
your dream and to live your passion.

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.499
Just like you did when you were a little kid
and you would play let’s pretend.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:14.330
That energy is the creative force that makes
everything happen, makes magic happen, changes

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.520
worlds, changes people’s lives, that creativity
that lives inside each one of us.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.270
I think each person has a legend that wants
to live.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:33.930
Men, women, children, there’s something,
there’s a seed inside of each of us that

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:44.199
we were born to see through to some kind of
fruition in our lifetime, to actually let

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.379
that creative side of us exist.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:53.810
So I started with a handful of women and now
my classes are hundreds of women and I’ve

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:01.569
impacted tens of thousands, maybe with my
books millions of women, but it all started

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.219
with a desire.

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:04.219
Yes.

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:09.830
When we talk about making these dreams come
to life, so many folks I get to interact with

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.710
get caught up on the how.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.860
And you and I are friends so you know, I’m
a very linear person and one of the things

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.120
that I love about you and I admire about your
work is that you help us step out of such

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.930
a linear framework of thinking and keep us
in that creative space of play.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.199
And any time I interact with you personally,
I come to one of your seminars, I read something

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:37.089
that you wrote, I can always feel myself coming
back to this space of creative magic.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:41.360
So I wonder if you could tell us a little
bit more about why it’s useful at times,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360
right?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.360
Not always.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.740
At times to just set aside the how.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.099
Well, the how won’t fuel the dream.

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:53.879
It won’t make the dream bigger, it actually
makes it shrink.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:59.080
Because even though we all have to do so many
things, you know, have to…

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080
Make the plans.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.080
Right.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.080
Take the steps.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080
The to do list, the steps.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.339
Those things are key, they’re important.

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:09.169
No dreams get launched without a good, solid
foundation.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:14.400
If you spend all of your time in the how and
the how is so seductive.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.719
It says, “Oh, there’s always more things
to do.

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:17.719
Come.

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:20.229
There’s always more ways you can work.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:21.229
Come to me.

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:22.229
Come to me.”

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:29.610
But it’s never going to lead to that kind
of regenerating, throbbing enthusiasm that

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:35.580
it requires to build a business or to take
an idea and actually turn it into a reality.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.169
There’s nothing creative that happens there.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.300
So the idea is to connect with a desire.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.779
And to connect with a desire, it’s like
that line in the Sound of Music, a dream that

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:53.810
will need all the love you can give every
day of your life.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.750
You know, sing with me.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.750
Oh, I have no idea.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.750
You don't know this song?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.509
You know I’d love to sing with you if I
knew it.

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:08.021
But the point is very true, because as a person
who is very, very accustomed to doing, when

00:09:08.021 --> 00:09:09.640
I find myself grinding…

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640
Yes.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.880
...and when I find myself getting to that
point where it feels like all the creativity

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.720
is gone, where I don't have another idea to
put out there, I don't know even why I’m

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.639
continuing to do it, you’re one of the people
that pops in my head.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:28.089
Because I remember that I have to get reconnected
to having fun and pleasure and desire and

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:30.519
I love that that’s what you take a stand
for in your work.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:37.089
Yeah, because… it’s hugely important because
a desire, a dream, it’s the interface between

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:39.279
you and that which is greater than you.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:43.140
It’s a way that you connect with your divinity.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.720
So… and that requires some tending and some
fueling.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.810
And pleasure is what fuels our ability to
continually create and regenerate and stay

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:59.290
in the heartbeat of why we started on this
crazy adventure, this magnificent adventure

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.529
in the first place.

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.490
So pleasure is a key ingredient.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.779
The problem is that that’s the last thing
you wanna do when you have a to do list that’s

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:08.779
huge.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.520
And you have deadlines out the wazoo and you
keep creating more deadlines.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.529
It sounds like the craziest thing in the world.

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:18.700
You know, I know sometimes I have, even in
my own mind, resisted you, you know, even

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.000
in my own head going like, “No!

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.090
I can’t take a break now.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.920
I, really, I have 15 more things to get done
by tomorrow morning.”

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.230
However, when I’m wise enough to surrender
to that because the higher part of me knows

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.589
it’s actually where it’s all gonna come
from, there’s magic.

00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:37.740
So what are some practical things that we
can all do from a pleasure, desire, staying

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.399
connected to that fun place that anyone could
practice?

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:49.220
Well, there’s something… the way I run
my company, just out of sheer necessity.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.360
Believe me, if I could make those people work
all the time, I would, honey.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.470
But, it… no one can live without the pleasure
and the joy and the enthusiasm.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:07.089
So the way I start every staff meeting is
with something that… at the school there’s

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:11.880
all of these practices and tools and arts.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.070
So this is so handy and it’s so useful and
I recommend it to everyone.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.980
Start every meeting with a brag, a gratitude,
and a desire.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.029
When you do all three, it’s called holy
trinity.

00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:33.370
What it does is it grounds you in the inspirational
qualities that you possess, which then you

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.029
have so much to give.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.170
So we’re gonna practice it right now.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.710
I love it.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.710
You wanna…?

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.710
Do it.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.710
Yeah.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.710
Ok, so I’m gonna brag.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.370
And by the way, before you brag, as your bragging
is kind of bubbling up inside, one of the

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.890
other reasons I love this, especially for
women, although it affects men too, it affects

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:51.890
kids.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.490
We’re so trained out of tooting our own
horn.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.490
Yes.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.490
We’re so trained that we cannot…

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.490
Hello.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.490
...celebrate anything that…

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.490
Hello.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.410
...we accomplish or that, you know, we’re
braggartly if we talk about things that we

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.410
do.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.410
And that just seems like such a sickness.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.810
Well, it’s a difference between boasting,
meaning fluffing yourself up to make you even

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.720
more wonderful than you are, and absolutely
truing up to what is.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.710
Truing up to the incredible, inspiring being,
the infinite being, that every human being

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.710
is.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.209
So bragging just kind of puts you in touch
with that.

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:25.319
And then gratitude, hello, is just…

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:28.399
That’s just the magical elixir of everything.

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.720
And then desire, it’s important to key into
your desire because that’s your connection

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.459
to your divine, so source energy.

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:41.019
So I’ll give you a brag.

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:45.889
Alright, I brag that…

00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:47.620
I brag our friendship.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.930
I brag that I'm here with you right now.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.620
I brag that I’ve known you since you had
your little flip cam in your hand.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:04.540
I brag how our sisterhood and how each of
us stands so fiercely for one another.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.560
I brag that.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.019
I am proud of that, on both ends.

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:12.990
I… my gratitude.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:24.440
I am so grateful to do the work that I do
in the world that keeps me connected to myself

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.899
and able to express my passions in such a
range of ways.

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:33.259
I feel so grateful for that.

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:44.689
And my desire is that this episode reach everyone
who has a dream, an impossible dream, and

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:54.060
that on seeing this episode they feel even
more inspired to connect and live that passion

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.410
in their lifetimes.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.210
Well done.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:02.019
I like that and I can absolutely see how if
every meeting started with folks going around

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:06.270
and doing the holy trinity, it would shift
some things in a major way.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.270
Come on.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.270
Ok.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.270
Bring it.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.270
Hit me.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.569
Alright, so I brag that I have the most amazing
crew in the whole world.

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:14.569
Oh, yeah.

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:15.569
You do.

00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:16.569
So I know you guys kind of see them on MarieTV.

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:20.069
I have to tell you, they are better in real
life than you could ever imagine possible

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:21.779
and I am so, so, so appreciative.

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:25.579
So that’s gonna spill into my gratitude.

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:26.949
Can it be the same or does it have to be different?

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.180
No, it can be all… yeah.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.709
I can bubble it in together?

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:30.709
Ok, so I’m also…

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:35.370
But one thing about a brag would be that an
I… you would have to add on, “And I created

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.370
that.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.370
I made that happen.”

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.370
I created them.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.589
And I pulled all these amazing people together.

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:40.589
Because you did.

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:42.720
Because you guys are all freakin’ awesome.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.410
Ok, going on to my gratitude.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.529
I’m so, so grateful for this building, this
company, what we’re able to do each week

00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:55.110
for our audience, which if I didn't have anyone
watching I’d be no… there’d be nobody

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.110
to make videos for.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.650
So I’m grateful for you.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:06.920
And then in terms of a desire, my desire is
that I continue to find new and fun ways to

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.890
inspire my work so that I can keep doing this,
because it’s the most joyful thing I’ve

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.890
ever experienced.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:12.890
Yeah.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.890
Awesome.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:14.890
You did so good.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.890
Thank you.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:16.890
So well bragged.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.890
Thank you.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.890
Regena, thank you so much for coming on MarieTV

Now Regena and I have a challenge for you.

00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:36.860
So, have you ever had a somewhat impossible
dream that you nurtured into fruition, against

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.930
all odds?

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.839
Or is there a desire inside of you right now
that really needs a little more air time?

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:45.110
We would love to hear about it.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.370
