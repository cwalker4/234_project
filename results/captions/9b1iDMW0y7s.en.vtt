TECH. IT’S TIME TO BREAK UP AMAZON,

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:21.087 line:92%
IT’S TIME TO BREAK UP AMAZON, GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.790 line:92%
GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK. IT WAS MORE NUANCE THAN THE

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.124 line:92%

&gt;&gt; SURE. LET’S USE AMAZON.

00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:30.230 line:92%
LET’S USE AMAZON. THEY RUN TWO KINDS OF

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:30.630 line:92%
THEY RUN TWO KINDS OF BUSINESSES.

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:31.998 line:92%
BUSINESSES. ONE, IT RUNS A PLATFORM.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.533 line:92%
ONE, IT RUNS A PLATFORM. THAT’S THE PLACE WHERE ALL THE

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.536 line:92%
THAT’S THE PLACE WHERE ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES COME AND THEY

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.140 line:92%
SMALL BUSINESSES COME AND THEY TRADE AND THEY BUY AND SELL.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:41.942 line:92%
TRADE AND THEY BUY AND SELL. AMAZON RUNS THAT PLATFORM, BUT

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:45.512 line:92%
AMAZON RUNS THAT PLATFORM, BUT ALSO SUCKS OUT TONS OF

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.715 line:92%
ALSO SUCKS OUT TONS OF INFORMATION FROM EVERY SINGLE

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:49.115 line:92%
INFORMATION FROM EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION.

00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:50.551 line:92%
TRANSACTION. IT THEN USES THAT INFORMATION

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.586 line:92%
IT THEN USES THAT INFORMATION THAT NOBODY ELSE IS PRIVY TO TO

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.055 line:92%
THAT NOBODY ELSE IS PRIVY TO TO LOOK OUT AND SAY, OH, THERE’S A

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:55.756 line:92%
LOOK OUT AND SAY, OH, THERE’S A PROFITABLE BUSINESS.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.758 line:92%
PROFITABLE BUSINESS. WE THINK WE’LL GO INTO

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.526 line:92%
WE THINK WE’LL GO INTO COMPETITION WITH THEM.

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.662 line:92%
COMPETITION WITH THEM. SO, IT THEN PUTS OUT A PRODUCT

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:05.065 line:92%
SO, IT THEN PUTS OUT A PRODUCT IN COMPETITION WITH THE PILLOW

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.135 line:92%
IN COMPETITION WITH THE PILLOW SALES GUY AND MOVES THE

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:09.670 line:92%
SALES GUY AND MOVES THE PROFITABLE BUSINESS BACK TO PAGE

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:12.773 line:92%
PROFITABLE BUSINESS BACK TO PAGE 6 AND PUTS AMAZON RIGHT AT THE

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:14.475 line:92%
6 AND PUTS AMAZON RIGHT AT THE FRONT, AMAZON’S OWN BUSINESS.

00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:16.610 line:92%
FRONT, AMAZON’S OWN BUSINESS. SO, THE WAY I SEE THIS, IT’S A

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:17.878 line:92%
SO, THE WAY I SEE THIS, IT’S A LITTLE LIKE BASEBALL.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.680 line:92%
LITTLE LIKE BASEBALL. WE’LL USE A BASEBALL ANALOGY

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:19.980 line:92%
WE’LL USE A BASEBALL ANALOGY HERE.

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.849 line:92%

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.585 line:92%
YOU CAN BE THE UMPIRE, THAT’S THE PLATFORM, OR YOU CAN HAVE A

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.487 line:92%
THE PLATFORM, OR YOU CAN HAVE A TEAM IN THE GAME, THAT’S RUNNING

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:27.688 line:92%
TEAM IN THE GAME, THAT’S RUNNING THESE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES THAT

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.890 line:92%
THESE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES THAT MEET ON THE PLATFORM.

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:32.559 line:92%
MEET ON THE PLATFORM. BUT, YOU DON’T GET TO DO BOTH

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:33.060 line:92%
BUT, YOU DON’T GET TO DO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:34.695 line:92%
SIMULTANEOUSLY. I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE BROKEN

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:34.995 line:92%
I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE BROKEN APART.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.396 line:92%
APART. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER WAY TO EXPLAIN IS

00:01:36.398 --> 00:01:37.865 line:92%
&gt;&gt; ANOTHER WAY TO EXPLAIN IS TAKE APPLE.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.400 line:92%
TAKE APPLE. OBVIOUSLY, A VERY POPULAR

00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:46.107 line:92%
ABLE TO SELL ITS OWN APPS ON THE APP STORE?

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.276 line:92%

PRODUCTS ON THE APP STORE, BUT DOESN’T DO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.387 line:92%
DOESN’T DO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY BECAUSE WHEN EVER IT DOES, IT

00:01:59.388 --> 00:02:02.623 line:92%
BECAUSE WHEN EVER IT DOES, IT HAS THIS ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE

00:02:02.658 --> 00:02:04.492 line:92%
HAS THIS ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WIPES OUT ALL THE
