00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.580
From mysterious golden spirals found in Denmark
to one of the most important discoveries in

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:24.020
modern archeology, here’s 8 most bizarre
historical findings:

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.730
Number 8 Golden Spirals
Some years ago, a pair of amateur archeologists

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.949
using metal detectors found four mysterious
golden spirals in Boeslunde, Denmark.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.309
These tiny, tightly-wound curls measured about
an inch in length.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.440
The find prompted a larger archeological operation
that ultimately led to the discovery of around

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.920
2,000 similar curls, totaling over half a
pound of solid gold.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.890
The find dates from the Bronze Age, around
900 BC.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.039
The problem is that no one really knows what
the spirals were used for.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.140
The most prominent theory claims that they
were part of priests’ attires which were

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.460
most likely worn during sun-worshipping ceremonies.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.800
The fact that wood and fur fragments were
also found seems to indicate they were buried

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.850
in a luxurious box, which might mean they
were offered as sacrifice.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.400
Number 7 Ancient Vampires
Made popular by various works of cinema and

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.730
literature, vampires have become a big part
of popular culture.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.290
Yet, 800 years ago, they weren’t perceived
as entertainment but as a real and imminent

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.290
threat.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.300
In the Middle Age, people in Bulgaria, Romania
and various other parts of Eastern Europe

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.130
would take an iron stake and plunge it through
the heart of anyone they thought was a vampire.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.280
Over a hundred such corpses, dating back to
the Middle Age, were discovered scattered

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.170
across Bulgaria alone, most with the iron
spikes still embedded in their chest.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.530
In some parts of Eastern Europe, ancient rituals
associated with demons and vampires still

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.640
seem to find believers.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.770
As recently as 2005, a shocking story emerged
from Romania.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.630
A while after her uncle had died, a woman
began screaming that he’d returned as a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.740
vampire and that he was eating her alive.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.120
The woman was tormented each night and began
to wither away.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.720
Her husband gathered a few other villagers
and dug up the uncle’s body.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.630
Even though the man had died six weeks prior,
they reportedly found him with blood in the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.820
corner of his lips and a pool of fresh blood
in his stomach.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.910
They used a scythe and cut out the man’s
heart which, according to them, was still

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.360
beating.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.510
They put it on a pitchfork and burned it to
ashes.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.540
They made tea out of the ash and gave it to
the woman.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.330
She reportedly began feeling better the very
next day but the men were subsequently arrested

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.860
and fined for grave desecration.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.400
Number 6 London Hammer
The case of the London hammer is quite puzzling.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.740
In the mid-1930s Max Hahn and his wife, while
taking a walk alongside Red Creek, found a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.560
rock with some wood embedded in it and decided
to take it home.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.800
Ten years later, their son opened the rock
only to find a hammerhead within.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.270
The only problem was that the rock was subsequently
found to be 400 million years old.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.600
The obvious question that emerged was how
could a tool made of wood and iron be found

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.880
in a rock that pre-dates human evolution by
millions of years?

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.690
One theory was that soluble minerals in the
limestone had petrified around the tool forming

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.209
a concretion.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.900
While the rock itself was indeed millions
of years old, the minerals that petrified

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.400
around the tool weren’t.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.090
Still, carbon dating on the hammerhead proved
inconclusive and it hasn’t rusted at all

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.710
since it was found.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.239
Some have argued that it’s actually an artifact
that pre-dates the Biblical flood and, as

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.020
such, a proof of creationism.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.959
Number 5 Man with Tongue of Stone
In 1991, a cemetery dating back to Roman Britain

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.300
was excavated and 35 bodies were discovered.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.840
Out of all of them only one man had been buried
face-down and his tongue had been replaced

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.730
by a large, flat stone.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.290
It’s a rather unique mutilation that wasn’t
consistent with others known to have been

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.131
performed at the time.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:29.221
The act of interring the man with his face
towards the ground might indicate that he

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:31.120
was perceived as a threat to his community.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.199
It was most likely done so out of fear that
his corpse might rise from the grave.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.720
It’s unclear whether the amputation of the
tongue had been self-inflicted or a form of

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.490
punishment but the man was thought to be alive
when it was performed.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.970
The act of replacing it with a stone could
have been intended to make the man whole,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.970
in death.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.150
Yet, judging by the position of the skeleton,
it was most likely done so that he could never

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.540
speak again, not even in the afterlife.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.440
Number 4 Antikythera Mechanism
The Antikythera mechanism is undoubtedly incredibly

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.020
complex, considering the fact that it’s
at least 2,000 years old.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.900
Found in the wreckage of a Greek cargo ship
at the beginning of the 20th century, the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.940
clockwork mechanism was composed of numerous
bronze gears and featured various faint inscriptions

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.370
on its outer casing.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.780
The mechanism could predict astronomical positions
and eclipses decades in advance.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.870
It pre-dates any similar device by at least
1,000 years and nobody knows when or why this

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.010
technology was lost in ancient times.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:46.280
Number 3 Paracas Skulls
In 1928, Peruvian archeologist Julio Tello

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.650
found some mysterious skulls on the peninsula
of Paracas in a complex grave system.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:58.200
The 3,000-year-old skulls were elongated and
presented signs of intentional cranial deformation.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.000
This wasn’t an uncommon practice for ancient
South American tribes and other such skulls

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.660
have been discovered throughout history.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.020
It was usually done by attaching two wooden
boards to the skulls of the children which

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.570
would progressively be made tighter.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.000
The increasing pressure would permanently
deform the bones.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.960
Yet, these particular remains featured several
other odd characteristics.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.020
The sagittal suture, which is the joint that’s
typically seen atop human skulls, was absent.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.560
The hole at the bottom of the skull that the
spinal cord passes through, known as the foramen

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.620
magnum, should’ve been closer to the jawline.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.940
The skulls are also significantly heavier
and larger in volume than conventional skulls.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.160
Some have argued that such properties aren’t
typically altered by cranial deformation.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.660
Also, further testing revealed mutations in
their mitochondrial DNA that are unknown in

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.220
any other animal, including humans and primates.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.530
While many scientists have offered plausible
explanations for all the abnormalities displayed

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.300
by the skulls, there are still a few who believe
them to be part of some unknown moment in

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.890
human evolution or proof of alien-human hybrids.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.699
Number 2 Saqqara Bird
This bird-shaped artifact dates back to around

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.850
200 BC and was found following the excavation
of a tomb in Saqqara, Egypt.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.060
Nobody knows the purpose of the Saqqara Bird
but the more conventional theories suggest

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.460
it might have been a child’s toy, a weather
vane or a decorative piece placed on the masts

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.210
of sacred boats during ceremonies.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.060
Yet, others, most notably Egyptian archeologist
and physician Khalil Messiha, put forward

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.030
claims that ancient Egyptians had actually
developed the first aircraft known to man.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.650
The sycamore wood bird supposedly represents
a smaller version of a monoplane and, Khalil

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.050
added, that a horizontal tailplane from the
artifact had been lost.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.289
With it, the bird could reportedly function
as a glider.

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:02.110
It wouldn’t have been uncommon for ancient
Egyptians to place miniature versions of their

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.199
technology in tombs.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.720
Most Egyptologists usually reject Khalil’s
claims.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.530
However, tests conducted by aerodynamics expert
Simon Sanderson seem to indicate that Khalil

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.760
was right all along.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.889
He built a replica of the bird with a stabilizing
tailplane and factored in conditions similar

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:22.319
to Saqqara in a wind tunnel.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.889
The bird performed unexpectedly well.

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:30.410
Sanderson stated that ‘Over 2,000 years
after the ancient Egyptians carved this mysterious

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:36.310
bird, modern technology has proved beyond
doubt that it could have flown’.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:42.510
Number 1 Dead Sea Scrolls
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is often

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.190
regarded as one of the most significant finds
in modern archeology.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:53.200
These manuscripts were discovered between
1946 and 1956 by archeologists and Bedouin

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.200
shepherds in a series of caves in Qumran,
near the Dead Sea.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.560
Nobody knows for sure who wrote the scrolls.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.910
Most of the 15,000 ancient text fragments
are written in Hebrew and most likely originated

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.920
from a Jewish community that inhabited the
West Bank around 2,000 years ago.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.560
The texts have enabled scholars to better
understand the emergence of Christianity and

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.270
of rabbinic Judaism as well as the relationship
between their early religious traditions.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.540
There’s also a Copper Scroll, a type of
treasure map which, unlike the others, isn’t

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.760
written in ink on parchment or animal skin.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.740
It was chiseled onto metal sheets, perhaps
to better withstand the test of time, and

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.070
lists numerous gold and silver caches throughout
the region.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.800
However, none of the riches were recovered
and the leading theory is that they were pillaged

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.959
following a Roman invasion of the area.

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:50.270
Perhaps the most bizarre out of all the Dead
Sea Scrolls are the first known copies of

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.290
a Book of Giants.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.020
Written in Aramaic, the texts tell the story
of giants who were the offspring of mortal

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.300
women and the sons of God.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.600
The giants wrought havoc on humanity, killing
and consuming them as well as destroying the

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.350
structures they built.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.490
The possible existence of giants is argued
by some creationists as a consequence of the

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.450
atmospheric quality of a pre-flood earth,
which would have supported their growth.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.000
Thanks for watching!

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.440
Which do you think was the strangest discovery?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.450
