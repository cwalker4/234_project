00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.569 align:start position:0%
 - [Voiceover] Most of us
 would love to win the lottery.

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.138
 The odds are stacked
 hopelessly against us,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.307 align:start position:0%
 to the point that it's
 hardly worth buying a ticket,

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.342 align:start position:0%
   unless it's simply
   considered entertainment.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.177
  Still, some people
  have beaten the odds

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.079 size:88% position:44%
   and won massive jackpots.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But many of these
 winners have ended up

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.049 align:start size:88% position:13%
  looking more cursed
  than blessed.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.817
  Four out of every
  ten lottery winners

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.387 align:start position:0%
  aren't any happier than
  before they won the lottery.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.921
  Lottery winners are
  actually more likely

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.624
to file for bankruptcy
than the average person

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
   and are more likely to
   develop a drug addiction.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.528 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you win the lottery,
you're more likely

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.265
  to end up divorced, and even
  more likely to end up dead.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.334 align:start position:0%
   To help you succeed
   where others have failed,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.803
  we've compiled a list of ten
  things you should never do

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.873
under any circumstances
if you win the lottery.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.274
Number ten is having a stash of

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.343 line:0%
   illegal substances
   inside your home.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.278 line:0%
Or you could end up like
a North Carolina woman

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.416
   who won a staggering $188
   million Powerball jackpot.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.451 size:88% position:44%
   When local police showed
   up to arrest her roommate

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.520 align:start size:88% position:13%
  for violating the
  terms of his parole,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.622 align:start size:88% position:13%
 the officers believed
 they smelled pot.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.657 align:start position:0%
   Obtaining a search warrant
   and found marijuana

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.292
and paraphernalia in the house,

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.994 align:start size:88% position:13%
 the 26 year-old mother
 of four was cited

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.629 align:start size:88% position:13%
and arrested for
possession, proving that

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.365 align:start position:0%
   even if you're lucky,
   you're not above the law.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.902 line:0%
 Number nine is throwing your
 lottery ticket into the trash.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.071 line:0%
Or you could end up like
one Massachusetts couple

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.174 align:start position:0%
who threw away a million-dollar
winning lottery ticket.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.076
  While the two realized their
  mistake and dug their ticket

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.945
out of the garbage, you
may not be so lucky.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.447
   So it goes without
   saying: keep track

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.582
of your winning lottery ticket.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.751 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Number eight is telling
everyone you know.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.119 line:0%
If you win millions of dollars,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.754 align:start size:88% position:13%
most people immediately
feel the urge

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.156 align:start size:88% position:13%
 to brag to every last
 person they know.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.658 align:start position:0%
   The trouble is that
   telling everyone you know

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.027 align:start position:0%
  before you collect your
  winnings puts you in danger,

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.829
and in more ways than just one.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.397
  Lottery winners have
  ended up kidnapped,

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.032 align:start size:88% position:13%
  flooded with emails
  and phone calls

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start position:0%
   begging for cash, scammed,
   and even murdered.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.070 align:start position:0% line:0%
  Number seven is giving
  your winning lottery ticket

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.272 line:0%
   to someone else
   to redeem for you.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.108 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Sometimes people
  can be too trusting.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.077 align:start position:0%
Even if the stakes involve
hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
So this is when an undocumented
immigrant in Georgia

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.715 align:start size:88% position:13%
gave his winning lottery
ticket to his boss

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.051 align:start position:0%
   with the promise that
   they would split the cash.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.187 align:start position:0%
  Instead though, his employer
  took the money and ran.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:04.124 line:0%
  Number six is bringing your
  winnings to a strip club.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.993 line:0%
 If you try this, you could end
 up just like Jack Whittaker,

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.195 align:start position:0%
  who brought a half a million
  dollars to a strip club

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:13.266 align:start position:0%
   and was robbed of $545,000
   the same strip club.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.835 align:start position:0% line:0%
  Number five is believing
  that you are the best person

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.071 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 to manage millions
 of dollars in assets.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.073
If you go from living
at paycheck to paycheck

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.609
 to a multimillionaire,
 does it seem likely

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.777
that you will know the
best things to invest in

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.980
 and the best financial
 planning strategies?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.348
Some lottery winners have taken

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.550 align:start size:88% position:13%
  investment advice
  from naive relatives

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.853 align:start position:0%
and their friends, who are both
unlikely financial experts.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.822 align:start position:0%
  Many lottery winners who
  took their financial matters

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.957
 into their own hands
 ended up in bankruptcy

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.526 size:88% position:44%
   as a reward for
   their initiative.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.996 align:start position:0% line:0%
  Number four: Don't assume
  you're a genius at business.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.064 align:start position:0% line:0%
 Chances are that if you
 hadn't started any businesses

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.167 align:start size:88% position:13%
before you bought a
winning lottery ticket,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.537
 you probably hadn't already
 started one for good reasons.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:54.307
  For instance, Ken Proxmire,
  a tool grinder from Michigan

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.877
 won $1 million in the
 1977 Michigan lottery

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:00.813 align:start position:0%
and used his winnings to
indulge his inner entrepreneur.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.183 size:88% position:44%
   He opened up a chain of
   stores with his winnings.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.185
  Several years later,
  his business failed

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:09.189
 and Proxmire was left
 with $100,000 in debt.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.891 line:0%
  Number three is not
  paying your taxes.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.694 align:start position:0% line:0%
 In the United States, your
 lottery winnings are taxable.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.095 align:start size:88% position:13%
  But for some lottery
  winners, taxes

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.931
 are just too much of a bother.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.633 align:start position:0%
For instance, one man in
Pennsylvania ended up in prison

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.603
 after trying to avoid paying
 taxes on his lottery winnings.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:27.307
 This probably doesn't need to
 be said, but pay your taxes.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.043 line:0%
Number two is giving all
of your winnings away.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.444 line:0%
  The worst example
  of this is probably

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.913
the wigmaker Janet Lee,
who blew her fortune

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
  on charity and
  political donations.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.450
Her lottery winnings bought her

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.885
 a reading room named after her

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.387
   at Washington University's
   law school, and millions

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.524
  of dollars in contributions
  to the Democratic Party.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.792
Eventually, after a decade-long

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:49.295
 generosity spree, she
 filed for bankruptcy.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.765 align:start position:0% line:0%
   And number one is spending
   all of your winnings.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.834 align:start position:0%
  By far the biggest
  downfall of lottery winners

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.736
  comes from simply spending.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.538
   They often quit their jobs
   and don't use their money

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.707 align:start size:88% position:13%
to bring any meaningful
investment income.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.276
  Instead, they go on spending
  sprees which will inevitably

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:05.745 align:start size:88% position:13%
 drain every last penny
 of their winnings

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.348
and put them back to square one.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.150
 Thank you all for watching. I
 hope you enjoyed this video.
