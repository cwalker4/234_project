Hello welcome back to the Most Amazing channel
on the internet.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.400
I am your host, Rebecca Felgate and today
we are talking about the Top 10 Worst Things

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.980
Convicts have said to a judge… and…well..things
can get pretty heated!

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.379
Before we get into this video, why don’t
you let me know what your favourite prison

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.130
documentary or drama is…

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.850
I love Orange is the New Black, but this is
real life!

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.619
LIKE, share.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:44.530
10 - I’ll Kill You
This video was uploaded to Youtube in 2010

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.480
and shows a convict going off on a female
judge who is having none of him.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.839
The video has had nearing 11 million views
and 11 thousand thumbs up.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.030
Basically, the convict is standing trial for
attempted murder and has a bit of a hissy

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.229
fit in court.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.289
He says this to the judge.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:13.170
Hope you could make that out over the beeps
we have had to add.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.910
He then says this… right.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:26.000
So ….really does threaten to kill the judge
then.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.840
Nice one, you’ve probably just earned a
life sentence!

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.570
9 - The Convict who threatened to rape and
bomb a judge

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.490
In May 2017 it was revealed that a Salt Lake
City convict, 47 year old Norman Eric Pierce

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.100
sent a threatening letter to the judge who
sentenced him to two years in jail.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.160
The note to the judge was a threat to rape
her and blow up her courthouse.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.000
A second letter outlined that Pierce had 15
guns and tons of ammo.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.510
He said he would blow pregnant women, old
people and kids away with them.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.620
How he was going to manage that from inside
of a jail cell, we aren’t sure… but this

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.670
has to be one of the worst things said to
a judge.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.229
Anddd this little stunt gave him extra time
on his two years as along with violating his

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.050
parole and trespassing, charges of making
a threat of terrorism, and an assault against

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.150
an elected officer were added.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.340
Judge Vanessa Dixon probably wished that this
guy would say it and not spray it – we have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670
the convict who spat at number 8.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.810
In 2009 in Bourbon County a man, with the
last name Webb, was being tried for attempted

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.810
murder.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.540
Prior to the spitting incident, Judge Dixon
had said “There is no way I am going to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.080
try this case or have further proceedings
where I have to see you for one further second.”

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:51.030
– have a watch…

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.880
The judge is visibly shocked.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.350
Initially she sends Webb away, but then calls
him back to make him watch her wipe the spit

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.610
from her face.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.040
7 - Unprofessional and Desperate
While it may not sound as harsh as some of

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.630
the insults and actions on this list, I think
that actually – this more eloquent put down

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.250
from a convict is pretty savage.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:21.620
Teenager, Anthony Allen was standing trial
for 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.819
the murder of Renee Greco when he read out
a statement attacking Niagara County Judge

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.660
Sarah Sporasa.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:49.240
Allen, who beat Greco with a table leg, apologised
for his actions to the girls family.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.050
To the judge, he had this to say – Judge
Sporasa changed the wording of the inditement

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.900
with hopes that her influence as a judge and
her intimidation as an authority figure would

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.310
do the trick and persuade the jury into convicting
me.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.709
But to any observant person, she made herself
look unprofessional and desperate.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.709
Hear it for yourself.

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.970
Following his attack, Sporasa replied with
nothing but his sentence – 25-life.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.300
6 - Woman who launched at Judge
A video of a woman who attacked a judge at

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.470
a court hearing in Southern Kentucky was uploaded
to youtube by the associated press in July

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.870
2011.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.900
At first the Monticello judge is heard telling
the woman who was there for a divorce hearing,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.310
that she will be held in contempt of court
if she keeps interrupting.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.750
The woman then interrupts again, so the judge
says she will be arrested for contempt of

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.560
court.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.210
The woman then loses it and launches herself
at the judge, trying to scratch out her eyes.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.300
The woman is hit in the face and taken down
by police officers who then escort her out

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.920
of the court room.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.060
5 - N Word
Racial slurs are vile and never acceptable.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.500
What idiot would dream of using one in court
in front of a whole bunch of witnesses and

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500
a judge?

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.560
In January 2016 New York Daily News uploaded
a video to their youtube channel of a Kentucky

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.699
Judge holding a man in contempt of court.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.650
As Judge Olu Stevens is trying a separate
person, a defendant screams a racial slur.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.000
We obviously aren’t going to play that part
of the clip, but when the defendant in question

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:37.120
gets to the stand, this is what the judge
his to say 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.320
in response.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:06:00.310
Go on Judge Stevens!

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.680
Hard no to racism.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.870
Threats made to Judge Amber Wolf
I actually really like Judge Wolf.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.229
She featured in a previous top 10 I did about
the Top 10 Judges who Lost it in court…so

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.820
kind of the reverse of this video!

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.840
She spoke up for an inmate who was denied
trousers and female hygiene products.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.050
Anyway, here she is again being a sasspiration
in a Jefferson District County Court, this

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:38.590
time with a crazed convict threatening to
kill her and her family.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:46.440
Who knows what you will be able to make out
between those beeps.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.750
This guy is a triple homicide suspect…His
voice is reaaaally weird….not that that

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.380
is the focus here…but he sounds as if he
has been hit in the face with a golf club.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.480
Judge Wolf lodges his threat and notes it
for future sentencing – she serves him with

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.900
contempt of court.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.650
Yes, Queen.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:11.210
Don’t bow down to threats.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.320
This video was uploaded to youtube by Fox
News in September 2016 and has received 6

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320
million views.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.020
My favourite comment is from Marcel Wormsley
who wrote: Wow, way to go Judge.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.660
It takes a big person to remain professional
and even courteous through all of that.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.500
And a threat as well!?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.759
She's better than I am.?

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:38.090
Threw a Backpack at the Judge
A defendant denied the chance to get a lawyer

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.020
and then attacked the judge offering him time
to get one.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.090
In July 2011, June Carson stood before Judge
Marilyn Cassidy in the Cleveland Municipal

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.669
Court and threw a full, heavy backpack at
her, sending the whole courtroom into meltdown.

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:55.810
She isn’t hit but we see her duck under
her table to try and get away from the projectile.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.740
By her reaction it seems like she thinks the
defendant may have a weapon and this is just

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.639
the beginning of an attack.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:05.390
Luckily it wasn’t and the man was apprehended.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.200
The man was jailed and held in contempt of
court.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.950
A Crippling Disease for Judge Barbara Walther.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.850
Warren Jeffs is a convicted felon and child
molesterer.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.060
The former president of the Fundementalist
Church of Jesus Christ or Latter Day Saints

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.820
was placed on the FBIs most wanted list and
was charged with incest, sexual assault and

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.770
sexual conduct with minors.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.380
Two of Jeff’s children have publicly accused
him of sexually abusing them.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:38.070
In his court hearing in 2011, which sadly
– for the purpose of this video, anyway,

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:51.190
was not recorded, Jeffs threatened the Judge,
Barbara Walthers life.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.660
He said “I have sent a crippling disease
upon her which shall take her life soon…

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.350
a pox I tell you.”

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.750
Ummm.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.720
He also threatened the court by saying that
they will bring more harm upon themselves

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.090
than they can imagine if they don’t cease
the proceedings.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.210
It seems that Warrn Jeffs believed that he
is a profit.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:16.180
Good old Barbara – the Judge for District
51 in Texas is still very much alive.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.339
Profanities to the Judge
OOf what a tirade.

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:24.730
In 2014 the Police Center Youtube Channel
uploaded a video showing defendant Christopher

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.230
Colon launching an absolute tirade of abuse
on the Judge.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.290
Broward County Judge John Jay Hurley kind
of spurs him on in my opinion, but none the

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.020
less, the 27 year old is only making life
worse for himself.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.450
The defendant, who was appearing before the
judge for domestic violence charges and breaking

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.760
a restraining order, swore at the Judge 20
times.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.260
Here are some excerpts.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.950
He also calls the judge a Puss ass cracker.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.780
At one point, a deputy turns off his microphone
but the judge asks for it to be turned back

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.780
on.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:18.930
As the judge sets an extremely high bond,
then denies bond, he spurs Colon on.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.260
He invited the foul mouthed convict by asking
- “ Do you have anything you would like

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.260
to say.”

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.390
Colon then replies You aint no Hitler… which
is somewhat baffling.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.480
Anyway, his lengthy outburst, which includes
inviting the judge to perform oral sex on

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:45.470
him, got him 364 days in prison for contempt
of court.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.920
Comments from Scary Things Robots Have Said:
Jess the Unicorn Said: I love this channel,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.220
keep up the good work!

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.690
One of our channel sponsors, Foster Dog wrote:
I wonder what ever happened to the guy that

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.110
Yeah, I don’t know….we should investigate.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.649
Thanks for sponsoring our channel, by the
way.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:22.410
Jessica Torres said: I love Rebecca’s Narration.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.149
Thanks babe!
