00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.370
From cities with mysterious origins, to ones
that were nearly wiped off the map forever,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.100
Here are 9 ancient ruins that have defied
history.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.260
No matter what they’ve been through, they
are still here!

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.160
9.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.820
Çatalhöyük, Turkey
Built in what was once Mesopotamia, the city

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.270
of Çatalhöyük, which now resides in Turkey,
is easily one of the biggest mysteries of

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.540
the ancient world.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.219
I mean reaaaallly ancient, it reached its
heyday around 7000 BC!!

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.649
This place makes ancient Rome look modern!!

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.179
These tightly clustered mudbrick houses kind
of look like honeycombs, don’t you think?

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.789
Every single house in this city shares a wall
or two with another house, just like how honeycomb

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.159
is connected in a hive.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.410
To get out of their houses, the people would
use ladders and cut doors in the roofs.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.430
The people would actually walk across the
roofs like we would walk across the street.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.859
The Neolithic residents left behind paintings,
plaster reliefs, and pottery.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.479
As well as their dead which they buried in
the floors!

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.610
At one time, this thriving ancient metropolis
had about 8,000 residents and archaeologists

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.170
are still uncovering thousands of mysterious
objects.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.980
There are many skulls found that have the
same type of head wounds in the skulls that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.830
later healed (so they were non fatal).

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.040
This has led archaeologists to believe that
they might have been an egalitarian society

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.800
but that they used controlled violence to
keep everyone in check.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.440
We are still trying to understand how these
people lived, and why things eventually fell

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.440
apart.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.440
8.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.550
Palenque, Mexico
Mexico is a land of many mysteries and lost

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.690
people and cities.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.930
But easily the biggest civilization, with
the biggest mystery surrounding them, are

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.050
the Mayans.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.740
This tribe came from an unknown area, arrived
in Mexico, and set up an empire that lasted

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.940
over 3000 years.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.100
Then they were gone.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.960
To this day, many still study the Mayans in
order to find out more about them, and especially

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.450
what happened to them.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.860
One of their most well-preserved cities that
they made was Palenque.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.170
Palenque is a prime example of how well the
Mayans could plan and construct their cities.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.020
This place not only had temples, but other
massive public and ceremonial buildings, and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.499
texts inscribed in various places that help
tell the tales of the empire.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:21.769
So here's the question, if the Mayans were
so powerful, and Palenque was so advanced,

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.549
why did they abandon it?

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.989
Most historians note that the city was abandoned
around the 1400's, much like various other

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.079
Mayan cities.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.150
But why?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.989
Why did they leave such wonders behind?

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.269
Were they driven out?

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.999
Did they have to flee to survive?

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.659
Or were they all affected by a disease?

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.459
No one knows the answers to these questions,
but there are many expeditions going on to

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.629
try and figure out the answer.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.370
And now for number 7 but first be sure to
subscribe if you haven't already!!

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.880
We’d love to have you around here!!

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
7.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.260
Cahokia, United States
This one might come as a surprise.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.499
In the United States, there is an old city
that used to be the biggest city in North

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.719
America at one point in time.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.310
This was the city of Cahokia, a pre-Columbian
Native American City.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.769
It was founded around the year 600 and lasted
until the 14th century.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.969
You can still go there today, it's across
from St. Louis on the other side of the Mississippi

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:15.969
river.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.349
The builders of Cahokia were very talented
and their gigantic mounds still exist today.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.889
Although they didn’t leave behind any written
records, the urban planning and agricultural

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:31.879
evidence tells scientists that Cahokia was
once home to around 40,000 people, which baffles

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:32.879
scientists.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.389
Some estimates claim that in the 13th century,
the population of Cahokia was equal to that

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.639
of London in the same century!

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.810
The people would use the Mississippi River
to water their crops, and created tributaries

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.519
that would make the water go where they needed
it to.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.590
While it's not known exactly who lived there,
many guess that there were members from several

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.249
different tribes and the people later became
known as the Mississippians.

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.220
It’s hard to say what happened to these
people.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.859
When the French arrived in the 17th century,
the mounds were already there.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.840
Archaeologists are wondering what happened
to everybody and they believe that they may

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.549
have run out of food, or had difficulty battling
contamination in these city-like conditions.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.969
Just like the Maya, the city was abandoned.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:13.969
6.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.609
Derinkuyu, Turkey
Turkey is home to another ancient, fascinating

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.419
and mysterious place: Derinkuyu.

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.650
The concept of making underground cities may
seem like something from fantasy television

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.050
shows, or Fraggle Rock, but many cultures
have made very grand underground cities.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.610
Turkey has a lot of ancient cities like this,
and not just underground, but in caves.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.820
But, when it comes to Derinkuyu, it's honestly
a whole other story.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.139
This city is ancient, and can be traced back
to the 8th century BC.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.460
Christians took over and expanded the underground
caverns.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.500
It reached its peak during the earliest days
of the Byzantine Empire when it was used by

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.650
the Christians as a hideout during the Arab-Byzantine
wars At its peak it held about 20,000 people,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.810
a very impressive number for that many people
to be living, and thriving, underground.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.400
And remember, this is before the year 1000,
so they didn’t have all the modern advances

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.400
we have.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.490
They had to worry about sanitation, ventilation,
safety, and general health.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.780
To be clear, this wasn't a slum, or a makeshift
city, this place had churches, and kitchens,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.450
and areas for livestock, it even had a place
to make wine!

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.150
This truly was a civilized and fully realized
city under the earth.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.009
Why was the city underground?

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.500
It was meant to be a safe haven for people.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.949
It was a dark time in this period of history,
and there was a lot of warfare going on above

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.000
ground.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.240
Later on it was used by Christians and refugees
to hide from the Ottomans.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.419
This place was a safe haven with secret entries
and exits where people could bring in goods

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.009
and provide services and live their daily
life in relative safety.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.379
Weirdly enough, later on the city was sealed
off for some reason, and it wasn't opened

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.720
again until 1969, by accident.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.479
Over 200 underground cities have been discovered
in the region.

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.479
5.

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.379
Yonaguni Monument, Japan
Off of the coast of Japan, there is a place

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.040
called Yonaguni Island which was famous for
hammerhead sharks.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.539
Now, people are more intrigued by some unnerving
formations in the water that were found by

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.430
a diver in 1987.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.009
The Yonaguni Monument is a series of rock
formations that has the scientific world split

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.689
as to whether this is a natural design, or
something made by humans.

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.740
And it's a debate that continues on to this
day.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.940
It looks like a lost city that sunk into the
ocean.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.040
The monument: is characterized as having clear
right angles and the largest structure is

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.710
about 90 feet tall.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.610
It seems like there are stone pillars, a wall,
a road and a star-shaped platform.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.650
There is evena rock protrusion that looks
like the carving of a human face.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.250
But there are a lot of theories as to how
this happened.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.919
For example some think that it was a real
city that was built above the water when the

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.599
ocean level was lower.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.160
It was then later slowly swallowed up by the
rising waters.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.689
However, there's no definitive proof that
this is the case.

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:02.180
Many others think it is just limestone rock
which tends to break off at sharp angles,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.189
and that it was never a city at all, but geological
formations.

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.300
No one has a clear answer to what this monument
really is.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.300
What do you think??

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.870
Let me know in the comments!!

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.620
Or we could plan a diving expedition and go
see it for ourselves!!

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.539
I’ve heard the currents are very strong
though, but in any case, it would still be

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.620
cool to see those hammerheads!

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.750
4.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.270
Machu Picchu, Peru
Machu Picchu is arguably one of the most interesting

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.509
and revealing places in the world.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:29.509
Why?

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.680
Because it's through this city that we got
to take a look inside the Incan Empire.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.259
This civilization ruled a lot of South America
for quite some time, and their territory included

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:41.599
Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and more.

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:46.740
And yet, for a while, we didn't know that
much about them, until we found Machu Picchu.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.590
This was one of the biggest cities in the
empire, and as such, we're able to learn a

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.689
lot from it.

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:55.110
One of the most shocking discoveries of the
city is that it was missing one of the most

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.190
common aspects present in all other civilizations
in the world.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.020
It didn’t have a marketplace.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.300
In this city, and apparently in all the other
cities in the empire, they didn't have marketplaces.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.460
Which makes you wonder how they bought food,
traded items, or even just interacted with

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.490
one another.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.669
Numerous civilizations built their cities
around a central marketplace, yet the Incas

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:18.969
didn't, why?

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:22.840
We are still trying to understand their civilization
and how they were able to build their cities

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.479
and monuments in such high places.

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:26.479
3.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:29.759
Thonis, Egypt
If you're big into history, then you knew

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.139
that it was only a matter of time before Egypt
showed up on my list.

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:37.580
And as you know, it is home to many ruins
and mysteries, and the main topic of several

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.139
videos on this channel!!

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.430
Be sure to check them out when you finish
this video!!

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.550
One of the biggest mysteries in the past was
what had happened to Thonis, also known as

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.550
Heracleion.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.910
It was a port town in Egypt, and was literally
viewed as a gateway into the country itself.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.940
It had massive buildings, and monuments to
show off their culture and power to the Mediterranean.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.120
Then, one day, it sank into the Mediterranean
Sea, where it remains to this day.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.590
It took a loooong time to find it again!!

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.680
It didn’t seem to disappear in the blink
of an eye either.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.440
This apparently happened over time.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.889
But no one is really sure of the cause.

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:15.510
Many speculate that earthquakes, or liquefaction
could be the cause of its demise, but no one

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.510
can say!

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.380
It could be the waters just changed their
course.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.519
Needless to say, Egypt had to adapt big time
after the loss of Thonis.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.519
2.

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:29.320
Great Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe
Sticking with Africa, let's head to Zimbabwe,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.019
which holds one of the biggest mysteries of
the continent.

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:33.019
It's called...

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:34.019
Great Zimbabwe.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:36.570
Yeah, doesn't really sound mysterious, does
it?

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.860
But don't let that fool you, there's more
to this than you might think.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:46.709
From 1200-1400, Great Zimbabwe was a major
point of trade, people came from all around

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:48.550
including from India and China!!

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.620
The city was very wealthy and had many different
industries including farming, livestock, and

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.620
mining.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.339
It was a true crown jewel of the region.

00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:01.320
Yet, like just about all cities or monuments
on this list, its success led to ruin, and

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.399
no one is exactly sure why?

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:08.370
Some think that Great Zimbabwe grew so big
that its resources began to dwindle, forcing

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.260
the people to move away in order to survive.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.529
Like Cahokia and maybe even Palenque, they
may have run out of food.

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:19.490
Others speculate that cultural changes led
people away from this trade haven.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.500
Either way, it's now a ruin, and many archaeologists
and researchers are trying to figure out what

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.500
happened!

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.500
1.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.260
Pompeii, Italy
There are many scary stories in history, but

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.870
the story of Pompeii is one that we just can’t
get over.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.440
This is the city that was built in the fertile
valley near a volcano, Mt. Vesuvius.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.360
When it erupted, it caught people by surprise
and buried the city in soot and ash and left

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.810
it covered and perfectly preserved for hundreds
of years.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:52.040
Now much of it has been uncovered and it is
a sad historical marvel and many people were

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.089
frozen in time forever.

00:10:54.089 --> 00:10:58.449
As people continued to uncover the ancient
city, some oddities began to emerge.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:02.511
Because of how it was buried, everything that
survived is actually in pristine shape, which

00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:04.380
is a miracle in many ways.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.730
The fun part though, is that there are many
interesting "items" that you can see in the

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.070
city that have many wondering what was going
on in Pompeii.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.410
For example, there are statues of reproductive
organs, graffiti that makes no sense, arrangements

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.160
of items that make even less sense, and the
list goes on and on.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.380
What does it all mean?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.910
Why did the citizens of Pompeii have all of
this in their city?

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.600
It's certainly not documented in any of the
history books, but it was believed that the

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.820
people of Pompeii were being punished by the
Gods.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.649
While there are stories and some documents
of Pompeii, it just goes to show that while

00:11:36.649 --> 00:11:41.380
history may be written by those who have survived
it, that doesn't mean they're telling everyone

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.380
everything.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.570
Thanks for watching!

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.310
What did you think of these cities in ruins?

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.339
