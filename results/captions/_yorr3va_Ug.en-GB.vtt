00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:08.080
A country torn to pieces. A people divided
into groups, forced to fight their own brothers.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.040
Lives caught in between the claws of two great
ideological enemies. And an army in retreat,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.710
as another advances.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.970
Army Group North becomes trapped in the Courland
Pocket in Latvia. People say that the trap

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.450
could have been avoided. People say they should
have evacuated them. And people say that Hitler

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.800
is to blame - it was his ‘fortress’ and
‘stand fast’ mentalities that resulted

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.290
in the waste of an entire army group in Courland.
His generals call him ‘mad’ for ordering

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.050
his men to stand fast and fight to the death
when he has so little manpower. And Courland

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.370
- a siege larger than that of Stalingrad - is
a great example of this. Or is it?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.140
How did Army Group North become trapped? Was
this avoidable? Why didn’t they evacuate

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.049
them? Who is to blame for this? And why didn’t
the Soviets destroy the pocket? Were they

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.110
capable of destroying the pocket? Did they
try to? In this series, we will attempt to

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.930
answer all these questions. Filthy detailed.
Super accurate. History. This is BATTLESTORM,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.840
the story for the Courland Pocket 1944 to
45.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.679
In this video series we will look at the Soviet
offensives of 1944 that resulted in the Courland

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:56.060
Pocket, and the six battles in Courland that
took place from October 1944 to May 1945.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:34.500
It’s hard to escape the conclusion that,
by 1944 and 45, the war was lost for Germany.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.450
The Western Allies had defeated Germany in
the Mediterranean, Italy, the Atlantic, and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.800
had landed in Normandy in June of 1944. The
Germans had failed to gain victory during

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:58.799
Barbarossa in 1941, locking them into a long-attritional
war. In 1942, the Germans had launched Fall

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.120
Blau, in a desperate attempt to secure the
Caucasus oil fields, which would provide them

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.770
with enough oil to continue the war, whilst
reducing Soviet supplies. This culminated

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.819
in the Battle of Stalingrad, which was a crushing
defeat of the German 6th Army. In 1943, the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.989
Wehrmacht was so crippled by oil shortages
that they were forced to launch a limited

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.969
operation against the Soviets - no grand Barbarossa
or Fall Blau movements - just a small operation

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:39.689
at Kursk. In this case, they failed to even
break through to the operational depths. The

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:48.560
Soviet counter-offensives in 1943 and early
1944 were not reversible, and, unlike before

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.349
Kursk, the Germans were now unable to sufficiently
replace their manpower or equipment losses.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:03.569
The German Army wasn’t out, but it was certainly
on the backfoot, and there weren’t any obvious

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.879
ways now to claw out a victory.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.700
Most people looking at this era of the war
will ask this question - why did Germany keep

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.380
fighting? Why didn’t Germany surrender?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.220
Well, there are a few reasons. It was believed
at the time (although it wasn’t true) that

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.610
the German Army in World War 1 hadn’t actually
been defeated, but had been stabbed in the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.700
back. Hitler and the vast majority of the
generals in this second war refused to contemplate

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.430
the idea of surrendering before being totally
defeated. Therefore, there would be no shameful

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.120
capitulation like that this time - they would
fight to the bitter end. Plus, the Allies

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.759
and Soviets had agreed on unconditional surrender,
meaning that there would be no negotiations

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:07.849
at all. A surrender would be entirely on their
terms and no doubt disfavorable and humiliating

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.850
to the Germans.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:17.039
The Germans had also committed numerous atrocities
across Europe (especially in the East), resulting

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:23.380
in millions of dead. If they surrendered,
surely the Soviets would take revenge upon

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.720
them. So there was no logical reason to give
in.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:37.680
And, perhaps, not all doors were closed. The
always optimistic Admiral Dönitz was adamant

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:45.861
that a wave of new U-boats could do the damage
needed to turn the tide in the Atlantic. These

00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:52.319
new submarines were faster, more advanced,
and were the first actual submarines deployed

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:58.530
by the Kriegsmarine. They didn’t have to
surface at all thanks to the new snorkel,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.509
adopted from the Danish, which allowed them
to recharge their batteries underwater. In

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:10.220
the older designs, the U-boats had to surface
to let the exhaust fumes out as their engines

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.770
recharged the batteries - so they were technically
just boats. And with these new submarines,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.949
they could potentially do a lot of damage
to the Western Allies.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:29.410
Hitler liked Dönitz’ optimism, which explains
why he favoured him at this stage. Heinz Guderian

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.750
also remained optimistic of victory, which
is why he becomes Chief of the General Staff

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:42.660
of the Army in mid-1944 - replacing Zeitzler.
Hitler was trying to choose generals that

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.840
would keep fighting - those who still had
belief in victory. You can’t win a war if

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.389
you don’t believe in victory - at least,
that’s how the logic went. Guderian tries

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:01.659
to paint Hitler as a madman in his memoirs,
but there’s little evidence that he thought

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:09.740
that at the time. Guderian believed in victory
- that is why he was chosen.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:18.169
Hitler also had the V-1 and V-2 rockets. Since
the Luftwaffe was no longer capable of taking

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.289
off, and German cities were being bombed,
it was time to take revenge on Britain by

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:31.550
firing missiles at them. The slower V-1s could
be shot down, but the Allies could do nothing

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.720
against the V-2 rocket, which came in faster
than the speed of sound and gave no warning

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:44.680
before impact. It was hoped that these miracle
weapons would cause a morale crisis for the

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.180
Western Allies.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:54.389
This is why Hitler hoped to counterattack
the Western Allies, turn the tide, then concentrate

00:07:54.389 --> 00:08:02.520
on the Soviets. A plan came to light in September
1944 for what would become known as the Ardennes

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.900
Offensive - an attack in much the same way
that the Germans had attacked the French and

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.460
British in 1940.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:16.050
Clearly, Hitler was clutching at straws. The
fact that he was ordering his men to “stand

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.570
fast” against impossible odds, and that
he had ordered troops to create “fortress”

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:27.080
towns and cities - willingly allowing his
men to be surrounded and cut off by the Soviets

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:34.860
- have led some to conclude that Hitler’s
meddling was making the situation worse. There’s

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.070
also a question of the Führer’s mental
state - although both of these points are

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.390
certainly up for debate.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:48.980
In the west, the fortress towns actually played
to the German advantage. Blocking the coast

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.820
prevented supplies reaching the western Allies
- which forced them to drive supplies by truck

00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:02.620
over huge distances in order to keep their
armies in the field. This actually stopped

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:09.760
them for months. So there’s an argument
to be made for the fortress towns in the west.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:17.220
But in the East, the Soviets were not reliant
on ports to supply their forces. They were

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:23.390
using trains, trucks and horses. Holding onto
random towns and villages in the middle of

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:28.630
nowhere did little to the overall logistical
situation, although it did slow them down

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:34.840
a little bit. Hitler’s reasoning was that
a smaller German force could tie down large

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.110
numbers of Soviet forces. This would slow
down the Red Army, giving the Germans time

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:48.910
to build defences, replenish their forces,
and find victory somehow. The problem of course

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:54.890
is that the Red Army had enough troops to
both cover the pockets and keep going. Plus,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:01.440
once supplies ran out, the pocket would surrender,
and this happened pretty quickly in most cases.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.320
So the time gained was little, and the manpower
and resources wasted in holding the pocket

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.130
was greater than the gains. But desperate
times called for desperate measures and this

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.900
was desperate times for National Socialist
Germany.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:25.180
It has been argued that this is what led to
the creation of the Courland Pocket. It was

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.730
a way of tying down huge numbers of Soviet
forces, preventing them from being used on

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:37.600
the dash to Berlin. But is this really the
case? We’ll come back to this question later

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.820
in the series, but it’s good to have this
idea in the back of your mind as we watch

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.060
the fighting unfold.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:50.660
Either way, the German Army was resorting
to desperate tactics in order to stem the

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:57.500
Red Army tide. What’s interesting is that,
earlier in the war, when Kurt Zeitzler becomes

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:04.529
Chief of the Army General Staff in September
1942, he implemented Fundamental Order No.

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:10.140
1 - a policy of stripping down the number
of staff officers in the higher formations

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:16.690
in the army. In part, this was an effort to
become more efficient and provide experienced

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:22.860
staff officers for the front line units - since
they were severely lacking experienced officers.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:29.149
But it also increased the pressure on what
had already been small staff sections, and

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:36.089
reduced the number of officers working in
intelligence or logistics, causing even more

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:42.760
problems at the front as a result. The German
Army of World War II was not known for its

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.250
logistical capabilities - in fact, logistics
was probably the skill it lacked the most.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:58.370
So this reduction was doubly painful. And,
because of this reorganization, 16 or 17 separate

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:04.980
branches now reported directly to the Chief
of the General Staff, which was too much for

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:13.660
him to handle. By mid-1944, Zeitzler was on
his last legs as a result of the stress, as

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.760
were his staff officers.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.199
A change had taken place in the way the army
handled officer promotion. Unlike in the early

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:27.320
war, where officers were promoted based on
the time they’d served in the army, the

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:34.570
idea now was that officers should be promoted
based on their performance at the front. This

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:40.350
was because there was a lack of officers in
general for the expanding army, and so rapid

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:48.200
promotions were necessary. Character and effectiveness was now all that mattered in order for a

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:57.000
soldier to become an officer. And that character was
based mainly upon National Socialist teachings.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.620
Any officer who wanted to get ahead now had
to prove that he was a good National Socialist.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.800
The problem was that the new officers had
little knowledge of the workings of their

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.480
new commands, and didn’t have time to learn
them before they were soon promoted again.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.140
As the war progressed, this problem became
an epidemic within the army, with fewer and

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.410
fewer officers able to fulfil their role.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:34.740
In fact, by late 1941, let alone later, officers
in the lower ranks were constantly asking

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:43.180
questions and giving tasks to those above.
They were new to their role and inexperienced.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:49.520
They would skip ranks if needed - and this
habit was actually encouraged by the top ranks,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.560
by people like Keitel and Hitler. As the war
progressed, and even more newer officers rose

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:03.320
up the ranks, this tendency got worse and
worse. The reality was that the entire staff

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:11.089
organization - from top to bottom - was massively
overburdened, with lower ranks going straight

00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:14.780
to the top in order to get answers.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:21.250
While Hitler did meddle in the decisions of
his officers - they wanted him too. In some

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:29.279
cases, they needed him too. The officer corps
simply couldn’t cope, forcing more and more

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:36.170
decisions to go higher and higher, until...
Hitler. And coupled with the fact that Hitler

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:43.860
didn’t want his men to withdraw for no reason,
this relationship ‘benefited’ both sides.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:52.370
On the 19th of January 1945, Hitler ordered
that all commanders down to division level

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:58.680
should report any planned movement or action
to him so that he could have a say in the

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:05.050
decision. Sure, it looks as though Hitler
was meddling - and maybe he was - but this

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:12.310
order wouldn’t have been necessary if those
officers weren’t as inexperienced and overburdened

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.790
as they were.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:19.100
But wait a second, why was there such a need
for officers? Wasn’t the army getting smaller

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:25.540
as the war progressed? Surely this would lead
to a decline in the number of required officers…

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:35.130
right? Up until Kursk in mid-1943, the army
was actually expanding in size, not decreasing.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:42.300
This required more officers. And, while the
army started to decline in late-1943 (after

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.990
Kursk), there is something important to note.
On a whole, German divisions were getting

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:57.540
smaller, and there were more divisions. This
meant that there were more individual units

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:05.500
overall (like battalions). Now the battalions
required less men per unit, but still need

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:13.889
the same amount of staff officers overall
to run them. So there were more weaker battalions,

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:22.959
more weaker regiments, more weaker divisions
- requiring less manpower overall - but needing

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:30.600
more staff. Needing more officers. And Germany
was out of officers.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:37.829
Now this might seem contradictory at first,
but in theory, smaller divisions are actually

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:44.319
better and more mobile than larger - bulkier
divisions. Smaller divisions are more flexible

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:52.069
- which is great for a mobile Blitzkrieg or
Bewegungskrieg war of movement. The Italians

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:57.490
realised this before the war, deciding to
create binary divisions - divisions with just

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:04.450
two infantry regiments rather than three.
Unfortunately, while this is perhaps correct,

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:10.570
it requires more officers to fill those ranks.
The Italians didn’t have enough good officers

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.630
(and few trucks to make these smaller divisions
faster), which is why they struggled against

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:22.530
the British. And as the war progressed, the
Germans were trying to create more smaller

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:30.640
or binary divisions. By 1944, the German divisions
were operating in divisional groups, often

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:38.350
the size of regiments. Perhaps this was down
to the lack of officers? Yes they had a large

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.360
number of experienced officers within the
officer corps, but they also had a much larger

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.470
number of inexperienced officers as well.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.260
Part of the reason that the Germans could
reduce the size of their divisions was because

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:57.610
Soviet divisions were smaller than theirs.
The Red Army actually had this problem throughout

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:04.830
the war - smaller divisions, but requiring
more officers. This was why they got rid of

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:10.760
the corps-level of command in the early-war
period and only put it back in later. This

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.560
reduced the number of officers at corps level,
freeing them up to go to the bottom level.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.760
But of course, this led to organizational
problems, which is why, in the early war period,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:31.250
the Soviets were less flexible in their operations.
The Red Army by 1944 though had large numbers

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:37.550
of experienced staff officers, and the corps
level was reintroduced. Their army - while

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:44.560
still far from perfect - was far more organized
and efficient than it had been in the early

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.220
part of the war.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:55.560
By 1944, most Soviet Rifle Divisions had an
effective strength of just 2,000 men or less.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.930
This was very very small - since divisions
in the early-war had been over 10,000 men

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:08.800
strong. Though they were severely battered,
the German divisions still outnumbered the

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.490
Soviet divisions in terms of manpower. So
when you hear of ten Soviet divisions going

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.670
up against two German divisions - actually
they don’t outnumber them five to one - as

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:26.020
the number of divisions suggests - but perhaps
two or three to one. Still outnumbered, but

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:32.700
not by the “waves” of troops as often
described in the German books. For example,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:41.580
at one point 1st Shock Army sends 13 divisions
vs three German divisions. But if we do some

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:49.510
rough math, 2,000 men times 13 equals only
26,000 men. The reality was that the German

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.330
divisions at this stage had somewhere in the
region of five to seven thousand men each,

00:19:54.330 --> 00:20:00.680
which puts the number roughly between fifteen-thousand and twenty-one-thousand. So certainly

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:08.060
outnumbered, but not by three or four to one as the division numbers alone suggests.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:14.180
This principle applies to many of the Soviet
units. During the Courland Pocket, the Germans

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:22.000
have two armies, but tie down six Soviet armies.
What we see though is that both sides are

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.170
roughly equal in strength (with the Germans
in good defensive terrain), which again suggests

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:32.740
that the Soviets don’t outnumber them several
times over. There’s a two or three to one

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.940
advantage at times during the Summer and Autumn
Offensives, but that ratio decreases once

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.660
the Germans are trapped in Courland, since
the Soviets are racing for Berlin - not Courland.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.460
The reason for this is the often overlooked
or ignored fact that the Soviets are also

00:20:50.460 --> 00:21:00.620
scraping the barrel in 1944 and 1945. Their
country has been devastated by the Axis onslaught,

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.910
and National Socialist occupation - as well
as the previous failures of their own economic

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:16.460
policies. In 1942, approximately 62,400,000
people of the Soviet Union were under German

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:30.700
occupation. This left 104,600,000 to fight
against a combined Axis population of 147,800,000.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:40.180
Yes, in 1942, the Soviet population was outnumbered
by their enemy. They had to strip the Soviet

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:46.030
economy to incredibly thin levels just to
find the manpower to recruit for the army.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:55.120
In 1945, collective farms were operating at
just 71% of their 1941 work staff. And the

00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:04.760
percentage of women working in these farms
had increased from 56% in 1940 to 73% in 1943.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:11.540
Similar numbers applied to the Gulags - which
were providing substantial raw materials for

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:19.080
the Soviet war effort. It’s only really
in mid-1944 that this lost-portion of the

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.160
Soviet population comes back under Soviet
control, but even then they’re desperate

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:31.100
for manpower. This is why they force local
Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians into their

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.090
ranks - they’re short on manpower.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:43.450
That said, in the July of 1943, the Soviets
as a whole have 6.7 million men in arms, while

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:50.790
the Axis have 4 million. Approximately, a
ratio of 2 to 1 of Soviets vs the Germans

00:22:50.790 --> 00:23:00.150
alone. But by the May of 1944, the Soviets
have 6,750,000 men on the Axis-Soviet Front,

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:10.870
while the Axis have 3,313,000 (of which 2,520,000
are German). On a whole, German forces are

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:17.560
outnumbered two or three to one, while total
Axis are outnumbered two to one. But by the

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:25.220
time we get to November 1944, when the Courland
Pocket is formed, Axis forces are reduced

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:32.180
to 2,200,000, while the Soviets increase their
numbers (mainly due to an influx of 700,000

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:42.850
allies troops) to 7,200,000. Now the Axis
are outnumbered roughly 3.5 to one. Clearly,

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:49.050
as a result of the successful Soviet Summer
offensive - Operation Bagration - the Germans

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.000
are in trouble by this point.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.710
But it’s worth noting that in 1944 and 1945
the bulk of the Soviet manpower is aimed at

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.870
the central and southern fronts, not in the
north - which is where we’ll be focusing.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:09.900
Therefore it’s probably best to imagine
a rough manpower ratio of about two to one

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:16.670
facing Army Group North, although that certainly
fluctuates. But the point I want to emphasize

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:22.850
is that counting the number of divisions is
not the best way to judge by how much the

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:28.700
Germans are outnumbered, and in order to discourage
this, I’m going to reduce the size of the

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.960
Soviet unit cards in this series compared
to the Germans to give you a more accurate

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.130
reflection of the strength of their units.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:46.330
Either way, we can clearly see that by 1944
the German Wehrmacht was in serious decline.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:52.650
Post-Kursk reserves of manpower were at critically
low levels, and frontline infantry divisions

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:59.871
were forced to fight in kampfgruppen (battle
groups) at the strength of regiments. Material

00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:06.600
equipment was in decline too. Typically, only
a third of German anti-tank units had tank

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:13.740
destroyers or high-calibre guns, and tanks
became a scarce commodity.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:22.310
In contrast, by 1944, the Red Army had transformed
from it’s early-war shell into a veteran

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:29.360
well-oiled machine. And it was using Blitzkrieg
(or, to be accurate, Deep Operation Doctrine,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.550
which was similar) which it could only do
because half the trucks in the Red Army were

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.080
provided by Lend Lease.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.960
“These trucks solved one of the Red Army’s
greatest deficiencies: the inability to resupply

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:50.390
and sustain mobile forces once they had penetrated
into German rear areas. Without the trucks,

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:58.960
each Soviet offensive from 1943 to 1945 would
have come to a halt after a shallower penetration,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.090
allowing the Germans time to reconstruct their
defenses and forcing the Red Army to mount

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.620
yet another deliberate breakthrough attack.”

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.890
The Soviets were less thrilled by other Lend
Lease equipment, such as tanks and planes

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:19.330
- although 63.5% of the Soviet air defence
force throughout the war ended up being stocked

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:27.180
by western fighters. But it was clear that
by 1943 onwards, the shortchanged Soviet formations

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:34.030
of the early war were now receiving significantly
more equipment, in terms of tanks, anti-tank

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.870
guns, radios, trucks and plentiful numbers
of artillery pieces. Soviet rifle armies were

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:49.480
now combined-arms armies. And after 1943,
Tank Armies were being used to strike into

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:58.850
the rear of the German lines up to 500 kilometers
in depth. These new formations had one or

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:06.380
two tank and one mechanized corps, and a separate
tank brigade or regiment, plus various motorcycle

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.570
reconnaissance, anti-tank, anti-aircraft,
artillery, rocket-launcher, signals, maintenance,

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:19.680
and transportation units. This was no longer
the early days of the war - the Red Army dominated

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.250
the battlefield.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:31.710
To counter these Tank Armies, the Germans
created Heavy Panzer BATTALIONS? Yes, battalions.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:38.841
The Germans would use battalions and panzer
divisions to counter Soviet Tank Armies. On

00:27:38.841 --> 00:27:44.870
a whole, Panzer 4s and Panthers were employed
in the regular panzer divisions, while the

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:52.610
Tigers were used in heavy tank battalions.
StuGs were employed in their own Sturmgeschütz

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.350
Battalions as well.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:28:00.180
The original concept of the heavy tank battalions
was that they would be used on the offensive

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:07.130
to break through the enemy’s tactical defensive
lines. But, the tide of war had turned, so

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:14.000
the heavy tank battalions were often employed
on the defensive, or as a counter-attacking

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.160
force, against the Soviet Tank Armies. In
these roles, they were generally quite effective

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.320
on the tactical level, and could destroy large
numbers of enemy vehicles.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:32.410
However, there were problems. Due to shortages,
there was a lack of infantry, artillery, minesweepers

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:38.630
and armoured recovery vehicles to support
them. And since lone tanks are vulnerable

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:45.730
to enemy infantry, mines and anti-tank guns
etc, this resulted in heavy tank casualties

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:51.220
and rendered the heavy tank battalions less
effective than they could have otherwise have

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:57.720
been. Production costs were also high. Few
tanks reached the front, and those that did

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.860
were deployed in small numbers. They also
had massive mechanical reliability issues,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.890
were a logistical nightmare, and had a short
radius of action. So while they may have earned

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:18.200
some tactical victories, they made very little
impact on the operational or strategic levels.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:25.040
Worse, the Soviets simply countered them with
heavy guns, or bypassed the heavy tank battalions

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:32.280
entirely to strike off into the rear of the
German lines. Overall, while they seem impressive,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.660
they really weren’t that effective at stopping
the enemy.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.280
Now what’s interesting is that the Germans
did actually have a reasonable number of spare

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:48.550
tanks at this stage. The problem was that
many of them were awaiting repair, and they

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:56.220
didn’t have the spare parts to actually
fix them. In the June of 1944, 17% of all

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:02.210
the panzers that Army Group Centre had, were
out of action because they needed repair.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:06.930
While I don’t have the numbers for Army
Group North, it’s reasonable to assume that

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:14.110
they had similar percentages of armoured vehicles
out of action due to mechanical issues.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:19.360
And those tanks that they did have suffered
heavily from a chronic lack of fuel brought

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:26.030
about by Germany’s failure to capture the
Caucasus oil fields in 1942, not helped by

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:32.690
the Allied bombing campaign against the Oil
Refineries in Germany during mid-1944. The

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:40.450
same applies to the Luftwaffe. By mid-to-late
1944, the Luftwaffe was effectively grounded

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:47.010
by a lack of fuel and spare parts. Those that
did continue were concentrated in the Reich

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:56.540
itself in order to try offset Western Allied
bombers. This is where 75% of all 88mm Flak

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:04.580
guns ended up - the Reich - to try stem the
tide in the air. Now front line units found

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:10.270
themselves without air-power; something they’d
relied upon quite heavily in the early-war

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:19.580
period, and with less air or anti-tank protection
due to the recall of 88mm guns. Effectively,

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.640
the same problems that had plagued the Red
Army in the early war period now plagued the

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.190
German Army. And just like the early-war Red
Army, the Germans didn’t have the capability

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.440
to resist.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:39.380
Perhaps this explains why Germany was relying
on heavy tanks to take on the enemy tanks.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:45.510
It seems that the Germans were trying to make
up for the lack of 88mm guns in their anti-tank

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:53.350
gun forces by mounting those guns on the heavier
tanks. Was this a good solution to the problem

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.920
though?

00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:02.950
If we consider that in 1942, T-34s made up
51% of all Soviet tank production, and that

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:11.750
by 1943 to 44, the percentage had increased
to 79%. Most tanks that the Germans would

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:21.460
face in this period would be T-34s of various
models. T-34-85s outgunned and out-armoured

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:29.370
the Panzer IVs, but they were in trouble when
faced with a Panther, Tiger or Tiger II. The

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:36.770
Tiger I’s could be defeated if the T-34s
got within 500 yards - which would be lucky

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:42.780
since the Tigers’ 88mm gun could defeat
them from thousands of yards away. Similarly,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:50.460
a Panther could knock out a T-34-85 from the
front at 1200 meters away, while the Panther

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:56.790
or Tiger II’s sloped frontal armour were
(with an exception of a lucky hit on the flat

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:04.530
turret face of the Panther) impossible to
defeat from the front using a T-34. Only heavy

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:13.090
122mm guns on vehicles such as the SU-100
tank destroyer could hope to penetrate a Panther

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.260
or Tiger II from the front.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:22.590
But, of course, the weaker side and rear armour
of the German tanks could be taken out at

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:29.490
long ranges. So, the German advantage in heavy-armour
and firepower was much like the German tank

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:36.980
advantages in the early war. The Germans tried
to destroy Soviet tanks at a distance before

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:42.270
they got close enough to take them on, and
the Soviets tried to outflank and get close

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:50.100
to the German panzers. But we know that the
Courland Pocket prevented any major outflanking

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:56.660
maneuver, and because of the marshes and forests
in the area, the Soviets were funnelled into

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:04.740
killing zones, which naturally favoured the
armour and firepower of the German tanks.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.280
Prior to this point though, the open spaces
favoured the Soviets, since it allowed them

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.450
to get around the sides of the German tanks.
This helps explain why the fighting flowed

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:21.300
prior to, and then became a stalemate in,
the Courland Pocket.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.480
However, there’s something we need to note.
Using tanks to take on tanks is not the purpose

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:34.010
of a tank. An anti-tank gun can take out a
tank just as well as a tank, and can be hidden

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:40.020
easily, and are easier to produce. If one
gets taken out, it’s no big deal because

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.900
they’re cheap to make. Tanks on the other
hand are expensive to make. Losing one of

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:54.240
them costs you a ton of precious resources.
In the period of 1942 to 1944, the Germans

00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:04.980
only built 1,350 Tiger I’s. In 1943 alone,
the Soviet Union produced 1,300 heavy self-propelled

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:17.450
guns (SUs with 152mm guns), plus 800 medium
self-propelled guns with 122mm guns, and 2,300

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:27.490
light self-propelled guns with 76mm or smaller
guns. The heavy 152mm and 122mm guns would

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:33.530
have no problem tackling a Tiger tank. And
we’ve not even talked about the production

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:39.730
of the T-34, which dwarfed all German tank
production of the entire war combined. So

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:46.390
while armour can help, there’s always a
bigger gun, and losing an expensive tank to

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:51.720
cheaper weapons really doesn’t justify the
cost.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.680
In the early war, the Germans had used a combination
of anti-tank guns, mines, anti-tank rifles,

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:04.310
Stukas, explosives, and tanks to overwhelm
the lone enemy tanks that wandered into range.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:11.110
This was combined arms warfare. The Germans
had learnt this lesson in the early war period

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:17.330
- yet seemed to have forgotten this by 1944.
Now they were using tanks to take on enemy

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:24.880
tanks directly, which, while that is fine,
it’s simply not efficient. Sure, they had

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.630
replaced anti-tank rifles with panzerfausts
and panzerschrecks, which were more capable,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.850
even if the user had to get pretty close to
the target tank in order to use the weapon.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:41.850
But the idea of using tanks to take out enemy
tanks is the main issue. While your tank is

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:48.550
doing that, it’s not riding off encircling
units and destroying the enemy’s rear areas.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:55.080
You’ve abandoned the idea of the war of
movement (Bewegungskrieg), and have replaced

00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:02.660
this with the war of position (Stellungskrieg).
Let’s sit there and lob shells at each other

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:12.540
until one side wins. It’s now a war of attrition
- a war that Germany cannot hope to win.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:20.370
Perhaps this was all a result of the oil crisis.
The fuel costs of driving off into the sunrise

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:28.020
are massive. But having a tank sit there and
fire its gun doesn’t cost so much. Perhaps

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:35.980
it was a necessity for the Germans. Either
way, the initiative had been lost by the Axis,

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:41.720
and gained by the Soviets. Overall, it’s
hard to escape the conclusion that the German

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:49.100
Army was on its last legs - making it’s
last stand. And while the Soviet Red Army

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:56.300
was also scraping the barrel, it was armed
and ready for the fight to Berlin... stopping

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.400
to recapture the Baltic States on the way.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.940
Next episode, we’ll take a look at the Baltic
States themselves, and see what fate befell

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:11.300
them during this war. That will put the whole
thing into context, prior to the fighting

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:17.820
itself. Thank you to my Patrons, you made
