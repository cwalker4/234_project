00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:01.766
DETERMINATION BUT WE CAN SAY

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.301
THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THERE

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.804
APPEARS TO BE A HUGE

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:06.838
INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN WHAT

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.306
MICHAEL COHEN TOLD THE HOUSE

AT THAT HEARING LAST

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:13.979
WEDNESDAY, MICHAEL COHEN

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.514
SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT HE

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:17.682
NEVER ENTERTAINED THE IDEA

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.017
OF A PARDON BY THE PRESIDENT

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.685
NOR WOULD HE.

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:21.753
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT PART OF

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.623
HIS TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.324
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.561
NOR WOULD I ACCEPT A PARDON

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.632
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.033

GIULIANI ABOUT THE

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:44.676
POSSIBILITY OF A PARDON.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.278
THIS WAS AFTER THE FBI

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.913
RAIDED COHEN'S HOME,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.713

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.254
WEEK.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.889
PRIOR TO MICHAEL COHEN'S

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.557
DECISION TO LEAVE THE JOINT

REPRESENTATIVES PRIVATELY

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.302
AND IN THE MEDIA.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.903
DURING THAT TIME HE DIRECTED

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.138
HIS ATTORNEY, THAT WOULD BE

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.773
STEVEN RYAN, TO EXPLORE

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.541
POSSIBILITIES OF A PARDON AT

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.410
ONE POINT WITH TRUMP LAWYER

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.477
RUDY GIULIANI AS WELL AS

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:20.578
OTHER LAWYERS ADVISING

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.013
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:24.316
BUT AFTER JULY 2ND, 2018

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.350
MR. COHEN AUTHORIZED ME, AS

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.485
A NEW LAWYER, TO SAY

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.553
PUBLICLY MR. COHEN WOULD

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.422
NEVER ACCEPT A PARDON FROM

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.456
PRESIDENT TRUMP EVEN IF

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:31.790
OFFERED.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.224
THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:33.525
CASE.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.526
AND HIS STATEMENT AT THE

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:35.727
OVERSIGHT HEARING WAS TRUE

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.395
AND CONSISTENT WITH HIS POST

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:37.996
JOINT DEFENSE AGREEMENT

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:41.733
COMMITMENT TO TELL THE

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:42.033
TRUTH.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:42.968
RUDY GIULIANI WOULD NOT

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:43.802
CONFIRM WHETHER STEVEN RYAN

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.603
HAD APPROACHED HIM ABOUT A

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.072
PARDON BUT RUDY DID TELL FOX

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.073
NEWS THAT WHENEVER THEY ARE

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.975
ASKED ABOUT A PARDON BY ANY

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.142
ATTORNEY OR INDIVIDUAL THEY

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.844
GIVE THE FOLLOWING STANDARD

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.179

PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE WILL

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.183
NOT CONSIDER ANY PARDONS

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.584
NOW, OF COURSE, THAT DOESN'T

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.820
MEAN THAT HE IN ANY WAY IS

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:02.487
DIMINISHING HIS

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:03.321
CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO MAKE

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.155
THOSE DECISIONS IN THE

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.123
FUTURE.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.058
I MEAN, CLEARLY HERE, BILL,

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.793
THERE IS A LOT OF PARSING

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:12.230
GOING ON ON THE PART OF

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.631

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.004
WHAT HE SAID IN THE CLOSED

HEARINGS.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.039
IN THAT OPEN HEARING AT NO

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.307
TIME DID HE EVER SAY I NEVER

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.143
ASKED FOR A PARDON AFTER

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.711
JULY 2ND, 2018 BUT DID I

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.414
BEFORE JULY 2ND, 2018.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.316
