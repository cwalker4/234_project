00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.350
JUDY WOODRUFF: The push to ground the kind
of Boeing 737 jet that crashed this weekend

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.380
has grown around the world.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.139
But here in the U.S., the FAA and the airlines
say they still believe in the plane's safety.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.480
There's a fair amount of criticism and questions
about that decision.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.630
John Yang begins with this report.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.939
JOHN YANG: Dozens of countries, including
all nations in the European Union, have grounded

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.460
the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and banned them from
their airspace.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.840
That's on top of at least 27 airlines that
have voluntarily taken the planes out of service.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.510
The actions come two days after an Ethiopian
Airlines 737 MAX 8 crashed shortly after takeoff,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.980
killing all 157 people on board.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.840
Chinese officials said their ban would last
until U.S. regulators act.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.900
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): The CAAC has clearly

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.890
stated that they will ask Chinese aviation
companies to lift the ban on commercial operation

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.700
of Boeing 737 MAX 8 unless they are assured
by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.060
and Boeing company that they have taken related
measures to guarantee safe travel.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.359
JOHN YANG: The FAA insists the planes are
safe.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.240
They say they are closely watching the probe
of the Ethiopia crash.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.999
U.S. investigators are on the ground, where
family and friends of the victims are sifting

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.389
through debris for remains and personal items.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:35.670
Sunday's tragedy is the second deadly accident
in five months where a 737 MAX 8 crashed just

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359
after takeoff.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.429
In October, a Lion Air flight crashed, killing
all 189 people on board.

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.080
The cause is still under investigation.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.479
Attention has focused on an automated flight
control feature designed to avoid what's called

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.360
a stall.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.570
A stall can happen if a plane's nose points
too high and loses the ability to fly.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.459
The 737 MAX 8's autopilot is designed to sense
when that is a danger and automatically push

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.360
the nose down.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.560
Pilots can override the system by shutting
the autopilot off.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.030
While insisting the plane is safe as it is
now, the FAA says it expects to order fixes

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.621
to the system no later than April.

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:27.560
The changes have reportedly been delayed by
disagreements between Boeing and federal regulators

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.010
about how extensive they should be.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.470
About 350 Boeing 737 MAX 8's are in operation
worldwide; 58 of them are operated by two

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.500
U.S.-based airlines, Southwest and American.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.960
Both carriers are continuing to operate the
jets.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.840
On Capitol Hill, a growing number of lawmakers
say the FAA should ground the planes and look

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.300
into the issue.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.511
Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal:

00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:53.511
SEN.

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:57.120
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut: These
planes are accidents waiting to happen, until

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.970
there is some assurance that either pilots
have been better trained or the problems with

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.960
the aircraft have been fixed.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.680
JOHN YANG: President Trump weighed in, saying:
"Airplanes are becoming far too complex to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
fly.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.340
Pilots are no longer needed, but, rather,
computer scientists from MIT."

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.810
But the president didn't publicly call on
the FAA to act differently.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.770
We are joined by Mary Schiavo.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.620
She is a former Transportation Department
inspector general.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.370
She is now a lawyer representing survivors
and victims' families in airline accidents.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.340
That includes a case against Boeing stemming
from the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.490
Flight 370.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.060
Mary Schiavo, thanks so much for joining us.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.630
Just a little bit ago, the FAA put out a statement
repeating that they find no systematic performance

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.110
issues and no basis to order the grounding
of this aircraft.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.640
What is your reaction to that?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.530
MARY SCHIAVO, Former Transportation Inspector
General: Well, the two planes have already

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.530
crashed.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.530
We don't know the cause yet of the second
one, and FAA's own warnings to Boeing concerning

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.920
the repairs that were needed after the Lion
Air crash said that there was a risk of impact

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.210
with terrain.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.110
So, it's impossible to say that they're safe,
when two have already crashed and we don't

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.680
know why for the second one.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.490
It's completely impossible, oxymoronic.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.060
JOHN YANG: We should note that we asked the
FAA to give us someone to talk to, and they

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.060
turned us down.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.320
But they say that that's precisely why, the
fact that they don't know the answer to what

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.740
caused these two crashes is precisely why
they are not ordering the grounding.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.990
MARY SCHIAVO: Well, if you don't know why
planes are falling out of the sky, what you're

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.350
doing is betting with passengers' lives and
other lives that it won't happen again.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.780
And that's not the purpose of safety regulations.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.920
The purpose of safety regulations -- remember,
an aircraft certification says that the plane

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.790
is safe to fly.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.870
It doesn't say, we don't know why it's falling
out of the sky, so we're going to leave it

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.870
there.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.669
It's completely the opposite of what safety
regulators are supposed to do.

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.760
JOHN YANG: And the FAA also says, it's safe
the fly now.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.300
But, at the same time, they're talking about
modifications to this stall-avoidance system.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.760
And we're also told that there are discussions
between Boeing and the FAA about the parameters

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760
of this fix.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.630
Help us understand the relationship between
regulators and the regulated.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.290
MARY SCHIAVO: Well, unfortunately, you know,
in the case of the FAA and Boeing and other

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.060
manufacturers and major carriers, it's a very
symbiotic relationship.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.780
But the FAA has over the years really come
to defer to Boeing and other manufacturers,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.860
Airbus, et cetera, and to the airlines.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.200
And so on issues such as this, the FAA often
takes its cues and its direction from Boeing,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.050
not for sinister reasons, not because somebody
is on the take, but because Boeing has the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.310
greater expertise.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.980
And, over the years, when I was inspector
general, we had many investigations, including

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.850
on the certification of the 777, that showed
that the FAA just didn't have the firepower,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.290
didn't have the expertise and the training
and the ability to go toe to toe with Boeing

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.760
and other issues in manufacturers over complex
computer issues.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.840
And that's what this is.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.270
They put a computer modification on a plane
to keep it from stalling, didn't tell the

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.300
pilots and train them, and then after a second
one went down, now the FAA says they're going

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.330
to order Boeing to make changes to that computer
system by April.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.070
So, in the meantime, is it safe?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.820
Well, not according to the FAA.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.200
It can cause impact with terrain.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.800
JOHN YANG: Impact with terrain, a euphemism
for a crash.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.260
You asked that question, is it safe?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.540
You wrote in a blog today, earlier today,
that you wouldn't be comfortable flying on

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.830
this model aircraft.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.830
Why?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.260
MARY SCHIAVO: Well, because we don't know
why two have fallen out of the sky, and we

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.380
don't know why.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.880
And to me that says you shouldn't be on it
until we do know why.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.090
And they will very soon.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.270
In some ways,this is just astonishing that
people have not been more proactive.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.910
Those black boxes are the best there are.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.229
They're the top-of-the-line models.

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.500
They're the newest ones.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.400
They have probably downloaded them already.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.160
And literally within a week, we will know
a cause and can say -- at that point, we can

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.650
say whether or not the airplane is safe.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.350
At this point, it's the whole reason we have
a black box, to solve the mystery, so we can

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.699
say whether it's safe or not.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.030
So, for me, no, I wouldn't get on it until
we know.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.610
JOHN YANG: And what advice would you give
to the traveling public?

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.150
MARY SCHIAVO: Oh, the traveling public.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.210
I mean, the Internet has blown up with this.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.900
The traveling public is already searching
for their own and making their own decisions.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.620
They're being smart consumers and voting with
their feet.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.270
They're all asking, how do I find out if my
plane is one of these, and can I re-book,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.530
get off, or cancel?

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.340
JOHN YANG: Mary Schiavo, former inspector
general at the Transportation Department,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.360
thank you very much.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.830
MARY SCHIAVO: Thank you.
