00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.920
Before their split in 2017, Brad Pitt and
Angelina Jolie were better known as Brangelina

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.560
and they wandered around the world with a
fleet of children. In other words, they were

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.520
the coolest parents ever.
The Jolie-Pitt kids range from 9-16, hail

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.231
from all around the world (interesting fact:
none of them were born in the USA!), and were

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:30.710
raised in their parents' Château in France,
a place in Los Angeles, a home in New Orleans,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.941
a penthouse in New York city, and on-set.
So basically, they are extremely cool. Time

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:38.000
to get to know them better!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.010
16-year-old Maddox is Angelina's first child,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.190
and was adopted from an orphanage in Cambodia
in 2002 when he was seven months old. Angie

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.140
was originally planning to adopt Maddox with
her then-husband Billy Bob Thornton, but ended

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.760
up adopting him alone thanks to their split.
Brad Pitt then adopted Maddox in 2006, after

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.750
he and Angie met.
Angelina started Cambodia's Maddox Jolie-Pitt

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.850
Foundation in 2003 (focusing on environmental
conservation, education, health, and infrastructure),

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.360
and the family even owns a home there. That
same year, Angelina said, "Maddox was the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.540
first baby I ever held. He's really made me
a woman."

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.600
Maddox might be just a wee teen, but he already
has a production assistant credit on his parents'

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.110
joint film By the Sea, not to mention an executive
producer credit for working on his mom's film

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.530
First They Killed My Father—about the Khmer
Rouge genocide in his home country of Cambodia.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.430
"I was trying to help wherever I could," Maddox
said. "[She’s] fun, funny, and easy to work

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.540
with. She’s a wonder."
Maddox also had a cameo in Brad Pitt's World

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.950
War Z, and his character died a gruesome death.
"He gets shot in the head . . . multiple times.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.620
But he gets double tapped," Brad said. "I
don't know what that says about me as a parent."

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.000
It's been reported that Brad Pitt's incident
on an airplane in 2016 involved Maddox.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.439
Angelia adopted 13-year-old Zahara from Ethiopia

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.290
when she was six-months-old, and Brad Pitt
was right by her side—eventually adopting

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.299
her when he adopted Maddox. And lovely fact:
Zahara's name is Arabic for "luminous," and

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.379
her middle name is "Marley" after Bob Marley.
Zahara's personal backstory is complicated,

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.700
as Angelina initially believed that she'd
been orphaned from parents who had AIDS. "There

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.879
was a fear that she had HIV," the actress
said.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.659
Zahara is regularly seen on red carpets with
Angelina Jolie, and is known for her great

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.529
taste in fashion. She's also inherited her
mother's passion for helping others—in January

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:57.280
2018, she accompanied Angie (and her sister
Shiloh) on a trip to visit a Syrian refugee

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.480
camp in Jordan.
When it comes to acting, Zahara had a small

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.000
voice part in Kung Fu Panda 3 and has an uncredited
role in Maleficent.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.640
12-year-old Shiloh Jolie-Pitt (meaning "the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.840
peaceful one") was born on May 27, 2006—and
Brangelina flew to Namibia for her birth,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.689
which ended up being by cesarean due to Shiloh
being breech.

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:27.650
"[Brad] was in the operating room, yeah. Yeah,"
Angelina said. "I just wanted to hear her

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.950
cry. And I was sure everything would go wrong.
The last minute I became the mother that was

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.859
sure everything was going to go wrong."
Brangelina famously sold the first photos

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.749
of Shiloh in order to give money to charity,
and over $7 million in proceeds ended up being

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:49.090
donated to UNICEF.
In 2010, Angelina chatted candidly about her

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.900
daughter, saying "Shiloh, we feel, has Montenegro
style. It's how people dress there. She likes

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.749
tracksuits, she likes [regular] suits. She
likes to dress like a boy. She wants to be

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:07.060
a boy. So we had to cut her hair. She likes
to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.309
one of the brothers."
Shiloh was also featured in Kung Fu Panda

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:16.209
3 (we're sensing a trend), got "bored" and
passed on Maleficent, and had a cameo in The

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.730
Curious Case of Benjamin Button. She recently
made headlines for breaking her arm during

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.500
a family vacation. And in other news, Angie
and Shiloh traveled back to Namibia in 2017

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.000
to open the Shiloh Wildlife Sanctuary.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.610
14-year-old Pax was adopted from Vietnam in

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.030
2007 when he was three. Despite the fact that
Brad and Angie were very much together during

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.650
the time of his adoption, Angie filed the
paperwork herself due to laws that prevented

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.770
unmarried couples to adopt in Vietnam. Brad
adopted Pax in 2008.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.070
Like his brother Maddox, Pax worked as part
of the production on First They Killed My

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.810
Father, and was even a set photographer. In
adorable news, he was his mom's date to the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.620
2018 Golden Globe Awards, and wore a #TimesUp
pin on the red carpet.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.810
Tabloids claim Pax wants to be an actor like
his parents (he was also in Maleficent and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.920
Kung Fu Panda 3), but Angelina said, "None
of my kids want to be actors. They are actually

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.060
very interested in being musicians. I think
they like the process of film from the outside.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.100
Mad is interested in editing. Pax loves music
and deejaying."

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.699
Angelina took Pax back to Vietnam in 2011
to learn about his cultural background. "We

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.890
owe Vietnam a visit, because Pax is due,"
Angie said before the trip. "They are all

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.610
learning about each other’s cultures as
well as being proud of their own. They all

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.000
have their flags over their beds and their
individual pride."

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.740
And finally, the twins! Vivienne and Knox

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.810
are nine (they were born in France in July
2008), and if you thought Shiloh's photos

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.110
were expensive you ain't seen nothing yet.
Photos of these cuties were sold to People

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.280
and Hello! for a reported $14 million, with
proceeds going to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.520
Knox's middle name Léon is the middle name
of Brad's grandfather, while Vivienne's middle

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.270
name Marcheline is the name of Angelina's
mother. Angie described Vivienne as a "girly

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.720
girl," saying "She is so elegant and delicate.
Vivi will pick flowers from the garden and

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.030
put them in her hair," while her brother is
a burgeoning bro who "loves dinosaurs and

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.180
swords."
Vivienne had a staring role in Maleficent.
