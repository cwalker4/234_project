Jobs. Literally, the only reason
that anyone gets up before 11am.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.011
Politicians care about jobs
more than anything else,

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.080
as you can tell from how often
they mention them.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.537
Politicians seem to think
that jobs are like Beetlejuice.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.373
If you just say the word
a magic number of times,

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.775
eventually they'll just pop up
out of nowhere.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.145
Now, more specifically tonight,
I'd like to talk about

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.847
one of the ways that politicians
try to create jobs.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.548
Economic development incentives.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.184

that doesn't sound interesting.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.006
All of a sudden, a show about
economic development

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.407
doesn't seem like
the worst thing

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.709

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.978

-So... (CLEARS THROAT)

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.414
-As I was saying...
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS)

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:26.251
Economic development incentives
are essentially when state

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.654
and local governments
offer perks to companies

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.557
to entice them to build
or expand in their area.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.658
Here in New York

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.927
there is a program called
StartUp New York

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.730
which launched with some pretty
astounding tax breaks.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:40.633

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.151

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.788

-See ya next year, little buddy.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.363
And look,
it's not just New York.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.133
All 50 states
offer some kind of incentives,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.335
like tax-breaks
to attract companies,

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.871
and the argument is,
that they attract employers,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.507
which attract jobs,
which lead to spending,

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:23.942
which creates more jobs
and so on, and so on, and so on,

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.245
and many places have
bought into this, hard,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.781
trying to outbid one another
for businesses.

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.318
Indiana even once took out
attack ads on other states,

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:36.055
like this billboard, which read,
"Illinnoyed by higher taxes?

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.524
Come to Indiana,
a state that works."

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.027
And that's pretty aggressive,
although, it's actually much

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.928
tamer than their
original billboard,

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:44.930
"Just Arkan-saw your tax bill?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699
Ida-hope you like
our tax breaks.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.100
Because if you Colora-don't,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.202
we'll Conneti-cut
your fucking balls off."

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.804
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.872
And if a company is big enough,

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.376
it can even start
a bidding war itself.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.978
That is actually happening
right now, with Amazon.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.547
They are planning to build
a second headquarters

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.182
somewhere in North America

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.417
and they are making
governments bid for it.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:08.821
They even released eight pages
of instructions for candidates

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.324
telling them to "think big
and be creative,"

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.593

to do stupid shit like this...

You know, to compete,
I'm not surprised

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:42.354
that Omaha, Nebraska didn't
offer to let Jeff Bezos

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.324

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:48.494

Look at him, he wants it so bad.

It's the only thing
he can't have and he wants it.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.701

made direct appeals to Amazon

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:59.172

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.460

You know, my one and only worry
with all of those ads,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.334
and I mean this sincerely, is,
are they almost too hilarious?

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.671
But those stunts
are just window-dressing.

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.474
What Amazon cares much,
much more about,

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:38.911
as they mentioned
in their instructions 21 times,

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.313
are incentives.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.915
And while few places
are revealing what they offered,

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.117
we do know that New Jersey
reportedly offered

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:47.753
seven billion dollars
in tax breaks,

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:51.156
which is an insane amount
that other places

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.426
may now have to compete with,
and think about what that means.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.461
That could mean billions
of tax dollars

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.431
that would not be collected
for things like roads,

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.867
or schools, or hospitals,
and Amazon already has

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.137
more money than it knows
what to do with.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:07.573
How else could you explain
the existence of<i> Goliath?</i>

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:12.678
A show that, and this is true,
literally nobody has ever seen.

00:05:13.512 --> 00:05:17.150

No animal. Nobody.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.285

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:21.387
Does it even exist?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.489
If you make a show
and no one watches it,

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.691
does it exist? Discuss.

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.527
And...
And that is the thing here.

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:31.363
We give companies a lot of money
through these incentives.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:34.166
By one estimate, in 2015
they cost state

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:37.036
and local governments
45 billion dollars.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.371
And that money can go
to some questionable projects.

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:40.540
For instance, a few years ago,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.942
Kentucky took a big swing
on this...

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:46.078 line:0%

And I'm not saying that is
inherently a bad idea,

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.741
I do kind of want to see
this thing,

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:18.444
especially as its website
genuinely has a section

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.781
devoted to the question,
"What about all the manure?"

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.350
The answer, apparently, is,

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:28.154
"Slatted floors
or multiple-level cages,"

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.788
which is really
not a good answer,

chastity is a pretty weird rule
to put in place for a museum

00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:00.519

for taking a gamble
on a gigantic ark,

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:21.307
was that it would be
a boom to the whole area,

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.141

are extremely lax.

Remember StartUp New York?
Zero taxes for a decade?...

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:28.240
-(SLIDE WHISTLE ASCENDING)
-Oh shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.342
Don't think about it,
I'm sure it will pass.

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:33.012
That program
is hiring requirements--

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.479
That program's hiring
requirements

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.150
were that you create just
one new job a year,

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.718
and the state
recently considered

00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:43.823
scaling that back to one
new job in the first five years.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.891
And sometimes these incentives
are given out

00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:47.459
even when
they may not be necessary.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.628
Take a look
at Fargo, North Dakota.

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:51.464
-(SLIDE WHISTLE DESCENDING)
-You know what, he's not wrong.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.633
He's not wrong and I knew
that would do the job.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.435
Fargo gave a tax break to FedEx

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:59.538
for moving a facility
to their city, but why?

00:08:59.838 --> 00:09:01.606
Did they really need to?

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:03.709
'Cause just listen to what
happened when one

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:06.144
city council member
asked that very question

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:07.546
of a FedEx representative.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.948 line:0%
Mr. Wilson, if you don't get
this exemption,

00:09:10.048 --> 00:09:11.450 line:0%
will you still move to Fargo?

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.652 line:0%
-MR. WILSON: Yes, sir, we will.
-Okay.

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:15.087
Yet, ten minutes later,

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:17.957
the council voted
to give FedEx that exemption.

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.024
Why?

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:21.627
Also, if someone wants to
willingly move to Fargo,

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.529
you don't offer them
tax incentives,

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:26.599
you simply offer them
a full psychological work-up

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:29.568
that starts with the question,
"Who did you murder?

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.105
We'll still let you live here,
but we do need to know."

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.440
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.475
And then...
Then there are programs

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:39.445
narrowly set up to encourage
a particular industry to grow.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:42.214
Which can sound great,
but may not lead

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:45.951
to good, permanent jobs.
Take film and TV incentives.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.120
At some point
in the last couple of decades,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.956
nearly every state decided
that they wanted to be

00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:53.826
the next Hollywood, and now,
31 states

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.161
have incentive programs
for film or TV.

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:58.431
The problem with that is,
if you are one of them,

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:02.034
you have 30 other states
competing with you... hard.

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:04.236
And because film productions
are portable,

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:06.138
if you try and scale back
your incentives,

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.607
they'll just go
wherever a better deal is.

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.209
Just listen
to this movie producer

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.711
who has taken advantage
of multiple states' incentives.

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:16.315 line:0%
I would never make a movie
where I didn't get an incentive,

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.950 line:0%
and I don't ever intend to.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.486
But at the end of the day,
if there's an incentive...

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:22.822
it's good for me.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.190
-And look...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.092
He's not wrong,
I mean yes,

00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:29.628
he looks like every woman's
worst ex-boyfriend,

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:31.630
but he's-- he's not wrong.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.767
It is not his job to worry
about whether his incentives

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:35.868
are good for the states.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:39.605
It is his job to, I'm assuming,
refer to sushi as "sush,"

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.174
because he definitely does that.

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:46.111
But it should be someone,
someone's job,

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:48.147
to worry about the effect
of these programs.

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:50.515
And on some occasions
when states have done that,

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:52.518
the news they got was not great.

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.286
For instance,
Louisiana found that

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.188
for every dollar
it spent on its film program,

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:59.291
it generated just 22 cents
of tax revenue.

00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:00.959
Which sounds bad,
but which is still better

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:03.796
than Maryland,
which made just 10 cents

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.164
for every dollar spent,
which is still better

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:08.633
than Connecticut's program,
which returned only

00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:10.602
seven cents on the dollar.

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:13.205
That's like putting a dollar
into a vending machine,

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:16.409
and getting a single,
yellow Starburst in return.

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:18.511
At some point,
what you're getting out

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:20.412
is not worth what you're
putting in.

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.814
And defenders
of economic incentives will say,

00:11:22.914 --> 00:11:25.718
that's just a fraction
of the broader economic benefit

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.419
that they bring.
The problem is,

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.255
there's not much evidence
for that.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.790
And I know that accounting
for the total economic impact

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.893
of anything is tricky,
but we are gambling

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:37.563
billions of dollars
on little more than faith.

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:40.933
And even basic information
can be really hard to come by.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.835
One study found that
three quarters

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:44.502
of major state
development programs

00:11:44.602 --> 00:11:48.406
don't even disclose actual jobs
created or workers trained.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.110
So, we're basically throwing
money down a hole

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.911
and hoping it bring us
prosperity,

00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:54.679
which is the exact
business model

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:56.415
of a fucking wishing well.

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:57.916
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.853
And to see this at perhaps
it's most pointless,

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:02.655
just look at Kansas
and Missouri.

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.323
They've offered competing
tax breaks

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:05.657
to businesses for years.

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.826
Which has made things
particularly interesting

00:12:07.926 --> 00:12:09.161
in one metro area.

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:11.230 line:0%
So,
I'm in Kansas City, Missouri.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.466 line:0%
That's it behind me. Uh,
there is Kansas City, Kansas.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.303 line:0%
Two states, one metro area,
but those states offer subsidies

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:21.273 line:0%
for job creation. Create a job,
you get a tax break.

00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:22.874 line:0%
So, what do businesses do?

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.810 line:0%
A Missouri business will move
some employees

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.180 line:0%
over to Kansas City, Kansas
and claim a tax break,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.048 line:0%
move 'em back,
claim another tax break.

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.149
It's true.

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:32.851
For instance,
Kansas City, Missouri

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.253
lost corporate offices
for all these companies

00:12:35.353 --> 00:12:37.489
to Kansas City, Kansas
which, in turn,

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.391
lost offices
for all these companies

00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:43.128
to Kansas City, Missouri.
And that isn't creating jobs

00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:45.564
any more than moving your couch
from the bedroom

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:48.134
to the living room
is creating fucking furniture.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.070
And this war has come
at a real cost.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.672
A local foundation has studied

00:12:53.905 --> 00:12:55.774
two state-level
incentives programs

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:59.544
and estimates that since 2009,
around 6,600 jobs

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.213
have moved from Missouri
to Kansas.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:03.615
While around 5, 500 jobs

00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:05.450
have moved
from Kansas to Missouri.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.154
Meaning there's been a net-gain
of around 1,100 jobs

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.755
on the Kansas side of the line
and a combined cost

00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:15.027
to the two states of
$331 million

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:18.430
in lost tax revenue, and
think about that for a second.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.133
You could create a program
where the first 1,100 people

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.703
to move from-- to Kansas City
from Missouri

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.105
would each get a Ferrari
which they could then

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:30.342
drive around a giant pile
of $30 million

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:31.943
that the state had set
on fire

00:13:32.177 --> 00:13:34.346
and you'd actually be
fiscally responsible,

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:37.550
because you would have
saved the area $20 million.

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:42.588
Look, it is pretty clear
that economic development

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.322
needs to be done
in a much smarter way.

00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:46.358
And I don't fully blame
the companies for this.

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.394
Because if governments
are going to offer

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.563
ridiculous incentives,
they are going to take them.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:54.233
So, governments need to
hold themselves,

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.167
and companies,
more accountable.

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:58.436
And if companies aren't
producing what they promised,

00:13:58.536 --> 00:14:00.872
we need a system to claw
our money back.

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:03.075
But to find that out,
we're going to need

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.911
much more oversight
over these programs

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.312
and what we're getting
in return.

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:08.447
Although, I will tell you

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:11.683
one thing that I know for sure
we got in return,

00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:13.085
the<i> Entourage</i> movie.

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:18.123
That got a $5.8 million
tax credit from California

00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:21.627
and where else were they
going to film<i> Entourage?</i>

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:26.064
Idaho? So,
California, please know

00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.367
that you indirectly had a hand
in producing a movie,

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:29.801
which, may I remind you,

00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:32.204
had this,
for it's very first line...

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:35.941
I may have to jerk it
before we even get there.

00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:38.043
You know what,
I've got to say this,

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:40.845
"Congratulations,
Kentucky Ark Museum,

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:43.081
because somehow, you've become
the second worst

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.918
tax-payer subsidized
fuck-boat in this story."
