00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.129
Speaking up is hard to do.

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:16.479
I understood the true meaning
of this phrase exactly one month ago

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:19.620
when my wife and I became new parents.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.880
It was an amazing moment.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.210
It was exhilarating and elating,
but it was also scary and terrifying.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.540
It got particularly terrifying
when we got home from the hospital.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.189
We were unsure
whether our little baby boy

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.590
was getting enough nutrients
from breastfeeding.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.039
We wanted to call our paediatrician,

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:43.670
but we also didn't want 
to make a bad first impression

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.609
or come across as a crazy neurotic parent,
so we worried and we waited.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.489
When we got to the doctor's office
the next day,

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.769
she immediately gave him formula
because he was pretty dehydrated.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.789
Our son is fine now,

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.979
and our doctor has reassured us
we can always contact her.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.310
But in that moment,
I should have spoken up,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.520
but I didn't.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.230
But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.510
I learned that over ten years ago
when I let my twin brother down.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.160
My twin brother
is a documentary filmmaker,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.450
and for one of his first films, he got
an offer from a distribution company.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.580
He was excited and he was inclined
to accept the offer,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.510
but as a negotiations researcher,
I insisted he make a counteroffer,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.550
and I helped him craft the perfect one.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.620
It was perfect;
it was perfectly insulting.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.210
The company was so offended
they literally withdrew the offer

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.460
and my brother was left with nothing.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.380
I've ask people all over the world
about this dilemma of speaking up:

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.050
when they can assert themselves,
when they can push their interest,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.490
when they can express an opinion,
when they can make an ambitious ask.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.160
The range of stories
are varied and diverse

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.860
but they also make up
a universal tapestry.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.650
"Can I correct my boss
when they make a mistake?"

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.828
"Can I confront my co-worker
who keeps stepping on my toes?"

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:13.349
"Can I challenge
my friend's insensitive joke?"

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.750
"Can I tell the person I love the most
my deepest insecurities?"

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.740
Through these experiences,
I've come to recognize

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.590
that each of us have something
called "a range of acceptable behavior."

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.880
Sometimes, we're too strong;
we push ourselves too much.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.670
That's what happened with my brother.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
Even making an offer was outside
his range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.190
But sometimes we're too weak.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.500
That's what happened with my wife and I.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.720
This range of acceptable behaviors,

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.770
when we stay within our range,
we're rewarded,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.950
and we step outside that range,
we get punished in a variety of ways:

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.999
we get dismissed, or demeaned,
or even ostracized,

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.409
or we lose that raise,
or that promotion, or that deal.

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.070
Now, the first thing we need
to know is: "What is my range?"

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.870
But the key thing is,
our range isn't fixed.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.750
It's actually pretty dynamic.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.260
It expands and it narrows
based on the context.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.710
There's one thing that determines
that range more than anything else.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.430
That's your power.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.720
Your power determines your range.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.050
What is power?

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.810
Power comes in lots of forms.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.850
In negotiations, it comes
in the form of alternatives.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.000
So my brother had
no alternatives; he lacked power.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.130
The company had lots
of alternatives; they had power.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.230
Or sometimes being new
to a country like an immigrant,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.890
or new to an organization,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.380
or new to an experience
like my wife and I as new parents.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.730
Sometimes it's at work,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.239
or someone's the boss
and someone's the subordinate.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.060
Sometimes it's in relationships

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.290
where one person is more invested
than the other person.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.809
The key thing is,

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.420
when we have lots of power,
our range is very wide.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.430
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.440
But when we lack power, our range narrows.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.580
We have very little leeway.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.550
The problem is when our range narrows,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.920
that produces something called
"the low-power double bind."

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.180
The low-power double bind happens

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.189
when if we don't speak up,
we go unnoticed,

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.339
but if we do speak up, we get punished.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.088
Now, many of you have heard
the phrase "the double bind"

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.900
and connected it with one thing,
and that's gender.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.750
The gender double bind is:

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.090
women who don't speak up go unnoticed,
and women who do speak up get punished.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.060
The key thing is that women
have the same need as men to speak up,

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.540
but they have barriers to doing so.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.109
But what my research has shown
over the last two decades

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:47.750
is that what looks
like a gender difference

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.760
is not really a gender double bind;
it's really a low-power double bind.

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:54.820
What looks like a gender difference

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.260
are really often just
power differences in disguise.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.900
Oftentimes, we see a difference

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.910
between a man and a woman
or men and women,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.840
and we think biological cause,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.200
there's something fundamentally
different about the sexes.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.730
But in study after study,
I found that a better explanation

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.369
for many sex differences
is really "power."

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:22.150
So it's the low-power double bind,
and the low-power double bind means

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.630
that we have a narrow range
and we lack power;

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.040
we have a narrow range
and our double bind is very large.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.860
So, we need to find ways
to expand our range.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.430
Over the last couple of decades,

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.660
my colleagues and I have found
two things really matter.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.010
The first, you seem powerful
in your own eyes.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.559
The second, you seem powerful
in the eyes of others.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.019
When I feel powerful,
I feel confident, not fearful,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.870
and I expand my own range.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.240
When other people see me as powerful,
they grant me a wider range.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.900
So we need tools to expand
our range of acceptable behavior.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.409
I'm going to give you
a set of tools today.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.200
Now, speaking up is risky.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.650
But these tools will lower
your risk of speaking up.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.780
The first tool I'm going to give you
got discovered in negotiations.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.480
An important finding:

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.330
on average, women
make less ambitious offers,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.000
and gets worse outcomes
than men at the bargaining table.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.750
But Hannah Riley Bowles
and Emily Amanatullah

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.800
have discovered there's one situation

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.649
where women get the same outcomes
as man and are just as ambitious.

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.790
That's when they advocate for others.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.440
When they advocate for others,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.280
they discover their own range,
and expand it in their own mind.

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:46.980
They become more assertive.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.820
This is sometimes called
the "mama bear effect."

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.890
Like a mama bear defending her cubs,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.930
when we advocate for others,
we can discover our own voice.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.500
But sometimes,
we have to advocate for ourselves.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.910
How do we do that?

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.890
One of the most important tools
we have to advocate for ourselves

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.260
is something called "perspective-taking."

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.980
Perspective-taking is really simple.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.590
It's simply looking at the world
through the eyes of another person.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.810
It's one of the most important tools
we have to expand our range.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.740
When I take your perspective,
and I think about what you really want,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.490
you're more likely to give me
what I really want.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.900
But here's the problem:

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.330
perspective-taking is hard to do.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.870
Let's do a little experiment.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.540
I want you all to hold your hand
just like this, your finger, put it up.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.790
I want you to draw a capital letter "E"
on your forehead as quickly as possible.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.670
Okay.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.540
It turns out that we can draw
this "E" in one of two ways

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.950
and this was originally designed
as a test of perspective-taking.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.440
I'm going to show you two pictures
of someone with "E" on their forehead.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.560
My former student Erica Hall.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.650
You can see over here,
that's the correct "E".

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.100
I drew the "E" so it looks like
an "E" to another person.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.180
That's the perspective-taking "E,"

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.410
because it looks like an "E"
from someone else's vantage point.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.580
But this "E" over here
is the self-focused "E."

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.500
We often get self-focused

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.800
and we particularly get
self-focused in a crisis.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.130
I want to tell you
about a particular crisis.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.340
A man walks into a bank
in Watsonville, California.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.690
He says, "Give me $2,000,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.950
or I'm blowing
the bank up with a bomb."

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.940
The bank manager
didn't give him the money.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.369
She took a step back;
she took his perspective.

00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:40.550
She noticed something really important.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.529
He asked for a specific amount of money.

00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:48.120
So she said, "Why did you ask for $2,000?"

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.680
He said, "My friend is going to be evicted
unless I get him $2,000 immediately.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.950
She said, "Oh,
you don't want to rob the bank.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.620
You want to take out a loan."

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.640
(Laughter)

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.770
"Come back to my office

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.860
and we can have you
fill out the paperwork."

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.700
(Laughter)

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:09.060
Now, her quick perspective-taking
diffused a volatile situation.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.130
When we take someone's perspective,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.840
it allows us to be ambitious
and assertive, but still be likable.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.470
Here's another way
to be assertive but still be likable.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.980
That is to signal flexibility.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.600
Imagine you're a car salesperson
and you want to sell someone a car.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.160
You're going to more likely make the sale
if you give them two options.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.690
Let's say, option A:

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.060
$24,000 for this car,
and a five-year warranty.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.780
Or option B:

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.820
$23,000 and a three-year warranty.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.330
My research shows that when
you give people a choice among options,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.350
it lowers their defences,

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.540
and they're more likely
to accept your offer.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.470
This doesn't just work with salespeople;
it works with parents.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.970
When my niece was four,

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.990
she resisted getting dressed
and rejected everything.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.000
But then my sister-in-law
had a brilliant idea.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.700
"What if I gave my daughter a choice?"

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.920
"This shirt or that shirt?"
"Okay, that shirt."

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.070
"This pant or that pant?"
"Okay, that pant."

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.390
That worked brilliantly.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.540
She got dressed quickly,
and without resistance.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.700
When I've asked the question
around the world,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.340
when people feel comfortable speaking up,
the number one answer is:

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.970
"When I have social support
in my audience."

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.920
"When I have allies."

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.450
So, we want to get allies on our side.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.350
How do we do that?

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.050
One of the ways is to be a "mama bear."

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.830
When we advocate for others,
we expand our range in our own eyes

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.170
and in the eyes of others
but we also earn strong allies.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.420
Another way we can earn strong allies,
especially in high places,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.250
is by asking other people for advice.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.830
When we ask others for advice,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.070
they like us because we flatter them
and we're expressing humility.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.620
This really works to solve
another double bind.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.280
That's the self-promotion double bind.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.030
The self-promotion double bind

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.320
is that if we don't advertise
our accomplishments,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.690
no one notices,
and if we do, we're not likable.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.369
But if we ask for advice
about one of our accomplishments,

00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:16.930
we are able to be competent
in their eyes, but also be likable.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.410
This is so powerful.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.440
It even works when you see it coming.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.590
There've been multiple times in my life
where I have been forewarned

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:31.000
that a low-power person has been given
the advice to come ask me for advice.

00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:33.469
There are three things about this:

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:36.599
First, I knew they were going
to come ask me for advice;

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:39.490
Two, I've actually done research

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.689
on the strategic benefits
of asking for advice;

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:44.869
And three, it still works!

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:49.170
I took their perspective,
I became more invested in their cause,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.120
I became more committed to them,
because they asked for advice.

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:56.639
Now, another time we feel
more confident speaking up

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:58.820
is when we have expertise.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.600
Expertise gives us credibility.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.760
When we have high power,
we already have credibility.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.749
We only need good evidence.

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:09.779
We lack power,
we don't have the credibility,

00:12:09.909 --> 00:12:12.050
we need excellent evidence.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.819
One of the ways that we can come across

00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:18.129
as an expert is by tapping
into our passion.

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:22.970
I want everyone in the next few days
to go up to a friend of theirs,

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:27.190
and just say to them, "I want you
to describe a passion of yours to me."

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.159
I've had people do this
all over the world,

00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:33.750
and I asked them, "What did you
notice about the other person

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.779
when they described their passion?"

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.729
The answers are always the same.

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:39.590
"Their eyes lit up and got big."

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.620
"They smiled, a big beaming smile."

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.319
"They use their hands all over;

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:46.819
I had to duck because their hands
were coming at me."

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:49.130
"They talk quickly
with a higher pitch."

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.929
(Laughter)

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:52.369
And, "They leaned in
as if telling me a secret."

00:12:52.659 --> 00:12:57.360
Then I said to them, "What happened
to you as you listen to their passion?"

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.139
They said. "My eyes lit up.
I smiled; I leaned in."

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.479
When we tap into our passion,

00:13:04.499 --> 00:13:07.870
we give ourselves the courage
in our own eyes to speak up,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.880
but we also get the permission
from others to speak up.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:16.939
Tapping into our passion even works
when we come across as too weak.

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:22.140
Both men and women get punished
at work when they shed tears.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.669
But Lizzy Wolf has shown

00:13:24.669 --> 00:13:28.849
that when we frame
our strong emotions as passion,

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:34.989
the condemnation of our crying
disappears for both men and women.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.749
I want to end with a few words
from my late father that he spoke

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:41.529
at my twin brother's wedding.

00:13:41.739 --> 00:13:43.239
Here's a picture of us.

00:13:45.379 --> 00:13:47.190
My dad was a psychologist like me,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.929
but his real love and his real passion
was cinema, like my brother.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.599
He wrote a speech for my brother's wedding

00:13:54.619 --> 00:13:57.679
about the roles we play
in the human comedy.

00:13:57.819 --> 00:14:01.409
He said, "The lighter your touch,
the better you become

00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:04.149
at improving and enriching
your performance.

00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:08.189
Those who embrace their roles
and work to improve their performance

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:11.749
grow, change, and expand the self.

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:15.630
Play it well, and your days
will be mostly joyful."

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.629
What my dad was saying

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:21.620
is that we've all been assigned
ranges and roles in this world.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.579
But he was also saying
the essence of this talk.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:31.199
Those roles and ranges
are constantly expanding and evolving.

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:33.809
So, when a scene calls for it,

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:38.049
be a ferocious mama bear,
and a humble advice seeker.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:42.989
Have excellent evidence and strong allies.

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:45.649
Be a passionate perspective taker.

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:47.540
If you use those tools -

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.859
and each and every one
of you can use these tools -

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.889
you'll expand your range
of acceptable behavior

00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:58.130
and your days will be mostly joyful.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.090
Thank you.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.751
(Applause)
