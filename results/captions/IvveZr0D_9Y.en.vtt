00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.890
one million

darker

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.979
are like a lot

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.599
talking about your financial future out
those figures become applet all of your

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.489
sleep

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.539
caught at

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.239
uh... i'd like to start

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.150
uh... by posing a problem for you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.329
and so i'm just gonna talk for a couple
minutes until two q and a because pat

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.800
what we want to loose talk about what's
on your wife but i'd like to think about

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.330
this for just a second

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.740
if as we walked out of here today

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.850
i said i would like to buy

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.060
ten percent of your financial future

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.390
i was going to write you a check today

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.430
from the state forest

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.350
you were going to give me ten percent of
everything you her

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.320
uh... how much would you want your for
that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.990
modify one-tenth of you

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.840
and uh... i may take a little bit
incidently so

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.010
careful what you are

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.000
all right now

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.580
well i think it has a lot about that
logic

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.310
cop like that for a few let's see how
you're going to check for me today

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.660
in doing a lot with the money but

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.050
from the state for if you have to give
me

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.410
ten percent of what you were not

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.509
i think it would be very foolish

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.460
of you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.290
any of you

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.820
if you ask for less than say fifty
thousand dollars out of the few years

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.070
before you're out

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.000
earning money in so i've got a few years
of that money there but then i would

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.530
start getting his royal yacht

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.850
visual along so

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.290
i really think that

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.770
if you thought about it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.090
most of you would want

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.760
for a lot more that i think you'd be
right

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.799
uh... fortunately i didn't make this
deal with anybody when i started out so

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.650
i'm nobody's got a ten percent royally
may but

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.690
uh... i think that

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.200
fifty thousand what sort of the absolute
minimum

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.370
and if you think about that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.220
that means the right today

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.430
you're worth five hundred thousand

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.810
because of ten percent is worth fifty
thousand in cash today

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.730
your potential

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.729
is worth a minimum on a hundred percent
faces

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.999
a five hundred thousand dollars that is
the big financial asset you've got it's

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.329
way more important

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:22.949
what you do with that five hundred
thousand dollar asset that you all today

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:27.039
whether you decide to buy stocks or
bonds or whether you put your money in a

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.309
mutual fund or pick your own stocks or
anything of that sort

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.759
the biggest financial asset

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.959
that you have going for you by miles

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.149
is the value of your own earning power
over the years

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.919
so that's really what you should focus
on you're focusing on your financial

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.019
full future

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.169
that means you should find focus on you

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.980
because whether your ten percent is
worth fifty thousand or a hundred

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.359
thousand three hundred thousand

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.569
which would be a five hundred thousand
millionaire three million for all of you

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.959
whether it turns out that be one of the
other is really dependent

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.939
i had a very large part on what you do
in the next few years

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.159
all of you in this room

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.439
have the brains to do extremely well in
life

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.939
you've all got the energy to do
extremely well in life

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.199
and the question is how do you apply it

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.559
if you've got a two hundred horsepower
motor

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.649
you get two hundred or spa robert

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.099
you get your full

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.619
potential or do you get a hundred or spa
our fifty horsepower

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.839
now there's two things that happen

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.789
hold you back

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.760
and getting

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.399
force power out of here

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.819
your engine whatever may be all of you
have the contentions

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.289
at one of those the lack of education
but that probably isn't going to happen

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.059
to very many people trump

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.809
if you don't have a lack of education
didn't it if you didn't have a chance to

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.599
get a decent education life

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.469
it would make any difference what that
potential was because

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.109
you've ever unblock

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.569
but the second most important thing

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.639
and equally as important

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.539
is in terms of the habits that you
develop in terms of what you do with

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.139
yourself

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.379
one week

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.719
hire people

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.889
we look for three qualities

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.459
we look for integrity

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.029
we look for intelligence

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.919
and we look for energy

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.759
but they don't have the first one
integrity the other two will kill you

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.189
because if you're hiring somebody
without integrity he really want to be

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.980
done and lazy gotcha major

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.979
blasting the world you won't want to be
smart energetic self

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.129
smart energetic only goals

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.569
with integrity

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.020
but i say well

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.149
you make your own decision on that you
can change

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:33.939
your i_q_ or how far you control
footballer how high you can jump

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.919
of the color of your hair very easily

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.539
but you can

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.080
elect

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.830
to have integrity that matches anybody
else has and if you match that

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.499
with intelligence which you have

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.440
and energy which you have

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.330
uh... you'll get an extraordinary
resulting you'd be very foolish to

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.749
somebody ten percent of yourself for
fifty thousand on the other hand

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.129
if you don't match it without your
potential

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.599
in a significant part going use

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.139
and i'll give you a little

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.949
simple test apply in terms of thinking
about the kinda habit she wanted about

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.380
if you don't have any haven't you want
to get you can be

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.780
it can be lazy who can be prompt you can
be it can be

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.569
late you can be honest you can cut
corners of the uh... police forces

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.039
and those resources for you to make

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.229
nobody else is going to make room for
you

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.490
and i would suggest that you play this
little game with me too

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.860
think about the person you would most
like to be in life

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.050
submit is one of your contemporaries
maybe somebody will orbit pick up the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.779
person you admire the most person the
you change places with if you could

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.409
and then write down what you martin

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.289
just put it on a piece of paper

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.119
figure out the person that you would

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:44.849
least like change places with who really
turned you off

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.909
when you find repulsive

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.159
and lists the reasons why

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.800
that person turn you off so much

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.280
to put those on the other side of the
paper

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.249
and then look at that list

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.099
and you'll find that everything on the
left hand side with which in my and

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.590
other people

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.249
the qualities they bring to life

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:04.729
truthfulness

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.979
generosity all kinds of things

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.039
the finals of things you can do it
yourself it's very simple

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.069
got apply yourself but the habit shoe
formed and doing early on a military

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.659
through life

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.550
and on the other hand you'll find that

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.699
the things that make people repulsive

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.379
selfishness ob noxious use all these
things egotism

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.820
are things

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.120
but no one has to have if you find those
it yourself you can get rid of them as

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.330
well you get rid of them early so

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.030
all i suggest is that you're right

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.419
the right down the list of what

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.860
which admire

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.240
what you find uh...

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.830
contemptible

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.189
and decide that in other ones on the
left

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.279
i meant

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.809
add and admired side everyone's you're
going to acquire for yourself as you do

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.949
that when you're young and contrary to
the rest of your life this doesn't work

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.129
if you do it when you're fifty or sixty

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.999
by then they have a trip to well-formed

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.080
uh... but if you do it early

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.090
behavior becomes becomes a habit so

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.089
if you do that

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.249
two or three years now to go to the same
exercise

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.179
you'll find out the person you admire
the most as yourself

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:10.159
i can be a little bags under some
circumstances but it does

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.490
uh... but it's not it's not a bad thing
and that you want to be somebody like

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.789
and you don't want to be somebody
picture that you dislike and and uh...

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.979
formals habits early

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.030
uh... he basically can't mess i'll give
you one other small piece of advice is

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.169
just a corollary on this

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.299
and then we'll get to your questions in

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:31.270
and that is

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.310
as a general matters are one piece of
specific finance

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.669
uh... financial advice

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:37.860
i would say

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.840
in onboard credit cards just forget
about me

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.199
uh... where in various businesses issue
credit card the american public loves

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.240
credit cards but if you start revolving
debt on credit card you're going to be

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.499
paying

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:51.259
uh... eighteen or twenty percent and

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.180
you can't make

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.330
progress and your financial life

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.449
who are on borrowing money eighteen or
twenty percent

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.159
you can make a lot of money by lending
out earlier eighteen or twenty percent

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:03.009
over time

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:06.229
you can find a way that's good that
uh... will borrow from you but

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.949
you don't want to be on the side of the
equation

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.219
that's always behind in life

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:12.269
uh...

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.249
you know i was lucky i'd saved about ten
thousand dollars by the time i got out

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:18.349
of school that ten thousand dollars was

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:21.759
really worth millions i might have run
later on because after you get a family

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.099
member vaguely expenses role in but

00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:27.349
but those are my tools to work with but
it was only because i was ahead of the

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:28.210
game

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.620
if you're behind a game by ten thousand
dollars at some point in paying eighteen

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.510
or twenty percent interest on it

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.710
you will never economically you'll never
get out of it cell

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.410
their partner that says

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.500
i want to know is where i'm going to die
so i'll never go there

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.290
events true international matters as
well you wanna figure out where you

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.020
don't want to be

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.140
uh... at a time in a void that i get
about a dozen letters a day

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.800
from people who are having terrible
problems

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.620
and there are two reasons why they have
terrible problems

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.060
one is

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.980
a number of them up had health problems
of some sort them and they have really

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.770
been hit by some or somebody in their
family has been hit by some kind of

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.220
catastrophic

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.860
uh... illness and that is that

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.470
you know it's a terrible thing to happen
to any family

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.020
and they get in

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.900
there are bills they can't pay and and
really only society consult that one

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.680
in terms of protecting people against
that but that's just plain bad luck

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.200
the other one is from people run up
credit card debt and uh...

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.520
they're facing bankruptcy evident from
bankruptcy once before

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.480
and they'll of what your money and they
can they can pay the interest on loan

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.520
pani principled

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.449
and a half of my letters come from
people like that and that that

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:39.940
that problem is avoidable

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.880
catastrophic illnesses not but

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.700
credit card debt has something to bring
on yourself and

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.510
it's way better

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.610
it's way easier

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.070
to stay out of trouble

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.970
than to get out of trouble financially
and and uh...

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.470
i will guarantee if you're in a big
record that you will be in trouble

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.950
probably the rest of your life in terms
of

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.860
uh... your financial situation on the
other hand if you get ahead of the game

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.980
uh...

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.200
even as on a very modest scale

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.160
money is coming in from investing

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.600
mandira that you're a

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.419
you b

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:15.420
people owe you money or equities oyu
ownership

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.970
and you'll be way ahead of the game
compared to paying it uh...

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.529
it's always been paying them

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:22.830
your creditors every month

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.940
my advice to you this sir

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.670
if you can't pay for don't buy it

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.730
it yourself in a position where you can
pay for anything and uh...

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.520
then we'll be glad to see abortion into
the rest of furniture market

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.070
now let's uh...

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.790
let's have some questions

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.000
we have a mic out there that

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.400
people can either go toward the travels
around her

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.630
and i can't necessarily situ well-fed

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.590
i think that one might touch each size
in just raise your hand waitress to come

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.670
to you

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:58.030
we have some electronic like mine

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.440
anything that's on your mind ask about
them

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.250
gottlieb actual

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.320
how do you guys people who are innocent

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.980
and curriculum and to make a pen

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.370
my keeping families into my non-standard

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.350
furman that mean uh... performing arts
center

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.290
music

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.350
how would you advise as to

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.060
keep

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.610
out financially weakness in the world

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.350
but stroop

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.710
that our market system

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.330
uh...

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.030
does not pay as well in some and spend
some activities as

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.910
might seem appropriate

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.900
for the importance of those activities
the society

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.070
just a teaching for example on the
teaching does not pay well

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.250
what could be more important i mean you
know you've got to be is

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.160
as interested in who you're too

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.490
the teachers of your children are
schedule your account desert and on

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.680
uh... whatever

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.380
firms winning the heavyweight title of
the world of that sort of thing but

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.710
it doesn't it doesn't pay well and and

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.050
it's a fundamental choice

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.450
uh... what you're going to go into
something it for many people could be of

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.470
the definable choice where they're going
to go into something you love or

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.550
something then

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.770
to try to make a lot of money i think
that

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.940
generally it pays to go with what you
love

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.180
uh... i think that

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.390
it's very hard to find people

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.240
when they get to be my age

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.269
say they're on

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.950
that they've love what they've done all
their life and feel was very worthwhile

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.590
uh... but they're terribly sad they made
that choice because they didn't make a

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.260
lot of money i idon't think anybody ever

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.630
ever said that to me that they wish
they'd gone into something else for this

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.900
or uncomfortable doing under didn't
enjoy it didn't feel very productive but

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.170
make a lot of money

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.310
so i don't i don't think you'll find

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.050
that's why would i would never go to
work

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.610
i would go to work

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.270
and whatever terms your honor

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.560
it may turn out to will be more
profitable than and you can thank but

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.390
almost everybody here will make

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.480
enough money

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.150
unless they get some terrible habits
along the way

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.350
to do reasonably well and in doing
reasonably well in this country

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.840
really is

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.560
is uh... is pretty darn good i mean
activities

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.750
it's not necessary to have

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.320
uh... huge amounts of money in order and
your ears of i enjoyed myself when i

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.859
wasn't

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:18.520
and my ten thousand dollars in

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.740
i live in the same house that i've lived
in when i was making when i had about

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.720
that i bought a forty one years ago

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.350
i'd like the house and i like the house
now

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.120
if you think about it

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.410
if you have a reasonable job

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.159
you'll be eating at mcdonalds and i'll
be there top so we're word approach

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:37.070
uh... on on food i mean

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.910
help in fact i was very clear actually
in baghdad

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.710
uh... i think on the dairy queen you'll
see me and you can order reading on the

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.340
menu i can order will be we both can
afford it

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.590
you know you old he'll wear the same
clothes i wear i'll pay more for my

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.750
suits but isn't good for money look
cheap on me so well will talk about the

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.200
same event

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.280
will both live in the same houses i live
in that house from forty one years ago

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.500
it is it's it's warm in winter and a
school in summer and it's comfortable

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.730
and you live in a house that's been
somewhere in that

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.450
whatever's is a negative you have fifty
more rooms orbital guesthouses relented

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.620
encourages brenda problems i mean you
have to worry about that

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.630
about the uh... greens keeper something
when you get through side

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.550
uh... i'd been in the house is the
people

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.530
uh... where the house is a work uh...

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.930
all probably two hundred times

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.740
uh... what my house is worth and i would
not be any heparin dose houses at all if

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.710
i could i'd be less happy i just have
one more thing didn't to worry about and

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.980
you know there

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.220
dozens of people around the place and

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.000
people quitting in people stealing from
him kinds of these

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.980
helicopter

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.460
we drive will drive the same kind of car
thank you probably got a better car i'd

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.300
record about eight years old i don't
know what it's worth now but

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.060
it took me around five and that i i'm
pretty happy what will watch

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.150
what what's the same television you know

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.870
well will work on the same computer
pretty much

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.770
the only difference will be

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.720
how we travel long distances

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.270
fly a plane that

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.760
more comfortable in

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.320
when flying southwest airlines or
something at which etc

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.770
i got nothing against babbitt that's the
one real big difference and

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.780
other than that i do what i like every
day i hope you you'll know what you like

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.359
every day to do and uh...

00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:20.860
i work with nice people i hope you work
with nice people

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.220
and that's this twenty four hours in the
day and those are where the hours ago or

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.120
so

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.260
great wealth

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.800
uh...

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.230
the tiniest bit different

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.530
uh... in a real stp sense than having
just a decent

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.550
a decent income and uh...

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.960
and trade

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.060
a decent income

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.410
and something you love doing in
something where you feel worthwhile

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.960
doing it

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.590
huge well for you to trade off a lot of
your principles

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:58.460
i would be a terrible mistake

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:04.210
reviewing that acknowledges success more
on yourself helping teachings of others

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.070
well i had

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.259
i had the pipe

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:08.360
who was very lucky in life

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.270
uh... if you tell me who your heroes are
are uh... i will

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.530
make a pretty good prediction about how

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.080
what you're going to do and i i i i have
the right heroes i was very lucky in

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.330
life and uh...

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.440
my heroes never let me down and starting
with my dad

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.980
and then i had others in business and

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.750
so i have had

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.050
great teachers

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.570
some formal teachers some that were just

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.600
informal teachers teachers by instinct
for example

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.030
and uh...

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.140
if i hadn't had those

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.030
uh...

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.970
you know mike my life insurer would have
been very different if i'd been born any

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.670
place else when i was i was born in
nineteen thirty

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.670
uh... and

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.920
at the time

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.260
one out of fifty burst in the world one
united states so i came and against

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.430
fifty to one odds against being born
denied state

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.880
i would have probably been a disaster
you know if i been born in afghanistan

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.010
or peru or some place and that i was

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.140
four-to-one i won the lottery today i
was born you know by being born in this

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.850
country so all of you

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.830
uh... i mean you have you

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.360
the odds were probably fourteen to one
against you being born in this country

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.150
and uh... the roots

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.280
five time are likely to been born in

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.690
insuring their six times as

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.180
four five times more likely been born in

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.180
and in india or some other place where
would not have been is easy

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.459
to exploit them

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:31.870
for potentially account so we will won
the lottery in that respect them

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.420
and that's just plain luck

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.770
i mean that uh...

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.310
and i was lucky to be born at this time
and the capital allocation

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.550
is something

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.710
it pays off extremely well in the
society now

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.820
but it doesn't pay off in other
societies in that

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.200
didn't pay off you know many years ago
my but friend bill gates says that if i

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.230
would have been born a few thousand
years ago i have been some animals

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.470
launch

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.390
i can't run very fast i can't climb
trees and you know i just happen

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.650
those are talented nobody asked me to
climb trees now but uh...

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.900
there was a time when i'm out of an
important can

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.850
incidently bill would have been some
animals breakfast and he can not so fast

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.010
leader but

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.210
event uh...

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.480
what we are lucky

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.779
we just imagine being part of a hundred
years ago exactly the same talents and

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:18.510
how far they were thinking of that

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.750
of the average person the bailiff so
much better than that

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.380
the richest person would

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.130
uh... hundred or a hundred and fifty
years ago cell

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.340
uh...

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.780
morgan at respective lucky to be

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.860
one of terrific parents

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.660
i was lucky to be raise them online
again i think in a great public school

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.640
system i gotta start here

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.630
in the first eight grades

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.269
they gave me a foundation

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:43.800
that later when i went off the track a
few times

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.010
uh... carried me through because i had a
terrific great school education

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.660
in at writer analog roselle and one of
the reasons

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.780
i havent incidently is kind of
unfortunate but i had a great education

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.410
uh... in part

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.380
because

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.140
women were being

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.000
enormously discriminated against and
sold at that time

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.460
could be a teacher she could be a
secretary she could be a nurse

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.670
you know and i was about a actually and
i have to tell what pull in the united

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.010
states

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.530
limited to just a few jobs so you had to
abundance of talent

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.860
uh... in those

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.770
activities like nursing her toward her
teaching because

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.090
uh... a talent

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.299
with males was spread across

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.309
every act every formal worked activity
there was no with women it was

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:29.570
concentrated in a few areas and that

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.860
uh... benefit the it's kind of sad
because they've been benefit those

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.950
teachers but

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.440
but i was very lucky

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.230
have really been that way

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.870
uh... all my life and

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.410
what i do

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.210
is what i do is important is that what
it would be pure dusre governors does or

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.320
something of sorts

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.419
and i i think it's quite questionable

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:51.919
it pays off enormously well in a market
economy like the united states and uh...

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.400
but that's an accident

00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:00.400
demanding to any innate ability of mine

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.970
underlining his marine it's an anti ten
omaha central high school a place for

of the technology industry and was white

the united states on download said
there's no question strumming world

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.370
upside down it's it's it's tons done
somewhat

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.820
already but

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.980
it will than i was just beginning

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.080
but is moving very fast

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.490
i met gates on july fifteenth nineteen
ninety-one dot there for a fourth of

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.670
july

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.970
uh...

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.470
celebration with a friend

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.040
and uh...

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.179
who subsequently died meg greenfield of
the washington post and she took us down

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:49.270
to those of the gates family

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.210
he tried to educate me about

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.160
and he too had better luck with
chimpanzees i mean i i was so there's

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.650
really a disaster but

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.130
but it's a good teacher

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.690
but one thing he did told me was that

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.100
at the time he said

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.470
you know you've got this model in your
head of the world

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.549
and your model

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:10.440
time and distance

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.650
as very limiting factors and he said
they are limiting factors anymore

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.950
receptivity

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.640
cost

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.990
talking to somebody around the world or
getting your message in front of

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.490
somebody or publishing

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.810
is that it's going to be zero and parcel
post a zero doesn't make any difference

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.520
in

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.150
you know that was revolutionary

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.909
it's happening already in a in a very
very big way and

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:34.170
it's just uh... what eight years later

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.760
and and it's it's it's exploding so

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.140
high-tech

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.730
information technology where we want to
call it

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.790
is changing the world

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.400
and it's going to change it and ah...

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.600
very very big way i would change and
that's one of things i think about a

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.130
businesses we buy

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.260
uh... we announce the purchase of the
yesterday

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.480
uh... by uh... furniture retailer and
and and and boston in the boston area

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.720
you know i think to myself what effect
does this new world of in terms of the

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.240
internet on furniture repairman we have
to think about questions like that

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.410
that the changes will be huge i will be
played bridge yesterday

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.350
uh... with people

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.500
uh... all over the country but i played
it with people all of the world logistic

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.960
down on my computer and i've got some
popcorn ironman khakis and a sweater and

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.580
i

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.220
i can have a bridge game in thirty
seconds with people all over the world

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.970
in

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.540
uh... no cost to add basically

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.280
now that's a lot different than trying
to arrange a game before people a mama

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.180
hawk anton hugged a one one guy wants to
play golf mother wants to watch baseball

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.410
and its

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.710
it it just it changes things in huge way

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.570
we are very fortunate i mean it's

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.160
indeed agreed to which the united states
leads to the world in this area mean we

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.659
have a lead

00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:49.070
it's hard to think of who's in second
place

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.250
and fifteen or so years ago

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.050
this country had an inferiority complex
would be hard for you to remember to

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.690
shoot you weren't old enough to be
around them but in the in the early

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.970
eighties

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.320
we were wondering whether the germans
and japanese were going on everything

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.800
and if they were going to make all the
steel when they were going to make all

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.950
the cars

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.420
and everything else and the television
sets

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.480
and we were gonna flip hamburgers that
was the standard line

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.320
and

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.250
just imagine a short period like fifteen
years i've been changed around

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.010
in an important way that shane to
because

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.040
information

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.720
a revolution uh... where we had

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.970
like i said i don't know who

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.690
i don't know who you would name is being
in second place in the world but here's

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.830
the most important industry in the world

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.580
and the united states has this
incredible position

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.510
and removing all the time of that
position so

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.100
i think that

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.540
argues for a very

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.930
i think it argues for trivia future for
the world over time and i think it

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:49.360
argues even more for a terrific future
with this company our country

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.880
one of the best place for you to get
started now in securing their financial

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.090
future

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.220
uh... for forgot to secure their
financial future

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.880
freely youthful

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.890
well it's not

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.809
it's a very complicated uh...

00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:05.270
it goes back to

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.430
getting full use out of your own talents
first

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.690
i mean there is a twin whether you're
going to be earning extra two excerpts

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.350
react see here

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.779
uh... twenty years from now

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.500
is going to be a function

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.720
awhile well how much talent you have but
i'll how well you use the talent you

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.180
already have

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.200
and uh...

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.360
so that is

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.860
the your best financial future

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.320
is your own ability

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.780
and and

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.090
and here

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.860
uh... capacity to

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.860
to use those abilities to their
potential

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.870
and

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.539
they can take that can be taken away
from the kerry kerrigan taxes

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:45.539
i mean that

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:46.740
you know most things

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.470
if you are not as a hobby serena stated
that they double the taxes than double

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.210
the taxes that changes

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.260
your ownership in the property because
now

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.710
in effect the taxing authorities all the
more about because they've

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.010
gotta greater command on the revenue
stream

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.640
uh... sending about

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.260
uh... almost any assets you have uh...

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.130
big they and they don't tax what's in
your head

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.580
and they don't act

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.029
here but what we did

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:13.310
start performing when u when you get to
work in the morning and

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.580
finish in the evening uh... to to your
potential one of things it amazes me

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.600
is how people who really do perform well
just sort of jump out at you want a

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.429
running a business when i got out of
school

00:25:25.429 --> 00:25:26.290
you know everybody

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.240
would behave that way but they don't
most people

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.680
go through life in the sleepwalking and

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.050
added if you don't

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.010
you will stand out so

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.610
the big the biggest thing for your
financial futures yourself now

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.080
beyond that it is always being ahead of
the game rather than getting behind the

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.520
game it's saving a little no matter how
you do it i mean i delivered papers i

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.820
worked at pennies and sold well pulls
out a pinball machine i did a lot of

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.930
things

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.360
that enabled me gmail in about ten
thousand dollars by the time i got out

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.490
of school

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.960
uh...

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.710
ten thousand only goes for now the dead
then but it

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.090
having anything

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.390
so that your head of the game and not
getting behind the game

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.600
is enormously important i mean just

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.470
you know if you go to a hundred

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.680
and regard dash against a bunch of
people in life

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.660
uh... if you couldn't figure it out so
that when the gun goes off your ten or

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.340
fifteen yards ahead

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.000
instead of ten or fifteen yards behind
is going to make an enormous difference

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.559
in how the race comes out so

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:25.880
having having some net

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.340
resources

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.770
the member service whether in stocks or
bonds in my view let uh...

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.820
uh... and not having debt

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.610
when i've done goes off when you get out
of school

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:41.390
uh... is a huge crossover being behind
the game and uh...

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.460
it may come from dolores paper out in
the morning of may come from part-time

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.570
work someplace but

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.380
put aside a few dollars for yourself
that uh...

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.120
uh... so that

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.070
when the time comes in the other

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.970
yet of the work force uh...

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.900
your head of the game and not behind and
then once you get there don't get behind

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.980
by buying a lot of things that

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.960
if you're going to pay for sunday you're
paying twenty percent interest in

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.410
between

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.740
since bt please stay in maine and school
let me ask you questions

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:15.740
that they're missing him on the market
on this but i think

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.030
my name is patrick burland from

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.470
plymouth right

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.250
i was wondering with the increasing

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.340
hahahha

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.659
education today

00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:29.330
welcome students due to deal with it
that's one survivor college

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.910
well i think that's a tough line and and
and i decide that office passes i could

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.480
and i would encourage you and others as
possible and

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.940
and uh...

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.540
uh... before that time came out i would
say this

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.980
uh...

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.160
in my experience

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.240
in business

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.030
there's very little difference

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.150
if any

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.160
between a very high price business
education

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.390
and what's available a lot of for a lot
less money so i i mean i a m

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.410
i went to the university abreast of
lincoln

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.170
i last year in college i went to work
for a couple years before that uh...

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.110
uh...

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.790
i learned as much as university breast
as i did at wharton at uh...

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.299
uh... and

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:17.160
it's nothing against warner measures
that we had a very good school he writes

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.150
and terrific professors that at lincoln

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.630
so i i would not assume

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.830
that if i was paying a few thousand
dollars for an education

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.200
uh... here in the state for example

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.520
purses pain

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.270
huge amounts of swear

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.110
that it was going to make a lot of
difference uh...

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.410
uh... most of the a lot of the education

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.030
uh... unit you need to be prodded to the
right direction an awful lot of it is is

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.300
is itself

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.440
the self-taught

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.830
me andrew carnegie a wonderful thing in
this country in terms of libraries and

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.630
are you spent a lot of time

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.360
lovers and have locked in at the
university will not want what was then

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.320
the university of mom on the head

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.690
i couldn't get out for hours and uh...
midnight i get so entranced with what i

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.720
was reading but

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.629
there's there's all kinds of information
available now internet it's so much

00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:07.490
you know issue that was then so

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.470
it's out there to be taken

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.570
it isn't necessary to pay

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.730
thirty or thirty five oh three dollars a
year ago to some

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.730
uh... big-name school

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.100
to get the education at all

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.150
if you're not alone accounting it yet
which is about the most important of

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.760
course you take in business

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.929
going to tell you not accounting
absolutely as well

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:30.000
and my view going to you i was going to

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.540
garber i mean i i see uh...

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.710
i would i would abed on that and uh...

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.120
i wouldn't grow up

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.050
huge bills

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.540
interviewing a business education out
you know if you got to get a medical

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.990
education

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.460
i mean there's certain professions
worded

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.190
not be any way around

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.980
spending a fair amount of money and
getting in debt to some degree has been

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.010
going to make that decision yourself but
certainly try to minimize it

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.350
and uh...

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.160
uh... and i was sort of i would have
figured out

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.080
how i would

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.490
campbell that debt

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.270
and say a five-year period after i got
out of school where i would think twice

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.970
about incurring

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.789
there's a question up here if we can
bring a microphone

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:17.649
uh... managed hong kong come here every
single minute advisory council

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:22.000
uh... what advice would you have for a
forming nonprofit organization

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.470
performing a non-profit organization

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:30.370
always tried to avoid form a non-profit
organization

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.620
well i i would bet would depend entirely
what a lot wanted accomplish i mean

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.230
uh... you know it could be one there was
a hospital and another thing

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.830
uh... it over

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.750
visitors and are so many types of it so
i

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.789
you know you've got to get people that
are

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:46.400
better experienced in involved

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.670
uh...

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.110
internet idea like that and uh...

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.460
uh... but uh... the defense so much on
that

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.280
on the objectivity

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.330
you're working at

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.870
down promises shown here

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.620
microphone for a long time

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.950
i mean carhartt right-hand nine west
high school

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.410
and engineer very speedy involved an
airplane hampering inclined he think

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.230
that is very individual and my headline

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.000
you know i wouldn't say that i am not
and i i do certain subject and i think i

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.389
think

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:24.330
europe your model as a citizen for
example and all of the walrus god and he

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.070
is

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.790
far more so that were involved

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.559
but i am and uh...

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:31.779
incident his predecessor peter came it
was too but warmers carried it to new

00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:33.130
heights so i

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.810
uh... i don't want to

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.510
uh... on any mammal for that myself i do
some things uh...

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.860
uh...

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.419
one of the problems i have that love
what i do so much that uh...

00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:46.710
that'd be a sort of takes over and i'm
like a

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.550
uh... guy that likes to play a lot of
offer some things that the liked i liked

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.190
the business i'm in

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.169
uh... i've got a family

00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:56.280
district very actively uh...

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.220
uh... some my children were

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.210
worked on

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.390
almost anything that comes along in the
civic area and

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.590
you know it's

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.140
you do

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.920
and and people do what they want to meet
the criteria great and and uh...

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.400
uh...

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.490
i've never talked to anybody that

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:17.920
that enjoyed working in civic activities
that india with was very worthwhile

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.230
after they've done to build something
and

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.770
participating in building something
always

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:27.120
offline and acting head of the time we
have a golf tournament for example

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.290
september and

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.340
we raise some money for seventy beverage
a good time to nobody's paying any price

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.650
by doing i'm having a good time to
people come running a good time

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.500
and then we have to show almost two
people

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.929
you should be enjoying things you go on
and and you will want to work in civic

00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:45.290
activities that

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.670
but interesting that you do the same in
politics unconnected

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.380
you know if if you

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.810
if you get

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.980
if you find

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.460
political ideas drupal apart

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.770
or politicians who particularly

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:03.670
you down if i would really didn't get a
lot of self satisfaction out of

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.750
i working continue doing something
worthwhile so i

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:13.750
just just follow your instincts on that
uh... they my recommendation

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.790
okay

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:25.279
prime minister regret from the ritz out
by school

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:29.810
prided i guess the old beat youth of
today and i question

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.010
what do you see is the problem the
biggest economic problem facing

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.750
uh... visa today going into the future

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.160
now on

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.610
i don't think give that uh...

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.650
you're going to have enormous economic
problems i think you will live in a

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.510
society

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.650
where the average person

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.630
uh... lives better

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.530
by a significant margin

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.309
than the average one of the generation
earlier two generations earlier that's

00:33:56.309 --> 00:34:00.200
been the history of this country it's a
marvelous country that way

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.710
when you really have four and a half
percent of the world's population

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.070
you know and and

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.749
what's been accomplished years
incredible fifty three percent of them

00:34:08.749 --> 00:34:13.529
of the value of corporations that are
publicly traded in the world exists in

00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:16.189
the united states with four and a half
percent of population

00:34:16.189 --> 00:34:18.039
this country always

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:20.069
has done well isn't uh...

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:21.869
and they say in stocks

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:25.089
that you've got should buy stock in the
business is so good that even an idiot

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:25.989
can run it

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.799
because sooner or later one well and and

00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:32.039
that's not terrible advice lessons have
been sort of his used in this country

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:34.149
from time to time i mean we've

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:37.389
we'd have all these problems that have
come along if you look back on the ice

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.399
hundred years and was all the problems
this country is going to do

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:43.729
integrate a very long list in a lot of
people who focused on those problems of

00:34:43.729 --> 00:34:44.739
the time

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.240
have missed the bigger picture

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.649
and the bigger picture

00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:50.639
is that every generation was better than
the one before

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.649
and that's because of uh...

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:54.019
ice because of

00:34:54.019 --> 00:34:56.859
savings because they didn't enable
people

00:34:56.859 --> 00:35:00.709
to create new tools to do better things
as they go on as also

00:35:00.709 --> 00:35:02.539
due to an environment

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:07.089
that lets people realize their potential
to a greater degree than most other

00:35:07.089 --> 00:35:10.920
environments in the world it's far from
perfect i mean it's it's it's adult

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.469
partisan perfect

00:35:12.469 --> 00:35:14.689
but it is better than anything else

00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:17.209
around i mean in in this country

00:35:17.209 --> 00:35:18.529
uh... you've got

00:35:18.529 --> 00:35:21.969
you don't have some commissar something
running haiti

00:35:21.969 --> 00:35:25.170
you know the of a big business in this
country you've got a guy like jack welch

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.669
and and a fellow like jack welch makes

00:35:27.669 --> 00:35:30.149
a difference of might be

00:35:30.149 --> 00:35:33.869
in terms of the productivity of that
business over a period of decades and

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:35.679
productivity is whatever

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:38.799
is what causes the standard of living to
rise so anything that

00:35:38.799 --> 00:35:42.699
a system that throws up the jack welch
is of the world to run businesses

00:35:42.699 --> 00:35:47.249
is going to have an enormous advantage
over society that doesn't by heredity

00:35:47.249 --> 00:35:49.569
or the does it by government edict

00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:50.899
and we've got

00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.009
we're closer to that society

00:35:53.009 --> 00:35:57.399
that i've described in than than
anything than any other country and it's

00:35:57.399 --> 00:36:00.789
its lead do to great things and i will
continue to lead the great thing so i

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:01.500
think

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.879
i think you've got the best future

00:36:03.879 --> 00:36:06.889
uh... you know you don't face you don't
face a war

00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:08.910
and you've got a view that you've got a

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.319
a break

00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:12.129
uh... you've got a better

00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:13.309
uh...

00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:15.389
future in terms of

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:16.649
uh...

00:36:16.649 --> 00:36:18.740
achieving neutral rewards

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.669
than any

00:36:19.669 --> 00:36:21.749
generation in history so

00:36:21.749 --> 00:36:24.569
which encourage places

00:36:24.569 --> 00:36:31.569
when i get taken upon it by field no

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:40.659
don't

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.119
behind wilkins for millard west high
school

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:47.919
i was wondering if you or if you could
not speak for mister gates were afraid

00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:49.099
of

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:53.149
the impact of white u_k_ on the economy
were specifically the stock market bill

00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:56.700
and and i'm glad you indigestion bring
another day because i

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.869
i'm the last night in the world
understand that white too chaotic

00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:01.979
you know i don't know why this
microphones working i don't know you

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:03.869
know why lights go on a

00:37:03.869 --> 00:37:07.679
i flip on the switch of my television
and pray i mean i say that's all

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:09.569
it's all be i'm a bit

00:37:09.569 --> 00:37:13.249
i would say that's the smartest people i
know in that area

00:37:13.249 --> 00:37:15.029
uh... in large part

00:37:15.029 --> 00:37:18.469
think it's gonna be a non-event

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:21.380
in this country i don't think against
speak for the rest of the world but

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.209
uh...

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:24.639
uh... so i think uh...

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:26.759
i think you'll wake up on

00:37:26.759 --> 00:37:28.059
january

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:31.739

00:37:34.449 --> 00:37:37.969
checks for a billion dollars on december
thirty first and deposit them in

you you might find a lot of money to

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.469
your account but i wouldn't count on it
there

where we have that we had without a
college activity etc

uh... customers on pieces of airplanes
with us and we so we've got a hundred

00:37:57.779 --> 00:38:00.980
we got a hundred and sixty their planes
of some of our own flying around and be

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.119
very interesting to me to see

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:04.349
what p

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:05.399
advance

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:08.059
people on the cell at a time when their
money use it would be a very insincere

00:38:08.059 --> 00:38:09.159
many

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:10.359
sign up for

twelve oh one boat dealer

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:16.549

gamestop

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:32.079
and jeannie solace from clint bolick

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:36.549
house went and had a decidedly invested
time and money and

00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:40.929
yellow wine

00:38:40.929 --> 00:38:44.109
businesses that have good economics now
what what a good economics will good

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:46.259
economics or business that has

00:38:46.259 --> 00:38:49.539
some kind of a mold around that

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:53.509
makes its product or service search
location or something

00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:54.859
a little more time

00:38:54.859 --> 00:38:59.009
undesirable into the customer than any
other sort of comparable product

00:38:59.009 --> 00:39:00.379
uh...

00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:03.429
you know the number one candy bar in the
last thirty or forty years has been

00:39:03.429 --> 00:39:04.609
snickers

00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:07.399
people don't fool around with different
candy bars

00:39:07.399 --> 00:39:09.239
they fool around with different

00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:12.430
length dresses therefore on the yellow
kinds of things but they don't fool

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.879
around with candy bars

00:39:13.879 --> 00:39:16.909
because they figured we're going to lay
out fifty cents or whatever his input of

00:39:16.909 --> 00:39:18.379
their mouth and

00:39:18.379 --> 00:39:21.019
they're not going to run for fifty cents
a putting in your mouth looking at

00:39:21.019 --> 00:39:24.799
herself of competence of twelve forty
five cents and put something else i'm

00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:25.979
i'm also

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:28.019
you find that very stable

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:29.559
and we like businesses

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:30.460
that we think

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.439
we can figure out where they're going to
be in ten or fifteen years

00:39:33.439 --> 00:39:36.029
i don't know where the information
technology businesses are going to be in

00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:39.149
ten or fifteen years idler snickers bars
are going to be in ten or fifteen years

00:39:39.149 --> 00:39:41.550
are going to be selling just about the
spin on the way they do now

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.849
i don't worry please gum is going to be
in ten or fifteen years be is not to be

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:46.469
a lot of innovation

00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:48.389
in in insuring

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:51.819
uh... the ended internet soccer cause
people to put showing them a dominant

00:39:51.819 --> 00:39:52.959
least

00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:55.869
makes me think so but i don't accept but
uh...

00:39:55.869 --> 00:39:58.729
ob

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:01.269
it's predictability

00:40:01.269 --> 00:40:04.769
regarding the sustainability of a
competitive advantage some something

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.169
special about proc

00:40:06.169 --> 00:40:07.900
so we look for those kind of products

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.549
and then we look for people

00:40:09.549 --> 00:40:13.029
but running the business that are honest

00:40:13.029 --> 00:40:15.479
aane

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.499
clubs

00:40:16.499 --> 00:40:19.530
it's easier to find people hospitable
because the fine

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.099
businesses that are

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:24.179
going just a wonderful for a long period
of time

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:27.019
there are a business and look like a
rock star wonderful work

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:28.629
really about breyer over time

00:40:28.629 --> 00:40:30.390
but that's what we're looking for m

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.510
nice thing about it or not to find very
many

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.289
we find one a year

00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:36.739
that's terrific

00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:41.269
you don't need a hundred thousand great
investment ideas do well

00:40:41.269 --> 00:40:42.669
you need a couple

00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:45.309
and uh...

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:46.669
the discipline

00:40:46.669 --> 00:40:49.679
is the most important thing witty
brainpower

00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:51.639
with winnie discipline

00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:55.049
you don't need a hundred and fifty i_q_
to do what i do

00:40:55.049 --> 00:40:57.819
you know where you don't need a hundred
and forty you know they are in thirty

00:40:57.819 --> 00:41:01.109
five you may need a hundred and fifteen
or something like that and

00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:03.249
and but she did he disciplined

00:41:03.249 --> 00:41:04.649
you have to wait

00:41:04.649 --> 00:41:07.469
until you see the fat pitch to swing up

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:11.069
because investing is a noble called
strike game you know up if i were

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:12.419
baseball player

00:41:12.419 --> 00:41:14.309
and i only like pitches

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:16.199
two inches above my navel

00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:19.249
and all some guy could run out and he
could pitch may you know three or four

00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:21.920
inches below that i get called on
strikes because i've never find

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.049
officially

00:41:23.049 --> 00:41:25.479
you can get colorado strikes in baseball

00:41:25.479 --> 00:41:26.589
you have to

00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:30.319
you have to swing it pitches that you
you don't even necessarily like

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:33.279
degree after the county of san two
strikes

00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:34.539
in business

00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:37.129
units who had anything you can sit there
and

00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:40.459
the paper says general motors of sixty
years as john electrical a hundred and

00:41:40.459 --> 00:41:44.039
fifty years as general dynamics of sixty
three

00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:46.530
and if you'd like this prices you have
to swing you can wait there

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:50.839
day after day after day after day and
there are no called strikes

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:54.089
now when you swing when you decide to
buy something

00:41:54.089 --> 00:41:56.589
than enough you swing in this is just
right but he

00:41:56.589 --> 00:42:00.239
it's a marvelous came to the end because
there are no called strikes and you can

00:42:00.239 --> 00:42:01.399
simply wait

00:42:01.399 --> 00:42:04.159
for that one behind

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:05.829
for six months for a year

00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:07.129
two or three years

00:42:07.129 --> 00:42:09.420
when you really know what you're doing
where you like the price

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.439
we'd like the people running the
business

00:42:11.439 --> 00:42:14.809
and then you swing in the only need a
few swings in your lifetime

00:42:14.809 --> 00:42:17.869
uh... so that's the way we got a pic
businesses we try to stay with with

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:19.529
things we understand

00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:23.009
and that there can be all kinds of
wonderful investment opportunities out

00:42:23.009 --> 00:42:23.759
there

00:42:23.759 --> 00:42:26.709
but i don't understand i don't know what
cocoa beach are going to do next year

00:42:26.709 --> 00:42:28.849
you know maybe you know but i don't know
either

00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:33.319
i don't know what i don't know what
uh... crude oil stocks sell for

00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:34.889
i don't have to know

00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:36.510
it's just have to know all of the things

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.170
at the know what i know

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:42.199
pastor noel where the limits of maya
understanding hard

00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:43.079
what i call

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:45.439
what my circle conferences

00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:49.719
and finally able to evaluate five
percent of the businesses in the world

00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:53.779
no problem i just a within a five
percent and try and find something

00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:56.629
and that's most people get in trouble
because

00:42:56.629 --> 00:42:59.209
in investments because they

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.770
what we did a cheap and i look at the
support of salsa

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.670
they hear about other people making
money nothing upsets people so much of

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.399
their about their friends making money
cabinet

00:43:07.399 --> 00:43:10.669
that's very destructive to discipline
because i think i got smart guy next

00:43:10.669 --> 00:43:13.939
door neighbor's just bought that new car
with the money made trading stocks on

00:43:13.939 --> 00:43:15.879
the internet so i can die

00:43:15.879 --> 00:43:18.989
well the answers you cannot work dot you
will lose money for trade stocks

00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:20.130
actively

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.469
and uh...

00:43:21.469 --> 00:43:24.959
uh... it's it's hard to exercise at this
point

00:43:24.959 --> 00:43:26.949
but anytime you buy something

00:43:26.949 --> 00:43:28.779
you should be able to take out a

00:43:28.779 --> 00:43:31.079
one patient a paper

00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:35.549
i say i'm buying travel more assists
sixty-five i'm buying gallagher hundred

00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:36.120
fifty

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.549
because

00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:39.949
and you should write down the reasons

00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:41.589
to cancel out the sheet

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:44.369
it's because somebody told me about a
cocktail party last night that's not

00:43:44.369 --> 00:43:45.399
good enough

00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:48.959
because because my broker told me about
it that's not good enough

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:52.019
it's a you've got to have a reason

00:43:52.019 --> 00:43:54.390
for thinking that it makes an
intelligent investor you do the same

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:58.249
thing if you're buying a farm apartment
house provide apartments are by this

00:43:58.249 --> 00:43:59.309
parma

00:43:59.309 --> 00:44:02.889
thousand dollars an acre because i think
i can earn sixty dollars an acre on it

00:44:02.889 --> 00:44:06.399
if quan sells such-and-such destroyed
himself such-and-such should be able to

00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:07.659
such-and-such

00:44:07.659 --> 00:44:09.199
and you've figured out

00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:10.979
it's the same reason you're buying

00:44:10.979 --> 00:44:13.789
businesses and when you buy stocks
you're buying a little piece of the

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:14.919
business

00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:18.639
and as part of the most important thing
to remember and an interesting is that

00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:21.789
when you're buying a stock your vital
piece of the vote was sent

00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:24.879
if you're buying it had an attractive
price for the business for the whole

00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:25.709
business

00:44:25.709 --> 00:44:26.979
you donate money

00:44:26.979 --> 00:44:28.739
and if you aren't

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:35.739
over time you walk money

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:38.039
promote michael

00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:40.889
home reverend jackson jesse jackson
charges were there

00:44:40.889 --> 00:44:44.369
you seem to believe that the moral
standards astute today's society will

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:46.279
eventually affect this business

00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:50.039
how you feel this will affect us as
youth growing up in nine states he said

00:44:50.039 --> 00:44:52.470
the most important to stop

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.679
poetry institute

00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:55.610
opec disagrees

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.319
it's byo

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.979
you reunite

00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:00.789
well i think

00:45:00.789 --> 00:45:02.709
very difficult

00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:04.569
quantify

00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:07.379
moral standards overtime i mean at that

00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:11.329
you know you could give you pick out
huge weaknesses at any given time in

00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:12.819
terms of how

00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:17.389
before the country's behaving and and
and and and you'd strike so i think it's

00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:19.699
normally difficult to quantify

00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:21.190
uh... i think

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.599
by and large we have made

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:27.669
progress in what i would call
institutionalized moral standards

00:45:27.669 --> 00:45:29.039
in this country

00:45:29.039 --> 00:45:31.089
i mean the the the uh...

00:45:31.089 --> 00:45:35.369
uh... bell in terms of slavery in terms
of the uh... in terms of them in the

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:38.359
women women couldn't vote you know a
century ago at uh...

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:40.769
uh...

00:45:40.769 --> 00:45:44.200
half the country were second-class
citizens in that respect in a very and

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:44.630
they had

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:48.039
much lesser rights in terms of
inheritance and all kinds of things

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:49.579
uh...

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:51.549
the income tax

00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:53.409
uh...

00:45:53.409 --> 00:45:54.869
did exist

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:58.599
a hundred years ago so the idea of
taxing people according that

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:00.189
to how much the

00:46:00.189 --> 00:46:03.159
they've benefitted from society in their
income

00:46:03.159 --> 00:46:04.820
uh... didn't exist so

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.729
i think in terms of institutionalized
moral standards

00:46:08.729 --> 00:46:10.509
the country has made

00:46:10.509 --> 00:46:13.199
really quite significant progress uh...

00:46:13.199 --> 00:46:15.819
and uh... in the last hundred years i
think you know

00:46:15.819 --> 00:46:18.819
there's a nor must distance to go i
think we're going on the right direction

00:46:18.819 --> 00:46:21.129
maybe by fits and starts

00:46:21.129 --> 00:46:24.729
but i think we're going to write
correction and i think

00:46:24.729 --> 00:46:25.879
uh...

00:46:25.879 --> 00:46:28.649
you know that there is that there will
be a

00:46:28.649 --> 00:46:31.969
it will be a significant costs everybody
in this role as they live in a more

00:46:31.969 --> 00:46:35.439
moral society forty years from now than
callosum although i think the odds are

00:46:35.439 --> 00:46:36.679
that they will

00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:39.839
i think the country moves in that
direction very difficult to do it

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.559
all kinds of interested

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:43.369
work against that but

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:44.079
uh...

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:46.789
anne and i think the american people
want to

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:49.720
and then is sought civil rights manitoba

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.869
television to dramatize what was going
on in

00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:56.659
people don't want europe prefer not to
think about it

00:46:56.659 --> 00:47:00.170
it got through to the conscience of
uh... the american people

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:01.469
and uh...

00:47:01.469 --> 00:47:04.519
uh... allot of progress has been made
there and there's a lot left to be made

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:06.929
but they're it's better that i was

00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:09.919
and the pace may seem very slow to those
people involved and i can understand

00:47:09.919 --> 00:47:11.059
that

00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:12.239
uh...

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:13.029
the pace

00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:15.769
you know for woman's suffrage

00:47:15.769 --> 00:47:17.919
for decades and decades and decades

00:47:17.919 --> 00:47:19.719
woman could be on a jury

00:47:19.719 --> 00:47:22.649
that i was reading the trial part
sterile

00:47:22.649 --> 00:47:26.509
which took place in california of
nineteen oh ten or eleven

00:47:26.509 --> 00:47:30.949
uh... there were no women on the jury
that one was in a lot of the behavior

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:32.739
we're citizens in that sense

00:47:32.739 --> 00:47:33.839
so it's

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.359
the moral

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:38.549
behavior of the country has my view

00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:40.859
improved but it uh...

00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:41.970
uh... them up

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.760
and it'll continue to improve and i hope
you all in this room do your part to

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:51.760
help approach

00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:55.769
matures from central high

00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:57.789
and uh...

00:47:57.789 --> 00:48:01.699
wondering how us into stock market so
high right now

00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:03.479
would be smart for us to give

00:48:03.479 --> 00:48:05.759
to get involved now are to wait till

00:48:05.759 --> 00:48:08.979
trickles down a little

00:48:08.979 --> 00:48:12.309
yeah i can tell you whether or not to
buy stocks dot generally

00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:14.200
i think it's important that you save
money

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.719
at on what they want to put the stock
market out there dept

00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:20.329
i don't think is

00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:23.869
terribly important i think if your
interested stocks

00:48:23.869 --> 00:48:27.129
issued by a and you've got a couple you
should buy if you i mean i i don't get

00:48:27.129 --> 00:48:28.839
any way of running about them

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:32.309
better than x printing it when im papers
with the same

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:35.999
i can guarantee you if you lose money on
paper lose real money it's a different

00:48:35.999 --> 00:48:38.999
experience and uh...

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:43.969
i am so i i i think they're think you'll
learn more about yourself

00:48:43.969 --> 00:48:44.889
uh...

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:47.379
if you do it that way i bought my first
arc

00:48:47.379 --> 00:48:50.419
when i was eleven i was actually a
liberal some of the time and by about

00:48:50.419 --> 00:48:54.149
three shares of city service preferred

00:48:54.149 --> 00:48:55.559
thirty-eight panna

00:48:55.559 --> 00:48:58.649
went down to twenty seven which
something i still remember even has a

00:48:58.649 --> 00:48:59.939
lot of time

00:48:59.939 --> 00:49:03.449
uh... and then a lot of four and i sold
at i'm a five bucks

00:49:03.449 --> 00:49:06.609
on my free shares after commissions and
then i went to two hundred and something

00:49:06.609 --> 00:49:08.069
so

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:11.049
you know i i i probably remember that a
little better if i'd been doing it on

00:49:11.049 --> 00:49:13.659
paper it

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:16.939
i thought we were on doing a lot of
things between about age eleven and

00:49:16.939 --> 00:49:20.369
nineteen in the stock market i did
shortsighted all kinds of

00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:25.109
technical analysis i've read every book
i could get on the subject

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:30.299
i didn't do that well i can do terrible
but but i patted agree just while rob

00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:31.499
but bite

00:49:31.499 --> 00:49:34.930
that meant by the age of nineteen when i
read ben graham spoke of the universe

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.399
depressed him like that

00:49:36.399 --> 00:49:39.709
i went and bought this book called
intelligent buster just come out

00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:42.069
and i had an enormous impact on me

00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:43.929
now if i had done

00:49:43.929 --> 00:49:46.789
in the previous eight years i've got all
over the lot

00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:50.129
i'm not so sure that that book where the
sender background and i was by that time

00:49:50.129 --> 00:49:52.139
i was prepared

00:49:52.139 --> 00:49:55.390
to read and read was book which changed
my life and actually

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.679
the incredible life

00:49:57.679 --> 00:49:58.799
uh...

00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:03.249
uh... i wouldn't be a part of the if i
had written a book

00:50:03.249 --> 00:50:06.949
part of life is getting

00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:09.599
when something does happen that's
significant

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:10.969
you can call us

00:50:10.969 --> 00:50:14.179
the significance of it and know what to
do with it

00:50:14.179 --> 00:50:16.959
i would say that first eight years
before her out

00:50:16.959 --> 00:50:19.589
it without produced nothing financially
to speak of

00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:20.500
uh...

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.519
produced a lot in terms of getting my
mind preparer

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:26.599
but what i really didn't read something
that makes sense so i was ready to

00:50:26.599 --> 00:50:27.719
accept that

00:50:27.719 --> 00:50:29.799
and i actually went back in

00:50:29.799 --> 00:50:34.599
when to call me the study under the
under graham

00:50:34.599 --> 00:50:35.869
because of

00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:38.939
of reading that book of all kinds of
things flowed out of itself

00:50:38.939 --> 00:50:42.289
i would encourage you if you're
interested in the field

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:46.019
uh...

00:50:46.019 --> 00:50:49.260
to do a few things but so far but it was
intelligence possible

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.720
i would try to stick with things

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.390
businesses i thought i understood

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.389
but still get out that sheet of paper

00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:56.819
and i'd read i'm doing this because

00:50:56.819 --> 00:51:00.519
and just trust my reasoning that i go
back and review the year later on

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:03.889
and see whether what you thought would
be true turned out to be true

00:51:03.889 --> 00:51:05.919
so i would always checked myself

00:51:05.919 --> 00:51:09.649
i believe in grading myself on
everything of doctors have post-mortems

00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:12.919
and they they do it because they were on
from post-mortems

00:51:12.919 --> 00:51:16.149
uh... and business people don't like to
do postmarked when im all i'm i can be

00:51:16.149 --> 00:51:20.089
on the board of the company

00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:22.129
building plants are buying companies

00:51:22.129 --> 00:51:23.909
and everyone two years later

00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:26.609
tour i check out how the decision turned
out does it

00:51:26.609 --> 00:51:28.680
they can be unpleasant

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.089
but you learn from post-mortems

00:51:31.089 --> 00:51:32.169
and uh...

00:51:32.169 --> 00:51:35.099
you don't wanna learn we burn from other
people's mistakes in your own this

00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:37.639
pattern from a few of your own to and
uh...

00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:41.729
the time to do it is when you're young

00:51:41.729 --> 00:51:43.759
you can do maybe one more

00:51:43.759 --> 00:51:45.780
direct assault wonderware

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.739
maybe maybe two more p

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:52.009
well my name is pete wilson from craig
improv

00:51:52.009 --> 00:51:53.389
my question is

00:51:53.389 --> 00:51:56.410
toward extent do you feel that the
government

00:51:56.410 --> 00:52:00.440
with uh... the current policies of
welfare and social security is it

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.619
financially competent and physically
prepared

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:06.809
for the future

00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:09.809
i think i think that

00:52:09.809 --> 00:52:12.029
the country as a whole is quite

00:52:12.029 --> 00:52:15.229
quite well prepared for the future of
that doesn't mean that

00:52:15.229 --> 00:52:18.389
with about every policy they have but

00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:19.769
uh...

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:20.650
i think

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.859
eight we have an enormously rich society

00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:26.139
and want to reverse a site and they'll
get richer

00:52:26.139 --> 00:52:29.169
uh... everyone isn't going to
participate in that somewhat will

00:52:29.169 --> 00:52:30.789
participate because of

00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:33.949
physical disabilities either because a
mental disabilities other because of

00:52:33.949 --> 00:52:38.259
shortcomings in the education they
receive winner dr all kinds of reasons

00:52:38.259 --> 00:52:41.369
we have a prosperous in our society

00:52:41.369 --> 00:52:42.899
to be able to take care of

00:52:42.899 --> 00:52:44.379
of those people

00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:45.630
and we should take care of them

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.490
and how we do what so that they feel
most useful in life and how we do it so

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.090
that we continue to encourage people to
be more productive themselves all that i

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.219
mean those are

00:52:54.219 --> 00:52:56.049
that easy questions but

00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:59.399
but that shouldn't take our i'd off the
wall of feeling we should do something

00:52:59.399 --> 00:53:01.099
about it that uh...

00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:04.819
uh... opt-in i'd put my pose this
problem sometimes the people i say let's

00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:08.660
assume that it's twenty four hours
before you're born

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.019
all of you can take the steps twenty
four hours before it went

00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:14.649
and then she comes to you

00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:17.149
and the genie says

00:53:17.149 --> 00:53:20.699
overdrew their again out there

00:53:20.699 --> 00:53:22.809
will call you go

00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:24.769
and the jenny says job

00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:26.889
as you look pretty promising to make

00:53:26.889 --> 00:53:30.049
i think you've got kind of a sense of
fair play in

00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:31.359
at a good mind

00:53:31.359 --> 00:53:35.659
and so i'm gonna let you have an
extraordinary opportunity

00:53:35.659 --> 00:53:39.419
i'm going to let you designed the world
into what you're going to be born in

00:53:39.419 --> 00:53:41.189
twenty four hours

00:53:41.189 --> 00:53:42.549
it's yours

00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:44.539
you pick out the political rules

00:53:44.539 --> 00:53:46.679
you pick up the economic rules

00:53:46.679 --> 00:53:50.449
you pick up the social rules you
designed the world

00:53:50.449 --> 00:53:55.069
and we're more than twenty four hours
you're going to be one that i world

00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:58.089
and that's the world standing just for
your lifetime

00:53:58.089 --> 00:54:01.899
for your children's lifetime fairground
shorts lifetime

00:54:01.899 --> 00:54:05.439
and you having or some of the genie
jokes in the past would say

00:54:05.439 --> 00:54:07.199
what's the catch

00:54:07.199 --> 00:54:10.789
and jenny said well it's a very slight
catch

00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:14.140
soon went when you're born in twenty
four hours you're going to emerge in

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.019
this world you designed

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:18.089
but what you don't know

00:54:18.089 --> 00:54:20.349
is whether you're going to be born

00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:22.119
black or white

00:54:22.119 --> 00:54:23.949
male or female

00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:25.569
rich or poor

00:54:25.569 --> 00:54:27.619
brighter retarded

00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:29.609
able-bodied or infirm

00:54:29.609 --> 00:54:32.439
in the united states or afghanistan

00:54:32.439 --> 00:54:34.349
all you know

00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:36.380
is that you're going to reach into this

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.649
barrel which now has six billion bowles
was withheld representing one person

00:54:40.649 --> 00:54:42.010
every person in the world

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:45.579
and you're going to participate in what
i call the ovarian lottery

00:54:45.579 --> 00:54:49.889
you can take one bought a rubber never
get another book that u

00:54:49.889 --> 00:54:52.169
area one ball not even a merchant

00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:54.149
now what kind of rules

00:54:54.149 --> 00:54:56.489
do you wanna have for that society

00:54:56.489 --> 00:54:59.499
not knowing which ball you're gonna get

00:54:59.499 --> 00:55:00.520
now that night

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.119
but deal with the way

00:55:02.119 --> 00:55:03.859
i think people should think about

00:55:03.859 --> 00:55:06.839
social policy and if you're born if
you're lucky enough to be born this

00:55:06.839 --> 00:55:09.900
country you've won the lottery already

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.559
we should have a system in my view

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:16.429
that encourages the jack welch is in the
bill gates is an all out to work

00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:20.369
far beyond the time when it has any
economic significance to m we want

00:55:20.369 --> 00:55:23.089
people commanding those resources

00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:26.529
extremely able the commanding the mets
house pets have a how the standard of

00:55:26.529 --> 00:55:27.959
living moves forward

00:55:27.959 --> 00:55:29.279
so we should want

00:55:29.279 --> 00:55:31.269
you know we should one tom osborne

00:55:31.269 --> 00:55:35.339
go to nebraska we should want we should
want bill gates designing software and

00:55:35.339 --> 00:55:39.150
we don't want a mix up those two hundred
well i wouldn't want to go coaching in

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.329
the press kit uh... sold

00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:43.719
you what do you want people fill out a
system that

00:55:43.719 --> 00:55:44.800
directs

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.619
gets people other potential m

00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:47.959
and puts them

00:55:47.959 --> 00:55:51.099
in the position where they can do the
most good for society

00:55:51.099 --> 00:55:53.530
which also wanna system for the people
get the wrong lol

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:55.889
timing somebody's going to get the ball

00:55:55.889 --> 00:55:59.039
you know that says eighty i'd kill some
is gonna get the ball

00:55:59.039 --> 00:56:03.119
that says this is easier that disease
early in life to cripple zone

00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:05.719
and we've got a rich in our society

00:56:05.719 --> 00:56:10.189
that we can help we can take care of
those people and i think that

00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:13.599
if your question i think that this
society will move more and more in that

00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:16.489
direction it has the capability of
moving more and more in that direction

00:56:16.489 --> 00:56:18.309
as our resources

00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:21.849
uh... and our output increases and i
think the

00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:24.989
it has the will to do that in a general
way although i can't say they've always

00:56:24.989 --> 00:56:28.959
been taught to fits and starts so their
is no shortage

00:56:28.959 --> 00:56:31.609
in the united states of resources

00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:34.329
there's no shortage of output

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:35.969
you have to have a system

00:56:35.969 --> 00:56:37.969
that encourages people

00:56:37.969 --> 00:56:40.060
to behaved to the limit of their

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.489
abilities and puts them in the right
place

00:56:42.489 --> 00:56:46.089
but then you have to make sure that
everybody gets taken care of two

00:56:46.089 --> 00:56:50.509
now we can do one more and then we will
break

00:56:50.509 --> 00:56:52.759
put this all over the microphone woman
here

00:56:52.759 --> 00:56:57.150
make the decision

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:59.959
hyman's bengal were going on solid

00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:04.319
and i wanna know how you can to media of
extra-large in other places

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:05.249
months

00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:08.769
small question uh...

00:57:08.769 --> 00:57:10.779
well but obviously does

00:57:10.779 --> 00:57:12.119
simply because it's

00:57:12.119 --> 00:57:14.569
is move so far technologically

00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:18.379
is it's brought it together yahoo and i
was over china two years ago when i was

00:57:18.379 --> 00:57:21.049

the chinese

00:57:26.379 --> 00:57:28.729
coverage

00:57:28.729 --> 00:57:31.039
of that conference a and of course it

00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:34.129
it had nothing to do and what was taking
place but the internet was coming and

00:57:34.129 --> 00:57:35.599
and and

00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:37.149
you know you couldn't

00:57:37.149 --> 00:57:38.619

times and i i get the washington post at

00:57:41.979 --> 00:57:43.679

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.299
next day on untrue through physical
delivery but i'd buy electronic delivery

00:57:50.299 --> 00:57:51.579
i can read it

00:57:51.579 --> 00:57:56.959
uh... denver bali earlier the most
people in washington to repeat itself

00:57:56.959 --> 00:57:59.189
ability to communicate

00:57:59.189 --> 00:58:02.309
and the degree to which the world that
have awareness of what's going on every

00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:04.449
place in the world is just

00:58:04.449 --> 00:58:08.149
you know it's been applied only

00:58:08.149 --> 00:58:13.619
and that will help that they wrote them
a lot of things that come out of that

00:58:13.619 --> 00:58:16.919
there plus overtime but that they have
been a b

00:58:16.919 --> 00:58:20.699
the ability of information to be
available to everyone

00:58:20.699 --> 00:58:24.009
worldwide almost instantly
instantaneously its

00:58:24.009 --> 00:58:29.049
it's it's it's to be huge advances and
things like medicine for example justice

00:58:29.049 --> 00:58:31.419
uh...

00:58:31.419 --> 00:58:34.189
it's it's it's a net plus it has a

00:58:34.189 --> 00:58:37.049
it has a big affected

00:58:37.049 --> 00:58:40.329
the definition of media has now been
expanded

00:58:40.329 --> 00:58:43.639
anonymously i mean there were three
television networks and

00:58:43.639 --> 00:58:46.989
in the nineteen and you know in the
early nineteen sixties and that was that

00:58:46.989 --> 00:58:51.469
there were three highways information
traveled electronically

00:58:51.469 --> 00:58:54.900
if the three piece of information were i
love lucy and i want something else and

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.969
something else those with the three
choices of information or entertainment

00:58:57.969 --> 00:58:59.439
that you had

00:58:59.439 --> 00:59:03.219
first tens and tens of millions of
people selling their looking at it too

00:59:03.219 --> 00:59:06.519
now it's unlimited and that's only for
three or so decades so

00:59:06.519 --> 00:59:09.539
it's just exploded and it'll continue to
explore them

00:59:09.539 --> 00:59:11.499
