00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Rockets...
hurling space probes deep into

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.120
the cosmos.
Sound waves... compelling solid

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.380
objects to float in midair.
Laser beams... vaporizing

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.920
targets with pinpoint accuracy.
Are these stunning examples of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.580
mankind's modern technology?
Or are they merely recent

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.880
incarnations of scientific
achievements that have roots

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.790
stretching back to the ancient
past?

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.540
&gt;&gt; JASON MARTELL: We have
several cultures who depict

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.290
modern technology being used
thousands of years ago.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.830
&gt;&gt; PHILIP COPPENS: They were
working with technology that

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.830
could literally break the Earth
in two.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.080
&gt;&gt; DAVID CHILDRESS: How could
they have had these advanced

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.250
weapons that we've only just
acquired ourselves today?

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.210
&gt;&gt; GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Something
in our past has been lost, and

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.920
we're looking for that answer.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Millions of people

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.500
around the world believe we have
been visited in the past by

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.330
extraterrestrial beings.
What if it were true?

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Did ancient aliens really help
to shape our history?

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.830
And did mankind's cutting-edge
technology spring from our

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.500
imagination, or could it have
come from a source much farther

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.170
away?

&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the early

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.670
morning hours of November 5,
2005, the luxury cruise ship

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.210
the <i>Seabourn Spirit </i>found
itself under attack by pirates

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.250
in the waters off the coast
of Somalia.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.420
But the Somali bandits were
successfully repelled by a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.500
relatively new and formidable
defensive weapon: a Long Range

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.790
Acoustic Device or LRAD.
Manufactured by the LRAD

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.170
Corporation, this sonic device
can, when focused on a target,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.920
produce a piercing sound that
can exceed 150 decibels-- enough

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.920
to cause temporary blindness,
nausea and permanent hearing

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.920
loss.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: The U.S. Army used

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.830
sonic weapons in Iraq.
They're used in crowd control.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.380
There are certain types of low
rumbles and signals that will

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.330
affect a person.
They make you feel sick.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The LRAD is
currently used by law

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.250
enforcement, the military and
private security, and is

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.290
considered the ultimate in
sonic weaponry.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.750
(high-pitched ringing)
But is the LRAD really a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.880
21st-century invention?
Or is there evidence that

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.920
similar audio weapons existed
in ancient times?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.580
Approximately 17 miles northeast
of Jerusalem lies the ancient

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.000
ruins of the city of Jericho.
Here, archaeologists have

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.880
uncovered evidence of
settlements dating back

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.580
to 9000 BC.
According to the Hebrew Bible,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.540
Jericho is believed to be
where God spoke to Joshua,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.500
the successor to Moses,
and instructed him to march

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.670
around the walled city once
every six days with seven

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.830
priests carrying rams' horns
and followed by the Ark of the

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.710
Covenant, the golden chest
containing the Ten Commandments.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.290
Then, on the seventh day, under
orders by God, Joshua and the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.670
Israelites marched around the
perimeter of the city one last

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.380
time.
(horns blowing)

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.330
But this time, they blew the
rams' horns.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.580
The walls of Jericho fell...
and the city was sacked.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
&gt;&gt; DAVID WILCOCK: In the Old
Testament, you see very clear

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.330
descriptions in Joshua 6 about
the shofar, which is described

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.540
as a trumpet that was used in
the Battle of Jericho to

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.830
actually bring the walls down.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To religious

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.540
scholars, the collapse of
Jericho's walls was a miracle.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.170
To most modern day scientists
and historians, the destruction

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.460
was most probably caused by
an earthquake.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.000
But could it have been
something else?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.790
Could the Israelites have
possessed advanced sound wave

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.290
technology?
If so, where did it come from?

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.000
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN YOUNG: In the
scriptures, we have a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.960
fascinating story about the
fall of the walls of Jericho.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.540
The armies were told to circle
the wall repeatedly, and then

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.540
finally blow their horns, and
down came the walls.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.170
And we know there was a
powerful presence.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.000
The Ark of the Covenant, this
mysterious, sacred item, was

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.460
with them at all times, which,
of course, was part of the event

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.000
and part of the fall of the
walls of Jericho.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.210
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: The idea that
some kind of sonic weapon was

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.500
used to destroy these huge,
thick, ancient walls to allow

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.750
the Israelites to basically
take over that city is a

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.580
fascinating one.
So what kind of technology were

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.210
they using?
It sounds utterly fantastic to

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.170
us that they could have had some
kind of advanced alien

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.750
technology.
It's clearly what they're

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.750
describing.
&gt;&gt; TUDOR PARFITT: There is

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.000
little doubt that the Ark of
the Covenant was a weapon.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.580
It was described as a weapon,
famously, when the Israelites

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.170
crossed over into Canaan and
they had to pass by Jericho.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.000
And it could be that there was
some technology.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.920
We do not know what that
technology was, but there was

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.710
clearly an association between
the Ark and the falling down of

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.040
the walls, and that's the reason
that the Ark was sent around

00:06:51.040 --> 00:07:00.210
the periphery of the city.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to many

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.000
ancient astronaut theorists,
Moses and the Israelites

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.420
acquired a supernatural source
of energy at Mount Sinai.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.920
This powerful energy source was
later contained in the Ark of

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.170
the Covenant, and would have
provided the kind of power

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.500
necessary to amplify Joshua's
horns and make them into a

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.830
powerful sonic weapon.
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: What's interesting

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.330
about the Battle of Jericho is
that this particular use of the

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.080
shofar clearly seems to be the
same thing that we're seeing

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.330
with particle beam technology,
death ray technology,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.250
thunderbolt technology.
It very clearly seems that once

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.830
again we have an
extraterrestrial technology

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.040
that the ancient people had at
the ready that they could use

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.040
when needed for military
campaigns.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But even if the
Israelites possessed some sort

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.500
of advanced extraterrestrial
technology, could the amplified

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.290
sound of rams' horns really
bring down stone walls?

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.330
According to scientist and
former astronaut Professor

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.670
Taylor Wang, recent research
into the field of physical

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.080
acoustics suggests it is a
distinct possibility.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.170
&gt;&gt; TAYLOR WANG: Jericho's wall
breaking apart-- if you said it

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.120
has happened, caused by
acoustics, caused by sound...

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.620
well, the possibility has to be
somehow a resonance is built

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.080
in that wall.
It may not be the whole wall--

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.080
maybe some of the structure
material.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.170
When that resonance happens,
amplitude gets large enough,

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.880
yes, it could destroy almost
anything, because what the

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.170
resonance does is store
an enormous amount of energy.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.540
So you keep on, keep on feeding
it, eventually it shatters

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.210
everything.
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL DENNIN: When you want

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.920
to know how powerful sound is,
you have to realize that the

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.790
basic thing that sound is, is a
pressure wave, and it will come

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.830
down to the amount of energy you
put into your sound wave and

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.830
whether or not that particular
pressure wave you generate will

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.330
couple or impact the thing
you're trying to destroy.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.120
You can make it quite powerful,
'cause you can make a very high

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.540
amplitude, very large pressures
in the sound.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.000
It might be at a frequency or
amplitude where we no longer

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.750
hear it as sound, but from a
physics point of view, it is

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.000
still sound because it's a
pressure wave in the air.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.460
So it can get quite destructive,
if you put enough energy

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.960
into it.
You could also think of it as a

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.290
particle weapon because you're
moving air around, and you would

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.830
just need something to focus
the sound which we know

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.170
how to do.
So that would give you a

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:46.250
directed energy beam with sound.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if, as ancient

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.670
astronaut theorists suggest,
early civilizations had been

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:55.330
able to harness the power of
sound for destructive purposes,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.960
could there be evidence that
such technology might also have

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.420
been used for a more
constructive purpose?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.000
Might it help to explain the
existence of mammoth stone

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.500
structures whose construction
has baffled modern scientists

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:23.920
for centuries?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Mycenae.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.540
In the second millennium B.C.,
this ancient fortress city

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.880
dominated much of
southern Greece.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.210
Here, fortifications were built
in a style known as

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.880
"cyclopean masonry,"
where huge limestone

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.210
boulders were fitted tightly
together without the use

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:50.670
of mortar.
The term "cyclopean" refers to

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.880
the fact that-- according to
ancient myths-- these

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.420
Mycenaean fortifications were
thought to be the work of a

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:03.080
strong, one-eyed race of giants
known as the Cyclopes.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.040
&gt;&gt; PHILIP COPPENS: When you look
at Mycenae in Greece, you're

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.460
confronted with an anomalous
civilization, really.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.880
It is a city which people who
looked at it said, "Only the

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.670
Cyclops could have built this."
The Cyclops is, perhaps not by

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.670
coincidence, a mythical
creature.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.830
So we really are confronted
with the fact that people are

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.830
saying mankind could not have
built this.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.580
It has to have been something
above, or other than man, who

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.420
has constructed these walls.
And when you look at the fact

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.380
that tons and tons and tons of
stones have been used in a way

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.880
that really defies,
almost, gravity...

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.250
and I think that's why we have
to say that Mycenae is

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.460
definitely beyond human
capability of that specific

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.580
time and that specific period
in Greek history.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.880
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: In Mycenae, Greece
there is what's called the

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.290
"Treasury of Atreus."
And right in there, there is

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.830
one stone that has been hoisted
over the entrance of that

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:12.580
treasury, and it weighs an
estimated 250 tons.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.250
It is perfect.
Just unbelievable.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.380
Now, we would have difficulties
today moving that stuff around.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.170
Now, I'm not saying that we
today cannot do it.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.420
I'm not saying that, but if
we're struggling with our

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.170
modern technology, is it really
logical to suggest that our

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.710
ancestors did this with pivots,
and with little ropes, and with

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.920
wooden rollers?
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL BARA: You look at all

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.210
these ancient structures all
over the world: Mayan

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.500
structures, pyramids,
Greek temples.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.290
You see all of these... these
blocks that are not only

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.460
enormous, it would be
impossible to move them around

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.210
with anything but even our best
technology today.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.750
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: One of the great
enigmas of the megalithic

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.380
buildings around the world is
that in many cases they're

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.750
built with such large and heavy
granite or basalt stones.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:18.420
Even giant cranes would barely
be useful to lift some of these

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.790
really large stones, such as
the stones at Baalbek in

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:28.210
Lebanon, where you have just
mind-bogglingly huge stones

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:33.580
that weigh, in some cases, over
a thousand tons.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.210
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But just how could
ancient man have built such

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.880
colossal structures?
Were the stones really moved by

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.960
beings with superhuman strength?
Or might the builders have had

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.790
access to an advanced-- perhaps
alien-- technology?

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.210
For ancient astronaut
theorists, the key might be

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.040
found not by studying the
laws of physics, but by

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.040
exploring the interdisciplinary
science of acoustics and the

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.540
principle of acoustic
levitation.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.170
&gt;&gt; THOMAS VALONE: Acoustic
levitation is another way that

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.710
alien civilizations may have
influenced our history.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.500
And there is some evidence for
that, especially when you look

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.880
at some of the research that's
been done in acoustic

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.540
levitation here in laboratories.
(steady, high-pitched tone)

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.710
&gt;&gt; WANG: This system is a
acoustic positioning device, and

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.880
what happens inside, we create
an acoustic force field.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.790
The force field is pushing
everything toward the center.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.330
And the force field can rotate,
the force field can oscillate.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.210
This ball is fairly light
material.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.540
It's about ten grams, no more.
It's meant to be light.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.620
But if you want to move the
very heavy object, a large

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.750
object, what you really have to
develop in conjunction with the

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.960
acoustic positioning device, is
antigravity device.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.040
Because acoustic position
device, really meant to fine

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.040
tuning of the force field, but
the system must be force-free,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:22.380
otherwise it won't be budged.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But is it possible

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.040
that early builders had access
to the kind of acoustic

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.710
technology that would allow for
the transportation and careful

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:36.330
placement of mega-ton boulders
and stone blocks?

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.290
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe clues can be found in

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.540
the myths and tales of magic
handed down throughout time.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.040
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: There are many
ancient legends which suggest

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.960
that some of the monuments were
built with the help of acoustic

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.880
levitation.
What the local legend of

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.880
Stonehenge talks about is that
those big stones were

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.460
transported by way of
levitation by none other than

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.880
Merlin the wizard.
And he had a magical rod with

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.380
which he pointed at the stones,
and they would levitate and

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.210
position into place.
It's a very fascinating

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.920
story, because we know
that some of these stones

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.380
have been transported there
from as far away as 200 miles.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:36.380
And ancient legends are a
bridge to finding what truly

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.880
happened in our past.
&gt;&gt; BARA: There are lots of

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.120
stories of stones being
levitated, all using the power

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.210
of sound.
It's interesting as

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.040
you read these stories of magic,
that you see that they have to

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.670
use the chanting.
They have to chant certain

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.880
spells, certain words.
Certain vibrational frequencies

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.420
seem to create certain effects
in the physical realm.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.170
To me, it makes complete sense
that the use of a technology,

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.920
say, a magic wand of some kind,
would be some sort of amplifier.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.670
&gt;&gt; GEORGE NOORY: I mean, there's
no way that human beings, even

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.960
a hundred thousand of them,
could pull these things.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.710
They've done experiments by
putting hands around blocks.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.290
You can't get enough hands
in there.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.880
You can't get 200,000 hands to
lift a block.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.080
And once you roll it with all
these people, how do you

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.750
move it?
I think the technology had to

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.880
do with some kind of sound, and
they were able to just come up

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.750
with some antigravity, and just
move 'em into place.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.210
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But did ancient
aliens, using antigravity and

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.420
sonic levitation technology,
help early humans build the

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.750
ancient wonders of the world?
&gt;&gt; WANG: Well, everything's

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.000
possible.
We have no way to rule in or

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.380
rule out aliens, because human
technology is very primitive

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.540
at this stage.
And you look at Earth-- has

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.500
only survived four billion
years, but there are planets

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.790
billions and billions of years
ahead of us.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.290
Their technology and their
knowledge, it can be so far

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.580
ahead of us, we can't even
imagine.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if early
civilizations did possess the

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.460
ability to levitate large solid
objects, might they have also

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.580
possessed another even greater
ability?

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.250
Might they have also mastered
the power of flight?

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Flying saucers.
UFOs.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.000
Mainstream historians claim
sightings of these mysterious

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.460
craft are mostly a 20th-century
phenomenon.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.960
But according to ancient
astronaut theorists,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.620
unidentified flying objects
have been appearing in Earth's

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.420
skies since the dawn of man.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: Depictions of

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.670
flying saucers and what seems
to be some kind of ancient

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.000
spacecraft go back to some of
the earliest cave paintings

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.420
that we know of.
Scientists date these cave

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.330
paintings back to 20, 30,000
B.C.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:31.960
And these cave paintings are in
Russia, China, Africa, South

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.710
America and other areas.
And they appear to be some kind

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:43.460
of a spacecraft.
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: You can go back to

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.830
ancient Sumerian inscriptions
from Babylon, and you actually

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:53.460
see these discs with wings
around them and depictions of

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.420
people flying in them.
And you see the same thing in

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.960
Egypt where you see round discs
that have wings coming off them.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.830
What you're dealing with is,
most likely, actually a flying

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.880
saucer that's being seen up in
space.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.580
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Guatemala, Central
America.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.420
According to most mainstream
scholars and archaeologists,

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.670
the earliest human settlements
in this region date back over

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.920
14,000 years.
Here can be found numerous

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.620
ancient artifacts, and among
them is this one: the figure of

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.960
a man lying inside what appears
to be the shell of a turtle.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.670
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: And when I asked
the local archaeologist there,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.210
"What is this?" they said,
without the flinching of an eye,

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:55.670
"Well, this is, according to
legend, the giant flying turtles

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:01.830
which flew around in Guatemala."
The entire body is

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:07.080
aerodynamically fashioned.
The extremities are pressed in

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.620
an aerodynamic fashion against
the body of this turtle.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.790
And if you look closely, it's
as if there's some modern day

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.750
fighter pilot glasses or
goggles.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.750
This right here is from the
same culture, from the same

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.040
region where they created the
turtle in clay.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.170
So they knew exactly what a
turtle looked like.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:41.170
It looks like a snapping turtle.
And what we have here-- that is

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:47.000
everything but a turtle.
It's something else.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.790
In their frame of reference,
they were able to use the

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:56.380
turtle as the best example of
what they might have seen that

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:03.540
the gods used to fly around in.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Halfway around the

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.880
world, in 329 B.C., the Greek
ruler Alexander the Great

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.880
planned the invasion of India.
But according to ancient texts,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.750
his army was supposedly
thwarted by a strange attack

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.040
from the skies.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: As Alexander's

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.960
army was getting ready to cross
the Indus and invade India,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.750
suddenly in the sky appeared
these flying discs.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:37.040
And they began dive-bombing at
the war elephants that were

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.960
part of Alexander's army.
And what these flying discs did

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:48.000
was cause stampedes within
Alexander's own war elephants,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.960
who then ran amok throughout
his army, tearing up the camps

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.540
and everything.
And after that, Alexander's

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.830
generals met with him, and they
said, "No, we're not going into

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.920
India.
This is it.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.080
We're gonna turn back."
And that was the end of that war

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.790
campaign.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But whether in

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.580
ancient times or much more
recently, so-called flying

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.540
saucers are often described as
being unaffected by gravity or

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.120
the basic laws of physics.
&gt;&gt; STEVEN GREER: You know, I

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.330
know that people who have, who
have seen, uh, extraterrestrial

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.830
vehicles in modern times have
said, "How in the world could it

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.040
be doing that?"
For example, it's moving

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.120
through the sky, and it's going
20,000 miles per hour, and makes

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.210
a right-hand turn without
decelerating-- that isn't

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:42.580
possible using normal
aerodynamics.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.620
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: When jets have
been scrambled after flying

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.080
saucers, the saucers are
described as suddenly turning

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.790
at right angles at super speeds
and just zipping off in what

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.170
seems like impossible aerobatic
maneuvers.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.380
And this can be explained as
the kind of technology they're

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.000
using which is a gravity
control.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.710
It's artificial gravity.
So when you're inside of a

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.420
gravitational field that you're
creating yourself around your

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:22.420
craft, the gravity of the Earth
doesn't have a force on you.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But although
aircraft propulsion by means of

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.920
gravity manipulation is beyond
the limits of current

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.460
technology, many scientists
claim it is theoretically

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:42.120
possible.
In Davis, California,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.040
Canadian-born inventor Dr.
Paul Moller tests the

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.790
boundaries of real-life science
with a recreational flying

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:58.540
vehicle called the Neuera.
&gt;&gt; MOLLER: The Neuera is a very

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:06.250
simple device to fly.
It has eight lifting ducted

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:12.210
fans, as we call them, each one
driven by its own engine.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.170
One of the big advantages of
this kind of round shape is

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.830
that you end up with the
strength in the skin of the

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.830
vehicle itself, much like the
shell of a beetle.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.120
And that gets you a very, very
strong design.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.880
This-- air frames you see over
here next to this vehicle which

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.960
are similar to this, weigh only
75 pounds apiece, which is

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.120
incredible.
You get a complete airframe

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:39.040
that's capable of lifting 1,500
pounds with a 75-pound shell.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.080
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But could the
inherent design strength of a

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.380
disc-shaped object be the key
to overcoming the forces of

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.710
gravity?
And does the prevalence of

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.460
flying saucer sightings suggest
a connection between

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:59.170
antigravity technology and
extraterrestrial visitations?

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.620
&gt;&gt; MOLLER: Gravity is one of
the most unknown forces in

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.580
physics today, and when we do
understand it, we'll be able to

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.960
find out a way to shield
ourselves from it or to

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.380
provide a device, a method,
electromagnetically, but with

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.170
some much greater knowledge
than we have today, where we

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:20.250
eliminate it within the
vehicles' operations.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.750
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Although
antigravity devices in the

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.830
form of flying saucers may help
to explain how

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.750
extraterrestrials might have
been able to travel at

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.250
ultrahigh speeds, there is in
fact another means of

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.080
interplanetary transportation.
And it is one that humans, and

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.920
perhaps aliens, have been able
to use for centuries: the brute

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:50.620
force of rockets.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Merritt Island,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.120
Florida.
The Kennedy Space Center.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.580
Six Earth astronauts sit atop
NASA's <i>Endeavor </i>Space Shuttle

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.290
headed for orbit.
After countdown, three main

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.250
engines, together with two
solid rocket boosters, provide

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:13.380
the thrust to lift the orbiter
off the ground for its ascent.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.080
&gt;&gt; And liftoff of Shuttle
<i>Endeavor.</i>

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.540
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: I urge everyone
to be part one day of a

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.500
rocket launch, because it is a
life-altering moment.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.250
When you stand there, a few
miles away, you can still feel

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.500
the power as that rocket takes
off into space.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.960
A grumbling in your stomach,
the vibrations, and you can

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.710
hear the noise.
And it's a truly magnificent

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.540
sight and awe-inspiring.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But are manned

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.080
space flights really a recent
phenomenon?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:28:00.120
Or could our ancient ancestors
have witnessed similar events?

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.170
&gt;&gt; NOORY: There is no doubt
that if we thoroughly

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.670
investigate this planet, they
will find that this planet may

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.420
have already been to the moon
way before we went to the moon

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.380
with a man in 1969.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The interesting

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.290
thing is that we have the exact
same descriptions in ancient

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.790
texts and also in oral
traditions, where whenever

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:30.000
those quote, unquote "gods"
appeared, there was a lot of

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.540
smoke, a lot of fire, a lot of
noise, and the trembling of the

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.830
ground.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: When rockets are

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:43.960
taking off, it's best to stand
back and get out of the way.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.040
And that's a lot of what the
ancient legends are about, too.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.880
When the gods came and went, it
may well have been just these

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.790
rockets or other aerospace
vehicles landing and taking off

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.880
and making a lot of smoke and
noise.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.080
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But could early
man really have had knowledge

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.000
of rocket technology?
To make their case, ancient

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.250
astronaut theorists point to
numerous and consistent

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.670
descriptions of rockets found
throughout many cultures of the

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.790
ancient world.
&gt;&gt; GREER: When you're dealing

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.580
with this subject and you look
at the ancient literature, you

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.120
have to look at it through the
lens of how is it being

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.620
experienced by a civilization
with no foundation for

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.210
understanding the science, the
technology.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.670
And so I think, in ancient
times, there were people who had

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.330
encounters.
However, I think the way they

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.960
might have been reported
would've been in metaphors, in

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.420
ways that would have made sense
to them.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.960
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: In China, you have
these stories of dragons flying

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.080
through the air.
They make a lot of noise and

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.790
smoke comes out of them and
fire, just like a rocket.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.080
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The first emperor
of China descended in a fiery

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:09.080
dragon, with smoke and fire, and
whenever that dragon appeared,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.710
the earth was quaking and
everyone was afraid and-and

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.830
threw themselves to the ground.
Now, of course it wasn't a

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:22.040
dragon in a biological nature,
a living being.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.250
But it was a misinterpreted
machine.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.460
&gt;&gt; BARA: If you look at the
Greek gods, they were all

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.830
described as flying in on
chariots of fire.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.290
Well, a chariot of fire, to me,
seems very clearly like it's

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.540
some sort of rocket, probably
burning its retros as it lands

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.080
somewhere in ancient Greece.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: In the Old

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:53.000
Testament, we can read about a
glowing furnace that descended

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.420
from the sky.
And sometimes this glowing

00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:01.120
furnace is described as a
chariot of fire or as the glory

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.670
of the Lord.
So there are all these different

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.670
descriptions, which in the
ancient astronaut opinion

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:15.580
describe ancient rocketry.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: From 5000 to 2000

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.920
B.C., southern Mesopotamia was
home to the Sumerians, a highly

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.580
advanced civilization
considered to be among the

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.790
first astronomers.
Regarded as one of the oldest

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.580
written stories in history, <i>The
Epic of Gilgamesh </i>told of a

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.880
man's journey to the heavens to
meet the god Anu.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.000
&gt;&gt; ERICH VON DANIKEN: The
Gilgamesh epic, which goes back

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.460
to the Sumerian, that's a piece
where the hero, Gilgamesh, flies

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.250
over the Earth.
And he describes how the Earth

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.120
looks from above. Fascinating.
An old story of the first

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.670
flight.
&gt;&gt; MARTELL: The most ancient

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.380
civilization that we have on
record, the Sumerian culture,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.120
has left us evidence of what's
called a shem.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.540
And this object looks very
similar to a modern-day space

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.120
capsule that we place on top of
a rocket.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.960
And this shem is where priests
would go into the shem to

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.620
interact with the gods, or
anytime man was ascending or

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.960
descending into heaven.
So it's a very interesting term

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.960
used from a culture dating back
to 3800 B.C. and very clearly

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.960
matches the descriptions of a
modern-day rocket.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.250
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could early man
have actually possessed a

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.710
surprisingly sophisticated
understanding of what we now

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:45.830
call rocket propulsion?
In the first century A.D.,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.420
nearly 2,000 years before the
industrial revolution, a Greek

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.380
mathematician and engineer
named Hero created a

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.380
steam-powered engine he called
an aeolipile.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.080
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: One of the great
inventors of the ancient world

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.420
was the famous Hero of
Alexandria.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.120
He invented all kinds of stuff.
He actually invented what we

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.790
would describe as a rocket-type
motor.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.420
And really, something like this
is the beginnings of rocket

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.040
technology.
And we don't know where Hero got

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.170
many of his ideas, but it may
well have come from aliens.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.460
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: John Robert
Tindall, founder of Tindall

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.420
Vision Laboratories,
demonstrates a small-scale

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.670
replica of Hero's aeolipile.
&gt;&gt; TINDALL: Now, a conventional

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.290
steam engine that we think of
has pistons that get its power,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:47.620
but aeolipile uses these
opposing jets, so it's creating

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.460
thrust.
And rather than a thrust in...

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.460
like, a rocket would use it in
a linear fashion,

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.040
this is causing a rotational
effect, and there's your steam

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.620
turbine, really, working off of
thrust.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.960
Now this is operating much as
it did in the first century A.D.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.500
This is generally considered to
be the first working steam

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.750
engine.
It works more like a turbine

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.290
than a classic steam engine
with pistons, but it's very

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.750
significant because it really
is taking-- whoa!-- a compressed

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.420
gas (chuckles) and turning it
into energy.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.210
Wow!
That has a lot of energy, steam.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The name for
Hero's steam rocket engine,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.500
"aeolipile," translates to "the
ball of Aeolus."

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.620
In Greek mythology, Aeolus was
the god of the winds.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.960
Is it possible that Hero drew
inspiration for his invention

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.670
from the stories of the gods,
such as those found in Homer's

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:52.830
<i>The Odyssey?</i>
Or might he have had help from

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.380
the gods themselves?
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: Some have

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.250
suggested that it was alien
intervention, that aliens

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:01.620
taught him how to build this
machine.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:06.420
However, I'm leaning more
towards the idea that he looked

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.380
at older texts from previous
generations and that the source

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:17.290
of the idea of how to build
this did come from

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:22.170
extraterrestrials, but from way
before he was alive, and he

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:27.040
just came across those texts.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But do the

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.420
descriptions of rockets and
otherworldly devices found in

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.500
ancient texts and legends
provide evidence of

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.290
extraterrestrial encounters in
the distant past?

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.460
Perhaps the answer
will be discovered in an

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:47.000
unlikely place... in the hands
of the U.S. military.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: May 2010... off the
coast of California.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.540
A powerful new weapon shoots
down unmanned aerial drones

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.460
during secret testing carried
out by the U.S. Navy.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.880
Firing from a warship at a
distance of nearly two miles,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.920
a ray of intense laser energy
burns through targets traveling

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.380
at speeds of more than 300
miles per hour.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:25.080
But is it possible that such
so-called "death rays" could

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.880
have been used before?
Perhaps in ancient times?

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.580
&gt;&gt; GREER: I'm quite convinced
that there have been in the past

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.040
advanced civilizations on Earth
that did have such things as

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.420
the so-called death ray.
Whether it was used as a

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.170
weapon, or whether it was just
observed being used is a very,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:51.040
very open question.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 214 B.C., Greeks

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.040
living in the Sicilian city of
Syracuse prepared for an attack

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.210
by a fleet of Roman warships.
Though outnumbered by a

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.330
superior military force,
ancient texts suggest that

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:09.120
Syracuse was well-defended by a
mysterious and powerful new

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.880
weapon.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: Probably the most

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.380
famous ancient death ray was
the one that was built by the

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.330
Greek inventor Archimedes.
He was able to create this

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:29.000
giant mirror and parabolic disc,
and focus the sun's rays on the

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.710
fleet and set these ships
on fire.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:38.210
So here we have what would be a
primitive kind of death ray

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:43.920
that really worked.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But how could

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.880
Archimedes have conceived such
a formidable weapon?

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.000
One far in advance of any
known at the time?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.540
Researchers suggest the
inventor may have drawn

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.460
inspiration from Greek myths
written nearly 600 years before

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.540
the Battle of Syracuse.
Myths that told the stories of

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.790
gods that brandished cosmic
weapons of incredible

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:12.880
destructive force.
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK If you look in the

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.540
Greek tradition they have a
very clear description of Zeus'

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:21.460
thunderbolt, which he was able
to point at people or at other

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.540
things that he wanted to
explode, hit the button, and

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.250
what they described as
lightning would come out and

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.250
create a fierce and terrible
explosion.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.120
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: When these ancient
gods, like Zeus, were to come

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:40.790
down from the sky in this
flurry of thunder and

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.790
lightning, and then get out of
their spacecraft, they were

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:50.540
perceived as gods.
These ancient aliens had

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.380
fantastic technology available
to them, a technology that

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:58.580
would've seemed like magic to
our primitive ancestors.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.880
So when these people came down
from the sky, and they had

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.500
advanced energy weapons, they
were like gods to our ancient

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.420
ancestors.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS It doesn't matter

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:15.170
where you go, but the gods were
always able to create thunder,

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:21.290
create lightning in a
controlled way.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.710
In ancient India we have the
gods holding the dorje

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:28.710
sometimes like this, and it
looks as if some type of a

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.830
directed energy beam comes
directly out of the front to

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:37.120
vanquish the enemy, to destroy
him, to incinerate him.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if death ray-
type weapons had been used in

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:47.830
ancient times, might there be
some sort of tangible proof?

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:53.170
Perhaps there is.
Here, scattered throughout

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.250
the Scottish countryside, can
be found numerous ancient ruins.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:01.210
Many appear to have been forts
or other enclosures dating

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:06.380
back thousands of years.
Remarkably, they also appear to

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.040
have been subjected to fire and
heat so intense it practically

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.920
turned the stone structures
into glass.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.540
It's a process more
scientifically known as

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.710
"vitrification."
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: Here you have these

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.710
stone buildings in which an
analysis of the outside comes

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:30.580
to the conclusion that they
were heated to over a thousand

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.380
degrees Celsius in temperature.
Conventional fire could not

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.540
have reached this heat.
You needed a sustained burn at

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.960
a thousand degrees Celsius for a
long period of time.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.420
Why is it that it's only these
forts that have this type of

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.620
charring where they're actually
glazed like pottery on

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.830
the outside?
Why is it that you don't see it

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.710
on the stones in the
surrounding area?

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.420
And even more interestingly, why
is it that so many of 'em are

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.040
concentrated into this one
little area in northern

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.880
Scotland?
I believe this is very clear

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.210
evidence of death rays
being used.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:10.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to Celtic
legend, there once was a god

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:16.250
named Lugh, also known as
"The Shining One," the sun god,

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:23.170
and the god of war.
Like the Greek god Zeus, Lugh

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:26.750
was said to wield a mighty
"magic spear" not unlike the

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:30.500
thunderbolts of his Greek
counterpart.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.420
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: We have many stories
of divinities who were powerful

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.210
figures who had weapons that
seemed extraordinary for

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:39.880
their time.
One was the great Celtic

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.250
divinity Lugh, who had a spear
that could spit fire and

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.960
lightning and do great damage.
It was an extraordinary weapon.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.880
We don't have a great deal of
detail about it, but it clearly

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.920
could dominate any situation
he got into.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.880
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: When battle was
near, Lugh would draw out his

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.620
spear, and it roared, and then
flashes of fire came out of it,

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.120
and it tore through the ranks of
the enemy.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.540
Never tired of
killing and slaying.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:17.210
It was one amazing weapon.
I mean, how else can we explain

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.710
all those numerous vitrified
forts where the surface of the

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:28.210
stone is as smooth as glass?
And these spots can only be

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:34.330
found in very concentrated
areas through northern Scotland.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.250
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Is it possible that
what the Celtic legends are

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:42.420
describing as Lugh is, in fact,
an alien general or other kind

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.040
of extraterrestrial leader in
possession of a devastating

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.210
weapon?
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: All these

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:53.460
descriptions of sophisticated
weaponry sounds almost like

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.120
science fiction.
But is it, really?

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.960
Because we have those weapons
today!

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.210
(loud buzzing)
And I think it is merely

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:09.250
a reinvention of history; that
all the stuff that we have

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.210
today has been around before,
and that our past is not

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:17.500
science fiction, but science
fact.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Deadly laser
beams...

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:28.040
acoustic levitation...
antigravity.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.580
Could these be technologies
that were witnessed

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.830
and even used by
ancient civilizations?

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:41.670
If so, were they conceived in
the minds of early man?

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:46.710
Or did they have different--
perhaps otherworldly-- origins?

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:50.210
Might unlocking the secrets of
these inventions be the key to

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:56.460
discovering our ancient past?
Or by rediscovering lost

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:01.710
technology, might we clear the
path to our own future and to

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.040
the limitless potential
of the universe beyond?

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.040
