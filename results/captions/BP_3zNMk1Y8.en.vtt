00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:03.805
14 years ago I stayed in this bungalow.

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:05.355
I'm asleep at the moment

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.145
but I'll soon put on a flowery blue dress

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:09.235
which I'll wear while running for my life.

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:10.695
This is my tsunami story.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.500
I was 15 years old staying with my family at the island of Koh Lanta.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.860
In the Asian pearl, Thailand.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.500
We lived in an amazing bungalow with a terrace facing the beach

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.680
and a view of the beautiful and peaceful ocean.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.060
The Paradise factor was ever present.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.300
At 9.30 in the morning

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.900
like many 15 year olds I prioritized sleeping over hotel breakfast.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.140
Far away from my dreams I heard the voice of a young girl.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.080
My eyes opened suddenly and in front of me stood, Sofi.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.660
My 5-year old sister tugging my arm as hard as she could.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.940
"Lisa, Lisa, come on, we have new kittens!" she said

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.260
Since I am no fan of either animals or early mornings I reluctantly poured myself out of bed

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.000
with the energy of a beached seal while grabbing the family camera.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.845
At this exact moment no one knew

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:35.885
that she had just saved my life

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:38.905
and that in a couple of minutes, I would save hers.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.800
Once out at the beach I approached my pregnant  mother Anna, my father Magnus,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.340
my 1-year old brother Olle and those darn kittens.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.580
I press the rec-button to videotape my excited sister while she pets the kittens.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.640
"The dog likes the cat."

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.340
I look up from the camera to realize that there is a massive amount of people on the beach.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.120
Suddenly a wave approaches, not that high, about 4 metres.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.500
"Wave, there's a wave."

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.720
People remain on the beach and a confused murmur spreads among the locals and turists.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.840
"Dad, imagine the people all the way out there."

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.800
The wave hits the beach.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.060
The response is shocked yet somewhat amused.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.880
This was the biggest and most forceful wave we had ever seen.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.400
So far.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.620
"The chairs are going out."

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.760
That's when a roaring sound filled the air.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.440
The amused looks turned to the horizon showing a wall of mud and water approaching.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.560
Several metres taller than the last one.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.680
At first I struggle to comprehend what I'm seeing. What is now approaching is incomparable to the former wave

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.600
and the air around us fills with complete panic.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.880
"We need to back up now."

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.340
My dad runs off with Olle, I never see where.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.215
I look for my mom.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.840
She is running around the pool heading for the jungle on top of the mountain in the middle of the island.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.880
I don't know if I wanted to know how far from land the wave was, or if my subconscious took over

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.040
but for a brief second, I look over my shoulder.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.560
And there, on the beach, I see something. Something that I will never forget.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.020
My terrified, 5-year old sister left on the beach. Alone.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.760
Her gaze frantically looking for a familiar face,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.160
being shoved around by people in panic searching for their own family member.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.180
Without hesitation, my body turns around, heading straight towards the monster in the ocean.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.320
Straight towards the wave.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.840
I reach her, grab her and throw her into my arms.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.200
I'm running. Running as fast as my legs can take me.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.795
"Is this how we die?" "Am I even running?"

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.240
Every step feels like in slow-motion.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.620
The childhood nightmare, using maximum force to try to move but still not getting anywhere.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.500
When I exit the hotel area, across the road and a couple of metres across a patch of grass behind the hotel

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.820
I see my mother and can feel the adrenaline fading.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.780
The screams around me become louder

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.140
and I realize that the wave has hit the hotel.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.460
My legs can hardly carry me anymore and my arms can not carry Sofi any longer.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.080
"I'm gonna put you down now, and then you're gonna run faster than you've ever ran before, Sofi" I tell her.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.100
I put her down and grasp her little hand.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.180
And then we run, hand in hand, for our lives heading towards the jungle.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.340
She runs as fast as her little legs can take her.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.780
Mom yells at us to run faster.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.860
We have now reached a steep, slanting edge of the jungle full of thorn bushes and panicked tourists.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.820
The only way up is already crowded and ahead of me is a winded, heavy set woman climbing extremely slowly.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.200
I place my hands on her cheeks pushing her upwards with all my strength.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.920
She will reach the top, and so shall we.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.100
The natural sounds of the jungle, the loud crickets, is now replaced by screams, crying and panic.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.760
We will survive.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.260
We fight forward in the overgrown jungle until we reach an open sand dune.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.720
The athmosphere here is tense, to say the least.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.720
"Did we survive?"

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.720
Everyone is dusty and orange on their hands and feet after the intense climb.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:56.160
After awhile I reunite with my brother and father telling us how he was slung into the pool

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.820
by a concrete lounge chair while carrying Olle.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:07.380
A thai man approaches with a piece of paper for the embassy, for us to sign, affirming we're alive.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920
"Look at him..."

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.680
"He's wounded his entire head."

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:23.660
People start to worry for what's to come when a thai man tells us how he's friend on Phi Phi told him

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.620
that another wave, over 100 metres, is coming,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.480
I look up at the palm trees. Perhaps we would have a chance if we got up there.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.080
But how would we get there? Would we get dragged down by others trying to survive?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.740
I look out to the horizon imagining the sun obscured and the sky darkened by a wave that large.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.740
I imagine people pulling and tearing at each other to reach the tallest trees.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.660
My entire body starts to tingle and my fingers and toes go numb.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.380
"Why can't I breath?" And then everything, turns black.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:09.280
Hours pass and hunger sets in. A man reunites with his wife and vomits out of happiness.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:17.600
My brother has now developed pneumonia from the humid air and is starting to having trouble breathing.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.880
I throw away a 30cm long centipede to spare my mom the sight.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.040
Since there are no toilets, people just go anywhere in the sand dunes. We're animals, trying to survive.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.140
One questions keeps spinning inside my head, the same one that is being whispered among the trees.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.120
"Will the 100 metres tall wave hit?"

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.820
We wait, exhausted, from morning to sunset.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.920
In spite of what we've experienced the palm trees still sway with the wind, the crickets sing and the sun

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.260
moves across the sky, hour after hour.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.220
Suddenly my mom makes a decision. "We will sleep in the hotel tonight" she tells us.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.540
Olle won't survive the night in the jungle due to the humidity.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.760
The entire family climb down the sand dune together. Resisting the avid protests from fellow survivors.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.560
My mother doesn't waver and we don't have a choice.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.140
In the hotel we are faced with bloody floors, palm trees in the reception,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.240
odd baby shoes and flip-flops in the hallways.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.180
Everything covered in mud.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.260
I glanse towards the beach. Our bungalow is just walls now

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.960
and the concrete fence had been pulled away by the forceful water.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.560
My dad steps behind the counter in the reception and grabs one of the keys.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.700
We walk in silence as we head up as many stairs as possible.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:09:00.460
The atmosphere is dogged. It's 10pm and it's time to go to bed after this horrifying day.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.960
There's no water in the faucets so we wash off our hands and feet in the toilet

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.560
before crawling into the double bed, all five of us, fully dressed.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.980
My dad is on his phone, hour after hour, looking for earthquakes capable of creating another tsunami.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.820
He tells us exactly what to do if another wave thrushes into our hotel room.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.340
"We go into the bathroom, and stay there."

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.380
I fall asleep.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.280
A hard knock on the hotel door. "Tsunami is coming!"

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.700
I hear my dad slam the door in the messengers face while muttering "fuck you".

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:45.720
I pretend to still be asleep. I don't want my dad to have to tell us that we have to stay for Olle.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.020
"At least we'll die together" I figured.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I awake abruptly. It happened. It was all real. And time is running out.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.540
We have to get home to Sweden.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.640
We get down to the road where we see trucks filled with terrified people from others beaches and islands pass by

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.960
We manage to squeeze ourselves onto one of them.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.780
The trucks are crowded and along the way we see body bags containing corpses from those who passed.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:22.060
Among these bags, some are just 1 meter, the size of a small child.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:29.240
We arrive at a hotel who has volunteered as a rescue center where we are escorted to a room

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.160
the size of half a football field filled with survivors.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.260
Everyone with their own story, and fate. Some bleeding, some crying.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.640
I myself, have suppressed how I felt at this time. I can't remember, no matter how hard I try.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.900
I sleep on the floor that night. Next to someone who has had one ear torn off.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.500
I search for my mothers hand and feel a teardrop fall down my cheek.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.560
The whole family is alive. My family.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.540
After a couple of days on the rescue center we're escorted to an airport and an airplane

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.460
designated for families that have been divided, families with young children and pregnant women.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.620
The risk of diseases spreading through the deceased bodies has made it unsafe to stay in Thailand anymore.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.860
Our flight home occurs on New Years eve of 2004/2005.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.220
When we land in Sweden fireworks go off all around the airplane. The clock has struck midnight

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.260
and the new year is being celebrated, with resolutions and kisses.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.960
At the airport we are interviewed by a psychiatrist who advices us to go home and rest.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:46.080
A number of big brands have donated clothes filling up rooms for those of us who survived, but lost everything.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.800
We move through the rooms apathetic reaching the arrival hall and out to our taxi.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.360
Once I get home I sleep for days.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.620
"Look at the doggie."

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.960
For about two years afterwards I dreamt of the grey wall of mud roaring towards me every night.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.000
I often awoke screaming in panic and crying in fear.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.100
To this day I sometimes dream of climbing up trees and roofs trying to escape being

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.440
flushed or drowned by the enormous wall of water covering the sky and blocking the sun's light.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.900
But I'm alive. More alive than ever.
