00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.180
Let's make us a tool bit

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.480
ok what I'm doing is milling  away some of the high speed tool bits so it's a little easier for me to grind

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.460
I don't have a real narrow width grinding wheel so

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.780
I have to make something wide enough so I can get in there and grind

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.260
and use two inch wide grinding wheels

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.460
So I can get in and grind some relief on the inside

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.180
Here's what I milled away

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.460
Sp this is going to be the cutting end right here

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.120
I have to shape this a little bit more alright

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.540
I'm gonna give it a little bit of relief on the backside

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.120
because this is a half inch wide tool

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.840
my groove is half inch wide

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.540
plus you have to take into consideration the radius

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.180
So I'll have to relieve a little bit of this to clear inside there

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.960
I'll just do that right down here on the end

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.180
I did this so I can go

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.280
Like so

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.700
on the grinding wheel

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.420
This is where I do wish we had a  grinder with a one inch wide grinding wheel

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.200
for being able to do things like this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.380
This allows me to come in here

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.640
Just so

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.380
and grind it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280
That inside edge see? Getting clearance

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.940
That's gonna give me enough

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.360
there to cut the groove anyway

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.060
The groove depth will be 111 to 113 thousandths deep

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.880
There's a little bit of radius in that corner from the wheel right there it's grinding

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.980
Looks like I've got enough angle clearance there

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.900
Now I can get a little bit of clearance this way

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.760
over here on the course wheel and remove some of it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.840
Right there... the book actually says point 189

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.960
Okay so I'm gonna call that good right there

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.760
Basically 3 1/16ths

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.240
Now I do need to grind this front edge here too

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.320
This is your cutting edge

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.460
and that edge should be nice and square

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.700
And now just getting the bottom

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.120
I need to adjust this tool rest it's getting away from the wheel there.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.420
Just about there

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.500
I need to check it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.320
then put a little bit of relief on this back edge here

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.300
Alright so there's a little bit of the relief

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.360
to give me some clearance in the groove

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.640
I've got a little bit of wiggle room right there it's not gonna rub on the bottom of the tool

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.160
All I have left to do is some honing right there

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.960
I may come in here and give it some back relief.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.580
Maybe grind the top of it.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.920
Down

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.580
and help make a little better chip formation.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.220
That's it.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.640
Here's what I'm talking about

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.380
so we're gonna come in here like so

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.820
we'll get it in here and center it up and that's gonna go to the back

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.960
and we're gonna plunge in and cut an O-ring groove right there

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.080
so you can see why I had to give it a little clearance right here

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.840
I want to keep as much metal on as I can to keep it sturdy

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.000
This is gonna be choked up real close right here

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.560
O

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.680
I'm not gonna have it hanging way out like that.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.220
I'm gonna have it sticking out just enough to get in here

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.420
and cut that, make it as rigid as I can

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.920
Alright, we're ready to get started on this O-ring groove right here

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.500
I've got everything set.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.080
and ready to go.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.100
our tool mount is in the tool post.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.220
and I've already... let me just run this in here

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.180
close and I'll show you... we'll do it by hand

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.940
clearance here on the compound, something is always  ...

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.540
Important, before you turn anything on is to get things close

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.760
rotate it with your hand to make sure you're not going to jam the machine or crash it

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.140
so the other thing I've done too is I've squared the cutting face of the tool with the work

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.460
now one way I did it this time is I used my little lufkin square butt right here

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.340
alright

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.660
go in here and I've squared it up

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.160
and I put a flashlight underneath the tool

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.180
and looked at the light coming through the edge right there

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.500
alright and I've got it pretty well squared up good enough for what we're doing here

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.040
it's probably not zero zero if you were to dial that face in right there but it's really really close

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.540
alright

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.640
I've got my depth

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.920
not the depth but

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.640
we're gonna come up in here

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.640
I've already touched the back

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.640
and set a zero basically to where I know where I'm going to come in there and cut it

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.160
so what I've got to do is touch off on the diameter

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.620
set a zero then plunge in

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.240
and here's one more thing I'll show you

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.860
I usually write on the compound quite a bit

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.360
That's how wide the tool is

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.720
after I finish honing it

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.080
it's 187 which is right on what we want

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.140
3/16ths tool

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.440
And then this is the depth

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.360
So it's going 111 to 113 per side

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.680
okay that's the depth of the groove actually

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.080
is that...that's going to be 222 on the dial once I zero here

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.580
if I go 222 it'll make that depth right there

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.560
okay

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.860
that's the proper depth for this

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.320
zero one two I think it is a 2 series O-ring that I'm cutting

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.680
So, let's go ahead and let's get started.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.000
I'm probably going to use the cool mist

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.420
on this to try to try to help with keeping the tool cool

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.720
also less smoke maybe a little easier to watch on video

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.860
want to establish a zero

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.580
where we start making our cut

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.320
run it in there and once I touch I'm just going to stop the spindle here.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.900
Alright that looks pretty square

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.980
alright that should be our zero point

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.580
ain't going to hurt that high speed by shutting it off like that

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
zero the dial zero the read out

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.580
alright

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.040
and let's try to get this going

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.600
see how that works right there

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.340
alright here we go

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.660
just hand feeding

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.340
I'm not trying to go to aggressive just feeling the tool

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.440
as it's going in

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.660
Looks like I'm getting a little bit of chatter

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.540
we may have to slow it down

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.680
but so far it's doing pretty good

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.960
that chatter is probably from that little bit of tool hanging out that's why I'm saying try to

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.220
keep it as tight as you can get it

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.560
look at the chips binding up in there

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.360
I'm going to go ahead and stop that

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.160
there's really no where for them to go

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.000
hee hee hee

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.200
Tools cutting very good it feels very free cutting

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.300
alright that's half our depth right there, so where half way there

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.660
a little bit more aggressive on the tool bit... I mean the pressure I'm sorry

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.900
And I hope you guys can see this good, it looks pretty good from my end

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.660
ok there's 210 on the dial we've got another 12

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.460
There's 220

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.100
alrighty

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.860
that's going to be it right there I'm going to let it kinda scrape in just a bit

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.620
alright 222 on the dial

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.620
back it out

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:19.880
okay

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.180
there we go

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.260
let me go get and O-righ

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.880
and we'll stick it on there and see

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:43.220
ok here's our O-ring 256 actually this is the right size O-ring but it's the incorrect type

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.980
the byton O-rings go on here but I didn't have the right size in bytons

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.400
but this is a 256 this is the same size

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.700
damn, there you go

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.580
there's your tube seal right there

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.060
so the tube seal for the barrel the bore or whatever

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.020
gets pushed onto here

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:11.540
and this O-ring is what seals the hydraulic pressure from coming through the tube and out to the outside

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.800
this is a very very common type with this type, tie rod type cylinder

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.860
sometimes they are in the face there which I actually like better

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.740
because whenever these get damaged it usually pushes those lips in

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.040
If they get trash or something in there it comes off and it starts hammering it

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.940
these are a little more difficult to fix

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.780
I have to fix them like I did by cutting them with a tool bit

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.000
sometimes we have to go and weld them up

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.020
I actually like the face grooves more than I like this style here but

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.360
they both work good and I'm just replicating what I've got to make right here

00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.580
I do need to come in here with a tool bit and put a little bit of a chamfer a lead in angle to help align the barrel when it goes on

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:09.540
but other than that we'll chamfer this outside edge and do both of these and this side will be done

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.600
I figure since we're on the subject we'll go ahead and talk about it.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.820
this is a bytono ring it's also called fluorocarbon that:s what it is it's a fluorocarbon

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.340
this is a regular buno O-ring right here

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.540
the byton fluorocarbon style is for higher heat

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.300
it'll withstand more heat

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.620
than the regular buno style O-ring

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.000
so some applications require a fluorocarbon seal or O-ring to go in

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:49.100
the piston seals I'm sorry the glan and the piston seals are also fluorocarbon

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.400
so I just wanted to shwo the difference so this was a 256 O-ring number size

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.980
it's a standard size number 256 and then the

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.580
fluorocarbon or byton is going to be... I just had it

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.860
I just lost it off the top of my head

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.860
okay, heh, 568 so this would be a 568 dash 256

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:22.020
so if you wanted a flourocarbon 568 dash then whatever the size is and that will get you a bython

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.020
 

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.600
we're going to put this around... get it chucked up

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.240
make sure all of our jaws are clean I've already cleaned this off

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.060
just wiped with my fingers to make sure there's no grit or dust there

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.340
same thing with the part

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.800
make sure it's clean... stick it right back in here

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.000
just holding pressure against it

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.820
now I'll seat these I want to make sure the part is seated good against the jaws

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.600
you can kinda hear it  it's sort of a feel and hear

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.280
where ever it seems solid it sounds solid

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.380
but you don't want to hit it... continue to hit it too hard

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.740
because you'll get bounce back, the part will hit the jaw and bounce back

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.620
you don't want it to do that you want it to stay solid against the jaw

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.420
Abom is a machining god... Hahaha...

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.960
Hey, I'm just showing you what Paul taught me

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.300
Paul taught me how to do all this

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.660
He loves to cut iron

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.400
Okay so we're gonna use the spirit 67 with attachment

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.660
we're going to use this to indicate the bore

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.420
there's a half a thousand right there

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.000
we"ll go to our low

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.360
so on your od you're doing the opposite of what you usually see me do or what I say

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.680
you're loosing your lows... I'm sorry, you're tightening your lows and lessening  your highs

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.980
that's a tenth right there very very close

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:36.760
You know, whenever I hear guys like John Grimsmod talking about wanting to hold a tent on his laths when he's making screws

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.420
or little parts for his knives

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.660
I feel like this is my perfection right here

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.840
whenever I'm indicating something

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.960
and I'm not saying I'm perfect by no means but in my mind I hate seeing that needle move

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.680
so I'm always trying to tweak it to get it completely out

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.140
which is really tricky

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:05.100
so even though I'm indicated in there I'm seeing that move one or two tenths and I'm like mmm can I get that out?

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.380
I think I can, so I come back around here, I can barely feel this jaw move

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.580
and I think I got it within a tenth closer

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.780
We;"re going to call that good

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.180
We're gonna go ahead and finish our thickness which calls for 2 inch 960

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.120
we"re at about... 993 or so

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.920
around there so we've got about 30 thousandths a little over that

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.540
I'll go ahead an get :er started

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.580
we'll make a cut

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.620
Get in here and touch off, make a little pass then mic it

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.480
so we'll go a half or 15 and we'll mic it

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.760
That face thickness is not critical by the way

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.380
Just a target size of what the old one was

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.440
ok so 9 seventy three right there

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.660
this will tell you if you're square or not, usually off one or two

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.540
about 973 a tenth or two

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.200
there we go there's about 975 or so we're about 2,000ths out of square

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.220
975 we"ll just dial in 13 we'll call it good

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.340
I'm running a faster feed rate this time

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.520
That"s helping make that chip curl over instead of curl up into wads

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.560
clean your tools off when you're through

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:04.000
Okay our next stop is going to be 5 inch diameter about 7/8ths deep counter bore on this side here

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.720
already got my depth set time to touch the tool off

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.760
I'm down to my last 60 thou or so

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.460
gotta come out of here so we're gonna use our telescoping gauges

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.360
and a mic

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.980
be around 15 16ths

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.340
at 9 38 and a half

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.000
so what I'll do is split it in half so that's basically giving us 60 thousandths

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.880
So I'll do thirty and thirty or thirty then mic it

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.660
take whatever is left

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.340
That's going to be a pretty precision fit

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.540
That"s part of the rod glan seals right there

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.000
ten... twenty... thirty... and I got my speed rate slowed down

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.260
let's see what we got

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:30.220
that 69 and a half so that's going to give us 30 and a half thou I need to make that a little bit over

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.040
I'm going to shoot for 2 thousandths over that

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.620
So it''ll be 32 and a half thou

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:43.300
always double check yourself, make sure you've got your measurement correct

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.280
 

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.080
and compare

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.240
I get the same thing

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.880
Soooo

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.640
ten... twenty... thirty  one two and a half

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.240
So as I come up to this space

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.480
I go in 5 thousandths that will bring it to 875

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.940
And I'll just space it back by hand

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.880
I'm seeing there I am about one or two tenths under

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.900
alright so... 71 and 9 tenths

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.360
I think we're close enough

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.460
I'm within a John Grimsmo area

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.380
I'm within the John Grimsmo tolerance should I say

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.820
We're going to do a nice bevel for the O-ring to slide  inside this counter bore

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:33.020
Use a threading tool there so that gives approximately a thirty degree angle there

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.300
Alright then we'll use a boring bar to chamfer that other inside shoulder

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.320
The lathes works done

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.680
all we've got left is the four holes for the tie rods then we got one hole is going to be for our port

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.380
I was going to finish off this edge, the facing kind of sharpened it.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.460
Just going to use the file

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.300
the corners

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:34.840
okay

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.180
There we go
