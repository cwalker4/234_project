Yeah, cuz I was born in Hawaii well, so does everyone get in Hawaiian name if you're born in the wife. No, but I did

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.750
Hot Kalani, what does it mean it means? Heavenly star?

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.429
Slightly undermines it explain where your parents got the name from the Honolulu Zoo there was a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.799
Baby, elephant that was born at the same time as me whispered ha Kalani

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.330
We we felt we read about it, so we Google it there was a picture, this is a picture of who Kalani the elephant

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.059
That really then you've got it wouldn't be amazing if we had hookah line out back so we

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.080
Happened to Kalani and very kindly someone I think names Barbara. She found time to email back

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.110
Hello, ha because that's what you say

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.519
Barbara writes I am sorry to say that Oh Kalani dived at the Honolulu Zoo on November 13th 1970

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.860
1970 now you would think busy busy busy running a zoo, I'll stop my email there, that's all they wanted to know no Barbara continues

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.329
She was found dead in the moat of her exhibits

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.770
This was in 1970 and other members of like a busy yesterday

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.950
She was found in the moat, it was speculated that she was pushed in by another young elephant

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.840
Jealous of the mothering attention she was receiving from an older FIBA. I wish there was a more warm and fuzzy angle to this story

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.660
Good luck with your interview
