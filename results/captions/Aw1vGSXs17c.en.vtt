00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.765 line:92%
&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS PROCESS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.032 line:92%
THIS IS NUCLEAR GRAY BONKERS. WE ARE ABOUT TO REORDER

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.432 line:92%
ONE-FIFTH OF THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND WE ARE GOING TO

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:31.065 line:92%
HAVE TWO HOURS TO REVIEW A BILL WHICH AT FIRST BLUSH STANDS

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.265 line:92%
ESSENTIALLY AS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ARSON.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.098 line:92%
&gt;&gt; TO UNDERSTAND THE ABSOLUTELY STUNNING DRAMA THAT UNFOLDED ON

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.865 line:92%
THE SENATE FLOOR LAST NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO START MINUTES BEFORE

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.632 line:92%
10:00 P.M. WHEN SENATE REPUBLICANS FIRST POSTED THE

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:48.298 line:92%
TEXT OF THEIR HEALTH CARE BILL AND 18-PAGE REPEAL WRITTEN THAT

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.865 line:92%
DAY OVER LUNCH. DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE TWO HOURS

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.098 line:92%
TO REVIEW IT. THE POSSIBLY OF REORDERED

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.598 line:92%
AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WITH AMERICANS

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.165 line:92%
ASLEEP. IMMEDIATELY, DEMOCRATS ROSE ONE

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.932 line:92%
AFTER THE OTHER TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST AND IT THE IDEA OF

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.132 line:92%
JAMMING IT THROUGH OVERNIGHT. JUST ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.398 line:92%
WOULD TAKE TO THE FLOOR. THAT WAS THE SENATOR FROM

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.499 line:92%
WYOMING WHO INTENDED TO HELD TO FLOOR AT ALL COSTS.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:18.232 line:92%
&gt;&gt; DOES THE SENATOR YIELD? &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS UNDER MY

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.998 line:92%
TIME. &gt;&gt; IF I CAN RESPECTFULLY ASK THE

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.865 line:92%
CHAIRMAN, SINCE WE'VE ONLY HAD THIS BILL FOR AN HOUR.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.698 line:92%
WE HAVE AS YOU CAN SEE, A NUMBER OF SENATORS WHO WANT TO SPEAK

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:29.832 line:92%
AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK IF THERE'S ANY TIME WE WILL HAVE

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:33.565 line:92%
BETWEEN NOW AND THE VOTE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS, SINCE WE HAVE JUST

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:36.432 line:92%
HAD THE BILL FOR A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME?

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:40.399 line:92%
IT WILL OBVIOUSLY IMPACT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.499 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE ANSWER THAT I GAVE WAS PERHAPS YOUR TIME MIGHT

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:46.932 line:92%
BE BETTER SPENT TAKING A LOOK AT THE BILL.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:53.299 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AS THE CLOCK TICKED TOWARD MIDNIGHT, MIKE PENCE GOT TO THE

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:54.832 line:92%
HILL. THE FIRST VOTE BEGAN AT 20

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:57.865 line:92%
MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE LAST LEVER DEMOCRATS COULD

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.299 line:92%
PULL WHICH WAS A REQUEST TO SEND THE BILL TO COMMITTEE FOR

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.032 line:92%
DEBATE. THAT BILL ON CERTAINLY FAIL AND

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:08.065 line:92%
DID IT. EVEN WITH THAT FIRST VOTE, THEY

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.765 line:92%
KEPT THE FIRST VOTE OPEN. IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR, HE WAS

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.065 line:92%
STALLING. NEARBY, JOHN McCAIN WAS TALKING

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.432 line:92%
TO TWO SENATORS WHO CRITICIZED THE BILL.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:22.232 line:92%
THEN PENCE WAS TALKING TO McCAIN.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:24.265 line:92%
McCONNELL DID NOT HAVE THE VOTES AND THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.132 line:92%
TRYING TO CHANGE IT. AND THEY KEPT THE VOTE OPEN FOR

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:31.698 line:92%
OVER AN HOUR. THE CLEAREST FORESHADOWING

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:33.998 line:92%
HAPPENED WHEN McCAIN WALKED OVER TO DEMOCRATS.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.665 line:92%
THEY WERE JOKING AROUND AND SMILING.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.665 line:92%
HE EVEN PUT HIS ARM AROUND DIANE FEINSTEIN.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.265 line:92%
IT WAS AT 1:30. MUKOWSKI VOTED NO.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:50.365 line:92%
McCAIN DIDN'T ANSWER WHEN HIS NAME WAS CALLED.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.232 line:92%
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS SECONDS LATER AND ASKED FOR THE

00:02:52.366 --> 00:03:02.798 line:92%
CLEARING'S ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; MR. PETERS?

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:06.965 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AS BUZZ FEED NOTED, YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS ONE MOMENT LIKE A

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.298 line:92%
RENAISSANCE PAINTING, WHAT EACH PERSON WAS DOING WHEN THAT THIRD

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:16.398 line:92%
VOTE WAS ASKED. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:20.965 line:92%
BEFORE WHEN THEY WITNESS IT. BERNIE SANDERS NUDGING THE VOTE

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.465 line:92%
WAS COMING. BOB CASEY ON HIS FEET WAITING IN

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.932 line:92%
ANTICIPATION. AND SHERROD BROWN SLAPPING THE

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.299 line:92%
DESK. AND ELIZABETH WARREN LEANING IN

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:35.999 line:92%
TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND THEN UNABLE TO RESIST, CHEERING

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:40.865 line:92%
FOR McCAIN'S VOTE. CHUCK SCHUMER TRYING TO QUIET

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.399 line:92%
THEM WITH THE AUDIBLE GASPS. AND MITCH McCONNELL, ARMS

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:50.032 line:92%
FOLDED, STARING AT McCAIN, WATCHING HIM WALK OFF THE FLOOR

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:55.265 line:92%
KNOWING THE BILL WAS DEAD. THE CROWDS WOULD FIND OUT

00:03:55.366 --> 00:04:12.499 line:92%
SECONDS LATER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.399 line:92%
AFTER THAT VOTE, LEADER McCONNELL SAID IT IS TIME TO

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:19.165 line:92%
MOVE ON AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEFEAT.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.032 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS CLEARLY A DISAPPOINTING MOMENT.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:26.565 line:92%
WE WORKED HARD AND EVERYBODY ON THIS SIDE CAN CERTAINLY ATTEST

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.132 line:92%
TO THE FACT WE WORKED REALLY HARD.

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:35.098 line:92%
TO TRY TO DEVELOP A CONSENSUS FOR A BETTER WAY FORWARD.
