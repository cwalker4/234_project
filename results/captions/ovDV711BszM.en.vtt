00:00:02.716 --> 00:00:04.090
Previously on
The Good Stuff, we

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.964
talked with Laura
Kreidberg, a researcher who

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:08.540
studies exoplanets, planets
outside our solar system

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.880
around distant suns
many light years away.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.590
Do you ever think we'll be
able to get to these planets?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.795
Can we get there?

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:15.790
Yeah.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.300
it would be really tough.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.400
So to put it in perspective,
the most distant manmade

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.230
object from the earth right
now is Voyager 1, which

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.660
was launched in 1977, I think,
so nearly 40 years of space

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.160
travel.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.270
It is one light day
away from the Earth.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.590
So it takes light one day to
travel from Voyager 1 to us.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.280
The nearest star
is Alpha Centauri.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130
And that's about
four light years.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.920
And so maybe if we had
like nuclear propulsion

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.890
technology that has
not yet been developed

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.710
and we reached speeds that
are a significant fraction

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.480
of the speed of
light, we could reach

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.532
Alpha Centauri in 100 years.

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:55.740
So technically, we could
travel to neighboring stars

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.990
using existing technology.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.460
But the voyage could take
three generations of astronauts

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.507
aboard a spacecraft.

00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:03.090
And we can forget about any of
those guys returning to Earth.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.599
So it doesn't seem very
practical, does it?

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:04.890
Nope.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.440
If we really want to
travel to another star

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.898
system in our
lifetime, we're going

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:10.065
to need a revolution in
space propulsion technology,

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:11.440
something out of
science fiction,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.200
something like a warp
drive in Star Trek.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.860
And a warp drive
just might be sitting

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.454
in a garage in Omaha, Nebraska.

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:21.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.290
My name is Dave Pares.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.210
I'm the president of
Space Warp Dynamics LLC.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.480
I also teach college at
four other universities

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.520
here in the local area.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.560
So I'm kind of a busy guy.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.030
We're also in the development
of a functional warp drive.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.520
Ahead warp one, Mr. Sulu.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.660
Accelerating to warp one, sir.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.450
Warp drives have been a staple
transportation method in sci fi

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.016
for decades.

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:46.414
[SCREAMS]

00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:49.120
But cant it ever
be fully realized?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.360
In someone's garage?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.530
Where are we right now?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.570
What is this?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.760
This is the most
compact laboratory

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.560
that you'll ever be in.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.239
It's a makeover of a garage.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.780
This is where David Pares has
been working on his warp drive

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.540
for years now.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.070
You're in this garage,
which seems pretty low tech.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.039
Do you think that impedes people
belief in what you're doing?

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.855
As the old expression you
can't judge a book by its cover,

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.230
well, just because it's in a
garage doesn't mean we don't

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.040
have high tech equipment here.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.990
We have some of the most
advanced electronics sitting

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.990
there in the other room.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.399
I got a very strict budget.

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:22.940
And I got to make
do with what I got.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.070
We're very creative.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.310
We stretch a dollar
more than anybody can.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.000
I love hardware stores.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.630
I love lumber yards and stuff.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.950
We do a lot of things, just
like what Robert Goddard

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.560
did in his rocket development.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.190
And he used to go
to hardware stores

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.540
and do adaptive engineering.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.260
That's what I do.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.770
Most people don't
believe what we do.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.300
The proof will be in
the pudding when we

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.160
lift this craft off the ground.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.434
The craft is Blue Bird II.

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.600
And Pares hopes it'll be
ready for its maiden voyage

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.092
by the end of 2015.

00:02:49.092 --> 00:02:50.800
Well, it won't be a
maiden voyage as much

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.810
as a maiden hover.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.810
He hopes to lift it off
the ground a little bit.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.139
Is that the ultimate goal
here is to make a spacecraft?

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.430
Well, that's my ultimate goal.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.485
I intend to go to space.

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.760
I intend to go to the moon,
go to Mars, and have some fun.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.310
But I'll be back before lunch.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.150
What is a warp drive?

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.630
We are artificially
inducing the compression

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.000
of the fabric of space.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.070
Normally, that's done with
mass, like a black hole,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.350
the sun, the earth.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.335
The mass actually compresses
the fabric of space around them.

00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:19.710
That's what
Einstein discovered.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.480
His theory of general
relativity states

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.255
that all mass warps space time.

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:24.630
The greater the
mass, the greater

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.490
the curvature of
spacetime around it.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.180
Even you and me are warping
spacetime just a teensy bit.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.040
Pares's warp drive
would do the same thing,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040
just without the mass.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.123
When I think of a warp
drive, I think of Star Trek

00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:34.940
and sort of sci fi.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.939
So does everybody else.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:36.550
Yeah.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.110
It seems like something that
maybe shouldn't be possible.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.860
How does this, what you're
doing here, relate to those--

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.942
that type of warp drive?

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:45.150
Is it the same kind of thing?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.910
It generates a field, yes,
but it's not quite the way

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.720
they describe a warp drive.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.406
Back then, Alcubierre wasn't
really around describing

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:55.530
his theoretical principles.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.030
Yeah.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.780
Alcubierre was--
he came up with--

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.800
1994, he came up
with this concept

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.410
and was ridiculed heavily
by the scientific community.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.990
Miguel Alcubierre was and
is a Mexican physicist.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.440
This is Matthew O'Dowd,
host of Space Time.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.970
But he's also an astrophysicist.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.511
MATTHEW O'DOWD: Most
famous, I guess,

00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:17.050
in at least popular
consciousness for a paper

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.360
he wrote in which he described a
spacetime field in the language

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.620
of general relativity
that was capable of faster

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.287
than light travel,
his warp field.

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:28.870
Called the Alcubierre
drive, it could

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.920
warp the geometry of
spacetime in such a way

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.640
as to allow a spacecraft to go
faster than the speed of light.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.960
Although it's impossible for
anything, any objects, energy,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.130
information to travel
through space faster

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.990
than the speed of light or
even at the speed of light,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.210
there is no such limit on the
speed that two regions of space

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.000
can move apart from each other.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.630
Instead of accelerating
a spaceship,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.560
the drive compresses
the space in front of it

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.059
and expands the space behind
it, effectively moving the ship

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.490
by moving all the
space around it.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.800
The ship itself,
on the other hand,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.310
would never technically move
faster than the speed of light.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.768
In fact, the crew
of the space ship

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:06.310
wouldn't experience
any acceleration.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.059
It would be like they
hadn't moved at all.

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.370
But there's just one problem.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.300
His proposal was it took an
inordinate amount of energy

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.800
to create a warp bubble.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.950
He estimated you'd
need approximately

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.590
the equivalent
energy density of all

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.230
of the mass in the
observable universe.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.830
All the energy of the
universe to make a warp bubble.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.711
Well, that wasn't
obviously practical.

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:26.210
Yeah.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.650
All the energy in the universe
seems like a bit much.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.970
NASA has looked into the
possibility of building a warp

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.250
drive but is not actively
pursuing any sorts

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.390
of interstellar travel.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.480
Dr. Harold Sonny White
has been spearheading

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.170
this investigation for NASA.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.480
For the most part, his results
have been inconclusive.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.570
But his team did
lower the amount

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.670
of estimated energy needed
to create a warp bubble,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.680
down from the entire
universe to maybe something

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.260
the mass of a
Voyager spacecraft.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.170
Still an amazing amount of
energy and more than we're

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.070
capable of producing
with current technology.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.028
So that meant this could
have been potentially

00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:54.770
hundreds or thousands
of years away

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.590
from actually being developed.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.960
But Pares believes that a
warp bubble can be achieved

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.500
right now, right here on Earth.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.240
And it already has been.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.840
Cases of aviation from pilots
caught my eye of their claims

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.710
that they were displaced and
entering these thunderstorms

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.390
and being linear displaced
hundreds of miles downrange.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.670
One of these stories is
the account of Bruce Gernon.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.610
In December of
1970, Bruce Gernon

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.340
was flying through
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.964
Let's not say Bermuda Triangle.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:22.880
Let's say the Bahamas.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.379
OK.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.030
The Bahamas.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.490
He was flying
through the Bahamas

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.630
when his plane was engulfed by
a huge ring shaped thunderstorm.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.130
To escape the storm, he flew
through a tunnel in the clouds.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.713
And when he emerged
on the other side,

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:34.941
he found himself over
90 miles off course.

00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:36.440
By his estimates,
he should not have

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.731
been able to travel that
distance in the amount of time

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.825
he did with the amount
of fuel he expended.

00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:43.320
Bruce Gernon believed that
he went through a time warp.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.950
Most people didn't believe him.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.200
I mean, in the beginning
when I started to investigate

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.070
these cases, I was skeptical.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.440
You have to be skeptical.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.150
I've actually flown with Bruce.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.820
And I've actually
talked with him

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.890
extensively about what happened
in his particular case.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.840
And I came across
Alcubierre's theory.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.670
And the surprising
part of it was

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.460
that as you go through
his theory, what

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.662
Bruce describes
goes step by step

00:07:06.662 --> 00:07:08.060
on what Alcubierre predicted.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.750
So from that aspect,
I became a believer

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.315
in the power of a thunderstorm.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.120
And if the conditions
are just right,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.419
and you happen to be in the
right place at the right time,

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:22.960
there you go.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.290
You can get a compression
of the fabric of space.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.610
But it's not sustainable.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.410
And I started to
think about this.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.580
How could you actually
artificially induce

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.700
this on a craft?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.254
So David Pares set
out to replicate

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.670
the conditions of
the thunderstorm

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.760
by designing small
fractal antennas arranged

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.580
in an array on these
panels, he could

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.542
create an electromagnetic
field similar to that

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.000
which is created
in a thunderstorm,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.340
just on a much smaller scale.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.300
And according to Pares,
that field in turn

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.740
would create a microwarp
bubble by compressing

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.420
the very fabric of space.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.630
So this is a pulling engine.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.060
So if you had this on a craft,
it's going to move forward.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.580
You have it up, it's going
to move up that direction.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.980
We hang them down from the
vertical spring scales.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.740
And we have these
mirrors attached

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.030
where the laser bounces off.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.860
And it goes on to the projection
screen of the garage wall.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.920
As this energizes, this pulls
in that downward direction.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.260
And then the laser
goes down the wall.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.250
It's pretty simple.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.500
And it's being pulled because
the spacetime underneath it

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.591
is being compressed.

00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:23.090
Right.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.736
The fabric space is being
compressed into the motor.

00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:26.860
And it pulls it right down.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.110
And he claims to have done it.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.130
Here's a video of one of his
experiments demonstrating

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.770
his motors.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.980
You begin to see the
laser move down the paper

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.610
as the motor's being activated.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.770
And a warp field's
being created.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.940
And it's pulling the scale
in a downward direction.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.970
It pulls down to six
centimeters, which represents

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.120
0.16 Newtons of force.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.930
In the last summer,
we were moving

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.640
four millimeters in 60 seconds.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.780
Now we move 20
centimeters in 15.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.700
So we've made massive
improvements on these pullers.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.260
Well, we're here at the lab.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.395
Why don't we see
this thing in action?

00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:04.429
OK.

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:04.970
Let's do it.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.910
If you're game, I'll
push the buttons.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.727
Yeah.

00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:08.810
Let's warp some spacetime.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.310
There you go.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.200
This one's on a
vertical spring scale.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.970
So as the fabric of space
is compressed in here,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.850
it will literally
pull that down.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.620
All the hardware here is set up.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.520
We have our preamps.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.740
We're only doing up
to 1000 watts of power

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.420
today because of the nature
of the etchings on the board.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.790
And we exceed that.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.124
We have a tendency to
blow them off the board.

00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:32.790
Everybody ready?

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.670
Yeah, I think so.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.680
Motor's onto the vertical
spring scale there.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.240
And then the laser, we should
see it move down the paper.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.740
OK.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.281
I'm engaging.

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.482
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:51.454
It's getting up.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.804
Anything?

00:09:56.804 --> 00:09:58.286
It's one up.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.240
I just collapsed the field.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.794
What was it doing?

00:10:04.794 --> 00:10:09.440
We got about a centimeter up.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.314
OK.

00:10:10.314 --> 00:10:12.980
Hold on.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.030
Well, depends on where
the mirror is at.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.270
If it's bent up a
little bit, it's

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.890
going to do the
reverse of going down.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.600
Yeah, it's dependent
on the angles.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.950
And you changed the angles from
what we had set up last night.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.240
It was bumped around, yes.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.780
Yeah.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.200
So the motor didn't move much.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.690
He attempted the
experiment again

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.010
but didn't get any results.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.810
Supposedly, it moved about
a centimeter the first time,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.120
but in the wrong direction.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.100
Pares said this was because the
mirror was angled incorrectly.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.980
I think it's more and
more difficult to do

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.180
fundamental physics in
a homemade laboratory.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.030
Typically these days, we need
to build a giant particle

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.670
accelerator, create
a vacuum chamber.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.760
I would really hate
to see that just

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.470
you have to be NASA in
order to do something.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.990
The name NASA just
implies credibility.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.860
We have none.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.307
And like we said before
is we don't really care.

00:11:04.307 --> 00:11:06.140
I think, in general,
it's important to talk

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.860
to a lot of other scientists,
even if your theory is

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.330
contentious, and you may
receive some ridicule,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.820
there is so much
expertise we can call on.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.090
But yeah, even some
really contentious ideas

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.960
ultimately prove to be right.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.410
You know, the earth
does go around the sun,

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.929
not the other way around.

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:24.470
It doesn't mean you
shouldn't persist

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.860
if people don't agree with you.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.150
However, it's important to lay
out your ideas very clearly.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.550
And these days, that means
by writing it up as a paper

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.900
and subjecting it
to peer review.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.060
Our proof is what we've done.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.600
Our empirical results
speak for themselves.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.040
And if people want
to dispute it, great.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.180
Like I said, if that
thing goes off the ground,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.790
it's a moot point.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.070
So I would hope that
people can actually

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.240
be creative, have imagination,
have the discipline to sit down

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.150
and not be swayed by
people's comments.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.690
If you really believe, then
stand up and be counted.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.550
So I didn't get to see
the warp drive work.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.200
But David Pares hopes to get his
quarter scale craft, the Blue

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.251
Bird II, off the ground
by the end of the year.

00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.500
So I guess we'll just have
to wait and see, huh Craig?

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:08.840
Yeah.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.923
So what do you guys think?

00:12:09.923 --> 00:12:13.220
Are we on the verge of making
a new actual warp drive?

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.220
Are you working on any
scientific breakthroughs,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.990
legally, in the comfort
of your own garage?

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.930
Let us know in the comments.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.390
Thanks to Matt O'Dowd and Space
Time to lending some space

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.170
expertise.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.128
If you want to learn more
about the warp drive,

00:12:23.128 --> 00:12:25.480
you can go check out this
video from PBS Space Time.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.860
It's a really good channel.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.050
Check it out.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.790
Not as many beards
over there, though.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.162
But that's fine.

00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:32.120
Thank you for watching.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.286
If you enjoyed this video,
consider giving it a like

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.050
and subscribing.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.700
And you could warp on
over to our patreon page.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.025
And give us some support.

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:39.900
See what I did there?

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.660
Yep.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.880
Last week we talked
about exoplanets.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.330
And this is what you had to say.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.460
Gy001 said that
we've found planets

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.235
that are as close as
12 light years away.

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:51.454
And technically, we could
go to them and live on them.

00:12:51.454 --> 00:12:53.870
But I think you're stretching
the limits of the definition

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.520
of technically.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.061
In this video, Laura
mentions getting

00:12:56.061 --> 00:12:59.430
to Alpha Centauri in 100
years using nuclear propulsion

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.440
technology that hasn't
been developed yet.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.520
Alpha Centauri's about
four light years away.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.430
So let's say 300 years
to go 12 light years.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.550
That's longer than the
United States has existed.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.580
And we had a civil war
in there at some point.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.300
Now let's look at
current technology.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.360
The fastest made
object ever created

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.260
is the Helios 2 spacecraft.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.160
And that achieved 252,000
kilometers an hour.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.630
It can travel 12 light
years in about 50000 years.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.829
That's longer than all
of recorded history.

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:26.620
So we better hope
Pares's warp drive works,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.950
because that's pretty
much the only way

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.700
we're going to get there
in the foreseeable future.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.283
Space Time actually
made a video about

00:13:31.283 --> 00:13:33.819
some hypothetical spaceships
that could get to these stars.

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:34.860
And you can check it out.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.130
Phxtonash asks, how
can I tell that a planet

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.365
has water like Kevin?

00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:39.549
Well, by its density.

00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:41.590
Since you can get a planet's
mass and its radius,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.940
you can estimate its density.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.840
And Kevin has a
pretty low density,

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.092
ruling out a rocky surface.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.550
They've done some spectrographic
analysis of its atmosphere

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.740
and couldn't find significant
amounts of helium or hydrogen.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.984
But they have found clouds.

00:13:51.984 --> 00:13:54.400
So one theory is that it's
composed mainly of water vapor.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.410
Kevin could be composed of
something completely different.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.160
And the water world
theory would be wrong.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.010
But it's the best guess
we have right now.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.011
Hoping it's water world.

00:14:01.011 --> 00:14:02.843
And I'm hoping Dennis
Hopper lives on there.

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.680
Leedle Lord was
disappointed that we didn't

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.830
mention the Drake equation.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.080
Well, we probably should have.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.910
But we did mention
it in another video.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.016
And you can check that one
out if you feel like it.

00:14:12.016 --> 00:14:13.586
It's pretty cool.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.630
We look for UFOs.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.370
Thanks for all
the great comments.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.006
Next week, Craig trains
to be an astronaut.

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:20.506
Sort of.

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:20.930
Kind of.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.800
I'm basically an astronaut.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.340
A little bit.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.506
I'm basically an astronaut.

00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:24.100
Yeah.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.710
OK.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.800
I'd send you to space.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.740
Now let's warp away.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.550
Brian, can you edit
us like warping away?

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.650
Yeah, like use like a
ripple effect or something.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.150
Yeah.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.700
