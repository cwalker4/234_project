00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.110
Where there are politics there are political
parties, factions, and sub-factions which

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.930
shape the world, or in this case, the galaxy
through movements, legislation, and reformations.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.860
These political parties and factions also
give us a better understanding of what the

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.740
common people of the galaxy believe and what
they want from their public servants, as well

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.910
as what issues they agree and disagree on.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.610
In Star Wars there are over 100 political
parties, factions and sub factions recorded.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
Because most of them are pretty vague in their
descriptions and only appear once or twice

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.800
in isolated events, we’ll instead go over
only the major ones from the galactic senate

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.190
within each era.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.330
First we have the main political factions
during the Republic prior to the separatist

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.960
crisis and eventual clone wars.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.260
The two major factions of this time were the
Core Faction and the Rim Faction.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.960
The Core Faction composed of senators who
were from the wealthy, Human dominated planets

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.690
and systems of the Core worlds sector of the
galaxy.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
Most of its members were Humans, and the faction
worked towards increasing the Galactic Republic’s

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.520
central government as a means for it to have
greater control over the outskirts of the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.670
galaxy, especially the Outer rim.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.729
A lot of its policies involved taxing and
exploiting poor worlds of their resources

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.799
and bringing all the wealth to the center
of the galaxy, while also implementing and

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.149
expanding strict regulations and laws on free
trade in these same outer regions.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.439
Notable members of this faction were Finis
Valorum and Bail Antilles.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.249
The Rim Faction was its biggest opposition.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:43.899
The Rim Faction composed mainly of non-Human
senators who represented the worlds and systems

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.280
from the Mid Rim and Outer Rim.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
Once mega corporations were allowed to be
represented as their own separate entities

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.429
within the senate, most of them joined the
Rim Faction, including the Trade Federation

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.140
and Techno Union.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.579
The Rim Faction was against the Republic’s
central government from gaining more power

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.789
and they fought for less regulations and taxation.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.720
They were also for open and free trade markets
among their respective outlying systems.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.140
Major members of this faction were Orn Free
Taa and Nute Gunray.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.060
Actually Palpatine was nominated by the Rim
Faction during his run for Supreme Chancellorship.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.770
Although he wasn’t apart of their faction,
Palpatine did side with them on many policies

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.750
due to Naboo being in the Mid Rim.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.310
They picked him because he was independent
and had the best chance of winning when compared

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.440
to most of the other senators within the faction
itself.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.970
But Palpatine only used the Rim Faction as
a means to gain power, as after he became

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.140
Supreme Chancellor he began to side more with
the Core Faction and their policies.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.150
When the Separatist Crisis started, many of
the Rim Faction’s leaders and senators left

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.870
the Republic and joined the forming Confederacy
of Independent Systems.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.280
In response to the Rim Faction’s members
leaving the Republic, a new faction was created

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.910
called the Loyalists Committee.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.010
It included Senators who were completely devoted
in preserving the Republic and wished to keep

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.570
the galaxy united.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.710
Palpatine actually found this faction, promoting
its creation as a means to combat corruption

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.350
and forming peace talks with disgruntled senators
who had left the Republic.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.930
However he of course manipulated it to instead
increase tensions between both sides which

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.850
helped accelerate the start of the clone wars.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.930
Bail Organa and Padme Amidala were notable
members of this faction.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.510
We also have the smaller Militarist faction
within the senate around this time.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.880
They were senators who supported the idea
of the Republic rebuilding its army and navy

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.740
and for it to become a military power once
again.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.810
Although originally they didn’t have much
support, they began to grow in size once more

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.880
and more conflicts began to arise in the outer
rim that the Jedi couldn’t solve, as well

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.850
as when they began to embrace Humanist superiority
ideals.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.100
They were one of the biggest supporters of
the Military creation act which created the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.540
Grand Army of the Republic and authorized
the use of the Clone Army.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.290
A notable member of the Militarist faction
was Ranulph Tarkin.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.970
During the Clone Wars many new factions were
formed as a response to the ongoing galactic

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.830
war.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.530
One of the major factions was the Council
of Neutral Systems.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.210
They were senators and representatives who
wished to have their worlds and systems be

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.980
neutral in the conflict between the Republic
and the Separatists during the Clone Wars.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.490
Over 1,500 star systems were apart of this
organization, and it was led by Queen Satine

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.430
Kryze of Mandalore.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.870
The other major faction to arise during the
clone wars was the delegation of 2000.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.530
It was made up of senators and representatives
who opposed Palpatine’s increase in power

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.060
and abuse of emergency powers.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.100
They feared that he was trying to undermine
the Senate’s authority while in turn giving

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.630
himself as much power as possible.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.250
They wished to protect the democratic elements
of the Republic and to return its state back

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.590
to how it was before Palpatine took office.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.660
Notable members of this faction were Bail
Organa, Mon Mothma, Jar Jar Binks and Padme

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.320
Amidala.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.760
Once the Empire formed, 63 members of the
Delegation of 2000 were arrested for suspected

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.120
treasonous actions, which resulted in half
of its members to leave the faction out of

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120
fear.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.910
During the Empire’s reign, members of this
faction were the biggest opponents of Emperor

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.590
Palpatine, with some of them eventually forming
the Rebel Alliance.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.120
In contrast to the Delegation of 2000, there
was the New Order Party within the Imperial

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.130
senate which consisted of senators that supported
Emperor Palpatine and all of his actions.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.320
However it was eventually disbanded, along
with every other political faction and party,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.250
after the Imperial Senate was dissolved around
19 years after the Empire was created.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.551
In the New Star Wars Trilogy, the New Republic
is created after the fall of the Galactic

00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:57.730
Empire.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.030
With the New Republic came with a new galactic
senate which had two major political factions:

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.110
the Centrists and the Populists.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.730
The Centrists advocated for the expansion
of the New Republic’s central government

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.130
and for a more connected galaxy.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.000
Many senators of this faction came from the
wealthier worlds of the galaxy.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.440
They supported more funding for the New Republic
military and even defended the old Galactic

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.860
Empire to some extent.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.169
Actually there was a whole sub faction of
Centrists that even admired the old empire

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.000
and wished to reimplement, in their words,
the policies that actually worked from the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
old empire.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.840
They even fought for the New Republic’s
military to look more like the Imperial military

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.400
from the past, as a means to give it a greater
image of power and unity.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.430
Despite their call for a more unified and
connected galaxy, some Centrists believed

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.920
that individual planets should take more responsibility
on fixing their own problems and to not greatly

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.510
depend on the New Republic’s assistance
for every little issue they may have.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.790
They also supported free trade among worlds.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.930
The Populists on the other hand were opposed
of strengthening the New Republic’s central

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.020
government and its military.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.560
They believed in each planet being allowed
more independence and given more freedom on

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.479
its decisions on how their people should live.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.560
There was actually two extreme sub factions
within the populists.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.310
One sub faction wanted to essentially make
the entire Republic into a direct democracy

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.790
by allowing the general public to directly
vote on major decisions within the senate,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:36.110
which would mean tens of trillions of citizens
would be allowed to vote on major senate bills.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.100
The other sub faction instead wanted to completely
dissolve the senate and give full sovereignty

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:46.450
to all the planets, giving them full independence
and freedom to do as they pleased.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.360
Leia Organa was a major member of the Populist
faction, though she was not a member of either

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.470
extreme sub factions.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.020
However her political career in the senate
was destroyed after it became public knowledge

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.449
that she was related to Darth Vader.

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:05.930
And those are the major political factions
and parties of the Star Wars galaxy across

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.979
the 3 main eras.

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:13.050
Based on the summaries we gave of each faction,
which one would you guys most likely support?

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:23.379
Let us know in the comments below!
