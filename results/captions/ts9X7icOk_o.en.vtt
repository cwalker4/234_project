hey guys it's Kelly again and welcome
back to my channel

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.470
for this video I'm going to talk about
some of the different things that I've

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.840
observed about Germany as an American
living here and what's better than

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.510
seeing a crazy girl walk down the street
talking to herself into a camera? alright

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:34.920
let's go! I think when a lot of
Americans think about Germany they

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.750
immediately think about beer and
Oktoberfest and I was really surprised

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.690
to actually learn how popular wine is...
how many wine fests there are, and I'm

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.860
living in wine region. All up and down
the Rhine there are so many vineyards

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.449
producing just tons of wine. Before
moving to Germany I of course knew about

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.090
Oktoberfest and I knew about Christmas
markets but I did not realize how many

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.350
fests there are in Germany I feel like I
stumble across fest all the time whether

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.540
they're in Mainz or in other cities in
Germany that I'm travelling to... they're

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.810
everywhere! I had no idea what Fasching
was before I came to Germany and I know

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.750
that I'm kind of cutting this short you
know I'm not really giving it the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.350
explanation it deserves but it's
basically like the German version of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.060
Mardi Gras. everybody gets dressed up
they're partying there are parades it's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.970
a huge huge like day in Mainz and I
think cologne has another one of the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.680
bigger celebrations in Germany and it's
a lot of fun. one of my favorite favorite

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.290
things about Germany is the public
transportation. it is so much more

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.479
prevalent here and I think that's pretty
well known in the u.s. we just don't

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.340
have a lot of public trans and I hate it
but I love in Germany how like every

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.079
city has a train station and you can get
anywhere for pretty cheap I mean the ICE

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.800
trains start running really really
high but the regional train prices

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.510
aren't that bad
and then if you can't get a train there

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.709
then you can like take a bus. the buses
go everywhere and of course we have

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.629
trains we have metros we have buses the
metros and the buses are pretty much

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:29.709
just in the major cities. this is the
train station in Mainz. I've been to that

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.849
train station a lot. I think it's
relatively user friendly I haven't

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.690
really had too many issues but I think I
actually might make a video about riding

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.349
a train in Germany. there's a
tradition that I learned about in

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.720
Germany where a couple that just got
married

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.360
might have a ribbon tied to an antenna
or the windshield wiper on the back

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.290
window and they're supposed to keep it
on there until it falls off for good

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.519
luck for the marriage. I don't really
know if that's like a big tradition in

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.780
the u.s. I've never heard of it. I have
seen couples like have their car

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.079
decorated for the car that they're gonna
drive away from the ceremony or the

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.530
reception in but I don't really think
there's any sort of tradition behind

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.329
leaving those ribbons or those
decorations on. I also have witnessed a

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.819
few like I don't know what they're
called but they're like a group of like

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.019
the groomsmen or the bridesmaids with
the bride or the groom and they'll go

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.600
out and they'll sell little bottles of
liquor and from what I understand it's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.470
to help like raise money for the wedding
or maybe it's just to help pay for the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.989
bride's drinks that night but I've just
seen like big groups of people running

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.530
around dressed a little crazy and
clearly inebriated having fun like this.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.810
I laughed pretty hard when I learned
that Germans call cell phones

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.139
Handys because that is not what handy
means in America.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.680
Germans are, in my opinion, like pretty
collectively pretty healthy people. they

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.889
seem to place a high emphasis on
exercise they have really great food

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.870
regulations... but one thing that I was
just really really surprised by because

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.270
it clashes against this seemingly very
healthy outlook on life, this

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.970
healthy lifestyle, is that a lot of
people in Germany smoke. it is a very

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.979
stark contrast between what you would
see in the states and I really just

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.259
don't understand how smoking is still so
popular here when we know how bad it is

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:47.050
for you. I even see advertisements for
tobacco products here and those have

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.690
been outlawed in the States for a really
long time like I think before I was born

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.150
or maybe shortly thereafter. I mean they
even have cigarette vending machines

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.430
which is crazy to me... they look like this.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.710
but I guess in an attempt to deter
people from smoking the tobacco products

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.259
here have like really really disturbing
and disgusting pictures of like rotting

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:23.280
organs or someone dying or a baby and
it's like a big campaign to try to

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.800
address how dangerous smoking is.
cellphone plans are way cheaper here

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.349
than they are in the US we are getting
straight robbed in the states with our

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:44.740
cellphone plans. can anyone in the
comments tell me why that is? when I

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.440
first moved here I started to notice all
of these gold tiles like in the ground

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.389
and I finally took the time to look at
them and realize what they were.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.050
they're known as stumbling blocks and
they're put into the ground in front of

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.620
the last known address for people who
were murdered during the Holocaust. the

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.750
block shows the name of the victim, their
birth date, death date, and where they

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.599
died. and when I went to look up those
stumbling blocks

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.690
I learned that they're actually a really
controversial some people agree with

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.469
them and some people do not. I noticed
that there were a few stores that had

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.240
"Mc" in front of it and I came to learn
that "Mc"means discounted or cheap

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.110
which to me that feels slightly racist
and I've never even been aware of any

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.620
sort of stereotype that Scottish people
are supposed to be cheap.

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:42.029
this is the Romer Passage which is nice
to be able to walk through because it's

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:46.949
cooler in the summer and then warmer in
the winter and it's got a bunch of shops

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.369
and restaurants. Germans are all issued a
national ID and they have an obligatory

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:57.569
identification law which means that you
have to have that ID on you and the

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:02.189
police can stop you and ask to see your
ID or at least that's how I understand

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.069
it if I'm wrong please put it in the
comments.

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:11.729
I feel like German dogs can go
everywhere. I haven't looked into the

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:17.099
laws but I see them out and about in
public a lot. I've seen them on trains in

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:22.919
stores in restaurants and it seems like
that's perfectly fine but in America

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.209
there's a lot of places where you can't
take dogs. there's health codes against

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.659
bringing dogs into restaurants in
certain cities... of course it's

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:35.849
state-by-state county by county city by
city but you don't really see dogs out

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:41.699
in public as much. we even have hiking
trails where dogs are not allowed. I get

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:48.409
the feeling that Germans tend to marry
and have kids at a much later age

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:53.879
whereas in this States I think there's
like this still this societal pressure

00:07:53.879 --> 00:08:01.879
for people to get married and start
having a family way early on in life.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.800
I'm gonna be honest when I first started
riding my bike around Germany to get to

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.840
work or wherever I was going I only paid
attention to the signs for cars. in the

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.930
States bicycling I feel like isn't as
popular and so we don't really have that

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.509
many signs directed towards bicyclists.
that is not the case in Germany. there

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:29.970
are actually a ton of signs directing
bicyclists where they can go, what speed

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.219
they can go, where they can't go and I
very quickly learned to start paying

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:39.270
attention to these signs. they look like
this.... if I understand this correctly this

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.459
is a pedestrian zone it's a walking area
we're gonna walk through it next and

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:50.670
bicyclists are free to ride on market
and event free days and they have to go

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.380
at a walking pace. in a lot of ways
Germany appears to be more liberal or

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.279
more socially progressive than the u.s.
they're way more comfortable with sex

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:04.200
and nudity, they're censorship laws are
far more relaxed, I think you can swear

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.390
on TV like any word and it's not an
issue, and you're allowed to drink in

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.800
public but in a lot of ways they're not.
like I was really surprised to learn

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.079
that gay marriage was legalized only a
year ago. I walked out of my apartment

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:22.920
and I saw all of these celebrations
going on this was like a year ago I

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.750
think and it was because gay marriage
had finally been legalized here. also

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.020
it's not legal to smoke weed here
whereas that's becoming more and more

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.510
legal across the states. so this is the
Guttenberg Platz it's an awesome area as

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.260
you can see there are some restaurants
that set out their tables for people to

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.180
be able to sit and enjoy the outdoors
and watch the people go by, the buildings

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.110
are all really really pretty and several
days throughout the week there's a

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.520
market held here.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:59.120
and when the weather starts getting nice
they start having wine available at this

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.560
market is called the fruhstuck markt
which means breakfast market they'll be

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.880
selling wine at 10:00 in the morning and
everyone will be out here drinking

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.060
having a good time and again that's a
really big difference from what I

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.260
remember in this states. you can get a cup
of wine from one of the wine tents and

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.270
just walk away whereas in the states, if
it's a sort of event that allows beer

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.830
there is no way that you would be able
to leave the premises of that event that

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.630
are probably marked with a fence or some
sort of boundary and walk away with

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.890
alcohol in your hand because we do not
allow public drinking. but I will say

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.150
there are some cities that do allow
public drinking there is a city in

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.040
Montana that I've been to that I know
allows public drinking for example and I

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.530
think New Orleans even allows public
drinking.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.230
Mainz is where Johannes Gutenberg is
from and yes that's Gutenberg as in the

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:03.360
Gutenberg press and so they have a
Gutenberg Platz and they have a museum

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.680
dedicated to him and it has some of the
original Bibles and some of the original

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.480
printing presses. it's pretty cool
because you can go in there and actually

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.380
use one of the presses to make something
and they let you take it home. of course

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.120
I knew that the Berlin Wall came down
right about 30 years ago but what I

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.290
didn't know is that Germans actually pay
a specific tax to help try to continue

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.450
to economically rehabilitate East
Germany because they're still suffering

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.190
some of the consequences from that time
period I also learned that this tax is

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.780
quite controversial. in the u.s. I've
never seen crosswalk lights be in the

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.670
form of characters this is the mainzelmaechen character. so there seems to be a

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.200
pretty strong American influence here in
Germany that I didn't expect. I didn't

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.300
expect to see as many English words
whether it's on business signs or on

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.670
t-shirts or wherever. I was really
surprised by that and I'm actually

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:07.620
really curious what Germans think of
that...is that annoying to you? do you like

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.140
it? is it do you even notice it? I am in
FischtorPlatz right now which is this

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.360
little area with a green space and it's
one of my favorite places in Mainz and I

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.510
actually used to live on FischtorPlatz before I moved in with my

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:28.710
boyfriend. this is my old place and these
doors actually open up to a little

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.490
parking area that I was able to park in
and it definitely demonstrated to me

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.380
that cars are just a little smaller here
than they are in the US. it's rare to see

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.850
a pickup truck, you don't really see the
big SUVs we have in the States,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:48.900
and I could barely fit my car into this
parking area not just the space but the

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.510
lane that led to my parking spot was so
tight and very difficult to back in and

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.570
out of. another difference is that
Germany and a lot of other European

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.700
countries right their addresses
differently. so we will put the house

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.360
number and then the street after it
whereas

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.860
here you put the street and then the
number. so I would have said that I live

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.200
at 21 FischtorPlatz if I was thinking
in the American way but here in Germany

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.589
it's FischtorPlatz 21. I feel like I can put my address out

00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:22.800
there because I don't live there anymore.
the reason why I loved where my

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.470
apartment was so much is because not
only was it on

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.570
FischtorPlatz and really close to the
wine fest and everything that was going

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.100
on in Mainz but also because it's really
close to the Rhine and there's this path

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.779
that goes all up and down the Rhine
where you can either walk or run or ride

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:44.760
your bike on. the Rhine is a major
waterway in Germany and not only do

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.209
cargo ships go up and down it but
there's a lot of cruise ships... you have

00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:54.959
luxury cruises and then more I would say
casual ferries. brothels are legal in

00:13:54.959 --> 00:14:01.529
Germany and while I knew that, I didn't
realize when they say red-light district

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:06.120
referring to that very particular
district in Amsterdam it's named that

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.000
after the buildings with red lights that
signify the fact that it's a brothel.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.190
like I just never put that together that
when you see a building with fluorescent

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.260
red lights that's what it is whereas in
America I feel like we have fluorescent

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.899
lights everywhere of all different
colors it doesn't mean anything. for all

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:33.480
my gamers out there, I learned that the
video game versions for PC is way more

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.230
popular in Germany than the versions
that are made for specific gaming

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.230
consoles. when I went snowboarding in the
Alps

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:46.649
I learned very quickly how much more
popular skiing is here than snowboarding.

00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:50.100
I feel like when I would go in the
States you'd actually see a lot of

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:56.310
boarders maybe it'd even be like 50/50
but in the Alps it was by far dominated

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.860
by skiers with very few boarders.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:08.840
Germany has elected a woman as their
Chancellor for 13 years in a row now

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.000
which is different because I feel like
in the US a lot of people can't even

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.850
fathom the idea of having a woman as
president. there are a lot of ice cream

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.020
shops in Germany and I feel like that's
a big difference. yes there are ice cream

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.760
shops in the states but I feel like there
are far fewer in the States than there

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.840
are in Germany or in Europe as a whole
and some of the bigger ice cream shops

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:38.420
in Germany have these really really
elaborate sundaes and they have this

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.560
dessert called spaghetti eis which i
think is like geared toward kids and

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.900
it's actually ice cream that's really
truly shaped to look like spaghetti or

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.940
even spaghetti carbonara. so along with
writing addresses, another thing that

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:59.510
Germans write differently is the date. we
often put the month first and then the

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.190
date and then the year whereas in
Germany they'll put the date first and

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:09.740
then the month and then the year and
that can get a little confusing. another

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:15.380
thing that can get confusing is that
when writing numbers, they use a period

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:22.430
where we use comma and vice versa. so if
you're saying $2,000 and 34 cents it'll

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:28.160
be two point zero zero zero comma three
four whereas in the states it would be

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.170
two comma zero zero zero point three
four. a little bit of a difference. I

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.470
probably should have talked more about
this when I was at the train station but

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.650
I think it's entirely feasible to be
able to live in Germany without a car

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:47.690
depending on where you work because
the cities are so walkable, there are

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:53.540
bicycle paths everywhere where you don't
even really need to be on a road and if

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.970
you are on a road there are bicycle
lanes.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:01.010
it is so bike friendly. and yeah I mean
the public transportation like I said is

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:06.020
on point whereas in the states I feel
like it is very difficult for you to be

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.459
able to live without a car unless you
live in a major city. I'm just thinking

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:13.140
about the places I've lived and where I
grew

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:19.679
and I would have to walk like six miles
just to get groceries. this is one of my

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:24.720
favorite parts of Mainz. I love walking
here. of course on a day when everything

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.910
is open it's a little bit more lively
and bustley and everyone is shopping and

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:35.400
eating and enjoying themselves. bars in
Germany do not have a fixed legally

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.500
mandated closing time like we have in
the States. in the US, the bars have to

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.090
close at two but in Germany you could be
out drinking at a bar all night long as

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.380
long as that establishment wants to stay
open that late so it's really nothing to

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.700
see someone stumbling out of a bar
Sunday morning after an entire night of

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.380
drinking we're seeing a bunch of drunk
people or hungover people on the train

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.690
in the early morning I have seen it
alive in my travels here. I think there

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.110
are a lot of Americans who might not
think that our fast food restaurants are

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:13.950
over here in Germany but they definitely
are here and as an American living in

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:19.590
Germany I've actually gone out of my way
even more to avoid going to McDonald's

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.240
or Burger King or KFC because I feel
like it is a cliche for me to go to one

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.350
of those restaurants. I think Mainz is
your typical German old city or Alstadt

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.720
as they say in German where you have old
buildings that survived both world wars

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.540
among new buildings that were built
probably where old buildings had been

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:44.150
destroyed like right behind me you can
see that juxtaposition between buildings.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.720
there are a lot of differences between
Germany and the u.s. that I've noticed

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.919
these are really just a few so if you
haven't yet, subscribe to my channel to

00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:56.250
catch those. I'm gonna go and try to find
some coffee and enjoy this beautiful

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:03.180
morning. thanks for joining me on this
walk guys! bye
