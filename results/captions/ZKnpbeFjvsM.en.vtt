00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.509
So everybody wants to be a great networker,
but only a few people know how to play the

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.899
game the right way.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.150
So, because of that, I decided to explain
networking in a completely different way.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.639
Obviously I used the word, "Casanova" because
he was a charmer and there's a part of networking

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.669
and charming that both go together.

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:23.560
So whether you know this or not, you network
in one of six different ways, and it has a

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.199
lot to do with how, if you think about a player,
stay with me here.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.710
If you think about a player, a man who is
very good with women, right?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.520
Just think about a player, someone that is
very good with women.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.800
They typically have one of six different styles
of how they get good with women.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.059
Think about this for a moment here.

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.950
The most common style we hear about is the
flirt.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.950
What is the flirt?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.539
The flirt is a guy that's very good at flirting
with girls.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.440
He's got very good at charming them and seducing
them with his words.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.820
He gets to network and gets to the girl he
wants to with words.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.219
He's the flirt.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.100
The second type of player is the detective.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.310
The detective is the guy who goes and likes
a girl and let's say he likes Michelle, he

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.789
finds out everything about Michelle.

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.940
He finds out what's her favorite car, her
favorite song, favorite flower, favorite food,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.330
favorite drink, favorite everything.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.190
He finds out every single thing about Michelle
because he's a researcher.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.270
He researches so much about Michelle so by
the time he's asking her out, he already has

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.770
a lot of info.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.390
These types of networkers are amazing at what
they do.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.860
The third one is the promoter.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.680
The promoter is somebody that let's say he
likes Michelle.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.970
The same guy that likes Michelle.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.530
He goes and befriends Michelle's best friends,
five of them.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.729
And he does so good with her best friends.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.890
Treats them well, takes care of them, you
know, whatever they want to do with the nightclub,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.920
restaurant, with the ticket, with whatever
it is, he helps them.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.700
Then he goes and becomes good friends with
Michelle's dad or mom and he volunteers and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.840
he helps out.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.149
Next thing you know, Michelle has seven different
people who have the most influence on her

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.729
telling her how amazing Billy is.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.580
And she realizes maybe she should give this
Billy kid a shot.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.119
And boom, they go out.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.590
The fourth type is the success.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.470
This is the guy that says, "I'm not the best-looking
guy in school, but here's what I'm going to

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.470
do.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.430
I'm going to become so successful that Michelle
has to date me, and she will give more attention

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.480
to me because I'm going to become so successful.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.880
So networkers that become so successful that
everyone is talking about their success.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.580
And then boom, people do business with them.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.780
The fifth style is the man.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.440
This is the person that has the reputation.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.680
Everybody talks about his reputation.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000
Oh, you know how he is, he's amazing with
the girls.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.210
He's amazing.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.360
He's got a reputation.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.300
In business, "Oh, if you work with this guy,
he's amazing.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Reputation.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.430
And the last one is the comedian.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.970
If you've ever met a guy that charms a girl
with his humor, he's just funny -- I like

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.530
him so much, he makes me laugh.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.530
Every time I'm around him, he just makes me
laugh.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.590
Great networkers, and eventually she says,
"I don't know why, but I think I'm falling

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.910
in love with the guy.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.910
This is so weird.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.510
We were just friends and every time I'm around
him he just makes me feel.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.400
. . my boyfriend doesn't make me feel that
way.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.050
That's a networker.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.710
He's incredible at networking and all of a
sudden, she is now dating Billy, because Billy

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.050
is great at making her laugh.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.940
So all of these six steps, whether you know
it or not, not knowingly, you are generally

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.410
going to network, charm or prospect two of
these six ways.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.490
Sometimes only one, but two of these six ways.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.120
Sometimes you do more, but generally it's
going to be two of these six ways that you

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.500
will network and charm people.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.970
So now let's take this right into networking.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.980
So there are certain ways, certain things
you can do to become a networker.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.630
I'm going to give you 18 tips on how to be
a solid networker.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.540
These are some I've used in my entire career.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.370
And there are many things here that you'll
get that you'll say, "I've never heard of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.370
this one before.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.520
I've never heard of that one before."

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.290
Every one of these ways has worked for me.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.290
Just so you know that.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.900
And some of them are just things you need
to do and some of them are more actionable

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.900
items.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:04.000
#1: The first mistake everybody makes is that
most people have no idea who they want as

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.170
a customer.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.770
Who is your customer?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.310
They don't know.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.319
I was at an event in a Dallas office.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.060
I was at this office in Dallas and I got up
and I'm trying to make this point about networking.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.600
I said, "Let me ask you guys a question here.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600
Who's single here?"

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.530
A bunch of people raised their hands.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.320
I said, "Who would like to settle down and
find a real good girl?"

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.770
One guy raises his hand.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.770
Who knows what they want?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.770
The guy raises he hand.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.770
I said, "Why don't you stand up."

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.770
He stood up.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.461
I said, "Tell me exactly what you're looking
for in a woman."

00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:33.650
He said, "I want her to be nice, I want her
to be church-going.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.460
I want her to uh. . ." and he was stuck.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.080
He had no idea what he wanted.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.860
He was in his early 30s and didn't have a
girlfriend.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.360
He had no clue what he wants.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.320
It's just not going to happen, if you don't
know what you want.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.470
The same goes with who you want to network
with.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.160
Why is that so important?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.720
Once you know who your customer is, these
are the things you need to know:

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.470
Age
Married or Single -- what is the status of

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.760
where they're at?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.910
Income Level - what type of income are they
making?

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.660
Where do they live?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.620
What is the demographic?

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.720
Education

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.880
You know all this stuff you've got to do.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.820
Then once you know who it is, the next question
you've got to ask is who is connected with

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.150
this customer.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.150
What do I mean by this?

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.410
Watch this here.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.490
Let's just say your customer is a 70-year-old,
okay?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.110
70 is your customer that you want to network
with.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.780
Who knows, or does business with 70 year olds?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.780
Now watch this.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.480
Who does business with 70 year olds?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.370
You may go and ask certain CPAs.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.920
You may go and ask certain attorneys.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.370
You may go and ask certain people that are
working with retirement planning or estate

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.040
planning or insurance or health insurance
or doctors or maybe you're going to talk to

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.480
doctors that deal with heart problems or something
that deals with that age.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.640
Then you know how to get to your customer,
because you first need to know who you know,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.550
then you need to know who knows your customer
and get connected to them.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.630
If your customer is somebody that is, I don't
know, if your customer is somebody that makes

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.310
six figures.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.310
Who do you need to know?

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.180
You need to find out who knows people who
make six figures and get connected to them.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.810
This is not a hard thing to do, by the way.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.570
This is not a very hard thing to do.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.330
Once you figure out this formula, then you
work backwards.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.470
#1, that's the first point.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.900
#2: The second thing about networking is research
who you're trying to reach.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.290
Remember how we talked about the detective?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.290
Research.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.960
Maybe you want to get connected with somebody
who is going to get you into a massive market

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.710
and you want to figure out a way to do business
with that person.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.180
Research that person.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.169
Research what's their favorite book, favorite
cigar, favorite drink, favorite food, favorite

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.169
bottle of wine.

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.169
Do they like wine?

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:49.169
Do they not like cigars?

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.169
Do they not like.

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.169
. . who's their favorite sports team?

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.199
You know, what city did they grow up in?

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.210
Do they like that city?

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.210
What ethnicity are they?

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.210
Are they from America?

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.210
Were they born in America?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.210
Were they in the military before?

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.210
Did they like the military?

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.620
How as their experience in the military?

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.620
Do they have a hero?

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.350
Who do they look up to?

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.470
Whatever it is, then you pack it, and connect
them through that.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.860
I remember one time I got an email.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.740
A lot of people on LinkedIn send me a lot
of different messages.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.770
And one time I got an email from this commercial
real estate agent.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.979
And it was so well written.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.000
I was so amazed by this guy.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.770
His name is Forrest.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:28.020
He sends me this email and he says, "I just
want you to know that I've been following

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:35.540
your content and I heard about you through
a friend and I had a chance to go read your

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:42.259
book, 25 Laws for Doing the Impossible and
I like #13 and . . . here's why I like law

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:48.479
#13 because it reminded me of . . . and your
style of this is so good and we have something

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:49.479
in common.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:51.190
We both like the Lakers and. . . all this
stuff he said.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.360
He said, "I would love to get 15 minutes of
your time."

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.460
So, he's a success and he bragged about himself
a little bit.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.940
He was very good about bragging about himself
a little bit, which is what you need to do.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.590
We'll talk about that here in a minute.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.759
So I said, "Great, let's get on a call."

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.759
So we get on a call.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.789
This is three years ago.

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:06.789
We get on a call.

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:08.740
Here's what the call sounds like.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.419
"Oh my gosh, it's great.

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:13.960
. . " 10 minutes, 12 minutes, into the call
I asked, "What do you do?"

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.820
Oh, I'm a commercial real estate agent.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.820
Oh really?

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.820
Yeah.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.820
Tell me about that a little bit.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.940
He said, Well, you know, what I'm doing, my
specialty is the valley -- and I'm in the

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.940
valley.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.940
And then I connected the dots.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.630
I had just listed my property -- it's a massive
property I had - the commission check was

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.960
an $80,000 check.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.550
I had just listed my property and this guy
found out about the property, he researched,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.240
but nothing throughout that time, when I was
speaking to him, I never felt like he was

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.720
trying to impose the sale.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.240
Then we talked about the deal.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.600
And I said, If anyone's going to do commercial
real estate, this is exactly how you need

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.809
to approach people like me that can potentially
get you $50,000 - $100,000 deals.

00:08:57.809 --> 00:08:58.809
I was so impressed.

00:08:58.809 --> 00:08:59.809
Why?

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:01.829
Because #2, he did so much research.

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:03.350
He was the detective.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.110
He did so much research is what he did.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.529
#3: Give Yourself to the Top.

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:08.910
I love gifting myself to the top.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.310
I give this challenge to anybody that's in
real estate and sales and insurance and financial

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.310
services.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.310
I've got a challenge for you.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.310
Here's my challenge.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.430
Say you have 100 existing clients or you've
got 50 existing clients and 50 people who

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.709
would like to be your clients, okay, and they're
connectors.

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:30.309
What I mean by connectors is somebody works
at a country club, and he knows everybody

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:34.110
because everybody at that country club who
goes and buys stuff, they all know this guy.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.209
But he's a guy that's a caddy or something
like that.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:41.170
He's not the country club manager, for instance.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:46.800
Take 100 bottles of wine, 3, 4, 5 6 dollar
bottles of wine, $10 bottle of wine, whatever

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800
it is.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.759
Take 100 of them.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:53.269
That's $600 to $800 investment.

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:59.879
Take the next 60 days and give away 1 or 2
bottles of wine a day to one of your customers

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.829
or to one of the people that you want to do
business with.

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:04.240
Or someone who knows who you want to do business
with.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.029
He's going to connect you with who you want
to do business with.

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:12.579
Now, you take those bottles of wine and you
go and say, "Hey John, I just wanted to say,

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.120
thank you so much for being a great client.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.509
I really like you as a client.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:16.509
You're so great.

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:19.480
You treat me so good out of respect, and there
are so many clients that are emotional, but

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.480
you're so steady.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.260
I just wanted to show you my appreciation,
no reason, just wanted to give you this bottle

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.550
of wine and than you for your service."

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.230
Oh my gosh, you didn't have to do that.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.260
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.260
It's just great.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.429
They will say, "Man, I feel so bad, how can
I help you?"

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:35.679
I mean, John, you know, the way I make my
money is through referrals.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:39.470
The best way you can pay back is if you know
anybody that's this this this, you know if

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.679
you know anybody.

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:42.819
. . Oh, you know what?

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:46.110
You know, we just talked last week, one of
my friends who was working over here they're

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.220
thinking about buying a house and they don't
like their current real estate agent.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.649
Why don't you call them?

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:51.649
You should call them.

00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:52.649
Oh, great.

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:53.649
What's their name?

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:54.649
Boom.

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:55.649
How easy that is.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:56.649
Piece of cake.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.769
I used to give away books all the time.

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:01.550
I'd give away so many books all the time.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:08.730
And they almost always, if I spent $1,000
on books, I always 10xd the money.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:17.149
If I spent $600 on wine, I almost always made,
minimum, 6 - 30, $40,000 for giving away 100

00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:19.019
bottles of wine at $6, $7, $8, $10.

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:20.389
It always worked for me.

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:21.970
I've never seen it not work.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.720
Obviously, you need to do your follow up and
you need to do it in a very proper way, but

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
it always works.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720
But give yourself to the top.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.180
One of the guys I work with, Jose, he's phenomenal
at getting referrals.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.370
By far one of the best at getting referrals.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.579
He goes to a client's house, he asks the client,
"What's your dream car?"

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:40.319
The client says, "I would like to one day
buy a brand spanking new Jaguar."

00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:41.500
He says, Oh my gosh, that's great.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.660
That's a nice car.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.660
Makes a note.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.660
Leaves.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.430
Second appointment, he goes and buys the same
exact Jaguar that he wants as a toy.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.430
Spends $50.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.649
And he comes back to the client and says,
"I have a surprise for you, a gift."

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:55.649
He says, "What's that?"

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:58.119
Last time I was here you told me that your
favorite car is a Jaguar.

00:11:58.119 --> 00:12:01.319
Look, I couldn't go buy the Jaguar brand new
because it's $80,000, but I said I could do

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:04.249
the second best thing he's a Jaguar toy for
you.

00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:06.670
And he gives this Jaguar toy.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.440
That client ends up making him thousands of
dollars.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.290
He spent $60 on a Jaguar toy, simply because
he's paying attention to the client on what

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.259
the client is saying and he's gifting himself
to the top.

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:19.949
You can gift your way to the top in the area
of networking.

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:21.310
#4:Take Care of Your Image.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.310
Very simple.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.310
Always be presentable.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.100
#5: Be a little bit shameless and a little
bit fearless.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.869
You cannot be the flirt is a little bit shameless.

00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:32.329
The flirt is a little bit shameless.

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:35.480
He's willing to approach the girl and say
certain things that maybe you're not willing

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.589
to do.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.449
And you're like, "Oh, no, no, there is no
way she's going to like that."

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:43.220
The flirt can actually get away with that,
because he's a little bit shameless.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.251
And you're ashamed a little bit.

00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:45.251
What if she doesn't like this?

00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:46.251
He's shameless.

00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:49.730
This style (flirt) requires you to be a little
bit shameless.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.570
A little bit fearless.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.679
The guy who dated the hottest girl at school
-- always remember this - the guy who dated

00:12:55.679 --> 00:13:00.999
the hottest girl in school generally was the
guy who was shameless.

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:02.660
Generally was a guy who was shameless.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.449
There's a part of him that had the guts to
go ask her out.

00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:06.449
#6: Be visible.

00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:09.610
Let me explain to you what I mean by being
visible.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.610
Be visible.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.410
Be in their face regularly.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.529
Be relevant whether it's social media, you
know, being out there.

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:17.529
Be visible.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:18.529
Go to the events.

00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:20.119
If there's local events in your area, go to
these events.

00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:22.139
Go to the places that everybody goes to.

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:25.980
If there's certain national conventions that
have to do with your industry, go to every

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.980
single one of them.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.980
Because they're going to see you.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.249
There are certain areas they need to see you
over and over and oh my gosh, you see her

00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:33.249
again.

00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:34.249
Oh, it's you again.

00:13:34.249 --> 00:13:36.170
Hey, let me introduce you, this is Jack.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.839
Jack and I. . . are friends.

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:41.410
Connect.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.980
Okay?

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.410
Because you're constantly being visible.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.490
They constantly see you.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.559
They're constantly seeing you.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.339
It's almost like you're at five different
places at the same time.

00:13:49.339 --> 00:13:54.939
Like Ryan Seacrest in LA. Ryan Seacreast - it
feels like he's on five different shows at

00:13:54.939 --> 00:13:55.939
the same time.

00:13:55.939 --> 00:14:00.490
It kind of pays him 40 million dollars a year,
so it pays to be very, very visible.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:06.699
#7: next, Have Credible Names Building You
Up.

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:11.249
If you're always helping out, you're eventually
going to have certain credible names that

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:12.249
know about you.

00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:13.790
The other day I read a book I really liked.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.429
The book was written by a guy named Jules.

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:21.179
So I sent an email to Jules after I read the
book and I said, "Hey, I really like your

00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:22.179
book, Jules."

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:24.990
I sent this email from a flight.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.149
"I really like this book, Jules."

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:29.649
He took that email and he posted it on social
media platforms.

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:32.410
It said, "Patrick Bet-David said he liked
my book."

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.410
Great.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.240
Then he responds back and he says, "Do you
mind giving me an endorsement?"

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.489
Do you mind saying something about this book
and taking a picture of you with the book?"

00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:41.489
I thought, you know what, good for you.

00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:45.920
Because he wants credible people to see them
saying good things about him.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.980
And it's not that hard to get quotes from
people, just so you know that.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.239
Just make sure you're giving something in
return.

00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:53.939
People ask me all the time, hey, Pat, can
you give me an endorsement?

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:57.290
And I say, I don't even know what you're doing.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.939
So you start off with how can I help, then
you ask.

00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:02.649
You don't just come and say, "Gimme, gimme,
gimme."

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:03.649
It doesn't work that way.

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:04.649
You've got to first say, "How can I help?"

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:06.389
Then in return, can I get this?

00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:07.389
Yes.

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:09.480
So have some credible names that are saying
good things about you.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.689
#8: Have the reputation of being an expert
on what you do.

00:15:13.689 --> 00:15:14.990
That's the success.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.570
You have status.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.369
You have a reputation of being good at what
you do.

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:21.649
When you have a reputation of being an expert,
it's very easy to network with people because

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:22.759
people already know who you are.

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:25.499
So have a reputation of being a success story.

00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:29.220
#9: Be Extremely Helpful.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.749
You know, there's a certain thing like think
about a guy that's too pushy too early with

00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:35.749
a girl.

00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:37.470
I mean, that's just very ugly, right?

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.269
It's just annoying.

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:40.269
It's not the flirt.

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:43.489
Believe or or not, the flirt -- I'm not talking
about the obnoxious flirt.

00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:45.889
I'm talking about the charming flirt.

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:48.899
This is not about the obnoxious, hey, you
wanna go out, you wanna go out.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:49.899
That's obnoxious.

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:54.879
I'm talking about being extremely helpful,
always coming from a place of hey, how can

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:55.879
I help.

00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:58.089
Hey, John, is there any way I can help you?

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:02.279
And if you made 20 calls, let's just say you've
got 30 people you'd like to network with.

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:04.499
And you go their numbers.

00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:07.829
And you make a list of them today, and you
spend the next two hours calling these 30

00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:08.829
people.

00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:09.829
And you ask one question.

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:13.990
Hey John, one of the things I want to do this
month, I committed to this year, I want to

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.259
be able to help as many people as possible
with their business and I just wanted to call

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:19.259
you.

00:16:19.259 --> 00:16:21.130
I'm an entrepreneur myself and I know what
it is as an entrepreneur you need a lot of

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.379
help because you need other people that may
know the right people, the right connections.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:26.139
Maybe certain things I can help you with.

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:29.730
John, right now, what is one of the things
you're struggling with the most in business

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.730
and how can I help you?"

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.339
Out of 30 calls, half of them are going to
say, I'm totally fine, don't worry about it.

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:38.649
The other 15 is going to lead to, you know
there is one area I wouldn't mind getting

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:39.649
some help with.

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:40.709
Here's one of the things I'm struggling with.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:41.779
How do you deal with this?

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:43.489
Oh, here's what I do.

00:16:43.489 --> 00:16:45.170
. . Oh, read this article.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.399
I read this book, it helped me out.

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:48.399
Oh, no way.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.399
Yes.

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:50.399
Oh, you know what, John?

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:51.670
You're so helpful, man.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.670
Thank you.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.779
Then guess what's the line?

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:58.579
How can I help you?

00:16:58.579 --> 00:17:02.119
Then you say, You know, thank you so much,
man, you don't have to do this, but here's

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:04.699
how you can help.

00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:07.060
. . . Right?

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.110
#10: Don't invite them back to your place
too early.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.740
You know what I'm saying?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.490
Don't invite them back to your place too early.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.320
Like this netowrking isn't a one-night stand
type of thing.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.800
Networking is relationship type of thing.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.080
So don't ask for favors too early.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.040
I kind of covered that a little bit earlier.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.140
Don't ask for favors too early.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.020
It's kind of ugly, it's offensive a little
bit.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.180
And it's a turnoff.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.450
It's a very big turnoff to most people.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:38.350
If somebody generally says yes right off the
bat, there's a little bit of turnoff in there.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.350
Just so you know that.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.600
Even though you may get what you want, there's
a bit of a turnoff that's not a long-term

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.820
client, maybe.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.260
#11:Always have a positive attitude.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.660
There's nothing like having a positive attitude.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.960
People can feel by the way a positive attitude
in an email.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.790
People can feel a positive attitude in an
email, even an email people can feel positive.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.860
It was a pleasure meeting you the other day.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.750
I was so excited when you told me the story
about . . . so excited.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.430
There are certain words that can bring up
excitement in an email.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.870
#12: Develop the skill of small talk.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.490
Whether it's on email, on Facebook, on social
media, face-to-face, small talk.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.600
Current events.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.610
Hey, what do you think about what happened
with the trade recently.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.140
What do you think about Westbrook, the fact
that he stayed?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.810
If they're a sports person, have a sports
conversation.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.180
Hey, what do you think about what's going
on right now?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.500
How amazing is this political thing right
now that's going on?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.500
Right?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.500
I mean it's crazy.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.500
You've got both sides, it's just like, I've
never seen this much hate before.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.500
It's insane.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.680
What do you think about that?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.070
People don't want to touch politics, but it's
a current event.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.750
Hey, what do you think about what happened
with the weather over there?

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.750
What are your thoughts on this?

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.140
What are your thoughts on that?

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.140
Current events.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.140
Humor.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.140
The comedian, if it works for you.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.140
Entertain.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.380
Small talk is a bit of entertaining.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.380
Right?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.870
And one of the things is I would do on elevators
is let's just say I go into an elevator and

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:50.950
there's six people in there.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.950
Right?

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.350
When people walk into an elevator, the first
thing they do is what?

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.130
they stand this way and they wait for the
door to close.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.340
Try this one time.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.410
Go into the elevator and look at everybody.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.610
When the door closes behind you and say, This
is pretty uncomfortable, huh?

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.900
I read this article that said if you go into
an elevator and stand and face people, they

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900
get very uncomfortable.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.220
Are you guys a little bit uncomfortable?

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220
Yes, we're uncomfortable.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.010
I say, well. . . and that breaks the ice.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.010
That's great.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.720
And the next time in that elevator, every
time you go in, people will say, "you going

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.240
to stand like that again?"

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.240
The relationship.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.480
There's small talk.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480
How do you feel about the weather?

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.820
We live in Dallas, so every other day here
in Dallas, it changes.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.820
There's a surprise here.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.060
You can always have a weather conversation.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.530
Smile, eye contact, compliment, good handshake,
details.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.990
Everything is about details.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.371
I like the shoes you've got on.

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:33.550
Those are nice shoes.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.550
You know.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:39.150
. . Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom. . . by the way,
the watch you have on, that watch, you know,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.180
I don't know if most people know, that's a
very.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.180
. . details.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.180
Details.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.810
People like details.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.050
I like accents, because I have an accent.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.220
So I'll say, hey, I like your accent.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220
Where are you from?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.220
I'm from Britain.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.220
Very cool, you know.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.260
How long have you been in the States?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.280
I like accents.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.540
I'm always curious about where people are
from.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.490
So hey, where are you from?

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.810
Did you grow up here?

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.210
No, I grew up.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.480
. How was it?

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.140
Small talk, right?

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.080
#13 Develop listening skills.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.350
I know when someone is not interested.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.380
At all.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.380
Okay.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.060
And they're just doing it because they're
supposed to be doing it.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.420
But I also know when someone is interested.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.980
They look in my eye, they don't do these types
of things [looking at a watch].

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.110
They're just kind of giving you the entire
attention that you need, right?

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.170
When it comes down to relationships.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.640
Develop listening skills.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.160
#14: Send written notes.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.320
I'm big on written notes.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.960
I love sending cards to people.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960
Why?

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.500
Because no one's doing it any more.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.010
#15: Be a connector.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.700
And have it diverse group of connections to
connect people with.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.970
What do I mean by this?

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.100
The best auto insurance guy, the best health
insurance person, the best pediatrician, the

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.070
best doctor, the best personal trainer, the
best, chiropractor, the best whatever it is,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.070
be a connector.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.010
So when you're asking people how can I help,
you have the connectors.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.310
You have the things to connect them with.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.750
Be a very, very good connector.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.310
Keep connecting people together.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.680
And eventually you become the best connector
and everybody wants to tell you, they say,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680
you've got to go talk to John.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.160
You've got to go talk to Pat, right?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.230
#16: Have a solid brand, a very, very solid
brand, online with social media.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.770
I don't believe in business cards.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.220
There's a lot of people that say, Oh, you've
got to have a business card.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.540
I literally, I don't have business cards.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.690
I collect business cards, I don't have business
cards.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.880
That's unprofessional, Patrick.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.000
LinkedIn is your business card today.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.430
I don't need a business card today.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.960
I simply ask if you're on LinkedIn, let's
connect.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.190
What's your name?

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.190
Boom.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.190
Perfect.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.360
That's how I'm connecting nowadays.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.510
There is no business cards today.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.060
Your business card on LinkedIn says way more
than your business card is going to say on

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.060
a sheet of paper.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.260
Why would I care about your business card?

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.090
All I need is your number, I'll put your number
in my phone, and then I'll say what's your

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.500
name, I'll look you up on LinkedIn.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.950
I'll send a connection and boom, there you
have it.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.100
Now go clean up your social media profile,
your brand.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.730
Sometimes people don't even look at their
online brand.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.660
They don't realize they have a picture of
them doing a beer bong from two years ago.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.070
You've got to take that down.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:58.120
You know, they've got a picture of them twerking
and you're trying to go work with a lawyer,

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.100
and your market's going to change in two years,
but you forgot to take down that twerking

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.100
picture.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.740
You probably got to take down that twerking
picture.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.870
But if you're in the business of hip hop and
dance, maybe that twerking dance is not bad

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.610
to leave it on there.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.500
So what is your market, make sure you clean
up your social media platform.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.559
#17: Be Authentic.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:13.559
Be yourself.

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:15.080
If you're the detective.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.850
Be a detective, man.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.350
If you're a charmer, be a charmer.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.350
Be the flirt.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.810
If you're the comedian, be the comedian.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:26.130
If you try to be one you're not, it comes
across very awkward.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.460
People sense awkward like [snap] this.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.330
You ever watch people on YouTube or T.V. where
they try too hard.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.380
This guy's just not himself.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.820
It just doesn't fit.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:40.220
Johnny Carson, when he first got started on
T.V. got criticized a lot.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.220
Why?

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.880
Because he kept trying to be somebody else.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.150
Then one day somebody just said, Johnny, you're
fine the way you are.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.030
Just go on TV and be Johnny.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.600
So one day he goes on T.V. and boom!

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.250
That's when Johnny Carson got started.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.680
Because all he did, he was Johnny Carson.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.880
Hey, you know, his hands in his pockets, and
the way he would talk, and he would do his

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.060
things that he would do, and that's Johnny.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.700
Everybody fell in love with Johnny at night.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.230
Johnny became Johnny, right?

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:10.400
And #18 Learn how to brag about yourself without
bragging about yourself.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400
How do you do that?

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400
There's an art to it.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.720
Learn how to talk about some of your success
without sounding too cocky and arrogant about

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720
it.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.120
Because people do want to know that you have
been successful, but you've got to do it in

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.310
a very gentle way.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.200
Girls want to know that guy's have had some
kind of success.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.590
Guys want to know that girls have done some
stuff.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:33.560
Yeah, in school I was valedictorian or in
school I played sports, I was a quarterback.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.820
Yeah, the stereotype, I was that guy playing
the quarterback and I was pretty good.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.930
I was All American and had a good time, it
was great.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.450
. . Yeah, know right now with business I do
have three offices, business is going good,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.630
I'm very excited about one of our offices
we're doing this with.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.630
I've never seen a business.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.630
. . but tell me about yourself.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.120
Tell me how things are with you.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120
Very subtle.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.250
Not, "Let me tell you who I am."

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.250
Subtle.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.250
Subtle.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.080
Now there's a time for that, when somebody
is bullying you.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080
But that's a different story.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.810
I'm talking about just purely networking.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.810
Right?

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.160
I'm talking just simply about networking with
people.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.560
So, these are 18 different points for you.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.710
And hopefully, when you're looking at this,
you're going to look at networking and charming

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.000
and Casanova and all this other stuff in a
completely different way.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.880
You may want to watch this thing over again
and kind of going through and take notes and

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.220
figure out which one is you.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.390
And start implementing these things and I'd
love to hear some of the stuff that you're

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.630
implementing and how it's working for you,
especially the wine story.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.521
I would LOVE to get a Snapchat from you.

00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:33.230
You can follow me on Snapchat Betdavid19.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.950
So with that being said, Hey folks, we're
getting close but we're not there yet.
