00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.920
A lot of sports bloopers can happen in a year.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.730
And when those bloopers are spectacular or
really ridiculous, they can offer chuckles

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.950
and entertainment for a long time.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.040
Here are some of 2018's greatest sports bloopers.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.620
Behold: a perfectly flawed baseball play that
makes the Bad News Bears look like the Good

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.140
News Grizzlies.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.500
In the eighth inning of a clash between the
Colorado Rockies and Cincinnati Reds, Rockie

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.700
Carlos Gonzalez batted a fly ball to right-center
field.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.000
Reds outfielder Billy Hamilton seemed all-but
destined to catch it, but instead the ball

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.060
slipped past his outstretched glove.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.500
"But it'll be right - oh boy..."

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.600
Meanwhile, Gonzalez rounded second base, but
got tripped up on his way to third, although

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.950
it didn't turn out so bad for him.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.810
"Hamilton dropped the ball and Gonzales will
go around second, he falls down, and he's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.260
still able to get back to second base."

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.800
Colorado went on to score a 6 to 3 victory,
but for a brief, harmonious moment the Reds

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.740
and the Rockies failed beautifully together.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.760
The 2018 NFL playoffs will mostly be remembered
for the Philadelphia Eagles' stunning upset

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820
victory over the New England Patriots in the
Super Bowl.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.520
But the lead-up to the big game also defied
belief when a New Orleans Saint performed

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.500
a miracle â€¦ for the opposing team.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.580
The Saints were squaring off against the Minnesota
Vikings in the NFC Divisional round.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.200
For most of the game Saints rookie safety
Mike Williams played well, snagging an interception

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.220
and racking up five tackles and two pass deflections.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
With seconds left in the game and the Saints
up by just 1 point, Williams had a chance

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.020
to put a big fat cherry atop his NFL sundae
by tackling Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.280
Instead he missed by a mile and also took
out one of his own teammates, allowing Diggs

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.180
to score a game-winning 61-yard touchdown.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.140
"He has a shot, I'm not sure really what he's
thinking Joe.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.560
He comes in, he's got him dialed in, and,
he just, all he's gotta do is make a play."

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.240
In this February game against the Arizona
Coyotes, L.A. King Tanner Pearson didn't mean

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.010
to be funny when he collided with his teammate
Drew Doughty in the first period.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.411
He also didn't mean to flip heels-over-head
onto his backside, lose a skate blade, and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.600
shuffle awkwardly on one knee before being
towed to the bench.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.660
But all those things happened in quick succession.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.740
"A full barrel roll.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.740
Here we go!

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.840
And on the backside when he hit the ice, the
blade is no longer at the bottom of the skate."

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.489
It was all glorious because nobody got hurt,
except for Pearson's left skate.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.020
The incident also didn't hurt the Kings' chances
of winning, as they beat the Coyotes 6-0.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.380
Pretty much nobody expected the Cleveland
Cavaliers to win the 2018 NBA Finals.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.040
But thanks to a heroic 51-point performance
from LeBron James, the Cavs actually had a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.560
chance to steal Game 1 from the Golden State
Warriors.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.740
But what at first smelled like an upset ultimately
reeked of a brain fart by J.R. Smith.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.420
At the end of the fourth quarter, George Hill
had a chance to give Cleveland the lead at

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.230
the free throw line but missed his second
attempt.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.900
Smith snatched the rebound, but he was apparently
oblivious to the tie score, so he dribbled

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.150
the ball away from the basket.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.849
"It's grabbed by J.R. Smith! Smith's, gonna
run it out.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.549
I think JR didn't know how much time was left.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.549
(incomprehensible).

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.780
And we're going to overtime."

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.560
The Warriors ultimately won in overtime, and
James mourned his wasted efforts by punching

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.160
a whiteboard and injuring his hand after the
game.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.280
In a disastrous showing for Wake Forest University
football, freshman kicker Nick Sciba not only

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.140
missed his first field goal attempt of the
game, he almost didn't attend it.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.360
It happened during Wake Forest's 56-27 blowout
loss to Notre Dame in September.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.940
With the score tied at zero and seven minutes
left in the first quarter, the Demon Deacons

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.120
set up for a 37-yard field goal.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.500
Correction: They mostly set up.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.700
As Sciba continued practicing on the sideline,
the clock kept ticking down.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.380
"I think the thought here is, hey we just
put a pretty good drive together, they-"

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.840
"The kicker's not on the field.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.189
Surprised they're trying this!"

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.859
"They do need a kicker."

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.939
In a reverse Charlie Brown moment, Wake Forest's
holder looked back and discovered nobody was

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.779
there to kick the football.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:10.079
After what felt like an eternity Sciba scrambled
onto the field, quickly booted the ball into

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.360
the air, and watched it bounce off the upright
in the wrong direction.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.060
Athletes habitually break the laws of physics,
but sometimes those laws conspire against

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.580
them.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.060
Take, for example, this July contest between
the Houston Astros and Oakland A's.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.420
In the bottom of the 11th, Oakland had a one-run
lead and needed two more outs to put the game

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.940
away.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.310
Houston tied it up, and then with runners
on first and second, Astros infielder Alex

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.560
Bregman unleashed a mighty swing to create
what he later described as "the softest ball

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.700
anyone's ever hit."

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.960
Bregman barely made contact, and the ball
landed just a few feet from home plate.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.319
Oakland catcher Jonathan Lucroy tried to tag
him out but missed completely thanks to Bregman's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.300
stealthy dodge.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.620
And then disaster struck.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.780
"Everybody's in play.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.780
They both advance.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.780
The throw's away!"

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780
"No way!"

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.419
"The Astros are gonna win it!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.300
The Astros are gonna win!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.300
Unbelievable!"

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.520
A hockey player losing his balance on ice
feels about as unnatural as a bird that hates

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.060
flying.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.520
But just as real penguins can't fly, the NHL
has a Pittsburgh Penguin who got tripped up

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.800
by the ice.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.540
Pittsburgh goaltender Tristan Jarry achieved
the most wins by a rookie goalie in the 2017-18

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.240
season, but one March matchup got off to a
horrendous start.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.740
In the early stages of a game against the
New York Islanders, Jarry committed a goaltending

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.140
blooper for the ages.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.540
As Islander Brandon Davidson entered the attacking
zone, Jarry did his best impression of a man

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.940
trying to run across cartoon banana peels.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.500
(fast hockeyman talking)

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.360
"He scores!

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.220
Tristan Jarry fell over, as Davidson was going
to the backhand."

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.470
Luckily for Jarry, his fellow Penguins didn't
roast him like a turkey.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.599
Much to his relief, he "saw 90 percent of
the guys laughing."

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.370
And he had the last laugh as he went on to
make 25 saves and the Penguins seized victory

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.900
in overtime.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.520
The WWE's 10-year contract with Saudi Arabia
appears to be the gift that keeps on giving

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520
reasons to regret it.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.500
On April 27, the Greatest Royal Rumble was
held in King Abdullah International Stadium

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.740
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.240
The event drew scorn for a Saudi-imposed ban
on female wrestlers and for airing propaganda

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.120
that depicted the oppressive nation as a beacon
of positive change.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.060
The six-hour show featured a ridiculously
bloated main event in the form of a 50-man

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.980
battle royale.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.080
However, there was one diamond in the vast
expanse of rough: Titus O'Neil.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.660
O'Neil was the 39th entrant in the battle
royale.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.620
As he ran into the ring, announcers bragged
about him rubbing elbows with important Saudi

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.160
figures.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.780
Then out of nowhere, he started rubbing elbows
with the floor.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.320
The internet lovingly dubbed the moment "Titus
World Slide," a reference to the wrestler's

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.020
"Worldwide" gimmick.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.260
The tale of the tortoise and the hare teaches
us that slow and steady wins the race, and

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.990
it also teaches you not to stop before you've
finished.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.940
The hare learned that lesson the hard way,
as did Israeli runner Lonah Chemtai Salpeter.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.320
Salpeter's backstory could double as a real-life
fable.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.420
A native of Kenya, she became romantically
involved with a track coach while working

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.000
as a nanny in Israel.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.860
The pair married in Kenya and eventually moved
to Israel.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.540
Salpeter repeatedly applied for citizenship
but got rejected for about five years.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.420
The government finally naturalized her when
she qualified to compete in the 2016 Rio Games.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.180
Things went awry in Rio, but in 2018 she made
history as the first Israeli woman to win

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.280
gold at the European Championships.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.760
She almost won a second medal there but unwittingly
removed herself from the running.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.279
While competing in the 5,000-meter race Salpeter
underestimated how much race she had left

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.080
and stopped early.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.980
While celebrating the silver medal she thought
she had won, she discovered she still had

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.260
one lap to go.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.100
"And what was Lonah Salpeter thinking?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.349
She thought she'd finished, she moved over
to the right hand side of the track, big grin

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:05.419
on her face."

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:09.539
Salpeter would finish fourth but got disqualified
for crossing the running lanes too early.

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:13.089
She vowed to treat her blooper as a lesson
for future races.
