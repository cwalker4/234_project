or, you know,
something like that--

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.733

three types of peppers.

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.700
- Well, you don't--
that's an example.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.366

thought of something.
- Okay.

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:18.100
- Anyway, so you have five
seconds to answer three things

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.100
