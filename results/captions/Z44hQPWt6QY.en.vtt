00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.240
So 31 remain here on day four
of the pokerstars.com PCA 2016

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.240
main event.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.635
Getting to the business end.

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:18.430
There's no such thing
as an actual business

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.570
end to anything, though.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.970
Like a broom doesn't have a--

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.192
no, it doesn't matter.

00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:24.400
I guess the brushy bit is
the business end because it

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.450
gets the business done.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.950
Right.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.015
But where did that
actually come from?

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:30.515
Huh.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.080
So Tedeschi's raised
to 36,000 here.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.906
Philip McCallister culls out
of a stack of 1.74 million.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:45.030
Yeah, that's a lot of dimp.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:49.315
Oh.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.070
All right.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.220
My bad.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.380
McAllister has the table
chip lead, and in this end

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.550
will have the
advantage of position.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.341
He's on the button.

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:03.965
Looks like we've got a decision.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.865
Decision is to call, as well.

00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:13.690
Rabah comes in from
the picket blind.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.340
So we're three way to the flop.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.580
Chauriye Rabah.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.570
That flop is queen, eight,
four with two clubs.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.560
Looks like Raba has
checked to the raiser.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.220
Makes sense.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.060
Tedeschi was actually on that
French global poker masters

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.210
team.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.330
So my guess is he's a
pretty good poker player.

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:53.150
It's been checked to McAllister.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.290
I've been impressed by what
we've seen from this guy today.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.710
He's held the
tournament chip lead

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.020
at various points over
the last 48 hours.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.940
He's striking that
pose that supposedly

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.520
means you're comfortable.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080
A lot of poker
players sit like that.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.720
--describe how you
feel right now?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.180
If what?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.320
You would describe how you
feel right now as spectacular?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.275
This guy asks some
weird questions.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:23.425
I don't believe you.

00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:24.800
He's nothing if
not entertaining.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.900
Back on training Poker.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.690
So the bet from
McAllister is 48 K.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.538
There's nothing you
can do there, really.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.930
Rabah calls.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.375
What about the guy who started
this with a pre-flop raise?

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:50.125
Monsieur Tedeschi.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.970
I think it's Paul
Tedeschi, actually.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.840
Seems like that's a very common
French first name, though--

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.350
monsieur.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.640
No.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.930
No.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.660
30-minute break.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.627
It's The same thing
as the last few days.

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:06.585
Yeah, 30-minute break at
the end of this level,

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:07.495
then one more level.

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:08.860
Got it.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.156
How do you feel?

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:10.656
What?

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.544
How areyou?

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:13.815
I'm OK.

00:03:13.815 --> 00:03:16.655
Yeah.

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:17.839
That's a call, as well.

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.630
We're still three-way
as we go to the turn.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.630
It's really interesting.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.910
What would he raise pre-flop
with, not continue, but still

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.410
call?

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.993
And I think a lot
of times, it's gonna

00:03:27.993 --> 00:03:30.970
be hands like 10's and
jacks, 10's that maybe he

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.380
wants to take a free card with.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.846
If it jacks, he's
real happy right now.

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:36.220
Yeah, jack of
hearts on the turn.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.090
I guess he could do with
some absolute monsters, too.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.930
Slow play them.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.430
But I don't know.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.034
I don't see why he wouldn't
just see about that flop.

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:49.489
Rabah checks.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.280
And I think that was
a check from Tedeschi.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.679
Yep.

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:53.970
How much do you have in greens?

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.836
That's 200 in greens?

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:56.336
225?

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.850
He's gone from the one
arm on one shoulder

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.700
to two arms on two shoulders,
the old water slide

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:24.159
pose, probably learned out
there in the water park.

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.050
Philip McAllister bets again--

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:39.720
136,000.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.685
So Tedeschi doesn't even have
a pot-sized bet left behind.

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:45.650
Yeah.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.630
Just realized he's the
effective stack here--

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.760
388,000.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.700
Rabah is the other big
stack at the table.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.440
Yeah, this could be a
potentially huge pot.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.100
Especially as it looks
like he's calling.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.600
Smallest chips in play
are the yellow 1,000s.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.810
Blues are 5,000.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.861
Greens are 25,000.

00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.361
No.

00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:10.810
Receipt or something?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.740
Unless Tedeschi's
really strong, I

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.010
would be shocked to
see him over-call here.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.190
If he's got a big draw,
he might just show.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.690
Sure.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.912
But you can't
broadcast it, right?

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:29.412
OK.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.320
He's counted out the call.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.437
He's raised all in.

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:53.270
Well, I think the worse
he's gonna have here

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.287
is a monster draw.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.745
I still kind of
like him for jacks,

00:05:55.745 --> 00:06:00.025
and I guess queens is
a possibility, too.

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:02.150
That would explain why he
wouldn't want to see bet,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.525
because he knows he can't get
action on a board like that

00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:06.280
if three of the
four queens are out.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.450
What just happened?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.596
McAllister just called.

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:12.120
He flats the all in.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.900
So this pot is huge.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.620
1.1 million in the middle.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.380
And Rabah still to act.

00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:25.270
I don't know how you
could handle this.

00:06:38.392 --> 00:06:43.280
It will cost him
252,000 to call.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.640
It's pretty rare we
would see two calls here.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.750
But look at the
price he's getting.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.410
OK, well--

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.220
He does call.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.630
So let's be clear.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.450
We have one player all in.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.240
We have a pot of 1.4 million.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.460
We're going to the river
with potential action

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.040
on the side between the two
big stacks at this table.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.920
I like that one the best.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.040
One and a half
million in the middle.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.090
No one has a pot-sized
bet left behind now.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.070
Good point.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.470
River card is the ace of hearts.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.330
So the flush draw gets there.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.300
The back door flush draw,
the back door straight draw.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.670
Do these two just check it down?

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.540
No, they don't.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.050
He bets 300.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.320
It's a pretty small bet.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.780
But I don't see why you
would bet here unless you're

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.140
betting for value.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.660
There's no point in bluffing
McAllister off the hand.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.010
So 300,000 into the side pot.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.140
Tedeschi competing for the
main pot of 1.4 million.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.870
And now, McAllister
moves all in!

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.060
And he's got Rabah covered!

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.390
How does everyone
have a hand here?

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.133
I have no idea.

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:38.799
But obviously, Rabah's committed
most of his stack in this hand.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.710
He's got 851 K left.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:57.310
1.175, I think.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.380
Don't be mad if I
bluff you off a chop.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:06.630
What is-- what hand
does he think that they

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.340
could be chopping with?

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.180
King, 10, right?

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.790
Yeah.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.942
I mean, there's only--

00:09:12.942 --> 00:09:14.650
I don't even see how
they could both have

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.170
king, 10 because
the only king, 10

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.650
that gets this far is king, 10
of clubs or king, 10 of hearts.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.496
It works OK for me.

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.484
No, I'm saying in this pot.

00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:25.900
Oh, on this pot I
shouldn't speak?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.396
OK.

00:09:26.396 --> 00:09:26.892
No, him.

00:09:26.892 --> 00:09:27.390
Him, him.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.040
And that's true, yeah.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.750
Oh, all right.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.230
OK.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.230
McAllister really
shouldn't say anything.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.360
Tedeschi-- technically,
this is not a heads-up pot.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.440
I don't know the poker
etiquette, obviously.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.690
It's not even really adequate.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.570
This is a rule.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.010
It is a rule.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.230
This pot is officially
multi-way, with Tedeschi

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.980
already all in.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.810
Now McAllister's all in.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.790
And if Rabah calls, he's all in.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.330
I like this angle.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.544
It looks like he's wearing,
like, a karate headband.

00:09:57.544 --> 00:09:58.508
Daniel-san!

00:09:58.508 --> 00:09:59.940
This is a monster, huh?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.440
How much is in there?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.295
A lot.

00:10:02.295 --> 00:10:04.200
Roughly, roughly, roughly?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.752
Roughly a lot.

00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:07.210
Also, you're not
in the hand, dude.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.445
You shouldn't say anything.

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:09.320
This may not want it.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.350
That's a huge one.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.800
Stop talking.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.540
Why, the hand's done?

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.817
It's not done.

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:15.650
Oh, do you not call?

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.233
Oh, all right.

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.760
I thought you called.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.610
Sorry.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.314
He went all in.

00:10:21.314 --> 00:10:22.480
I thought he called, though.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:22.980
Sorry.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.480
That's really the
mistake I've made.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.938
You get to see the
hand afterwards.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:26.653
So, I mean--

00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:30.805
Man, he's got a real decision.

00:10:38.128 --> 00:10:40.060
He's been in the tank
for over two minutes.

00:10:44.484 --> 00:10:46.400
Do you think he thinks
this hard with king-10?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.858
Obviously, he
doesn't have a flush.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.710
I mean, there's only one
king, 10 he can have.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.910
Is this the classic
why did I bet 300,000

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.087
on the river expression?

00:11:02.087 --> 00:11:04.420
Yeah, right. 'Cause it just
looked like such an easy bet

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:04.990
to raise.

00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:17.920
I don't know what
Tedeschi's got.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.086
But he's got to be thinking,
this ain't good for me.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.150
Three minutes now.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.199
Sorry, guys.

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:36.240
I mean, not only is this
for his tournament life,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.323
but it could be for the
tournament chip lead, too.

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:47.770
I think it's fair to say that
this is probably the biggest

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.030
pot of the tournament so far.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.905
I mean, even though it
says side pot 300,000,

00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:52.990
the side pot's more
like 1.5 million.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.950
Yeah.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.120
Which puts 3 million
in the middle.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.250
Granted, Rabah can only
win 851,000, additionally.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.850
Coming up on the
four-minute mark.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.057
Think anyone at the table
calls the clock soon?

00:12:14.057 --> 00:12:14.890
I know you are sick.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.140
But I don't know if
you are that sick.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.030
What does that mean?

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.290
It means he has a
really strong hand.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.124
Flip a coin, literally.

00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:29.150
It's probably best.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.147
I've lost my phone.

00:12:31.147 --> 00:12:31.730
We don't care.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.230
Yeah.

00:12:38.562 --> 00:12:41.280
I'll give you two minutes,
and then I'll call the clock.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.560
Sorry.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.170
So that's two minutes
plus one minute.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.410
That's three minutes
to make a decision.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.883
This hand's been 17 minutes.

00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:49.850
Has it really?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.860
I mean, at least.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.430
I looked up when it said 46.

00:13:05.382 --> 00:13:07.090
Baffling the way this
hand is played out.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.673
That's a call!

00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:08.370
No, it's a fold.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.531
Yes!

00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.410
And he likes what he sees.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:11.920
Oh, no.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.200
King, 10 clubs.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.075
King, 10 of hearts
for a royal flush!

00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:15.782
It is a royal!

00:13:15.782 --> 00:13:16.490
And look at that.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.000
Tedeschi did have
a set of queens.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.470
What a terrible,
disgusting run out

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.630
for what is going to be the
best hand almost always.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.270
Runner, runner, perfect,
perfect royal flush.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.810
I'm trying to remember
the last time we saw--

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.800
I've never seen one.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.610
--a royal flush in an EPT, let
alone on the feature table.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.740
That is absolutely disgusting.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.480
And a royal flush
that eliminates

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.540
a player who flops top set!

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.280
Flop the nuts, lose to the
super mega ultimo nuts.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.100
A royal?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.980
Yeah.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.240
Wow.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.710
I knew he was gonna leave 300.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.685
Lucky, well, we
should evaluate it.

00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:03.060
I want to know
what Rabah folded.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.210
Oh, you're not small, are you?

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.750
Big one?

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.630
Give me one more hand, bro.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.440
OK, OK.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.940
It's yours.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.580
It's yours.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.330
That was the craziest
hand I've ever seen.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.820
We might never know, but we
do know Philip McAllister now

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.294
has 2.7 million.

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:23.210
Did he fold a flush or
just king, 10 of clubs?

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:24.744
Sick.
