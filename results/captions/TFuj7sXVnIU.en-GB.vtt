00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.640
Hello, my name is Colm Clarke, and I've lived in the Carrigans area of County Donegal for most of my life.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
And I've worked in the flax and linen industry up until 1955

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.020
Last year, here at the Monreagh Heritage Centre in County Donegal, we decided to film the process of producing linen.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.400
There are six steps in the process.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.080
Step 1: we sow the flax seed in April.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.200
Step 2: the flax plant grows to full height after three months.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
Step 3: we pull it and put it in a dam to soak for 2 weeks.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.300
Step 4: Spread it and dry it on a grass field. It takes about ten days.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.900
Step 5:  Plant is lifted and bundled together into 'stooks' for five days.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.900
Step 6:  The sixth step of the process is by hand, ready for the mill to produce linen.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.360
Now we're ready to sow the flax

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:52.225
 

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:32.405
 

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.405
 

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:39.295
 

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:46.275
 

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.005
 

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:53.535
 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.420
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.580
This is the flax we pulled the last day.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.620
We're going to take it and soak it now. You can soak it the Ulster Scots way or the English way.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.460
We can soak it or 'steep' it.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.440
The English word is 'Rhett'

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.540
We'll put it in now and 'rhett' it

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.860
You put the stones on top to keep it down

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.420
We keep it in here for 7 to eleven days.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:36.040
You then take it out and break it. And if it breaks 'clean' (the outer skin come off) it is ready for taking out and spreading....

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.480
and dry it on the grass green

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.640
This is a band made of rushes

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.560
 

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:00.005
 

00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:13.035
 

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:16.525
 

00:08:20.705 --> 00:08:21.705
 

00:08:33.115 --> 00:08:34.115
 

00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:36.825
 

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:43.945
 

00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:56.565
 

00:08:56.605 --> 00:08:57.605
 

00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:05.285
 

00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:23.115
 

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.820
 

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.040
The process we will do now is known as 'stutching'

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.200
This would have been done like this up until the 1930s.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.580
 

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:37.575
 

00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:39.735
 

00:10:56.765 --> 00:10:57.765
 

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:04.495
 

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280
 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:16.620
This process that I have done is breaking the inside fibers of the plant

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.260
It's the inside fibers that give us pure linen

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.160
This process is known as 'crimping'

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.680
This breaks the fibers further down so that we can take it to the next process.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.700
 

00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:52.245
 

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600
 

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.080
This is the 'brushing' part that takes off the coarser part of the plant.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.880
That's the finished product. That is pure linen.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:13:00.940
In the modern mill this process was done with machinery.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.240
This product would now be sent to the linen mill to be turned into thread

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:14.860
The spinning wheel was used in the 18th &amp; 19th century to produce thread. This process was used before the big mills.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:21.520
This is an example of what was made in the 19th century

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:30.840
Well, we hoped you enjoyed the film, and we would love to see you here at the Monreagh Heritage Centre

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.200
in Carrigans, County Donegal, where I can give you a personal demonstration.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.240
