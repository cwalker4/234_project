00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.667
The President: Thank you.

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:03.670
It's really wonderful to
be here today with

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.774
the auto industry workers
and management leaders.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.144
I'm also pleased to be
joined by two incredible

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.179
members of my cabinet.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.951
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Environmental

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.020
Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.422
They've been doing
an amazing job.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.924
They've done a lot of work
in a very short period of time.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.093
We're looking forward to
getting the rest of our

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:31.164
Cabinet approved because
believe it or not,

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.365
we don't have it yet.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.666
I also want to
thank Senator.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.837
Senator, we have two great
Senators from a great state.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.305
Senator Steve, we're going
to be heading out there

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.774
very soon, right Bob?

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.441
Thank you.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.776
Thank you very much.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.911
Appreciate you being here.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.379
You want to take some of
this business back

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.113
with you I think.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.183
They're doing big
expansions in Michigan.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.851
That's what I've been
promising and I guess

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.454
maybe it's one of the
reasons I won the state

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.390
of Michigan, much to the surprise of a lot of people

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.592
because it's been many, many years.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:03.930
But I also want to thank
Mary Barra, on my right,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.765
who has really been
spearheading it

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:10.236
and doing a great job with
General Motors.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.907
We're going to create 900
brand new jobs,

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.575
it was just announced.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.577
And that's going to be peanuts compared to the kind

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.113
of numbers we're going to be seeing in the near future.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:24.350
I believe Mary's going to
get on board and really

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.187
build new plants in
Michigan and the United

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.156
States and it's going to be thousands and thousands

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.524
of workers.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.426
And I want to thank you
very much because you

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.594
really have been
spearheading.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:39.065
My first week in office,
some of the executives

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.168
came to the White House,
became friendly with Mark

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.002
-- where's Mark?

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.237
Where is Mark sitting?

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:48.942
And Bill -- Bill Ford, and
it's been really great

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.410
Mark, and I appreciate
everything you're doing.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.278
It's been just super.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.414
Sergio flew in
from Europe.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.249
He told me it
took him 12 hours.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.917
I said, "What kind of a
plane were you flying?"

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:58.618
(laughter)

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.385
Where is Sergio?

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.386
There he is.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.255
But you've been doing
great and you make a great

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.656
product and I
appreciate it.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.692
Especially, when you make
them in the United States.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.528
So, thank you.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:13.132
So, the Obama
administration 11th hour

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:16.302
executive actions were
going back -- and they

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.372
really did go back on a
promise and it would have,

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.041
I think, destroyed or
further destroyed

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.910
the automobile industry.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.045
The prior administration
promised to listen

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:30.016
to industry leaders like you
about any concern you had

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.719
with the current fuel
efficiency standards

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.788
during a so-called
mid-term review

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:39.692
in 2016 and 2018.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:44.564
Then the days went by and
before my inauguration,

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.566
they did away with
a mid-term review.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.268
Is that a correct
statement, Mary?

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.536
You don't want to get too
involved politically,

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.803
but is that a correct statement?

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:51.571
Mary Barra:
That's correct.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.605
The President: They
did away with it.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.374
Can I ask you, Mark, is
that a correct statement?

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.842
Mark Fields: Yeah,
they finalized it.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.143
The President: It
never happened.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.646
Were you -- we want to use
the nice term --

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.315
were you mis-represented too?

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.083
Mark Fields: It wasn't
according to the process.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.785
Mary Barra: Right.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.754
The President: Imposing
painful new restrictions

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:11.791
on the American automobile
production lines

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.494
and undermining our ability
to compete with other

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:18.131
countries and other places
throughout the world,

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.866
which are very, very
competitive, believe me.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.702
Especially when it
comes to making cars.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:27.106
Today, I'm here to make
right on what you were promised.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.642
We are reinstituting
the mid-term review.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.279
We're going to reinstitute
that review and we're

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.049
giving you a voice
in the process.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.786
We're going to do some
wonderful work for you,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.454
but you have to come back
and you have to give us

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.089
big numbers in
terms of jobs.

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.857
And I know the unions are
going to treat them very

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:47.794
nicely because, Dennis,
we can't go crazy here.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.629
You understand that, okay?

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.064
We got to take
it nice and easy.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:51.864
We love the workers.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.232
We got to take
it nice and easy.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.134
We got to let them build.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.336
Remember that, Dennis.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:59.205
I know you so well.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.842
So, I know you're
competitors and you'll

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:06.346
always be competitors, but we're all on the same side.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:10.116
The most important issue
-- this is to me the most

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.151
important issue -- and
that's keeping jobs

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.589
in America and creating new
jobs in the United States.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.790
That's why I'm here today.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.826
We're going to
create new jobs.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:22.028
Many, many new jobs,
new plants, not just

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.396
an expansion of the plants.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.864
New plants.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.767
Modern plants like you've
been building in Mexico.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.569
Like you've been building
in other locations.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.771
We want to have new plants
built in Michigan and new

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.108
plants built in Ohio and
new plants in Pennsylvania

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.578
and North Carolina and
so many other places.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:40.680
And that's what
we're looking for.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.914
So, we're going
to go all out.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.116
We're lowering your taxes.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.219
We're going to remove one
job killing regulation

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.020
after another.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.255
The regulations have
already made a big impact

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:52.592
on the auto business and
on most other businesses.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.127
And we're far from
being finished.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:59.532
We've signed many executive orders reducing regulations.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:02.168
We are far from finished.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.771
We think we can get rid of
about 75 percent

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.542
of the regulations in many cases
and have more security

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.478
for the worker, for the
environment, and in safety

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.514
because safety
is so important.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.716
So, we'll have
better security.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:19.519
And that's why I'm very
glad that my head

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.155
of the Environmental Protection
is here, Scott,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.890
wherever you are, Scott.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.725
So -- hello Scott.

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:29.562
So, this is going to be a
new era for American jobs

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:33.833
and job creation and a new
era -- almost like

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:39.372
the beginning for the American
automobile manufacturers.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.908
We're going to make
thousands and thousands

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.776
and thousands of
additional cars.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.978
We're going to make them
in the United States.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.847
We're going to work with
you on regulations.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.449
We're going to work
with you on taxes.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.585
But you've got to work
with us on new plants,

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:55.788
on new jobs, and bringing
back our country

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:59.625
to a level that it's never
seen before in terms

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.028
of automobile production.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.463
And if you're going to do
that, you're going to see

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.966
some really wonderful
things happen for yourselves,

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.535
your industry, and for most importantly, the people

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:12.805
of Michigan and
Ohio and all of the states

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.574
that were so good to me.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.876
And they were good to me
because they were treated

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.313
very, very unfairly.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:23.916
And so, I'm just here
today to begin the process.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.085
And with that, if anybody
has any questions,

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.254
we'd love to take them.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:29.255
Go ahead.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.823
Anybody?

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.759
Dennis, do you want
to ask something?

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.094
It's always tough when I
have the union guy ask first.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.796
That's always
dangerous, Mark.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:37.463
But that's okay.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.531
Go ahead, Dennis.

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:40.433
Dennis Williams: Well, I just -- you know, I appreciate

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.001
everything you said.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.504
I think that the focus on jobs in the United States

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.907
is so important to us as a
country and as working men

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.208
and women in this country.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.944
And it's not just jobs,
but it's good paying jobs

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.347
and jobs that we can buy
homes and vehicles that

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.115
we build and everything else.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.851
But I do get concerned
about environmental

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.155
standards and I agree
with you that the 2018

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:06.392
discussion that we had in
-- I think it was in 2012.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:10.096
We had a discussion, but we have to have a mid-term review.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.367
Because the way that we
look at it, is that

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.835
we have to deal with
the environment.

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:20.573
We have to do it in a
responsible way where

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:23.509
manufacturers are not put
in a situation that they

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:24.577
cannot invest.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:27.847
But at the same time, meet
the environmental

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.415
needs of our nation.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:30.383
So that's a concern.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.717
The President: 100 percent
we agree with you.

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:33.953
We all agree with
you 100 percent.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.689
But we want you to make
great cars and if it takes

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.560
an extra thimble full of
fuel, we don't want that

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.794
to stop making it.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:45.364
And sometimes it's a
tiny amount of fuel.

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:48.568
It's a very small thing
we're talking about and we

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.337
want you to make -- I understand your business very well.

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.873
I understand
mechanics very well.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.475
I was always -- I would
have been a very good --

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:57.810
I would have been a very
good shop steward,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.912
but I would have been
a good mechanic.

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:04.150
And, you know, there comes
a point at which you are

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.852
not making great
product anymore.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.020
It comes a point at which
I would even say people

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.523
end up buying used cars
because they work better

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:14.627
because of restrictions that are put on your new product.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.229
And we don't want to
be at that position.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.997
And you are being forced
into a position, where

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.666
in my opinion, that was
going to happen.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.335
So, we're going to open it
up and we're going to make

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:26.439
it good in terms of your
workers, which, you know,

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:30.376
years ago, you had
thousands and thousands

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.311
of more workers making
automobiles in this

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:34.513
country than you do today.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:37.149
And this isn't just
machinery and robotics,

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:40.353
this is, you
know, the basics.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.954
And we're going
to change that.

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:42.855
And we want robotics.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.190
We want all of
that to happen.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.725
Going to make that
too, by the way.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:49.695
But when I looked at the
numbers I saw thousands --

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.098
tens of thousands of more
workers many years ago,

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.800
than you have today and we're going to bring that all back.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.169
We're going to bring it
back for the worker.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:57.837
Thank you.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:58.504
Thank you, Dennis.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:08:59.839
Mark Fields: Mr.
President, you know,

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:03.009
on any given day, we're
all fierce competitors

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:06.579
and I think the reason you
have 18 OEMs of car makers

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.181
sitting around here
is because under your

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.051
leadership to be able to
put this mid-term review

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:15.655
back on -- back on track,
which was what we agreed

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.490
to back in 2011.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.925
The President: Well, you
weren't treated fairly.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.193
Because I went to many
people and I'm talking

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:23.262
to people that are
down the middle.

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.231
They don't care
about anything.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.734
They just want a certain
fairness and they were involved.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.535
Mark Fields: Exactly.

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:30.436
The President: And
you were not treated.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.271
You were misrepresented.

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:33.506
Mark Fields: And I think
to your point, I just want

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.241
to make clear that what
we've asked for and what

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:39.345
you've responded to is
to reinstate the review.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:42.381
It's not a rejection
of what we agreed to.

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:43.849
It's a process.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.285
And so, we really
appreciate your leadership

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.421
and as always, we want to
-- we're absolutely,

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.624
you know, committed to
improving fuel economy

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:56.329
for our customers, you know,
less greenhouse gases,

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:57.663
that's safe for
the environment.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.732
But we need to make sure
that it's done sensibly

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:01.901
to your point in taking
into account jobs.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.035
The President: Right.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:03.903
Right.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:04.770
Thank you.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.438
Thank you,
Mark, very much.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.272
Good job too.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.374
Mary?

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.875
Mary Barra: Yeah, I would
say -- echo the comments.

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:11.577
I think by opening up the
mid-term review we can

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:14.146
look at all the development in technologies that have been

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.816
developed in the last five years and the way the industry

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:20.553
is changing not only with ridesharing, with higher use

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.521
-- so we can actually accomplish and do the right thing

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.458
for the environment, do it more effectively that supports

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.892
jobs and supports new technology.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.729
So, I think it is very
beneficial that we have

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:32.565
this discussion, and, you
know, find the pathway

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.232
to do the right thing.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.367
And I think we can.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.401
The President: And you
have to compete with other

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.303
countries too and we're
going to make you

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.506
so competitive that the only
ones you can blame are

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.407
going to be yourselves.

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:42.908
You're not going to blame
government anymore because

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.211
you're not doing well
against certain countries.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.912
You know, I'm so impressed
with the people.

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:50.016
I'm looking at Toyota,
I'm looking at Kia,

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.052
I'm looking at all these great
car companies -- Volvo.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.253
It's so impressive.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:57.123
Then I look at Reince.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.057
I'm only kidding.

00:10:58.057 --> 00:10:59.058
(laughter)

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:01.360
You should run
a car company.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.396
You probably will end up
doing that in a long time,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.697
but maybe not.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:05.631
I don't know.

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:06.532
He's done a great
job, Reince.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:09.235
But I thought we could go
around the table and we

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.404
could start with our great
Senator Bob Corker

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.706
and just introduce yourself
real quickly and we'll all

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:14.974
know who's here.

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.475
Bob Corker: Yes sir,
Bob Corker, Tennessee.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:17.510
I'm glad to be with you.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.644
The President: Thank you.

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.846
Bob Corker: And I know
that the automobile

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:24.750
industry plays such a huge
role in our nation and I'm

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.686
glad to see it flourishing
here as it is in many places

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:29.955
across the country and honored to be with all of you.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:30.823
Thank you.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.458
The President: Thank you
for being here, Bob.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.626
David Geanacopoulos:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:37.496
I'm David Geanacopoulos with Volkswagen Group of America.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:40.032
I'd like to thank you
and Secretary Chao and

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.436
Administrator Pruitt for
reopening the mid-term review.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.771
We think there's a
real opportunity for

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.973
harmonization
of standards.

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:50.209
We do think it's important
to reduce greenhouse gas

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.511
emissions and protect the
environment, but this

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.414
process is important by
itself and there is some

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:59.251
opportunities there for
flexibilities that can

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.320
help us to comply and
achieve the benefits.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.155
I also want to say that
we're proud to be

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:06.392
in Tennessee and to be
represented by Senator Corker

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.662
and Senator Alexander through our factory in Chattanooga.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.932
We've got 7,000 employees
there -- in the country --

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.834
and 3,500 there.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.969
And we'd like to grow
our presence in the U.S.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.471
and we look forward
to working with you.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.472
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.439
David Geanacopoulos:
Thank you.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:21.507
The President: It'll be
a very fair review too.

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:22.274
Thank you.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.008
Yes, sir.

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.376
Bob Kaiser: Good
afternoon, Mr. President.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:25.244
I'm Bob Kaiser.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.946
I'm the CEO of
Gallagher-Kaiser.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:30.116
We engineer and manufacture the paint shops.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:33.352
I'm a strategic supplier
of General Motors.

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:36.088
Because of General Motors
spend in the United States

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.524
in the last four of five
years, I have been able

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:39.358
to employ approximately

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.594
4,000-5,000 people
at any given time.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.162
And I thank you for
everything you're doing

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:44.330
for the automobile
industry.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.298
I've been in Detroit
my whole life.

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.968
I've seen the ups and
downs and I think the

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:51.270
nation is much better when
the cars are cut -- when

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.072
the industry is thriving.

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:53.873
Thank you.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.374
The President: Are the
paints today as good

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:56.542
without the lead content?

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.477
You know, you used to
have a high lead content.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:12:59.778
Bob Kaiser: Yes.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.113
The President: And I have
heard that paints today

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.282
maybe are not as good as
they used to be because

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.383
of what's been done.

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:06.952
Are paints today as good
as they used to be or not?

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.255
Bob Kaiser: Yes, they're
a lot better, I would believe.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.055
The President:
You think so?

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:10.823
Bob Kaiser: Yes.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.391
The President:
Okay, that's great.

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.059
Bob Kaiser: And less harmful to the environment.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:14.760
The President: Good.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.594
Okay.

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:16.495
Jerry Flannery: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:18.864
Jerry Flannery from
Hyundai Motor America.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.332
We're based in
Southern California.

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.934
The President: Sure.

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:24.503
Jerry Flannery: Last year,
sold over 700,000 cars

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:28.340
in the United States and we
proudly built 400,000

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.576
of those in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:35.614
As you know, we committed $3.1 billion further investment --

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:36.515
The President:
That's true.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.750
Jerry Flannery: -- in the
United States over the next

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.985
five years between
Hyundai and Kia.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.988
And help to bring
more jobs working

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:46.058
on automation, research
and development.

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.693
Look forward to
working with you.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:48.260
Thank you for
your leadership.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.595
The President:
Thank you, Jerry.

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:50.930
It's a big investment
you're making.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.765
I know all about it.

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:55.301
And you'll be very happy.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.569
You're going to
be very happy.

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:57.403
Thank you.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:58.170
Jerry Flannery: Thank
you for your leadership.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:58.871
The President: John?

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.039
John Maddox: Good
afternoon, Mr. President.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.640
Thank you very much
for joining us here.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.475
John Maddox, the president
and CEO of the American

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:06.111
Center for Mobility
here at Willow Run.

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.247
We're a technology startup.

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.716
We are focused on
automated and connected

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.251
vehicle technologies.

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.587
We're building a proving
grounds here right at

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:17.623
Willow Run, taking
advantage -- continuing

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.725
the spirit of
innovation here.

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:23.462
Really focused on making a
place that auto companies

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:26.665
and technology companies
and government agencies

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:29.868
can use to develop the
technology very rapidly.

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:32.705
We also see automated
technology, connected

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.940
technology as critical for
competitiveness

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.108
in the auto industry.

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:38.377
We know other countries
are following our lead.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.545
The President: And you're
going to need a lot of

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.915
approvals for that because
that is a very tough situation.

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.384
I know you're having a tough situation in certain states.

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.219
Not in Tennessee,
I don't think.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.656
To have the autonomous
cars, without driver.

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.658
So, it's going to be very
interesting, but we're

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.760
going to help you and help
you as much as we can.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.095
John Maddox: And Michigan
and the auto industry

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:57.263
are going to lead the way.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.130
The President: Thank you.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.132
Jim Lentz: Mr. President,
Jim Lentz from Toyota.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.968
Thank you very much for
being here today

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.737
and listening to the industry.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.641
The mid-term review -- fair and thorough is very important.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:11.510
You know, as we look at
what's happening in the

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.880
industry, smart regulation
is really what we need

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.849
to think about.

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.752
It's very complex today
with what's going on with

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.954
emissions and CAFE, but --

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:23.422
The President: It
shouldn't be complex, but --

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.890
Jim Lentz: Yeah,
I would agree.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.724
The President:
It shouldn't be.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:26.825
It's not a
complex subject.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.328
It's going to be great
regulation, but it's going

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:30.262
to be fair.

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:31.030
Jim Lentz: Yeah.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.164
The President: But
it won't be complex.

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:33.799
It'll be better for the
environment, it'll be

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:36.235
better for safety, but
it won't be complex.

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:38.003
Jim Lentz: And I think
as we look at future

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:42.675
regulation around autonomy, around connected cars,

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:44.777
other issues that
the industry is going

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.213
to face -- that same idea of
smart regulation, I think,

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:49.648
is really going to work.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:52.651
You know, we have -- we
have headquartered our

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:55.754
autonomous unit here
in North America --

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.423
a billion-dollar
investment in artificial

00:15:57.423 --> 00:16:00.959
intelligence, as well as
our connected car company

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.828
is going to be here
in North America.

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.029
So, you will see jobs.

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:05.130
The President: You got to
build those new plants

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.031
here though, Jim.

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:07.232
You know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.534
Jim Lentz: I understand.

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.368
The President: I know I
gave you a hard time,

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.303
but you got to build
them here, okay?

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.237
Jim Lentz: I understand.

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:13.539
The President: All right. Michael.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:14.606
Michael Sprague: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:15.774
It's an honor to be here.

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:16.809
Really appreciate it.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.578
Proud to represent Kia
Motors and our 3,000

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:22.081
employees down in West
Point, Georgia building

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:24.183
the Sorento that you had
an opportunity to see there.

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.217
The President: Sure. Very nice.

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:27.186
Michael Sprague: We opened
that plant back in 2009.

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:30.889
360,000 cars built per
year, 3,000 employees,

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:34.126
15,000 indirect employees,
so really appreciate it.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:36.695
We did it in the height
of the recession.

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:39.298
Took an economic depressed
area and now it's booming.

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:40.933
So, more jobs coming.

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:41.700
The President:
Great, Michael.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.634
Thank you.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:43.669
I heard that.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.403
Michael Sprague:
Thank you.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.437
Appreciate it.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:46.772
Sergio Marchionne: I just
want to thank you for

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:47.740
being here today.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.608
I think my colleagues
have expressed all our

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.076
collective concerns.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.978
There's not much I can
add, but thank you for coming.

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:55.781
The President:
Thank you, Sergio. Governor?

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:56.982
Rick Snyder: Yeah, well,
thank you for coming,

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.117
Mr. President.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:59.852
It's exciting to have
you here at the American

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.553
Center for Mobility.

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.422
This is going to be the
world's best test site

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:05.557
for autonomous
intelligent vehicles.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.326
And it's critically
important to our future

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.061
and you're helping build
that with your thoughts

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:11.797
about tax reform,
regulatory reform,

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.565
that's how we've helped
bring Michigan back.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.534
And we look forward to
working with you and great

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.970
partnership to show how
we can lead the world.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.471
So, thank you for
being in Michigan.

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:20.606
The President: Great.

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.507
Thank you very much.

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:22.408
Thank you, Governor.

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.375
Elaine Chao: Mr.
President, today is a

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.544
win for the American economy and the American worker.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.045
The President: Thank you,
thank you very much.

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:29.014
Keep up the good work. Mary?

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:30.916
Mary Barra: Well, again,
Mr. President, thank you

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.351
for this opportunity.

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:34.386
I think the team has
stated it very well,

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:38.290
but I want to reinforce, you
know, we can do the right thing

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.058
from an environmental perspective.

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.693
We can do it in
an efficient way.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.996
We can make sure that
we're preserving and even

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.030
growing jobs.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.199
So, I see this as a huge
opportunity and I hope

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.967
that we can include
that in the dialogue.

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:49.768
The President: Good.

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:52.371
It will be.

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:53.105
You okay, Dennis?

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.039
You want to go again?

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:54.907
Dennis Williams: I'm fine.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.175
You know, Mr. President,
I'm glad you're here.

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:58.043
I'm really happy to hear
that we're going

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:00.312
to continue to work
on the environment.

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:03.816
The only thing I would
like for you to change

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:06.852
a piece of your discussion
when you say, "We want you

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:10.456
to build your factories
here and be UAW members

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:14.393
so we can have a great
partnership." Okay?

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.094
The President: I
understand that, Dennis.

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:17.696
Dennis Williams: We want
the workers to rise too, right?

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.164
The President: Some things
never change, right?

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:20.466
(laughter)

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.500
Dennis Williams: I mean, we want the workers to rise, right?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.401
The President: We do.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.502
Workers are going
to rise, believe me.

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.604
They're going to have so
many options and so many jobs.

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.506
And we appreciate your
support too, Dennis.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.640
For everything.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.577
Dennis Williams: I've got to convince the Senator down there.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:33.712
The President:
Mark, go ahead.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.247
Mark Fields: Just to reiterate what everybody else says.

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:38.083
We can do right by the
economy, jobs, and we can

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.284
do right by the
environment.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.953
And I think you can have
a -- as everybody said,

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.054
a win-win-win.

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:44.156
I would just like to
emphasize as we -- as we

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:48.527
do this mid-term review, a
very important title was

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:51.697
used when we agreed back
in 2011, which was one

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.265
national standard.

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.667
And so working together
with Car -- California

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:59.371
Resources Board, NITSA,
and also EPA is going

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.441
to be hugely important to the
entire industry to be able

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:04.810
to do this economically
right for the environment

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.911
and right for
the customer.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:06.945
The President: And that'll
be worked out pretty quickly.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:09.114
Very high standards, but worked out quickly. Scott?

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:10.449
Scott Pruitt: Mr.
President, it's an

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:11.450
honor to be
with you today.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.852
It's been wonderful to
meet you here today as well.

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:17.256
As Mark indicated, we've
lived under this narrative

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:19.024
for the last several years
that you can't be pro

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.158
growth and pro environment.

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:22.461
That's something we need
to reject as a country.

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.730
We can grow jobs, we can
be pro growth, and we can

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.498
also be good stewards
of the environment.

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.467
As you look around this
table, Mr. President, each

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:30.002
of these individuals were
told that they were going

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.605
to take a test in April
of 2018 and what happened

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:36.108
last year is that the EPA
said, "No, we're not going

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.776
to give the test
in April of 2018.

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.579
We're going to accelerate
it by 16 months and take

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.647
the test early."

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.614
You righted that today.

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.783
It's great leadership and we appreciate the leadership.

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:45.617
The President: Okay.

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.952
Thank you very
much, Scott.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.820
Jose Munoz: Jose
Munoz with Nissan.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.489
Mr. President, thank
you for the invitation.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.857
It's an honor to be here.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.292
We really appreciate the position that you've

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:54.660
taken today.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.028
It's an historical moment.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:59.398
I want to say that we have
very proudly in America,

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:04.269
since over 58 years, 33
years with production

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:08.540
plants, 22,000 employees,
12,000 of them in Tennessee.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.443
We appreciate the support
very much from Senators

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:15.147
Alexander and Corker and
also from the Governor

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.516
in Tennessee.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:21.853
We have increased our
production in America 78

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:25.023
percent the last five
years, 50 percent sales

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:28.193
increase, more than one
million cars produced.

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:31.597
We have the largest plant
in America, historically,

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:36.735
all brands in Tennessee --
645,000 vehicles produced

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.471
and also the largest
engine plant also

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:42.441
in (inaudible) Tennessee with
over one million

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.475
engines produced.

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:48.146
And we'd been the first
ones implementing

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:50.349
a plant in Mississippi.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:51.450
Thank you very much again.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.451
The President: What
percentage of your cars

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.053
are made here
versus Japan?

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:59.958
Jose Munoz: Well, we do
65 percent of our plants here.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.426
The President: Sold
in the United States?

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.628
Jose Munoz: Yes.

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:03.495
The President: Okay, good.

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:05.631
I had your great Prime
Minister with me.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:06.698
Prime Minister Abe.

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:09.067
He's a great gentleman and
a great -- become a great

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:09.935
friend of mine.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.305
So, we had a very, very
great time two weeks ago.

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.274
You possibly
heard about it.

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:17.342
Great guy.

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:18.243
Jose Munoz: Yes, indeed.

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:19.244
The President: Yes, sir.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.178
Dietmar Exler: Hello,
Mr. President.

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:22.681
I'm Dietmar Exler from
Mercedes-Benz USA.

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.384
Thank you for having us
here today and thank you

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.953
for opening the door
for discussions about

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.489
regulation that can
support growth.

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.391
At Mercedes-Benz, we've
also been producing

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.960
vehicles in the U.S. for about 20 years.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.496
We made -- we started with
the SUV production for

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.231
the whole world here.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.333
We're down in Vance,
Alabama producing over

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:43.368
300,000 vehicles there.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:47.005
About 70 percent actually
exported to other countries

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:47.939
in the world.

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:48.774
The President: Very good.

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.375
Thank you.

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:51.476
Male Speaker: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.412
I think we are the
Benjamin here.

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:55.080
We are the junior
around the table.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.382
We don't have a car yet,
as you probably have seen.

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:59.685
We are -- we are building
a factory in the United

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:03.522
States as we speak in
South Carolina,

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.157
close to Charleston.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:08.060
We will open it
mid next year.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.096
We will start with 60,000
cars and have the capacity

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:14.433
to move along
to 140,000 cars.

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.468
So we are delighted
to be here.

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:19.604
we took a deliberate choice to be in the United States

00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:22.307
and I think we are
happy we took that --

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:23.442
we took that decision.

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:24.409
The President:
Well, thank you.

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:25.544
And South Carolina's
a great place.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:27.245
Very special place.

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:29.181
And again, our Chief of
Staff, Reince, would you

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.449
like to say something?

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:32.317
Reince Priebus: Other than
really proud to work for

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:34.352
the President who
works hard every day.

00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:36.288
I've never seen anyone
work harder than him.

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.524
And the accomplishments
that he's put on the table

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:42.227
so far have been tremendous.

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:45.130
And he's got the hearts of
the American worker

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.598
on his mind every day.

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:49.000
And you're all part of
making that dream come true.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.469
The President: Thank you.

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:52.671
Rick Schostek: Mr. President, I'm Rick Schostek from Honda.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.239
I also want to add our
voice of thanks

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:56.408
for reinstating the mid-term
review process.

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:58.376
Thanks to you and to
Administrator Pruitt,

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:00.145
we very much appreciate that.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.848
Honda has 12 manufacturing
facilities in the United States.

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.184
We've been building
here since 1979.

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:09.921
Not only cars, but lawn
mowers, generators,

00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:11.523
all-terrain vehicles.

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:14.326
I recently opened a plant
making jets in South Carolina

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:16.828
-- business jets in North Carolina.

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.029
The President: I
saw that, beautiful.

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.164
Very nice.

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:20.365
Rick Schostek: I'm
proud to employ 30,000

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:22.434
hardworking men and women
here in the United States.

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.469
And, you know, looking
forward with new

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:26.071
technologies and
environmental technologies

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.974
we just recently announced
along with General Motors

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:31.409
a joint venture to make
fuel cells right here

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:32.377
in Michigan.

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:33.311
The President:
That's great.

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:34.713
Thank you very much, Rick.

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.014
David Dauch: Mr. President, I'm David Dauch from

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:37.916
American Axle Manufacturing,

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.385
tier one automotive of driveline, drivetrain,

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:42.621
and metal-formed products.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:45.423
We support General Motors
and Ford and FCA as well

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:47.759
as many of the other
esteemed OEMs here.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.929
Strong manufacturer
committed to U.S. manufacturing.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.731
We're in the process of
acquiring another U.S.

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.567
based company adding an
additional 30 U.S. plants

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:58.336
to our portfolio
today, which is over 20.

00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:01.840
We'll have 25,000 associates as part of our organization

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.974
when it's all said and done.

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:05.177
So, very committed to U.S. manufacturing.

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:08.446
Very committed to your
agenda and glad to be with

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:09.714
you and support the team.

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:10.649
The President:
Great company too.

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:11.750
David Dauch: Thank you.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.717
Steve Miller: Mr.
President, I'm Steve

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:15.821
Miller, and I am CEO at
International Automotive

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.022
Components.

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:20.091
We have 80 factories
around the world and serve

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:23.061
all of the major
automakers near their

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.830
place of business.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:31.136
You hired my boss, Wilbur
Ross, to join your cabinet --

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.205
The President:
Smart guy, right? Smart?

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:34.639
Steve Miller: He's going
to deal with the trade

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:37.375
issues and he understands them deeply.

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:42.147
Our industry is inherently
a global supply chain.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.114
The President: Right.

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:45.150
Steve Miller: And we need
to make sure that America

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.785
is treated fairly.

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:50.188
But that should not stop
the benefits that all

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.656
people get from trading.

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:52.757
The President: Well, you
do know that we are not

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:53.325
being treated
fairly, though?

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.726
You do know that, right?

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:56.661
I think, better
than anybody.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.697
Steve Miller: Thank
you very much.

00:24:58.697 --> 00:24:59.865
The President: No, America
is not being treated

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:02.000
fairly by the world and
it's going to be treated

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.168
fairly, believe me.

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:06.137
Senator?

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:07.572
Senator Alexander: Thanks,
Mr. President, for bringing

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:10.175
me to Michigan where auto jobs are growing.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.477
When we leave here, we'll
be going to another state

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:14.479
where they're
growing, Tennessee.

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:19.551
Thanks to General Motors,
Nissan, Volkswagen,

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:23.521
and 1,000 suppliers, auto jobs
are now one third of all

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:25.757
of our manufacturing
jobs and the single most

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:28.126
important thing you can do
to help us is what you're

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:32.564
doing today, which is
to create a competitive

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:34.866
environment so that the
plants and the suppliers

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:37.636
in our country can compete
with the rest of the world.

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.337
The President:
Thank you, Senator.

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:40.839
Dave Trott: Dave Trott,
Congressman from

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:41.873
Southeast Michigan.

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.441
Thank you for coming
back to Michigan,

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.376
Mr. President.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.877
We met here several years
ago when you came in for

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.646
the open county
Lincoln dinner.

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.080
I think it's still the
largest Lincoln dinner

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.682
in our state's history.

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:52.751
Thanks for attacking all
the regulations affecting

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:53.852
the auto industry.

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:56.021
People forget all these
regulations that have been

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:59.591
promulgated add a bout $6,000 to the cost of every car.

00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:01.927
And also, I would be
remiss if I didn't tell

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:04.229
you that Speaker Ryan is
doing a great job getting

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.964
your healthcare solution
through the House.

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.032
The President: Good.

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:07.732
Good man.

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:08.767
And I want to
thank you, Dave.

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.669
It's true, about five or
six years ago I was given

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.404
the man of the
year in Michigan.

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:14.439
And I made a speech -- I
didn't know I'd be doing

00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:16.207
this -- I didn't know I'd
be running for President.

00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:18.944
I made a speech and I
said, "Your car industry

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:20.312
is being stolen from you."

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.046
Is that right?

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:24.015
And I spoke about it and
I think the people

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:27.652
of Michigan never forgot that
speech and that's why

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:28.753
we're here.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.388
So -- and I want to thank
you for your support.

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:31.856
You were amazing
for a long time.

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.391
Thank you, David.

00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:35.093
Does anybody have any
questions, and then we're

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:36.361
going to head out.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:38.229
Going to do a
little speech.

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:39.965
Everyone okay?

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:42.367
I want to thank everybody
very much and let's go to

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:45.003
the next event.

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.772
(applause)
