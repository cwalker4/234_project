00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.929
hi everyone we're Eamon &amp; Bec and
we've lived in our self converted

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.370
Sprinter van that you see behind us for
almost a year now if you guys are

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000
interested in learning anything more
about our build how we did it in 30 days

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.310
I'm gonna link all of that below but for
today we thought we would sit down with

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:26.310
you guys and share our top 10 reasons
why you should not should not you should

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.570
not live in a tiny home van or RV or
just a small space in general let's get

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.559
into it
because it's such a small space you are

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.899
constantly cleaning every single inch of
this place is lived in to the T so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.719
you gotta be ready to sweep like are you
kidding me I just found a piece of floss

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.379
on the floor all of this bright white
fresh cabinetry was really great in

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.270
theory until you've lived in a van at a
beach or anywhere for that matter and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.840
you see how dirty it gets real quick so
I'm constantly doing this and yelling at

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.909
everyone for putting their feet up on my
walls bed covers when it comes to dishes

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.310
we do not have a big machine that does
them for us so not only are we left with

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:30.329
cold water only but things tend to pile
up around here because you're limited on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.770
space you're limited on storage so one
thing we might have messed up is we went

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.579
with a little tiny fridge this thing's
not much bigger than a shoebox

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.470
it just means that you have to shop more
often

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.240
that goes for dried goods too this is
where we keep all our cereal pots pans

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.710
yeah you're shopping every couple days
extreme temperatures are only more

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.679
extreme in van life so when it's cold
you guys it is freezing in our tiny

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.810
house you have to picture it you've
worked late you don't have a heater or

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.929
you forgot to turn your heater on you
come back to the van you want to jump in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.049
bed it is not warm on the flip side
you're in Mexico it's 40 degrees and oh

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.569
my gosh it's so freaking hot you can't
possibly take off enough clothing

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.890
extreme temperatures guys it's a real
thing you should not be moving into a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.239
tiny house if you can't be totally aware
of your water usage we only have 15

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.920
gallons at a time so picture this you're
brushing your teeth you're doing dishes

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.720
you're in the middle of a remote amazing
location and all of a sudden you run

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
into water what are you gonna do that
you're not just gonna tap into water

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.819
lines and drinking a little glass of
wine oh you are you're screwed let's go

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.650
we're all right so now you've got the
water pump going you got water we got no

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.000
electricity to bring that water up look
nothing the water pumps not even on or

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.530
even worse you've got smoothie with a
banana ice peanut butter you're ready to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.269
go and make your morning smoothie and
then all of a sudden oh we do a fire but

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.920
you don't have any power you've got to
be aware of your basic hour vents

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.480
totally off the grid so when it comes to
electricity and charging devices we need

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.959
to make sure that our batteries are
fully charged so we charge through solar

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.099
we can plug into Shore power or we
charge off the alternator but it's super

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.239
important that you manage those battery
levels so you're not left in a sticky

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.360
city
otherwise known as no powered so even if

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.990
everything is jim-dandy
you got your 15 gallons full batteries

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:51.330
charge of electricity let's try and make
some pancakes here oh yeah you got to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:01.970
remember to fill your gas kids just one
more thing you gotta manage that's mom

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.220
mom dad please it is literally
impossible to be an introvert when you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.640
live in a min especially when your
partner is a DD extreme extrovert what's

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.239
it with people all the time I can even
remember a time when a man died went

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.200
down to see the fireworks and we thought
oh this will be such a romantic date

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.610
just the two of us and I think we ended
up probably having about a hundred

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.600
people pass through man because of
course a man's giving man tours at 10:00

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.660
p.m. on a Wednesday just something to
think about

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.850
I would not recommend moving into a van
if you do not like cooing in public

00:04:45.850 --> 00:05:05.590
places or have a small bladder the
reality is most days you don't shower if

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.430
you get a dank smell
it's called pits and ditch folks you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.680
gotta get to the sink do a little pit
and you're not okay with that you might

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:23.440
not be okay with van life but hey it's
something you grow to be okay but of

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.060
course there are so many different ways
that you can shower we shower at our

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.690
local gym yoga studios that we get class
pass to friends houses that kind of

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.360
thing oh what a better solar shower
we installed a solar shower and we just

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.630
started getting the hang of using it so
stay tuned for lots more sexy pics of my

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.060
shower
don't move into your vehicle unless you

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.410
are a little bit mechanically inclined
dan repairs can get expensive so you

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.940
want to be able to fix a flat tire
change your oil not just the vehicle

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.850
it's our home so it's important to get
back on the road as quickly as possible

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:10.679
also there's no routine to your day so
if you're one of those creatures of

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:20.249
habit you might not be down with Dan
much morning neighbor since we're always

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:29.600
on the move things are constantly
breaking so you got to be aware of that

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.870
before takeoff you got to make sure you
batten down those hatches

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.810
we got a few outstanding rules no glass
no explosives no sharp objects

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:49.590
a little trim maybe I'll use some epoxy
or something

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.000
clean that up a little bit things you
just got a fix on the fly so should you

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.330
move into a tiny house or a van that's
the question isn't it

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.520
that's why you're here that's why you're
watching for us overall we love it the

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.290
pros way outweigh the cons and that's
kind of how you make big decisions in

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:13.690
life so I hope you hopefully you guys
found this video helpful there's a lot

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:21.940
of things we didn't include like stinky
farts yeah being in such a small space

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.150
with your partner but to be honest we
purposely didn't include those because

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.520
there's nothing you do about stinky fart
stinky farts are gonna happen in your

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.960
bedroom anyway and we don't believe it
up we don't drive each other that crazy

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.680
which a lot of people think is super
weird and I think what's really

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.840
interesting to note is we really
struggle to come up with 10 cons to

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.610
living in we had to get a pen and paper
done write this down so I just goes to

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.980
show you that living in a van at least
for us is 100% the way we want to be

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.520
living right now we really hope you
