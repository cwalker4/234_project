00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.989
There are many places that are famous for
being so secretive and well-protected that

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:04.340
you can never visit them.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340
This list is not about them.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.330
This is about the really well-guarded places
— ones that are so secret that you may not

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.440
have even heard about them.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.120
Let’s take a look at 10 of our favorites…

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.120
10.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.120
Iron Mountain

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.440
On surface, Iron Mountain is a nothing more
than a huge storage company.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.390
However, they have one particular crown jewel
in their collection: Just a few miles from

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.890
Pittsburgh lies the Iron Mountain Vault of
Butler County.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.649
It’s a giant underground complex built in
an abandoned limestone mine, and it hosts

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.920
a truly mind-boggling amount of treasure.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.960
Within its confines, the truly powerful people
and institutions store the things they want

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540
to keep really safe.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.879
The company protects its clients’ confidentiality,
but if you think of a really big name, there’s

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.000
a good chance that they probably have some
secrets stowed away here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.039
Bill Gates stores the 27 million physical
images of the Corbis Image collection here.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.410
The Smithsonian stores many of its records
in the vaults, and other clients include several

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.039
movie studios and, of course, the Government.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.200
It’s easy to see why the Iron Mountain vault
is such a massive hit among the wealthy and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
safety-conscious.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.680
The complex is harder to enter than the White
House.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.350
2,700 people work in this vast network of
white corridors that look like they’re from

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.350
a James Bond movie.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.270
The vault has its own five-engine fire department,
and 125 massive, well-protected vaults that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.609
are artificially cooled with 50-degree water
from an underground lake.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:24.609
9.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:25.609
HavenCo

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.130
You might have heard of Sealand, a small WWII-era
anti-aircraft platform in the international

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.469
waters of North Sea that became a micronation
in 1967.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.749
Thanks to its lawless, grey area nature and
fairly secure physical location, Sealand has

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.979
been a home for all sorts of shady operators,
from pirate radio broadcasters to the Pirate

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.170
Bay and possibly even Wikileaks.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.770
Still, perhaps the strangest operation that
has ever graced its deck is HavenCo.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.840
Sean Hastings and Ryan Lacke founded HavenCo
in 2000 to act as a safe haven for all sorts

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.289
of data operators.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.149
In their own words, their aim was to create
“the world’s first truly offshore, almost-anything-goes

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.569
electronic data haven — a place that occupies
a tantalizing gray zone between what’s legal

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:08.649
and what’s… possible.”

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.870
Creating a data haven into one of the most
difficult-to-reach places on earth was a brilliant,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.379
if mildly unnerving concept that was at the
time hailed as potentially revolutionary.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.799
However, there was a problem.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.209
In fact, there were many problems.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.340
First and foremost of them was the fact that
Sealand has always been on extremely shaky

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.450
legal ground.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.540
It has no allies or international recognition,
so although it is very isolated and well-protected

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.870
by its remote location, any fool who can climb
onboard is technically free to take over.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.570
In fact, it’s likely that the only reason
it hasn’t been attacked a dozen times over

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.060
is the fact that the United Kingdom is just
12 miles away and would probably take offense.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.150
Another difficult nut to crack was the sad
fact that the only kind of content that their

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.239
owners couldn’t (or wouldn’t) host anywhere
else was the kind of content that was very,

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.360
very illegal.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.719
This in turn meant that it would just be a
matter of time before just about every country

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.560
on Earth took a good look at HavenCo, and
ganged up on Sealand.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.410
Perhaps this is why Sealand quietly “nationalized”
HavenCo just two years after its founding,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.770
and moved all its data hosting services to
mainland UK a few years later.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.770
8.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.770
ADX Florence

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.770
File:ADX.CELL.DESIGN.svg

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.670
ADX Florence, aka The Administrative Maximum
Facility, is the toughest and most secure

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.689
“supermax” prison in the United States.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.640
It’s the sort of place that is custom designed
to hold supervillains, and in a way, that’s

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.020
exactly what it does.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.579
This is where the country stores the criminals
it wants to completely and utterly cut away

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.900
from the outside world, and its famous inmates
are a truly mind-boggling parade of terrorists

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.099
and maniacs.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.069
You only need to look at the “bomber”
category of prisoners to get an idea of their

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.230
general notoriety: There’s Ramzi Yousef,
the man behind the 1993 bombing at the World

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.230
Trade Center, and Zacarias Moussaoui, who
carried on his work as a co-conspirator of

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.230
9/11.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.879
There’s the “shoe bomber” Richard Reid,
“Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, and even the

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.510
Boston Marathon bomber.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.849
ADX is known as the “Alcatraz of the Rockies,”
and like its namesake, it’s virtually inescapable.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.139
Heavily armed patrols and massive gun towers
watch the prisoners’ every move, and huge

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.379
walls with razor wire do their level best
to block away the mountains.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.659
And that’s just for the one hour per day
when the prisoners are allowed to stretch

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:06.659
their feet.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.620
For the other 23 hours, the vast majority
of them are locked away in their tiny, 7-by-12-foot

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.769
concrete cells, specifically designed so they
can’t move any furniture or even see the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.320
sky from the window.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.190
Everything is designed with control in mind,
and it’s so effective that one former warden

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.470
describes ADX as “life after death” … and,
in fact, much worse than death.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.150
Perhaps the nastiest trick ADX pulls on its
prisoners is the very first one.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.400
They arrive in prison buses or helicopters,
taking in the beautiful landscape of the Rocky

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Mountains.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.669
And then, they get inside the concrete hell
that blocks all of that beauty from their

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.550
view, and realize: That was the last time
they’d ever see such scenes again.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.550
7.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.280
Bank of England Gold Vault

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.900
Everyone knows about Fort Knox, where the
US stores its gold reserves.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.730
The Bank of England gold vault is basically
that, but for the United Kingdom … and with

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.730
far more style.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.130
A classy, imposing structure in the middle
of London’s Threadneedle street, this 1734

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.689
building has guarded a significant chunk of
the country’s gold bullion for literal centuries.

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.870
The bank building is known as “Old Lady,”
and it’s considered to be so difficult to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.750
break into that there’s a popular saying:
“Safe as the Bank of England.”

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.550
The building’s walls are 8 feet thick, its
safety measures are top-notch, and even its

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.629
keys are foot-long monstrosities… which
are used in conjunction with ultramodern voice

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.310
activation lock technology, naturally.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.251
Although generally considered impossible to
enter without permission, the Bank of England

00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.840
has been breached once.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.629
In 1836, the bank’s directors received a
mysterious letter that told them to meet its

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.889
writer in the gold bullion room at night.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.199
They decided to see what this was all about,
and were extremely surprised when the writer

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.970
dislodged a few floorboards and casually appeared
through the floor, right at the agreed hour.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.389
He was a sewer worker, and had noticed that
a certain drain ran directly underneath the

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:44.389
vault.

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.020
Fortunately for the bank managers, the man
didn’t use his knowledge for evil, and instead

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.940
chose to warn them about this security issue.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.509
The bank rewarded the man with £800 (roughly
$100,000 in today’s cash), and presumably

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.319
blocked the drain immediately afterward, just
in case.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.319
6.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.319
Tumen River

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.970
On paper, Tumen River is a pretty poor excuse
for a river.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.500
Its 320 miles are mostly pollution-tainted
water and sad, swampy marshland.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.180
However, its geopolitical location has made
it one of the most important, well-guarded

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.099
bodies of water in the world.

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.599
It happens to be the border river to not two,
but three countries that are not exactly known

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.770
for their easy-going attitudes: North Korea,
China, and Russia.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.320
Instead of the usual “thalweg principle”
of drawing the country borders by the deepest

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.569
point of the border river, a number of treaties,
disputes and Russia’s acute need to maintain

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.039
direct access to the Sea of Japan have turned
Tumen River into a strange layer cake of criss-crossing

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.039
borders.

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.910
There’s one particularly odd stretch where
the Chinese border extends as a tiny sliver

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.759
in the middle of the river, while Russia and
North Korea hold the shores.

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.960
So if you were to swim across, you’d first
go through a mile of North Korean waters,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.360
then a 300-foot channel of Chinese water,
and then enter Russian waters.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.069
Tumen River’s eccentric borders, tactical
location and the fact that many North Koreans

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.700
use it as an escape route from their country
have made it one of the most guarded rivers

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700
in the world.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.199
Of course, being a body of water, it’s still
one of the less fortified sections of the

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:07.330
North Korea-China border, and escapes across
the river are so common that the nearest Chinese

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.629
city is now one-third Korean-speaking.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.530
North Korean officials are trying to fight
this by guarding the river even more ferociously.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.419
In 2017, Pyongyang reportedly banned all citizens
from going within 500 feet of the river, regardless

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:25.280
of the fact that many of them do need water
for things like laundry and living.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.520
5.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.789
Bold Lane Car Park

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.610
In 2003, a science magazine published a study
that determined the safest places in the world.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.340
Most of the list was what you’d expect:
Fort Knox, Air Force One, and other famous

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.520
places like that.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.729
However, one entry made even the most experienced
science list connoisseurs do a double take:

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:48.530
A humble car park in Derby, UK, known as Bold
Lane Car Park.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.729
Bold Lane Car Park was designed by Ken Wigley,
an agricultural engineer who had a chip on

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.800
his shoulder from the time his car window
was smashed and his stereo was stolen in an

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.830
airport car park.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.270
This is why he designed Bold Lane to be a
very hostile place for car thieves and vandals.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.969
The multi-story car park has all the usual
frills, such as CCTV cameras, barcode tickets,

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:09.379
panic buttons and controlled entry doors.

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:14.759
However, it also has a very clever, computer-controlled
motion sensor system that spots if a parked

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:18.810
car moves, and if the computer determines
that this should not be happening, the site

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.440
goes into full lockdown.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.690
Not that this happens a lot, because at Bold
Lane, the cars that should be staying put

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.699
will stay put.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:28.900
In fact, drivers are specifically requested
to secure their parking bay with a numerical

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.670
code that the system links with their ticket
so it can recognize if the driver has left

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.790
the car park or has returned to it by linking
the bay number with a ticket.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.060
But what if a thief just walks in, wrecks
the ticket machine and drives through the

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.260
control gates after hot-wiring your car?

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.981
Don’t worry, Wigley thought of that, too:
Pedestrians can’t gain access to the car

00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.060
park unless they have the ticket from when
their car entered.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.060
4.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.060
The Greenbrier

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.760
The Greenbrier resort has been a popular gathering
place for the rich and famous socialites since

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.260
the late 18th century.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.010
Its fine premises, the nearby White Sulphur
Springs, and the legendary Old White golf

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.600
course built in 1914 have all attracted wealthy
visitors over the years.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.410
But the Greenbrier used to have hidden depths…

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.410
literally.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.910
Because of its luxury and relative proximity
to Washington DC, the government has often

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.760
used it for various purposes.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.700
During WWII, the Greenbrier housed Axis diplomats
at the request of the State Department.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.880
Then, it was converted to a massive hospital
that treated over 24,000 soldiers during the

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880
war.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.440
And that was just the beginning.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.870
In 1958, the government secretly leased part
of the Greenbrier’s West Virginia Wing,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.510
and started covertly constructing a large
bunker underneath it.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:39.170
The 112,544-square-foot “emergency relocation
center” was built 720 feet into the hillside.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.030
It took three years to complete, and could
accommodate 1,100 people: the entire US Congress

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.720
and the support staff it took to keep them
alive.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720
It had a 25-ton blast door that could, however,
be opened with just 50 pounds of pressure.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.690
It had giant water tanks, purification equipment,
a power plant, top-notch healthcare facilities

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.700
and a communications area for TV and audio
production.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.790
It even had full-size meeting rooms for both
House and Senate.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.060
For 30 years, the bunker remained a secret.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.460
It was constantly updated and maintained by
a tiny group of undercover government employees,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.920
posing as a small audiovisual support service
company called Forsythe Associates.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.820
There’s a good chance that this might still
be the case.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.160
However, a crucial point for a facility like
this is that its location remains a secret.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.760
And so it did, for more than three decades.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.620
On May 31, 1992, The Washington Post published
an article which exposed the facility.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.210
As a direct result, the US government began
de-commissioning The Bunker and ended the

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.340
lease agreement with The Greenbrier in 1995.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.500
Now, should you wish to visit, you can get
a tour of the facility.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.500
3.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.500
The Swiss Vaults

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.160
The Swiss famously make excellent chocolate,
watches and cheese, but what really sets them

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.900
apart is their banking system.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.580
A classic aspect of this is their ultra-secure
vaults.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.320
You’ve probably seen movies where a character
visits a Swiss bank’s underground safety

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.660
locker vault that might look a lot like the
one above, which belongs to Credit Suisse.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.070
Switzerland has a vault for everything.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.770
There are secretive alpine gold stashes where
tiny metal doors leading into mountain tunnels

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.530
once used by the military are protected by
serious-looking men in bulletproof vests.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.200
Private asset management companies offer increasingly
strange supervillain vaults under airports,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.630
and in hyper-secure deep-mountain locations
(“access by helicopter or private plane”).

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.240
There’s even a decommissioned military bunker
where people can store their Bitcoins as personalized,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.270
physical cryptographic keys.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.270
2.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.070
The Mormon Church’s Secret Vaults

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.670
The Mormons, aka The Church of the Latter-Day
Saints, have a massive secret vault in Utah.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.450
This sounds pretty ominous even before you
hear that the site is called Granite Mountain.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.690
It’s easy to suspect supervillain shenanigans
when a religious group starts setting up Iron

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.960
Mountain-style mountain bases, but according
to the Mormons themselves there is nothing

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.270
nefarious going on.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.330
They’ve even opened the complex for a virtual
tour.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.350
Despite its remoteness and the fact that they
don’t exactly welcome unannounced visitors,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.440
the 50 on-site workers have precious little
time to plot for world domination.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.040
They’re too busy digitizing and archiving
their material: The largest collection of

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.170
family history information in the world, which
Utah Mormons have been gathering since the

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.170
1930s.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:59.320
We’re talking about 35 billion images of
genealogical information, most of it contained

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.100
on fragile material such as 2.4 million rolls
of microfilm.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.750
It also stores material that the church sees
“key to church operations, leadership and

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.750
history.”

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:16.430
The reason why the site is fairly closed and
well-protected is simple: People destroy things.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:21.000
Just the dust from your blue jeans can do
terrible things to fragile archived materials,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.920
and constantly marching curious people through
the facility would make it borderline impossible

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.730
to control the temperature.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.730
1.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.730
Vatican Secret Archives

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.300
While we’re on the subject of religions
and their secret stashes, it’s impossible

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.000
not to mention the Vatican Secret Archives.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.710
This grandiose collection of some of the most
interesting documents and artifacts not only

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.110
contains 12 centuries’ worth of history
— it contains the very things history was

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.110
made with.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.830
The archives are not actually as secret as
legend has it — “secretum” actually

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.980
means “private” in Latin, Vatican’s
language of choice.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.700
Still, a private archive in the most heavily
fortified part of Vatican doesn’t exactly

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.920
seem like open door policy, especially since
its indexes are not public and even dedicated

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.230
scholars can’t reach them until they’re
75 years old.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.560
The archives’ main point is to house the
Pope’s official paperwork and correspondence,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.010
along with other documents related to the
Holy See.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.491
Of course, this means that it is full of original
documents that shaped history, so the people

00:13:14.491 --> 00:13:17.930
who wish to access it have to go through a
very careful vetting process.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.890
In recent years, the Vatican has tried to
be a bit more open about the Archives.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.110
They’ve allowed journalists to tour the
complex, and even held a public exhibition

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.880
of selected works in 2012.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.600
Still, the Archives continue to hold plenty
of secrets.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.510
For one, Vatican refuses to release any documents
that are dated after 1939.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.340
This may or may not mean that they’re sitting
on some stuff that indicates that the WWII-era

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:52.770
Pope, Pius XII, quietly collaborated with
Hitler when he didn’t speak up against

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.990
the Holocaust.
