[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.670
RORY TRUEX: I study
Chinese politics

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.336
and I teach courses
on Chinese politics,

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:13.840
so I am grateful for
this opportunity today

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.990
to get to speak to you
about events unfolding

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.220
in China this past year.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.560
So often, when we
talk about China,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.200
we talk about it through the
lens of China-US, the trade

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.890
war, these sorts of things.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.240
But actually, in mainland
China in domestic politics,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.140
this has been a seminal year,
in part because of this man--

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.980
Xi Jinping.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.810
And so today, I wanted
to really just focus

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.792
on giving you a briefing.

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:38.750
I thought that would be
the most helpful thing.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.510
I'd like to give you
a sense of what's

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.850
unfolding this past year,
and what we can think

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.350
will happen moving forward.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.200
So, I wanted to
start-- as I mentioned,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.745
I teach courses on
Chinese politics,

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:53.020
so I wanted to start with an
exam question, which I can see,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.290
there was little
enthusiasm for that.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.730
But here we go.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.950
Bear with me.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.860
So this past fall, I taught
a course on Chinese politics.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.930
And for the final exam,
I asked the students

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.580
to identify a year, a critical
year in the development

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.560
of China, in particular, of
China's political development.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.070
So we have this concept
in political science,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.720
something called a
critical juncture,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.810
which is a jargony way of
saying that is a turning

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.480
point, a year where
certain events unfolded

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.000
and certain decisions
were made that changed

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.620
the trajectory of history.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.290
And so if we look
back at the last 70

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.840
years of the rule of the
Chinese Communist Party,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.685
certain years come
quickly to mind,

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:35.560
which I'm sure many of
you are familiar with.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.050
The first is, of course, 1949.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.160
1949 is the establishment of
the People's Republic of China.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.290
This is a picture of
Mao Zedong standing

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.680
in Tiananmen Square
declaring the establishment

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.360
of the People's Republic.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.550
And for the first
time in decades,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.100
the territory of
mainland China is

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.240
consolidated under the rule
of a single government.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.698
So this was a heady
time for China,

00:01:57.698 --> 00:02:01.300
and signaling the
beginning of Mao's rule.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.900
Another year which
is, of course,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.630
very important is 1978, the
beginning of so-called reform

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.550
and opening-up.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.140
Does anybody here speak
Chinese or study Chinese?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.400
So I remember when I
started taking Chinese,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.380
I took Chinese 101.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.921
And one of the first
words we learned

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:21.070
is [SPEAKING CHINESE],, which
means "reform and opening-up."

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.014
And I swear, 50%
of our lessons were

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:25.180
about reform and opening-up.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.710
So it's an important year.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.440
And for those of you who
are less familiar with it,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.440
this signals the beginning
of China's economic miracle.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.090
So Deng Xiaoping
comes into power

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.430
and takes a much more
pragmatic stance with respect

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.280
to economic policy-making,
basically undoes

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.340
the command part of
the Chinese economy,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.770
and results in an
influx of trade

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.220
and foreign direct investment
in the so-called 30 years

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.564
of 10% economic growth.

00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:50.980
This is the beginning
of this era.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.850
This is him visiting the US,
and he's wearing a cowboy hat.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.900
This is one of the famous
images of reform and opening-up.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.420
Another year is,
of course, 1989.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.640
1989 is the year of
the Tiananmen Square

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.340
movement and the
Tiananmen Square Massacre.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.680
And this is the year where
we learned that the Communist

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.460
Party was willing to do whatever
it took to stay in power

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.480
and was not amenable to the
idea of political reform.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.900
And this is the
year where we saw

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.660
them willing to use live
ammunition on student

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.670
protesters.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.800
And finally, what I'm
going to argue today--

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.940
and I'm starting to come
up with this argument.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.060
It's not fully developed.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.640
But what I argue is that,
potentially, 2017 and 2018

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.397
have the capacity to
be one of those years.

00:03:36.397 --> 00:03:37.480
So it's difficult to know.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.590
We haven't seen history
unfold quite yet.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.712
We haven't seen the
trajectory moving forward.

00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:44.170
But there have been a number
of developments in the last 12

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.920
months that signal
this might be a turning

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.170
point for contemporary China.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.120
In particular, this
is the year where

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.910
Xi Jinping, the current General
Secretary of the Chinese

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.340
Communist Party, has
fully consolidated

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.940
his power, signaled
the start of a new era

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.250
under his rule that
could last well

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.735
beyond his expected
time in power.

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.360
So today, I want to
give you a briefing

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.480
as to what happened this past
year, why I think this might be

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.750
a critical year, and then some
trends to think about moving

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.545
forward, some things that might
be worth paying attention to.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.420
So before I get into
what happened this year,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.300
I want to set the stage to
talk a little bit about how

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.709
we used to talk about China.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.590
And when I say "how we," I mean
mostly the political scientist

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.705
community.

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:26.830
And when I say "used to,"
I mean not that long ago.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.172
I mean only a few years ago.

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:30.880
We used to describe
the Chinese Communist

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.960
Party through the lens of
almost an exceptionalism.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.630
So most authoritarian regimes--
and the Chinese Communist Party

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.580
is an authoritarian regime--

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.020
they don't last very long.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.860
They live short, brutish,
violent existences,

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.160
and they fall from a number
of different threats.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.380
The two most pressing threats
facing any authoritarian leader

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.152
are the threat from within,
the threat of a coup attempt--

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:54.610
actually, there's
some data on this

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.930
from Milan Svolik, who is a
political scientist at Yale.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.138
And he actually shows that
most authoritarian regimes

00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:00.790
die in this way.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.320
They crumble from within.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.180
I think it's roughly 60% to 70%
of authoritarian regimes fall

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.320
via coup, where one leader comes
in and basically institutes

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.156
a new authoritarian regime.

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:11.530
And then the second
way they fall

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.760
is through the
threat of revolution.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.400
This is the more
romantic version

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.740
of how authoritarian
regimes collapse.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.414
The population comes together,
demands political reform,

00:05:21.414 --> 00:05:23.080
and either through
some violent struggle

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.930
or some brokered transition,
the authoritarian regime

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.730
falls and is replaced
with something

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.590
else-- hopefully democracy.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.440
So these are the
two problems facing

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.910
any authoritarian
leader, including

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.360
Xi Jinping, Hu Jintao, Jiang
Zemin, and all the way on back.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.790
And the way we used
to describe the party

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.379
was, wow, this is
a regime that seems

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.170
to have learned from
the lessons of history

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.720
and figured out how to
mitigate some of these issues.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.360
So in particular,
the key feature

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.170
of the authoritarian regime in
China was institutionalization.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.840
So one of the difficulties
for any authoritarian regime

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.050
is how to share power,
how to keep elites happy,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.120
how to transfer power from
one leader to another.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.390
So if we look back in the
2000s, there were a set

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.880
of institutions--
rules and norms--

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.190
that the Communist
Party had developed

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.570
that seemed to be solving this
dilemma of threats from within.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.280
So in particular,
there was a norm

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.620
that no leader would stay in
office longer than 10 years.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.710
So leaders at the very
top, including Xi Jinping,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.520
were expected to stay in
office for two five-year terms.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.190
The successor would be
anointed in advance--

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.310
usually five years in advance,
potentially earlier than that--

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.110
thus smoothing the
power transition,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.410
allowing that person to
develop cache within the system

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.130
and experience.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.130
There would be well-established
retirement ages,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.870
so people would be
forced to leave office

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.090
and wouldn't hang on too long.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.510
Power was exercised
not by just one person,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.510
but collectively, where
each leader at the top--

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.940
and when I say the
top, I generally

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.190
am referring to what's known
as the Politburo Standing

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.560
Committee, the top tier of
leadership of the Chinese

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.990
Communist Party, usually
seven to nine leaders.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.570
Each leader would be
given a portfolio.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.479
And while there would be
one most senior leader,

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.020
they would cooperate
with each other.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.450
They would play nice.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.460
So these were the
key institutions

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.580
that we look back on under
Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.180
the two predecessors
of Xi Jinping,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.740
and we say these institutions
contributed to the resilience

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.975
of the Communist Party.

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:17.350
So that's the
threat from within.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.810
The threat from
below-- revolution--

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.690
the Communist Party is
an authoritarian regime.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.430
It uses the language
of democracy

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.960
and claims to be democratic,
but no self-respecting political

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.410
scientist would call the Chinese
Communist Party democratic.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.180
But nevertheless,
in the 2000s, it

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.390
looked like the party was
starting to develop mechanisms

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.424
for citizens to have a voice.

00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:42.590
So these weren't democratic.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.210
They were tightly
controlled by the party.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.709
But nevertheless, there were
channels through which citizens

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:47.990
could voice their concerns.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.510
This is everything
from a petition system,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.300
village elections, a People's
Congress system, which

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.210
is their legislative system,
online public opinion

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.440
portals, mayor's mailboxes.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.107
It's getting increasingly
online and digital.

00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:02.690
But there were
channels in place where

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.520
citizens could funnel
their grievances

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.330
and the party could respond.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.470
And so some of the language
we used to describe

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.150
the party at this time was--

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.340
we used to call it
responsive authoritarianism

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.410
or consultative
authoritarianism.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.870
In general, this is
a more tolerable form

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.970
of authoritarian regime.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.652
This wasn't a
tinpot dictatorship.

00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:23.360
This was a regime that
was sophisticated,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.280
and institutionalized,
and seemed to be trying

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.339
to mitigate these issues.

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:28.880
So that's how we
used to describe it.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.305
And this argument-- I
should cite the author.

00:08:31.305 --> 00:08:32.690
His name's Andrew Nathan.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.464
This was made in 2003 if any of
you want to do further reading.

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:37.130
I'm sure you have
plenty of other things

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.799
to do with your
time, but the article

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.900
is called "Authoritarian
Resilience."

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.549
So enter Xi Jinping.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.870
So Xi Jinping is the
current General Secretary

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.980
of the Communist Party.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.170
So I'm afraid I'm
going to have to get

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.730
in a little bit
of the weeds here

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.630
in terms of the Chinese
leadership system,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.060
but bear with me.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.790
So any top leader of
China today actually

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.894
has three different positions.

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:02.810
So the first is that
they're General Secretary

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.372
of the Chinese Communist Party.

00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:06.580
That's the head of the party.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.650
That's the most
important position.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.550
They are also de facto President
of the People's Republic

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.970
of China, which is the head of
state, the government position.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.740
The party and the government
on paper are separate things.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.366
In reality, they're
heavily intertwined

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.990
and the party dominates
the government.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.200
And actually, in my experience,
many Chinese citizens

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.351
have trouble differentiating
the party institutions

00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:31.600
and the party positions from
the government positions.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.272
But Xi Jinping's party
position is General Secretary.

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:35.980
His government position
is the president.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.690
And he also has a
military position.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.430
He's chair of what's known
as the Central Military

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.929
Commission.

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:42.760
So he's head of state, head
of party, head of military.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.090
So he assumed these
positions in 2012,

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.710
and we are just finishing
up his first term in office.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.040
And therefore, he's expected
to retire in 2022-2023.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.339
Now prior to coming to office--

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:57.130
I just want to emphasize
a couple of things

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.560
about Xi Jinping's rise.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.240
The first is, like
many Chinese leaders,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.020
you might hear of this
so-called China model, this idea

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.570
that China is a
meritocratic system

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.300
and people are promoted based
on their abilities, and talents,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.460
and experience, and so forth.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.070
That is a highly controversial
argument to make.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.690
What I would say
is that Xi Jinping,

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.940
like many other
Chinese leaders, had

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.030
a lot of governing experience
upon entering his highest

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.570
position.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.600
So he rose up the
ranks from a young age,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.320
was party secretary
and mayor and governor

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.490
of various different
parts of China,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.740
was involved in the
Central Party School.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.609
He actually helped run
the Beijing Olympics.

00:10:34.609 --> 00:10:36.400
So by the time he became
General Secretary,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.470
he was highly experienced.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.180
The second feature
of his rise is

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.700
that he is what's
known as a princeling.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.100
So in Chinese
politics, a princeling

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.790
is simply a leader whose
father or grandfather-- and I

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.570
apologize for using
male nouns here,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.250
but this is empirically true.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.850
Almost all Chinese
leaders are male.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.730
A princeling is a Chinese leader
whose father or grandfather

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.986
was also a leader.

00:11:01.986 --> 00:11:03.360
And so Xi Jinping's
father's name

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.076
is Xi Zhongxun, who actually
worked with Mao Zedong

00:11:06.076 --> 00:11:08.200
before being purged during
the Cultural Revolution.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.465
But Xi Jinping, because of
this princeling status--

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:13.090
an American princeling would be
like Chelsea Clinton and George

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.880
W. Bush.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.450
That's how you can
draw the connection.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.610
Because of this
princeling status,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.287
he potentially had a
more accelerated rise,

00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:23.620
and he had a certain level
of prestige within the system

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.010
early on.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.430
And then the third thing I
would talk about about his rise

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.040
is that, like many Chinese
leaders, prior to him

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.880
coming to power, we actually
didn't know a lot about him.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.460
So one way to rise up
through the Chinese system

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.830
seems to be to keep
your head down,

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.840
to develop relationships
with patrons

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.700
who are higher in
office than you,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.970
and not take any dramatic policy
stances in either direction.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.880
So prior to coming
into office, we really

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.190
didn't know a lot about what
Xi Jinping was all about.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.760
And if you look back at some
of the discourse about him

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.060
in 2012 and 2013,
a lot of people

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.070
believed he was
China's Gorbachev.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.710
So this is a
democrat in waiting.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.210
He's going to be
the one who finally

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.660
liberalizes China and
embarks on political reform.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.910
And the basis for these
claims was, in retrospect,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.690
fairly weak.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.482
Xi Jinping spent time in Iowa.

00:12:15.482 --> 00:12:16.690
This is him as a younger man.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.030
He spent time in Iowa
on an exchange program.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.250
So he spent time in Iowa.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.530
His daughter attends
Harvard University.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.640
Therefore, he must get it.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.922
He must be a liberal.

00:12:26.922 --> 00:12:29.380
As it turns out, this conjecture
couldn't have been further

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.190
from the truth.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.080
Xi Jinping is a reformer.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.580
And I'll talk more
about that later.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.250
But he is a reformer
of the illiberal sort.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.920
So he's moving China in a more
authoritarian direction, not

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.640
a more democratic direction.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.300
So what happened in 2017-2018?

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.890
Why is this past 12
months such a big deal?

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.480
Well, there were
really three events

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.650
that unfolded that really
changed what we thought

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.030
we knew about Chinese politics.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.020
The first occurred at what's
known as the Party Congress.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.960
The Party Congress
occurred last fall.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.774
It's a meeting of the 2,000 most
powerful members of the Chinese

00:13:01.774 --> 00:13:02.440
Communist Party.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.200
It happens only once
every five years.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.350
And during this
event, we typically

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.220
see the unveiling of
new leadership circles.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.660
And what we were expecting
to see, based on precedent,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.749
was that Xi Jinping--

00:13:16.749 --> 00:13:18.790
there would be a new group
of top seven leaders--

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.248
Xi Jinping would still be in
power because he still has one

00:13:21.248 --> 00:13:22.570
five-year term left--

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.600
but that there would
be a successor.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.700
So we would see
two new leaders put

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.800
into the top tier of the
Chinese Communist Party,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.049
and it would be generally
understood, potentially even

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:33.240
announced, that these
people were going

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.830
to take over from Xi Jinping.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.702
There would be a new
successor in waiting.

00:13:36.702 --> 00:13:38.160
So first thing we
learned this fall

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
is that there actually-- when
this new leader-- this is

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.200
the event, this image
that I'm showing here.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.630
That's actually four out
of the new seven members

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.370
of the Politburo
Standing Committee.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.070
There was no
successor announced.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.090
So remember, I talked
about institutions.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.860
This is a big one, having a
successor named in advance.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.480
That one's gone.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.900
And why is this a big deal?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.750
Well, actually, basically since
the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.250
the Tiananmen Square
incident, there

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.240
has been a successor in place
in the Chinese political system.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.760
So it was known that Jiang
Zemin would transfer power

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.200
to Hu Jintao.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.050
Xi Jinping came to office in
the Politburo Standing Committee

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.910
in 2007.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.751
It was known that he would
take over for Hu Jintao.

00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:20.250
So now, for the
first time, we don't

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.850
have a successor, which means
this can generate instability.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.397
So if an authoritarian regime--

00:14:26.397 --> 00:14:26.980
we don't know.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.330
If something ever
happened to Xi Jinping,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.413
if he had a health problem
or something like this,

00:14:30.413 --> 00:14:32.746
there would be a major
public power struggle.

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:34.120
So that was the
event number one.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.770
Event number two is a
little more into the weeds,

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.260
but I thought we could
have some fun with it.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.230
So this is event number two.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.140
And I had to write
it down because I

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.520
have trouble remembering
all of the language.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.960
But I encourage you
all to memorize this--

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.900
"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.980
for the New Era."

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.810
This is a mouthful.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.730
I am not a native
speaker of Chinese,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.390
and my Chinese is probably
suspect, but [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.580
That's it in Chinese.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.710
To me, it also sounds like
a mouthful in Chinese.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.626
There are native Chinese
speakers in the room.

00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:10.840
I heard you before, so maybe
you can tell me if you agree.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.650
But another feature of the
Chinese political system

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:19.040
is that any elite
leader is expected

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.320
to make an ideological
contribution to the Communist

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.550
Party doctrine.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.160
So every leader has
their pet phrase.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.620
Mao Zedong has Mao
Zedong Thought.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.520
Deng Xiaoping has
Deng Xiaoping Theory.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.014
Jiang Zemin's contribution is
known as The Three Represents.

00:15:35.014 --> 00:15:37.430
It should be said that it's
not called Jiang Zemin's Three

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.940
Represents.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.070
It's just called The
Three Represents.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.930
Scientific Concept of
Development is Hu Jintao.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.780
And so now, Xi
Jinping's contribution

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.640
is known as Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.410
with Chinese Characteristics
for the New Era.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.470
This phrase was put
into the Constitution,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.450
the charter of the
Communist Party itself.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.700
And it was done so while
Xi Jinping was still

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.050
in office, still in power.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.970
Usually, it happens
after the fact.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.490
So if we dissect this phrase,
a few things stand out.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.730
First, Xi Jinping--
his name is in it.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.320
So it's a named phrase.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.320
This honor had only been
reserved for Mao Zedong

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.460
and Deng Xiaoping.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.470
So here we have Xi
Jinping placing himself

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.979
on par with those two leaders.

00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.020
The second word I want
you to pay attention to is

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.550
"thought," [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.630
So remember, there's Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.530
Theory.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.940
So there are some analysts who
believe that a thought actually

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.704
is higher than a theory.

00:16:33.704 --> 00:16:35.370
Well, now, we're
getting into semantics.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.880
But it's telling that Mao
Zedong had Mao Zedong Thought.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.280
So now we have Xi Jinping
Thought, Mao Zedong Thought.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.700
So not only is he
putting himself

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.120
on par with Mao and Deng, he
may be only putting himself

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.520
on par with Mao and above Deng.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.110
Socialism with Chinese
characteristics

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.480
is an old, tired phrase in
Communist Party ideology.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.450
It's basically their way
of justifying the fact

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.670
that they've gone a market
direction while still

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.920
using socialist language.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.847
So this is actually
not a new phrase.

00:16:59.847 --> 00:17:01.930
But the last thing that I
think is, in some sense,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.829
the most important
is the New Era.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.609
So Xi Jinping is declaring
that we are in a new era,

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.010
and he is at the center.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.840
And up until this
point, we have generally

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.089
thought that China was in
the so-called reform period.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.510
So beginning in 1978, we have
the reform and opening-up.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.280
That was the period we were in.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.530
Xi Jinping is saying we are
in the end of that period.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.390
We are in a new era,
and I am at the center.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.660
So that was event number two.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.590
Event number three
occurred this past March,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.800
where we had an amendment
to China's constitution

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.470
that got rid of term limits for
the position of the presidency.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.570
So prior to this, the
position of the presidency,

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.590
which, you remember, is Xi
Jinping's government position,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.350
was governed by two
five-year term limits.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.485
And this past spring,
which, honestly,

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.610
would have been unbelievable
five or 10 years ago--

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.934
that term limit was
gotten away with.

00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:55.850
So the interpretation
of all of these events--

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.292
so again, just to reiterate,
so we have no successor,

00:17:58.292 --> 00:18:00.250
we have Xi Jinping Thought
in the Constitution,

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.570
and now we have no term limits.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.804
The interpretation among
the China studies community

00:18:05.804 --> 00:18:07.220
and the China
watcher community is

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.320
that this signals that
Xi Jinping is potentially

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.810
trying to stay on past
his expected retirement

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.960
in 2022, the
so-called Xi for life.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.420
And I titled the
talk not Xi For Life,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.920
I titled it "Xi For Life?"

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.609
with a question mark
at the end of it

00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:23.150
because I think it's
important for us

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.070
all to remember
that what we know

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.010
about elite politics in China
is actually quite little.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.200
It's an extremely opaque system.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.510
And so people that
observe the system,

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.810
we're left to take
these very crude signals

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.450
and try to infer what's going
on between the party leaders

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.530
and what's going
on in their heads.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.450
And so I think it's a
bit premature to say oh,

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.230
he'll be in there for
the rest of his life.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.410
Although Donald Trump actually
congratulated him on being--

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.140
I went 20 minutes without
bringing up Donald Trump.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.430
So my own interpretation--
so one possibility,

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.000
he is intending to stay on.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.050
That's one possibility.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.100
A second possibility is
he is using these moves

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.380
to further consolidate power
and create uncertainty.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.440
So one feature of the
Chinese political system

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.200
is if you anoint a
successor, you actually

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.110
are creating a rival, and you're
creating a new base of power.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.630
And instantly, that person who
is the successor in waiting

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.730
becomes quite
powerful, and you're

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.980
a lame duck for five years.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.900
And so maybe by not
anointing a successor

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.940
and signaling that he
might want to stay,

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.364
he's just maintaining his
own bargaining leverage.

00:19:28.364 --> 00:19:29.780
So that's one other
interpretation

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.120
that I think is
important to think about.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.700
Either way, my own feeling
is that whether or not

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.532
he stays in office or
retires, it actually

00:19:37.532 --> 00:19:38.990
doesn't matter as
much as you might

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.020
think because if he does
install a successor,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.830
he will likely try to
install a lackey of his own.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.500
So he will install someone
who is loyal to him,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.010
and he will rule from
behind the scenes.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.120
And this is also common
in the Chinese system.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.525
Deng Xiaoping continued to rule
despite not actually having

00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:57.620
the highest level title.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.340
So power in the Chinese system
is in some sense about titles,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.930
and in many others,
it's actually

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.270
about personal relationships
within the system.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.760
So either way, I
think one takeaway

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.260
I want you to come away
with from the talk today

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.990
is that we are likely in an
era where Xi Jinping is going

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.600
to be at the center of the
Chinese political system not

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.230
just for the next five years,
but likely for the next 10, 15,

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.150
possibly even 20 years.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.380
Of course, it's
difficult to predict.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.170
So what do we know
about Xi Jinping?

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.664
So if we're in his era--

00:20:25.664 --> 00:20:27.080
we've gotten a
chance to watch him

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.452
in office now for five years.

00:20:28.452 --> 00:20:29.660
So what is he actually about?

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.280
What does he care about?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.870
What makes him tick?

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.807
If I had to describe
him in three words,

00:20:35.807 --> 00:20:36.890
I would use the following.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.490
I would say he's nationalist,
he is authoritarian,

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.300
and he's populist,
that combination.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.790
So nationalism-- one of the key
phrases of Xi Jinping Thought--

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.570
and I encourage you to go
study Xi Jinping Thought--

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.814
is this idea of the so-called
China Dream or Chinese Dream

00:20:53.814 --> 00:20:55.480
depending on how you
see it translated--

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.680
[SPEAKING CHINESE] in Chinese.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.830
The Chinese Dream
dates back to this idea

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.510
of national rejuvenation.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.760
There is a narrative in the
Chinese political system

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.250
that China was once
a great nation.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:12.010
That status was robbed of it
by foreign imperialist powers,

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.780
beginning with the Opium War.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.180
There is a century
of humiliation

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.880
where China is
repeatedly infringed

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.292
upon by foreign powers.

00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:22.000
And only when the
Chinese Communist Party

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.820
comes to power in 1949,
that's the establishment

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.390
of a new China, and
China has stood up.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.610
And so Xi Jinping's
China Dream is

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.110
an extension of that narrative.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.930
And the basic dream, as
it has been articulated,

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.320
is that China will once again
become a strong, powerful,

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.040
and prosperous nation.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.760
One of the most cliche things
you can say about China

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.160
is that it is a
collectivist culture.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.960
This is a pet peeve of mine.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.810
It's a very simplistic
way of thinking,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.700
and it's, in some sense,
an orientalist way

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.800
of describing China.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.840
But in this instance,
I think it's

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.614
important to emphasize
that this China Dream--

00:22:00.614 --> 00:22:02.280
Americans hear this,
and they think, oh,

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.100
that's the American dream.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.099
That sounds pretty good.

00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:05.640
It's actually quite distinct.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.710
So this is an image of
one of the propaganda

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.080
posters of the China Dream.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.580
And you'll see, in
Chinese, it says,

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.870
[SPEAKING CHINESE], China Dream.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.286
And under it,
[SPEAKING CHINESE],,

00:22:14.286 --> 00:22:15.510
means my dream.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.030
So we literally have the
individual being placed

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.100
subservient to the nation.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.574
And to be working
under the China Dream,

00:22:23.574 --> 00:22:24.990
for an individual
Chinese citizen,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.330
it's about achieving
the collective goal

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.530
of national rejuvenation.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.410
So this isn't about I'm going
to work hard and better myself

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.410
like the American dream.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.200
This is a collective dream.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.580
This nationalism has been
ramped up in recent years.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.310
And it seems to me that
increasingly, the party

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.870
is relying on nationalism
as a source of legitimacy.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.190
So under the Mao era, the source
of legitimacy was ideology

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.220
and Mao himself.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.080
Under the reform period,
under Deng Xiaoping

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.230
and his successors, the source
of legitimacy was performance.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.020
So we are going
to deliver goods--

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.970
economic growth, public good
provision, and so forth.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.390
Now, economic growth
is slowing in China.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.322
It's down to roughly 6%.

00:23:04.322 --> 00:23:06.170
And so a new source
of legitimacy, it

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.260
seems that nationalism
will be the source of that.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.870
And we see Xi Jinping being
increasingly assertive

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.292
on the international stage.

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:16.250
You might have heard
about the South China Sea,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.940
China's territorial claims
there, his willingness

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.890
to build islands and install
military installations

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.304
on those islands to
buttress territorial claims.

00:23:25.304 --> 00:23:27.470
China's growing increasingly
aggressive with respect

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.604
to Taiwan and
reunification with Taiwan.

00:23:30.604 --> 00:23:33.020
You might have heard of the
One Belt, One Road Initiative,

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.353
or the Belt and Road Initiative.

00:23:34.353 --> 00:23:36.740
It's constantly rebranded.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.010
But this is so-called
China's Marshall Plan.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.920
It will be a multibillion
dollar investment

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.600
project spanning
multiple countries

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.820
and multiple continents.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.630
So we have a nationalistic,
assertive Xi Jinping.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.650
The second adjective I use to
describe him is authoritarian.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.322
China always has these cycles.

00:23:56.322 --> 00:23:58.280
If you look at the long
arc of Chinese history,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.060
there are ups and downs.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.310
There are periods of opening
and periods of closing.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.579
Mao Zedong comes to power,
and we see a closing

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:08.870
with the Great Leap Forward
and the Culture Revolution.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.130
Deng Xiaoping comes
to power, and we

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.200
see an opening, where
political discourse has

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.710
liberalized a little bit.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.880
Then we have Tiananmen
Square Massacre, a closing.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.770
Then actually, if we
look back at the 2000s,

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.270
we didn't maybe
realize it at the time,

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.020
but that was a period
of relative openness

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.660
in Chinese society.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.070
Under Xi Jinping,
we have entered

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.339
into another closed period.

00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:28.880
And I would argue--
and I don't think

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.560
I'm alone in this--
that China today

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.380
is the most repressive
it's been since the period

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.750
just following the
Tiananmen Square Incident.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.910
And this has manifested
itself in a lot of ways.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.567
There's increasing control among
civil society organizations.

00:24:41.567 --> 00:24:43.400
One of the key tenants
of Xi Jinping Thought

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.400
is that party should dominate
all aspects of society.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.180
We also see the party
willing to use good,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.040
old-fashioned
repression, detentions,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.250
torture, intimidation to
groups that it doesn't like.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.530
This is an image of Li Wenzu.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.050
She is the wife of the
man in that picture

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.237
there, Wang Quanzhang,
who is what's

00:25:02.237 --> 00:25:03.320
known as a Weiquan lawyer.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.760
The Weiquan lawyers in China--

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.040
Weiquan just means
rights protection.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.930
These are effectively
public defenders.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.450
They are a group of lawyers
who are civic-minded,

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.970
and have tried to use the
principles of the Chinese

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.000
constitution-- which is actually
quite liberal on paper--

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.830
to help Chinese citizens protect
themselves from the government.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.630
So they take cases on
everything from labor issues,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.530
environmental issues,
property rights protection,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.600
so people who have had
their property demolished

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.752
by the Chinese government.

00:25:30.752 --> 00:25:32.210
So these are people
that are trying

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.820
to work on behalf
of the population,

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.540
and to protect them from
the government using

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.284
the Constitution.

00:25:39.284 --> 00:25:40.700
So they're not
radicals, actually.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.070
They're not
advocating revolution.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.890
Most of them are advocating
that the government

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.010
abide by constitutionalism
and rule of law.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.780
Today, in China,
such individuals

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.360
to be this type of lawyer
has become a crime,

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.699
and hundreds of them
have been detained.

00:25:55.699 --> 00:25:57.490
This particular
individual, Wang Quanzhang,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:02.330
was detained for three
years without any meeting

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.140
with his lawyer.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.520
There's a certain irony in that.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.915
Not allowed to meet his family.

00:26:05.915 --> 00:26:08.040
We just found out last week
that he is still alive,

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.540
but I was at an event two
weeks ago where his wife spoke,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.480
and she was unclear
whether he was still alive.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.660
So it's important to
keep talking about this.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.090
I think a lot of us, when we
go to China-- myself included--

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.280
you get there, and you
think, oh, this isn't so bad.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.720
Really, it's not
that bad at all.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.120
It seems pretty normal here.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.590
And that's on purpose.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.800
And a lot of the repression
hums along in the background,

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.110
and it's easy to overlook it.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.617
And it doesn't affect
most of the population.

00:26:35.617 --> 00:26:37.950
But for those individuals
that do try to advocate things

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.770
like human rights
and political reform,

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.790
the regime is willing to
do the dirty business.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.230
So Xi Jinping is authoritarian.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.299
He is nationalistic.

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:49.340
And the final thing I
would say is he's populist.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.850
So one of the
hallmarks of his rule

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.970
which you might have heard of
is the anti-corruption campaign.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.210
So Xi Jinping came to office,
and he was quite different

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.360
from his predecessors.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.700
He had a little charisma.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:05.280
Hu Jintao was known as
being a bland technocrat.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.220
Xi Jinping, upon
coming into office,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.440
he went to a steamed
bun shop in Beijing,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.400
ate with normal people.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.970
He fosters this image
as a man of the people.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.760
And one of the key
features of his rule

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.440
has been cracking
down on corruption.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.930
And corruption in China
was the main threat

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.150
to the survival of the
Chinese Communist Party.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.780
So if you look at
survey data in China,

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.380
corruption was always ranked
as the number one or number two

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.270
issue among the
Chinese population.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.580
The levels of corruption
were quite high.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.530
This is a feature of
an authoritarian system

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.370
with no electoral
accountability, no freedom

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.190
of the press, a lack of
civil society organizations,

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.310
undergoing the process where
business assets are being

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.552
gone from public to private.

00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:47.010
So this is a recipe
for corruption.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.170
So Xi Jinping comes to power.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.500
And immediately, we see a
crackdown on so-called tigers

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.100
and flies.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.257
Tigers are senior
levels of officials

00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:56.340
within the Chinese system.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.520
So he's willing to go
after the big officials.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.940
And then if you're a
lower-level official in China,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.889
you're called a
fly, which is tough.

00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:07.680
Maybe one day you'll
grow up to be a tiger,

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.170
but for now, you're a fly.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.170
So Xi Jinping's
anti-corruption campaign

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.874
signals his willingness to
tackle the tough issues.

00:28:16.874 --> 00:28:18.540
The interpretation
about this campaign--

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.123
there are really two
that you'll hear.

00:28:20.123 --> 00:28:22.260
The first is that this is
all just a political ploy

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.930
to purge his enemies.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.680
And I believe there
is some truth to that.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.096
If you look at the highest
levels of the Chinese Communist

00:28:28.096 --> 00:28:31.470
Party, individuals who have
been investigated invariably

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.140
are not in Xi Jinping's
personal clique.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.600
They are people who are in
the rival faction or people

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.270
who might be opposed to him.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.310
That said, the
other interpretation

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.746
is that this is a genuine
effort at cleaning up the party.

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:45.870
And if you go to China and
you talk to individuals,

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.965
there is some optimism that
Xi Jinping is a strong leader,

00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:50.340
he's a competent
leader, and he's

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.040
the one that is going
to clean up the party.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.260
I think there's some
truth to both narratives.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.930
If he's investigated hundreds
of thousands of individuals,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.420
I have trouble believing
that all of this

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.470
is politically motivated.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.110
I do think there is some genuine
anti-corruption behavior going

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.980
on.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.100
But it's important not to be
too rosy about this development,

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.140
in the sense that
actually fighting

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.530
corruption is
difficult, but we know

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.720
the recipe for success
in political science

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.366
and economics.

00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:17.490
How do you stop corruption?

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.400
Well, you provide
information to citizens

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.730
on things like government
contracts and assets

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.625
of officials.

00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:26.250
You have a free press,
which is allowed

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.679
to do muckraking journalism.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:29.220
You have a civil
society organization

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.080
that works with them.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.667
You have anti-corruption
agencies that are independent

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:35.250
and a court system
that's independent.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.090
And over time, you'll see
the reduction of corruption.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.530
None of those
features that I just

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.840
named are present
in Xi Jinping's

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.530
anti-corruption campaign.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.280
So this is a top-down
campaign, driven

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.400
by the party, kept
within the party,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.616
and the party is basically
trying to police itself.

00:29:53.616 --> 00:29:55.240
And so that's important
to keep in mind

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.322
when we talk about the
anti-corruption campaign.

00:29:57.322 --> 00:29:58.780
So that's what Xi
Jinping is about.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.880
He's populist,
he's authoritarian,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.620
and he's nationalistic.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.540
In terms of his popularity,
I would say, I look at it

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.540
and I actually see,
if he is popular,

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.510
it's for the same reasons
that Donald Trump is popular.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.930
I went another 10 minutes
without bringing up his name.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.190
So the Chinese Dream is kind of
a version of Make America Great

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.700
Again.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.240
It's Make China Great Again.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.950
I hate to be simplistic, but
there is a similarity there.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.410
The authoritarianism-- so
Donald Trump and Xi Jinping

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:33.040
are both willing to speak the
language of law and order,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.750
and use the tools of coercion
to try to repress outgroups.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.730
That is a common
feature in their rule.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.150
And then the populism-- so
the anti-corruption campaign

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.299
is actually a version
of drain the swamp.

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:48.090
And actually, I think,
in the Chinese case,

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.719
it's more authentic
than what we're

00:30:49.719 --> 00:30:51.760
seeing with Donald Trump
in terms of a commitment

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.740
to clean governance, of course.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.630
So the question is,
is Xi Jinping popular?

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.540
And as a foreigner
standing in New York,

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.590
I am hesitant to even
weigh in on this.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.750
But my own sense--

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.000
first of all, any time we
try to assess the popularity

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.170
of an authoritarian regime--

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.003
this is sort of one of
the classic questions

00:31:07.003 --> 00:31:08.530
in political science--

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.051
it's very difficult to
do, because let's say

00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:12.800
you could do a survey,
and you ask people,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.175
do you approve of
the performance

00:31:14.175 --> 00:31:15.880
of Xi Jinping in office?

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.030
First of all, in China, you
can't ask that question.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.181
I do surveys in China.

00:31:20.181 --> 00:31:22.180
You're not allowed to ask
this sort of question.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.260
In other authoritarian
countries--

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.926
so Putin and other
authoritarian leaders

00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:26.676
have public opinion
polling about them.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.050
In China, you're not allowed
to ask about the performance

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.610
of any individual leader.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.090
But let's say, even if we
did have that question,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.560
and we see a lot
of people approve,

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.560
is it because they
actually approve?

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.360
Is it because they've
been indoctrinated

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.440
to say they approve?

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.410
Or is it because
they are scared,

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.810
and they say they approve even
though they don't approve?

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.730
So it's very difficult
to differentiate

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.900
those different possibilities.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.440
So we don't really know
how popular Xi Jinping is.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.470
That's an important
thing to emphasize.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.990
My own sense, through my
conversations with students,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.970
friends in China,
and other people,

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.770
is that he does maintain
a broad base of support.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.630
So people who are intellectuals,
liberals, business elites,

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.240
are generally less supportive
of him because of the themes

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.750
I've just outlined.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.720
But among the
common population he

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.100
seems to be viewed as a
strong leader who is helping

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.930
change China for the better.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.290
He's assertive abroad, and he's
tough at home on people who

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.880
have been guilty of corruption.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.080
So he does have a
base of support.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.830
So all that being
said, what are we

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.169
looking about-- what
should we be thinking

00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:34.460
about moving forward for China?

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.900
And why was
2017-2018 a big year?

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.397
I wanted to point to really
three troubling trends for us

00:32:42.397 --> 00:32:43.480
to think about as a group.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.980
The first is that we're
seeing an increasing

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:50.300
cult of personality
about Xi Jinping.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.340
So again, another
cliche or trope

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.230
in the study of Chinese
politics-- you'll

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.230
see a lot of "Time"
magazine covers or magazine

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.330
covers where you'll see
an image of Mao Zedong,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.610
and then it'll be peeled
back, and there'll

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.680
be an image of Xi Jinping
underneath or something

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.180
like that.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.550
So people keep referring
to him as the next Mao,

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.870
or China's next emperor.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.790
There's just a series
of phrases that

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.210
are used over and over again,
along with things like dragon.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.320
There's a certain way
people report about China,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.980
which is a little simplistic.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.290
But there is some
truth to this idea

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.916
that there is a cult
of personality being

00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:25.040
fostered around Xi Jinping.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.020
This is the cover of
the "People's Daily,"

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.540
"Renmin Ribao," which is the
mouthpiece of the Chinese

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.580
Communist Party.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.620
In red-- this is
not my own analysis.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.040
This was a report in "The
Wall Street Journal."

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.910
But they noticed that Xi Jinping
had been mentioned 11 times--

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.780
the leading word in 11
titles on the front page

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.430
of the "People's Daily."

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.130
And he's been mentioned
more on the front page

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:53.517
of the "People's Daily" than any
other leader since Mao Zedong.

00:33:53.517 --> 00:33:55.100
So this is troubling
in and of itself.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.933
What's particularly
troubling about it is it

00:33:56.933 --> 00:34:00.160
leads to a second phenomenon
which is Yes Man politics.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.790
And so it seems to me that at
the elite level in China today,

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:08.260
to oppose Xi Jinping, especially
publicly, is career suicide.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.850
And so what we're
observing instead

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.862
is a lot of sycophants,
a lot of people trying

00:34:11.862 --> 00:34:13.570
to ingratiate themselves
with Xi Jinping,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.489
praising Xi Jinping Thought.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:17.440
Universities are
building institutes where

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.320
they study Xi Jinping Thought.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.889
And we know-- this is one of
the basic tenets of government

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.080
is that power should not
be concentrated too much

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.150
in the hands of one person.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.300
At best, that person
is benevolent.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.889
But at worst, that can lead
to extreme policy making,

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.360
uninformed policy making.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.822
This is the vote count in the
National People's Congress

00:34:37.822 --> 00:34:39.280
of that amendment
that I mentioned,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.139
the constitutional
amendment where

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:44.530
they got rid of term limits
for the presidency, which

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.320
is one of the more controversial
pieces of legislation

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.950
to happen in China
within the last 30 years.

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:53.199
This is in Chinese, but the
National People's Congress

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:53.832
is huge.

00:34:53.832 --> 00:34:55.040
It's the institution I study.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.320
It's the largest
parliament in the world.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.880
It's got almost 3,000 members.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.090
We see 2,958 people
voted for it,

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.770
two people voted against it,
and three people abstained.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.650
We don't know who the people
are that abstained or voted

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.580
against it.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.774
It's a closed system.

00:35:10.774 --> 00:35:12.940
There's some speculation
that Xi Jinping himself may

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.210
have been one of those
people to say, oh, yeah,

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.770
people are willing to oppose me.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.547
But to me, this is--

00:35:20.547 --> 00:35:21.880
the National People's Congress--

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.960
I don't want to get
too much into it,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.850
but all of the Chinese
political system

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:25.930
goes according to script.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.610
The party controls everything.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.670
But even within
these institutions,

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.890
there usually is
some opposition.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.560
And what we observe in China
today is that a lot of people

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.170
are bandwagoning around Xi.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.670
And I worry about that.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.920
The final trend I thought
it was important to bring up

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.150
here of all places is the
increasingly sophisticated

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.610
surveillance state
we see in China.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.026
So I mentioned
that China is going

00:35:49.026 --> 00:35:50.860
through a repressive term.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.570
What makes it
particularly worrisome

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.630
is that we have a
highly-sophisticated

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.410
authoritarian regime that is now
using the fruits of technology

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.690
to repress its population
and monitor its population.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.706
So this is an image of facial
recognition software that's

00:36:05.706 --> 00:36:06.830
currently being rolled out.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.830
It's not national yet,
but it's being rolled out

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.700
in different
localities in China.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.720
And so we are nearing the point
where the Chinese Communist

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.630
Party, within the
next few years,

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.390
will likely have full
information on its population.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.450
So using closed-circuit
televisions, they have--

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.629
I've heard the estimate
of 200 million,

00:36:25.629 --> 00:36:27.170
but I have heard
that number is going

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.260
to rise to 300
million or 400 million

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.640
closed-circuit
television cameras

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.940
around the country within
the next five to 10 years.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.466
Using those in
combination with AI,

00:36:36.466 --> 00:36:37.840
which can do facial
recognition--

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.180
and I understand that the
technology is not perfect yet,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.950
but it will likely get there--

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.810
that, combined with
social media data--

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.320
so as you all know,
Chinese citizens commonly

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.250
use an app called Weixin WeChat,
which is sort of like a one app

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.120
to rule them all.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.060
Not only is it a social
network, but it's also a way

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.339
for people to make purchases.

00:36:58.339 --> 00:37:00.880
So the Chinese government, of
course, has a backdoor to that.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.330
So we have a situation where
an authoritarian government has

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.160
full information on
the social networks,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.290
the political commentary,
the purchases,

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:12.340
and the geographic locations
of all of its citizens.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.930
And this is the dark
side of AI, and big data,

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.100
and this sort of technology.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.950
And it's something, again,
we need to be talking about.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.450
And you all, as
technology leaders,

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.660
I'm sure are aware of this.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.750
But it's something that we need
to be having discussions about,

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.820
and it's an abuse of
this sort of technology.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.740
In China, I should say that it
seems that this technology is

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.610
being described as, again, a
way to preserve law and order.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.530
And it's being said,
oh, this is going

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.760
to be used to catch jaywalkers
and other petty criminals.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.070
And again, it's
unclear whether or not

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.430
Chinese citizens support this.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.360
There might be a faction of them
that does and says, oh, OK, you

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.068
have nothing to worry
about if you're not

00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.690
doing anything wrong.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.060
But it doesn't take a
genius, or a critic,

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.820
or a skeptic to say that
this technology will also

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.386
be used to target political
dissidents, protesters,

00:38:00.386 --> 00:38:02.760
petitioners, and so forth,
anybody that's causing trouble

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.129
in the Chinese system.

00:38:04.129 --> 00:38:06.420
I should say that as a
political scientist, a lot of us

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.407
do fieldwork in China.

00:38:07.407 --> 00:38:09.240
And I was party to a
couple of conversations

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.442
in the last couple
of years about--

00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:13.650
the one thing we do often
with our interview subjects

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.970
is we guarantee anonymity.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.310
We say, OK, we can
meet, and I will never

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.207
use your name in
anything I write,

00:38:19.207 --> 00:38:21.540
and there will never be any
record of this interview out

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.854
in public.

00:38:22.854 --> 00:38:24.270
Now that we're
operating in China,

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.644
I don't think I
could go to China

00:38:25.644 --> 00:38:28.410
and tell someone
that I can assure

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.910
that no one knows
about this meeting

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.820
because the state is everywhere.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.410
I should also say
that this technology

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.960
is being rolled out in a part
of China called Xinjiang.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.930
Xinjiang province
in Western China

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.760
where there is a large
Muslim population

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.920
known as the Uyghurs.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.170
I encourage you to
read about Xinjiang--

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:50.700
X-I-N-J-I-A-N-G. This is
not my area of expertise.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.190
But there is increasing
evidence coming out of Xinjiang

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:58.180
that these sorts of technologies
are being used to basically put

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.120
to a large chunk of
the Muslim population

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.430
into re-education camps.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:03.810
So the level of
repression that's

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.390
being used in concert with this
technology is very alarming.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.060
So I wanted to leave
time for questions,

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.940
and I wanted to close by
just using this phrase "end

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.496
of an era," which is not mine.

00:39:13.496 --> 00:39:15.870
There's a book that just came
out called "End of an Era,"

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.660
by Carl Minzner, which
does a nice job summarizing

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.790
some of the trends that
I just spoke about.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.748
But Xi Jinping is saying
we're at the beginning

00:39:22.748 --> 00:39:24.970
of a new era, which
inherently means

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:27.630
we're at the end of an old era.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.350
And to me, it seems one of the
big takeaways of the last year

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.980
or the last five years, has
been that the Chinese Communist

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.260
Party--

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.450
the success or failure
of the Communist Party

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.820
now lies in the
hands of this person.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.600
And one of the old lessons
of Communist Party history--

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.250
and this is the lesson
of the Mao era--

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.060
is that no single leader
should become too powerful.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.340
And it seems to me that this
lesson has been forgotten.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.420
So thank you, I
will leave it there,

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.886
and we can open it
up to questions.

00:39:57.886 --> 00:39:58.386
Thanks.

00:39:58.386 --> 00:40:00.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:05.980
Yes.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:06.600
Hi.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.170
One of the things that I was
thinking about during the talk

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.160
was, why is this happening now?

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.670
I can sort of imagine
maybe it's Xi's personality

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.520
and his strong
leadership, or maybe it's

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.490
a weakening of the
existing institutions.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.650
But why didn't this happen
with the previous leader?

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.482
What kept them in check?

00:40:28.482 --> 00:40:29.940
RORY TRUEX: That's
a good question.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.890
It's difficult to answer.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.660
The common narrative
you would hear

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.390
is that the previous
leader, Hu Jintao,

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.975
actually didn't have this
force of personality.

00:40:38.975 --> 00:40:40.600
He wasn't a particularly
strong leader.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.000
He was not anointed by his
predecessor, Jiang Zemin.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.750
He was actually anointed
by Deng Xiaoping.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.480
So Deng Xiaoping leaves office
and anoints his next two

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.150
successors, Jiang
Zemin and Hu Jintao.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.950
So Hu Jintao had a
reputation as sort

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.880
of a bland technocrat, a guy
that knew how to make policy,

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.820
but didn't know actually
how to command the party.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.720
And so this, in some sense,
leaves a power vacuum

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.440
that Xi Jinping has
been willing to step in.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.150
In terms of why now, I think
another thing to emphasize

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.980
is that this was incremental.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.950
So there were little moves
that happened along the way,

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.510
and they went unchecked.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:19.116
So for example, so Xi
Jinping, upon entering office,

00:41:19.116 --> 00:41:20.490
there was a dramatic
purge of one

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:25.470
of his rivals named Bo Xilai,
where this person was trying

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.640
to get himself on the
Politburo Standing Committee,

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.170
and there's evidence that Xi
Jinping engineered his very

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.210
elaborate downfall.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.500
This would be unusual.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.090
And so that sort
of thing happens.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.730
Then we start seeing the
anti-corruption campaign

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:39.500
unfold.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.520
And over time, he
becomes so powerful,

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.590
it's like a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.720
Once someone becomes
this powerful,

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.040
now to be opposed
to him is futile.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.160
So I think that's
one of the elements

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.110
too is that the
institutions maybe

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.770
weren't strong enough in the
beginning to constrain him.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.220
Thanks.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.690
Here, maybe?

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.660
Sorry to bring up
Donald Trump again,

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.064
but just a curious
thought experiment--

00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:03.980
RORY TRUEX: Oh, great.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.510
AUDIENCE: --because
when Xi Jinping decided

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.060
to get rid of the
term limit, I think

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.420
that was the most ridiculous
thing that Donald Trump said.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.700
Hey, maybe we should
try to do that.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.350
RORY TRUEX: Maybe we
should this someday.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.120
Yeah.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.830
That wasn't alarming
at all to hear.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.220
AUDIENCE: So my question
is a thought experiment.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.590
So assuming--
that's given Trump's

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.400
also having a populist
agenda-- if, say,

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.541
Trump manages to get
reelected-- and I

00:42:25.541 --> 00:42:28.040
know that culturally the US is
very, very different entirely

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.070
from China, but if you were to
try to get rid of term limits

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.040
in the US, based on
your understanding

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.990
of authoritarian
regimes, what might

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.676
be a path of least resistance
for him to go about doing that?

00:42:38.676 --> 00:42:40.550
RORY TRUEX: Well, that
took a very dark turn,

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.070
this conversation.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.300
And we were already
in a dark place.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.602
So the question is
about Donald Trump,

00:42:46.602 --> 00:42:48.560
if he were also to try
to similarly consolidate

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.340
power and potentially erode
the term limit institution.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.390
It's interesting.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.670
Right when Donald
Trump was elected,

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.360
there was a lot of political
scientists much more

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.360
senior than I am--

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.780
I'm junior, if
you couldn't tell.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.870
People who have been in
the field for a long time

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.376
were sincerely alarmed about
the erosion of democracy

00:43:09.376 --> 00:43:10.250
in the United States.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.350
And democracy is something
we take for granted here.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.820
It's been around for
hundreds of years.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.361
We expect it to be
around the future.

00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:19.672
But democracies elect
themselves out of democracy.

00:43:19.672 --> 00:43:22.130
They elect leaders that have
authoritarian tendencies, that

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.940
consolidate power.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.160
So there were legitimate
causes for concern

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.480
among the political science
community about Donald Trump's

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.680
authoritarian tendencies.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.800
And I think he's time
and time again revealed

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.800
that he has a certain
envy, let's call it,

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.100
of authoritarian leaders.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.170
He's done so with Kim Jong
Un, Putin, and Xi Jinping.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.330
In terms of this
specific scenario,

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.900
my hope, as an American citizen,
is if this ever came to pass,

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.780
we would see opposition
among not just the Democrats,

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.240
but among the Republican Party.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.280
At some point, the
Republican Party

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.060
needs to realize that this
is unusual and unsustainable,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.820
and they need to side with
democracy over the party.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.090
And so I hope-- we've
said that before.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.510
The Trump presidency has been
a constant series of events

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.739
where we're all
saying, is it this?

00:44:11.739 --> 00:44:13.280
Are they finally
going to oppose him?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.510
So my hope is that we
would see opposition.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.810
I would also say there are
major, major differences,

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.393
of course, between the Chinese
political system and the United

00:44:20.393 --> 00:44:22.880
States, and particularly the
strength of our institutions,

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.040
and the court system, and
the legislative branch,

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.530
and the media, and the ability
to have public discourse

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.002
is way above what
there exists in China.

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.710
So I think the outcry,
the public outcry,

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.709
would be enough so that
that scenario will never

00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:37.400
come to pass.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.964
That's my optimistic take.

00:44:38.964 --> 00:44:39.464
Hi.

00:44:39.464 --> 00:44:40.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.260
Two short questions.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.190
RORY TRUEX: Sure.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.870
AUDIENCE: What do
the Chinese people

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:48.880
know about these constitutional
changes and specifically

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.370
the term limits?

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.930
And also, in Xi Jinping
Thought, is there any

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.020
mentioning of
Confucianism at all?

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.687
Does it refer back to
those kinds of thinking?

00:44:58.687 --> 00:45:00.770
RORY TRUEX: Yeah, so those
are two good questions.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:03.552
So again, as a foreigner, I am
hesitant to ever make claims

00:45:03.552 --> 00:45:06.010
about this is what the Chinese
people know and this is what

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:06.460
they don't.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.830
AUDIENCE: But specifically
in the media, has it been--

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:08.170
RORY TRUEX: Yeah.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:09.730
So I would say
that the depiction

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.920
of this in the
Chinese media has been

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.410
that this wasn't a big deal.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:17.170
And a lot of the
outcry that occurred

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:18.880
was among people
like me, foreigners

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.140
who study China or
write about China.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.560
And the reason it was
pinned as not a big deal

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.380
is because actually, the
position of President

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.849
in the People's
Republic of China,

00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:29.890
if you actually look at
the Chinese constitution,

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:31.870
it's basically a
ceremonial position.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:36.290
So that office is not, in and
of itself, that important.

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.230
It's important because
the person who inhabits

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.790
it is the head of the party.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.374
So that's one reason why it
was deemed not that important.

00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:45.040
The second reason is
that there actually

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.620
are no term limits on the
position of General Secretary

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.090
of the Communist Party.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.070
So that position has
never had any term limits.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.960
There's been a norm
that that person only

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.630
stays in power for two terms,
but there was never actually

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.440
anything on paper
that prescribed that.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.340
So the way this was positioned,
and among people in China

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.510
who were describing this, was
that all this reform does,

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.220
all this amendment does is put
the position of the presidency,

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.437
it syncs it up with the
position of the General

00:46:08.437 --> 00:46:11.020
Secretary the Communist Party,
so now nothing has term limits.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.970
So that's the way
it was phrased.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:16.370
But for those of us on
the outside looking in,

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.630
it seems that this is a very
obvious example of an existing

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.200
institution that was designed
to curb excess abuses of power,

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.800
accumulation of
power, being eroded.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.590
So my sense is that the average
Chinese citizen is probably not

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.810
in uproar about
this, but I think

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.210
it does remain a pretty
significant political event.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:39.150
In terms of Confucianism, one
of the elements of Xi Jinping

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.240
has been not just the
nationalism in a foreign policy

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.820
front, but a cultural
nationalism, and the Communist

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.510
Party as being the bearer of
Chinese cultural traditions.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:52.410
So Confucianism--
I am no expert,

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.030
but there are elements
of Confucianism

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.490
that are conducive to
authoritarian rule,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.500
in particular the
emphasis on hierarchy

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.500
and the relationship between
the ruled and the ruler.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.500
And so we've seen a
resurgence of Confucianism

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.810
and the emphasis on
Confucianism in China,

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.350
especially as an alternative
to foreign ideologies

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.160
like Christianity and so forth.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.230
So I don't believe--

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.799
I'd have to look back.

00:47:14.799 --> 00:47:16.590
There's a whole book
on Xi Jinping Thought,

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:20.340
and I couldn't get through
it, to be honest with you.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.920
But I don't believe it's
mentioned in great detail.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.050
But culturally and
politically, it

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.410
has been an emphasis to focus
on traditional Chinese culture

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:29.430
and heritage.

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:32.730
And the Communist Party and Xi
Jinping are protectors of that.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.304
Thank you.

00:47:34.304 --> 00:47:36.529
Yes.

00:47:36.529 --> 00:47:37.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.550
My question is about
the surveillance state,

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.320
but I'll come through
a detour, which

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.050
is in the last question
from this microphone,

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.540
you mentioned the big
institutional differences

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.910
between this country
and China, and I'd

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.910
say democracies in
general and China,

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.600
and authoritarian regimes.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.170
Now, all of the world
is going into the world

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:06.360
of new surveillance
technologies together.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.810
And we don't have institutions
surrounding those yet.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:13.370
So do you think there's
a chance or a danger

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.070
that democracies around the
world will follow in the model

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:20.137
that China is developing and
will probably first develop

00:48:20.137 --> 00:48:22.470
to the greatest extent, and
that everyone will just sort

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:25.680
of stumble into an
authoritarian machine--

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.695
literally a machine?

00:48:27.695 --> 00:48:32.174
RORY TRUEX: Yeah, so I have
that personality type that

00:48:32.174 --> 00:48:33.590
worries about these
sort of things

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.215
and the rise of the
surveillance state.

00:48:35.215 --> 00:48:37.700
And Google as a company,
as you of all people know,

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.719
is involved in the
collection of information

00:48:39.719 --> 00:48:41.510
on normal citizens,
which could potentially

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.480
be used by a government for
these sorts of purposes.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.089
So I am glad you
brought up the question.

00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:49.130
It's something we need to
be talking about a lot.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:53.750
And I assume you all are talking
about this quite frequently.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.210
I think in the US, it has
a different flavor to it.

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:57.530
Again, I'm not within the CIA.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.696
I don't have much of a
window as to what's going on.

00:48:59.696 --> 00:49:02.480
But it seems that it's
being used, again,

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.780
for issues of national security,
and information collection that

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.710
can be used by the US government
to monitor terrorist suspects

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.182
and so forth.

00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:12.890
In China, they would
also argue that this

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.540
is about national security.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.564
So the dissidents
and protesters and so

00:49:16.564 --> 00:49:18.230
forth are undermining
national security.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.440
So it's always governments using
the lens of national security

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.660
to infringe upon
people's civil liberties.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.160
And so it is something I think
we should be concerned about.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.584
And I think the difference
in the US versus China

00:49:29.584 --> 00:49:32.000
is that in the US, there's at
least a dialogue about this.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.072
And citizens have willingly
given over their information

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.530
because the technology
is so good--

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:38.700
Facebook, Google,
Twitter, and so forth.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.430
The tools are so great
that we willingly

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.150
give forward our information.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.292
But I think we are
at a point where

00:49:44.292 --> 00:49:46.250
if it falls into the
wrong hands or if you have

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.958
a certain type of
leader, even in the US,

00:49:47.958 --> 00:49:49.806
this information
could be abused.

00:49:49.806 --> 00:49:51.510
Thanks.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.320
I never answered
that question before,

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.485
but thank you for asking.

00:49:54.485 --> 00:49:56.110
AUDIENCE: Could you
expand a little bit

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.360
on the world's
largest parliament?

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.250
I know you made a point
about how well it's

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.140
orchestrated by the party.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.412
But what's it like
in its daily affairs?

00:50:04.412 --> 00:50:06.120
How often does that
orchestration happen?

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:06.954
How deep does it go?

00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:08.911
RORY TRUEX: Thank you
for asking this question.

00:50:08.911 --> 00:50:10.660
So this was the topic
of my dissertation,

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.620
so this brings me back to a
sad, lonely, depressing time

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.220
in my life.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.260
So I'll just give a brief
answer because I could

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.426
talk about this for a while.

00:50:21.426 --> 00:50:24.280
But the National People's
Congress is China's parliament.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.560
And it has 3,000 members.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.040
It meets only once per
year for two weeks.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.200
So you can imagine,
such an institution

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.782
is not exactly a forum for
great policy discussion.

00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:37.240
And they sit in a
large room called

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.406
the Great Hall of the People
which has 3,000 people.

00:50:39.406 --> 00:50:42.790
So often when you hear about
the National People's Congress,

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.010
you hear the words rubber stamp.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.470
And there is some truth to that.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.460
So nothing ever
before the parliament

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.840
in the history of
the institution

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.620
before the full body has
ever been voted down ever.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.360
So if that's not a rubber
stamp, I don't know what is.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.340
That said, so one of
the arguments I make--

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.870
I did write a book on this.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.390
It's one of those books
that I wouldn't wish it

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.676
on anybody to read it,
but if you're interested--

00:51:06.676 --> 00:51:08.800
I have a forum, I might as
well self-promote-- it's

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.002
called "Making Autocracy Work."

00:51:11.002 --> 00:51:13.210
But the argument I try to
make is that actually, this

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:15.543
is one of those institutions
that the Communist Party is

00:51:15.543 --> 00:51:19.750
trying to use to channel
citizen grievances

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.800
through their institutions.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.860
So rather than have people
protest on the street

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.480
and potentially
engage in violence,

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.438
they're trying to create
political institutions

00:51:27.438 --> 00:51:29.440
that they control, but
that, nevertheless,

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.304
serve some conduit
of information

00:51:32.304 --> 00:51:33.970
that the government
can then respond to.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.730
So the People's Congress
system is actually a network

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:37.870
of these institutions.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:42.309
There are five different levels
of government, and all the way

00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:44.600
on down to what's known as
the township level in China.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.450
And there are
hundreds of thousands

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.660
of legislators in China.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.381
People's deputies,
they're called.

00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:51.880
And so what I've
argued in this book

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.590
is that these
people, their task is

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.930
to go out, and learn
about the population,

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.300
and try to convey
this information

00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.970
to the central government.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.960
But this shouldn't be
confused with democracy.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.900
This shouldn't be confused
with full representation.

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.630
These people are handpicked
by the Communist Party,

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.480
and they are not allowed
to cross the boundaries.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.760
So you'll never hear about
a People's Congress deputy

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.260
saying, oh, maybe we should
talk more about the surveillance

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.890
state, or maybe we should have
elections for the position

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:18.740
of the presidency.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.325
So it's a very
constrained system.

00:52:21.325 --> 00:52:23.336
But thank you for that question.

00:52:23.336 --> 00:52:24.460
That's the easy one for me.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:24.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.100
Thank you very much.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.180
This was very informative.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.010
RORY TRUEX: Thank you.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.426
AUDIENCE: I also
wanted to ask you

00:52:28.426 --> 00:52:31.840
about the international
affairs aspect of Xi Jinping's

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.880
administration.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.100
You talked a little
bit about nationalism

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.950
and how the Xi Jinping
administration is becoming

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:42.070
more assertive
internationally, especially

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:47.710
in South Asia area,
the Belt and Road.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.780
Could you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.402
And where do you see
this administration--

00:52:54.402 --> 00:52:57.310
do you see them
applying the tools

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.730
that they apply internally-- the
repression, the surveillance--

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:04.690
outside of the borders of China
through technology, and also

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:07.732
through politics and money?

00:53:07.732 --> 00:53:08.440
RORY TRUEX: Yeah.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.440
That's a great question.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.430
So it is a broad
question, because China's

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:15.040
foreign relations are
multifaceted and span

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.440
everything from territorial
claims and ambitions

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.350
to the economy,
environment, and so forth.

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:23.110
One thing I did want to
mention which I haven't yet

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:26.089
is this idea of Chinese
overseas influence.

00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:27.880
And so there's a lot
of discussion going on

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.310
in the US Congress right
now about so-called China's

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:33.460
influence operations and the
way that it's increasingly

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:38.659
using some of these tools to
try to shift discourse in the US

00:53:38.659 --> 00:53:39.950
and other advanced democracies.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.280
In Australia and New Zealand,
this is a major issue.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.920
We see this manifest itself
in a lot of different ways.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.000
The one trend that I'm noticing
and worrying about is this--

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.110
using the market, using the
access to China as a way

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.760
to coerce people.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.380
And I'm here at
Google, a company

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.990
that has had its search engine
throttled over the years

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:04.080
and now no longer has the
market share it should in China

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.590
because of this reason.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.000
So a lot of companies,
journalists, academics,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.850
universities are
facing this decision

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.450
of do I play by
the party's rules

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:19.290
and compromise my
business or my values

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:20.894
in order to get access to China?

00:54:20.894 --> 00:54:23.060
So this manifests itself
in a lot of different ways.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.056
So academics, we
face pressure if we

00:54:26.056 --> 00:54:27.180
write about certain things.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.000
We have a fear of potentially
losing visa access.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.582
In the grand scheme of things,
a visa is not a huge deal.

00:54:32.582 --> 00:54:33.540
We're going to be fine.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.880
But it's a
manifestation of that.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.060
Firms-- you might have read
about a lot of US airlines

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:43.710
now have been forced to change
their websites because they

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.210
can no longer have
the word "Taiwan"

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.280
on their website, because
Taiwan is a sensitive topic,

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.010
and it's considered
part of China,

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:51.685
according to the
Chinese government,

00:54:51.685 --> 00:54:52.560
and on and on and on.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.270
Cambridge University
Press is an example

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.302
that's close to home for us.

00:54:57.302 --> 00:54:59.010
Cambridge University
Press runs a journal

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.700
called "The China Quarterly,"
which is a China journal.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.600
At the pressure of the
Chinese government,

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.325
last year-- or was
it two years ago?

00:55:05.325 --> 00:55:08.970
I can't remember-- they
removed upwards of 300 articles

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:10.359
from their website in China.

00:55:10.359 --> 00:55:12.900
And the articles were all about
things like Tiananmen Square,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.670
and Xinjiang, Tibet--

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.660
sensitive topics.

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.077
And this is alarming
because then,

00:55:18.077 --> 00:55:20.493
if you're a Chinese citizen,
and you're reading "The China

00:55:20.493 --> 00:55:22.650
Quarterly," you're getting
a sanitized version

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.760
of scholarship on China.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.299
You're getting a sanitized
version of history.

00:55:26.299 --> 00:55:28.590
And that's the version that
the party wants you to get.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.631
So fortunately, as a result
of academic pressure,

00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:32.820
we saw Cambridge
University Press eventually

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.780
reverse its stance.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.950
But all of these individuals
are facing this decision.

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:40.020
And it's a commonality actually
between firms, journalists,

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.240
universities, and academics.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.500
So that's one thing
that's alarming to me.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.270
Another thing that is
concerning is the monitoring

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:50.910
that we used to see
reserved for China is now

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.140
being extended overseas.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.600
So there are a lot
of Chinese students

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.920
at American universities.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.260
And this is something we
need more research on,

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.760
so I'm hesitant to
make a statement.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.980
But it seems, from
what I've heard,

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.780
that there are many
Chinese students who

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.374
feel that they are under the
same level of surveillance

00:56:06.374 --> 00:56:08.040
in an American classroom
than they would

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.464
be at a Chinese university.

00:56:09.464 --> 00:56:11.130
So I teach a course
on Chinese politics,

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.380
and we talk about
sensitive topics.

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.880
A Chinese student
in my course might

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.740
feel reluctant to say
how they really feel

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.450
or what they think about
the Chinese government

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:20.460
because they're worried that
they might be being monitored,

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.200
or that information
might make its way back

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.158
to the Communist Party.

00:56:23.158 --> 00:56:26.670
So we are entering a phase where
Xi Jinping's assertiveness has

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:29.160
now led the Communist
Party to try

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.570
to influence discourse and
dialogue in other countries.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.150
And that's a trend that
I am worried about.

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:37.590
Thank you for your question.

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:38.090
Here.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.410
Yes.

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:41.780
AUDIENCE: You partially
asked actually my question,

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.980
but I want to extend the topic.

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.300
You mentioned the influences
going abroad, but mainly

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.910
focusing on Chinese citizens.

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:54.320
What is influence globally
with other countries?

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.220
And do you see a
possible backfire

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.570
and would other
countries trying to--

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:02.760
how do I say-- interfere
with China's government issue

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.040
and stuff?

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.660
RORY TRUEX: So that's
a great question.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.680
So for a long time, the
party rhetoric about this

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.480
was that China
does not interfere

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.610
within the sovereign
affairs of other countries.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:14.440
That was the line.

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.356
It's sort of this doctrine
of noninterference.

00:57:16.356 --> 00:57:18.499
Leave us alone, we'll
leave you alone.

00:57:18.499 --> 00:57:20.790
It's unclear whether we should
have believed that ever,

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.230
but it's increasingly obvious
that they do interfere in some

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.480
of the ways I just mentioned.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.240
More interestingly and
important to think about

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.140
is this idea that the Chinese
system of governance itself

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.934
could increasingly become a
model for other countries,

00:57:35.934 --> 00:57:37.850
particularly developing
countries, to emulate.

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:39.427
This is the so-called
China model.

00:57:39.427 --> 00:57:41.510
And it means different
things to different people.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:44.420
But it's basically where you
have a system of authoritarian

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.010
governments-- soft
authoritarianism,

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.720
if we want to call it that,
although I don't know how soft

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.530
it is--

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:51.770
coupled with
state-led capitalism.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:55.109
And China has the record
of economic performance

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:57.150
that is potentially
appealing to other countries.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:00.110
So it remains unclear
how much they're actually

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:02.090
trying to shift
to the governance

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:03.860
models of other countries.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.540
I have a friend,
Maria Repnikova,

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.450
who's a great political
scientist based

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.764
at Georgia State.

00:58:09.764 --> 00:58:11.180
And she's doing
some work on this.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.490
And she's interviewing
officials throughout Africa,

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.180
who are increasingly going
to China to be trained

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.960
and to study
governance techniques

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.720
from the Chinese system as
opposed to a Western system.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.080
So I think it's still
too early to tell

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.550
how much influence
there will be,

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.370
but I think it will
likely increase.

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:31.480
On that, I think I'm
actually out of time,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.350
so thank you all for
this opportunity.

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:35.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.300
Thank you.
