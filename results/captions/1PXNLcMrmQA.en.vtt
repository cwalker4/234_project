00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.910
Hi America, my name is Catherine Cohen,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.730
and I, along with Susie
Essman, am going to talk

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.020
to you about my father, Michael Cohen.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.950
He's sorta going to prison, which means

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.700
I get his car, vroom, vroom, lol.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.540
Just kidding, Michael Cohen
is absolutely not my father,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.720
we just have the same last name

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.460
and have both read The
Art of the Deal twice.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.260
I'm just kidding, again, oh my god,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.630
I'm so funny, and I lie, like a lot.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.743
Maybe he is my Dad.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.040
Anyways, here's Susie Essman,
followed by an update by me,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.250
a New York City comedian and
not Michael Cohen's daughter.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.303
My name is Catherine
Cohen, but first, my dad.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.880
- The man doesn't tell
the truth, and it's sad

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.700
that I should take responsibility
for his dirty deeds.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.560
- [Catherine] That's Michael
Cohen, President Trump's

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.270
former fixer who is going to prison

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.020
for three years on nine felonies.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.532
Oh, and he also allegedly
played lawyer to this guy.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:53.940
- By the way, there's a
really hot-looking chick

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.036
in the third row there,
how you doing, baby?

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:57.912
I'll take you backstage to meet

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.070
Hank a little later if you want.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.580
- [Susie] Cohen grew up on Long Island,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.620
son to a doctor and a nurse.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.320
In high school, Cohen picked
up Donald Trump's book,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.290
The Art of the Deal, and
read it cover to cover twice.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.150
He admired Trump ever since.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.920
- Many brilliant people write books,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.580
and many people write books, but not

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.230
too many people can talk
about being number one.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.170
- [Susie] After graduating
from American University,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.592
he attended Thomas M.
Cooley School of Law.

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:25.810
The school has been criticized for its

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.420
low GPA requirements, and the high number

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.200
of graduates who fail the bar exam.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.780
According to Cohen's
classmates, he'd often joke

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.960
about his 2.0 grade point average.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.780
- I love the poorly educated.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.930
- [Susie] But, he graduated in 1991,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.440
just as certified a lawyer as any other.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.380
Just one year later,
he went on to work for

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.790
Melvin J. Estrin, a personal injury lawyer

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.950
who just three years into Cohen's tenure

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950
pled guilty to insurance fraud,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.770
making him one of the first
criminals tied to Cohen.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.280
After Estrin was indicted,
Cohen worked out of a taxi base

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.300
in Queens owned by Simon
Garber, a Russian taxi magnate

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.160
who once pled guilty to breaking into

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.940
a few neighbors' homes,
shattering glass doors,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.803
smearing blood everywhere,
and then taking a shower.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.760
Cohen became a force in the
taxi business in the mid-90s,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.290
after marrying the daughter
of a taxi entrepreneur,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.150
inheriting her parents' taxi empire.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.700
By the late 90s, Cohen had
acquired a stock of medallions,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.670
the licenses you need to
operate a taxi in New York City,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.220
but didn't pay taxes on the
profits for the medallions,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.850
taking tens of thousands
of dollars from the MTA,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.840
and hurting the average commuter.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.850
In 1999, as Cohen was managing
trust accounts for clients,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.750
a Montreal Canadiens
hockey player wrote a check

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.950
for 350,000 to Cohen, that
was supposed to transfer

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.460
to a Florida woman, but
she never received it.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.020
A lawsuit ensued.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.190
In Cohen's deposition,
when the plaintiff's lawyer

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.560
showed him the endorsed
check, and asked if it's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.490
his signature, Cohen said: I
don't know, but it could be.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.660
The money is still at large.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.850
In 2003, his Trump fetishism
started to show again.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.180
He bought up apartments
in Trump properties,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.070
and just a few years after Trump's first

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.040
unsuccessful run for
president, Cohen himself

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.220
launched an unsuccessful
run for City Council.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.350
In 2007, Cohen came into
Trump's life the same way

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.290
anyone comes into Trump's
life: by complimenting him.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.640
The New York Post published
an article where Cohen said:

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.592
Trump properties are solid investments.

00:03:25.592 --> 00:03:28.090
This caught Trump's attention.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.170
Trump told The Post that
Cohen is a very smart person.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.090
The bond began.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.830
Trump hired Cohen again later that year

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.870
as Executive Vice President
of the Trump Organization,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.900
and Special Counsel to Donald.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.710
But he was more than just a
Vice President and lawyer.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.800
One unnamed associate
told ProPublica Cohen

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.980
did jobs for Donald that
no one else would do.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.540
He even allegedly carried
a licensed pistol around,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.000
in an ankle holster like
some kinda sexy spy.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.373
In 2008, he voted for this guy.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.900
In 2009, he ran for New York State Senate

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.180
before eventually pulling
his name out of the race.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.490
And then he realized who the
real horse to bet on was:

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.600
not himself, but instead,
his hero, Donald Trump.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.030
- I'm having a lot of fun with it.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.260
It's not my primary business,
but it is a great fragrance.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.050
I'd like to say that if you put it on,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.610
anything you want will come true.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.450
Now, maybe that's true, maybe it's not,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.220
in some cases it will be true.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.110
- [Susie] In 2010, Cohen set
up the website Should Trump Run

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.200
to see if other American
citizens had Trump fever.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.650
He'd even try to get Trump to be

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.050
a fictional president in Sharknado Three.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.110
Hollywood Reporter says Cohen
worked on legal documents

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.530
to secure Trump the role
in a film where he'd shoot

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.230
a shotgun at flying sharks in
the halls of the White House.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.310
But then Cohen allegedly pulled Trump out,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.640
saying it might affect any legitimate

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.760
run for the presidency Trump might make.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.188
The role went to Mark Cuban.

00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:57.938
(dramatic music)

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:02.386
(gunshots)

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.750
But despite the fact it was him

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.400
that turned down the role, Cohen lost it.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.860
He basically said: How dare you?

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.050
Donald wanted to do this,
we're gonna sue you.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.260
We're gonna shut the entire show down.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.500
The same year Sharknado was released,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.030
the site Should Trump
Run became a reality.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.380
- I'm really rich, I'll
share that in a second.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.180
And by the way, I'm not
even saying that in a brag.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.070
That's the kind of mindset, that's the

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.000
kind of thinking you
need for this country.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.670
- [Susie] Cohen was there to defend Trump

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.820
in the stormy days of his early campaign,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.240
when stories resurfaced
that the soon-to-be

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.699
President of the United
States had been accused of

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.140
raping his wife Ivana, who
later walked back the statement.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.230
Cohen came to defend Trump, saying:

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.540
By the very definition, you
cannot rape your spouse.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.310
It is true, you cannot rape your spouse.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.390
Before The Daily Beast
published the article

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.680
with Cohen's vile comments,
Cohen threatened the reporters.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.310
I will make sure that
you and I meet one day

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.560
while we're in the courthouse,
and I will take you

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.740
for every penny you still don't have.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.870
And I will come after your Daily Beast

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.260
and everybody else that you
possibly know, Cohen said.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.640
So I'm warning you, tread
very (beep) lightly,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.712
because what I'm going to
do to you is going to be

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:19.630
(beep) disgusting, you understand me?

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.150
The article was published.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.910
Cohen apologized for his basically

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.850
pro-rape comments by calling
them simply inarticulate.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.860
He's also made some inarticulate
statements on Twitter.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.140
Having a great night with Aviva and Reid,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.640
hashtag Real Housewives of New York.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.240
George showed up with an
erection, smiley face emoji.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.430
At Bret Michaels, hey brother, hope

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.700
you're doing well and wanted to say hi.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.240
So looking forward to the
Entourage movie coming this

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.692
summer, congrats to Mr. Doug
Ellin, the script is amazing.

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:52.260
- And then, days before the 2016 election,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.570
Cohen made 300,000 dollars in payments

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.860
to former Playboy model Karen McDougal

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.960
and adult film actress Stormy Daniels,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.820
in return for her silence about claims

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.420
that she had an affair
with Donald Trump in 2006.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.420
In March of 2018, Cohen
admitted to the payment,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.090
but claimed he used his own
money from a line of credit

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.090
on his house, and that
Trump knew nothing about it.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.700
Whatever he did, he did
on his own, Trump said.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.879
Cohen now claims all of this is wrong.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.900
- He's saying very clearly that he

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.050
never directed you to do
anything wrong, is that true?

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.460
- I don't think there's
anybody that believes that.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.780
- [Catherine] Cohen has come
a long way from once claiming

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.990
he would take a bullet for Trump.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.520
People close to the pair, like Trump's

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.020
former campaign advisor Roger Stone,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.550
told the New York Times that
Donald goes out of his way

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.248
to treat him, Cohen, like garbage.

00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:42.940
So, Cohen, who had everything to lose,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.020
ended up cooperating
with federal officials

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.020
and weathering his own storm, for once.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.236
He came clean about everything.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.870
I blame myself for the conduct which has

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.410
brought me here today, Cohen
said, and it was my own

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.340
weakness and a blind loyalty to this man

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.500
that led me to choose a
path of darkness over light.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.960
Cohen pleaded guilty to
violating campaign finance laws

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.300
by funneling illegal
hush money to cover up

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.340
Trump's alleged affairs
before the 2016 election.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.000
Under oath, Cohen said Trump directed him

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.440
to make the illegal payments.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.580
He also pleaded guilty
to lying to Congress

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.520
about Trump's businesses in Russia.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.870
Cohen has been sentenced
to three years in prison,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.843
but he's never felt better.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.110
- I have my freedom, and
I will not be the villain,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.640
as I told you once before, I will not
