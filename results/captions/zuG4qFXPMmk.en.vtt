00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
It’s late May of the year 1941.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.720
A two ship German battle-group attempts to break off into the Atlantic on its mission to raid Allied merchant convoys.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.520
But due to an unplanned string of events, German commander, Admiral Lütjens,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.120
is compelled into facing the Royal Navy’s Home Fleet, attempting to prevent the Bismarck from entering the open Atlantic.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.400
A fierce artillery trade-off ensued resulting in the sinking of HMS Hood, a symbolic British warship.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.660
Enraged, the Royal Navy now employs every possible means to track down and destroy the German raiders.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.880
The hunt has begun.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.500

With thousands of players, and hundreds of ships and customizations to choose from,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.220
it falls on you, captain, as to how you will conquer the waves.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.140
It is the cool, breezy morning of the 24th of May 1941.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.700
A mere hour has passed since the German task force sank the iconic HMS Hood

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.600
and considerably damaged another British capital ship, HMS Prince of Wales, forcing her to retreat.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.800
Both German vessels saw great elation among their crews following this spectacular victory,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.700
but the commander of the battlegroup, admiral Lütjens, was already preoccupied sketching plans for the immediate future,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.020
as he had no doubt, that the threat posed by the Royal Navy was only temporarily deterred.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.620
The most impending problem for the Germans was the damage that the Bismarck sustained in the course of the recent battle.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.900
Two hits dealt by the Prince of Wales caused the pride of the German navy to both leak precious fuel

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.500
and at the same time allowed a couple thousand tonnes of salt water into another compartment,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.300
which made her slightly list to port and down by the bow.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.700
Technically, it wasn’t a huge issue though, as the ship’s artillery, propulsion and even the crew remained intact,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.340
but with less than 3,000 tonnes of fuel available, Lütjens had a narrow set of options to choose from.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.300
The Operation Rheinübung was no longer feasible due to the Bismarck’s damage affecting her range,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.700
and the plan was no longer a secret to the Royal Navy,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.000
which, as Lütjens expected, was about to use all available means to neutralize his task force.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.940
The German admiral had to either turn and use one of the available passages to get back to the nearest friendly ports in Norway,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.160
or carry on into the North Atlantic and eventually reach the safe haven of German occupied France.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.340
The Norwegian option seemed more reasonable,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.380
but Lütjens expected the possible presence of British heavy units in the area between them and Scapa Flow

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.520
and considered this route as too risky.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.780
Instead, he decided to steam towards St Nazaire.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.900
The French coast was further away, but the route through the open Atlantic offered a better opportunity to shake off the British pursuers

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.660
and a much better position to attack Allied convoys once the Bismarck was fully operational again.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.840
Moreover, Lütjens successfully used the French option months earlier,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.200
coming back to the port of Brest with two other German battlecruisers.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.040
Still, the Bismarck’s group was shadowed by two British heavy cruisers equipped with superior radar,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.020
followed by the damaged HMS Prince of Wales.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.460
so the chase group under admiral John Tovey had a reliable information on German positions.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.180
The problem was, that Tovey’s force was more than 350 miles away,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:10.000
and the damaged Bismarck was still able to cruise at 28 knots, about the same speed as that of the British heavy warships were capable of.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.140
Thus, unless she was slowed down, there was little chance of her to be intercepted.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.820
In the late afternoon of the 24th May Lütjens took advantage of a rain squall,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.900
made a sharp turn to starboard and briefly engaged with the trailing British group,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:35.260
granting cover for the undamaged Prinz Eugen to detach unseen and steam away to harass Atlantic convoys.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.860
The Bismarck resumed her original course with all three British ships now trailing to her port side.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.660
But several hours later a new threat emerged.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.240
One of Tovey’s ships, aircraft carrier HMS Victorious adjusted her course,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.620
which eventually enabled her to launch a squadron of torpedo bombers in an attempt to damage and slow down the Bismarck.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.580
Yet inexperienced pilots mistakenly prepared to attack HMS Norfolk,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.520
which alerted German anti-aircraft gunners, who immediately opened fire at the enemy.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.820
But none of the attacking planes were shot down, and the British were able to launch nine torpedoes at the Bismarck,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.660
though only one reached its target, hitting the battleship’s main armour belt with no significant damage.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.840
Soon, the chase entered open waters and the pursuers were forced to adopt zig-zag manoeuvrings

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.620
in order to avoid German U-boats that might have been patrolling the area,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.440
according to British intelligence reports.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.660
As a result, the Bismarck was repeatedly out of range of Suffolk’s radar.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:51.360
Coincidentally, Lutjens ordered a 270 turn to starboard hoping to break off radar contact, circling behind her pursuers.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.320
Luckily, this move worked and the German admiral adjusted his course to France,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.420
fooling the British at the same time, who upon losing radar contact,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:08.460
steamed west at first and then, early in the morning dispersed to seek the Bismarck visually.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.920
It came as a shock for the British admiralty, as many of the Royal Navy ships were already low on fuel,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.460
and the actual position of the enemy battleship was now a mystery.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.720
From then on the plan to neutralize the warship

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.820
which sank HMS Hood, the pride of the Royal Navy, hung in the balance.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.900
But just like the British, the Germans were also making mistakes.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:40.560
Admiral Lütjens remained unaware of the fact that he actually got rid of his pursuit and didn’t maintain radio silence,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.280
allowing codebreakers at Bletchley Park to determine the Bismarck’s approximate position

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.500
and that she was steaming towards the French coast.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:56.280
Hope sparked again, as the narrowed search area gave a small chance to locate the Bismarck’s position

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.620
before she could make safely into the range of the Luftwaffe operating from French air bases.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:09.700
The odds were still against the British though, as HMS Prince of Wales, Suffolk, Victorious and Repulse

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.380
were forced to break off the search due to fuel shortages.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.420
This meant that Admiral Tovey’s only capital ships still in action

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:27.300
were the HMS King George V and the old battleship HMS Rodney, both far away from the Bismarck’s approximate position.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.720
In the morning of the 26th of May the British Navy had a much needed stroke of luck,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.600
as one of the Catalina flying boats which had flown from its base on Lough Erne in Northern Ireland

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.800
accidentally spotted the trail of the oil slick on the sea.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.920
Shortly, the Bismarck was located just short of 700 miles northwest of Brest.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.380
Seemingly this was good news, but her position also meant, that in less than a day

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.900
the Bismarck would reach the safe area covered by the Luftwaffe and U-boats.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:08.340
Time was running out and the only chance the British had to intercept the German battleship was the Force H,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:14.720
a naval formation based in Gibraltar, under the command of vice-admiral James Somerville.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.380
As soon as Somerville was informed of the Bismarck’s position,

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.080
he detached a light cruiser, HMS Sheffield to shadow the enemy

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.940
and commanded the carrier, HMS Ark Royal, to immediately launch torpedo bombers.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.680
But the first squadron was not informed of Sheffield’s orders and mistook it for the Bismarck.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.140
Luckily, the dropped torpedoes were equipped with new,

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.580
yet unreliable magnetic detonators and HMS Sheffield remained unscathed.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:51.520
Subsequently, the second squadron of Swordfish was launched, but this time equipped with older, contact detonators.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.860
On this occasion, the aviators picked the target correctly and despite heavy anti-aircraft fire,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.300
the torpedo attack finally yielded some results.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.600
The Bismarck was hit twice, as one torpedo hit mid-ship with minor damage,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.080
and another exploded at the stern, jamming both of battleship’s rudders.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:18.380
Damage control teams managed to repair the starboard one, but the port rudder remained blocked at a turning position.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.360
This meant, that the Bismarck lost her manoeuvrability and was unable to escape,

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.120
being just a few hundred miles away from the safe zone.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.440
But even with crippled mobility, her powerful armaments and fire control systems were intact,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.820
a sufficient reason for bigger British vessels to keep their distance.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.160
Six destroyers kept the Bismarck busy with torpedo attacks during the night,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.640
but it was not until the next morning, when the final battle occurred.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:57.260
Eventually, the three remaining ships of Admiral Tovey’s Home Fleet loomed on the grey horizon, preparing for a final battle.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:04.840
HMS Rodney and HMS King George V drew and fired first salvoes at the slow moving Bismarck.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.280
The German battleship returned fire with her forward turrets,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.800
yet managed to only fire short of HMS Rodney,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:20.180
as her ability to aim accurately was somewhat decreased due to erratic movement caused by the jammed rudder.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:26.800
But the British shells soon reached their target causing initial damage and fires to breakout on board.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.900
The two heavy cruisers joined the battle and aimed their turrets at the strafed German battleship.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.420
For the next 90 minutes the Bismarck suffered relentless British fire,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.660
as hundreds of shells struck the venerable German battle-vessel

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.420
causing massive damage to the ship and huge casualties to the crew.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:52.200
Yet despite this persisting cannonade and detonating the scuttling charges by her crew,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.020
the Bismarck refused to sink.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.320
As Tovey’s warships were dangerously low on fuel and shells, he sent them back to port,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.940
leaving HMS Dorsetshire to finish the job.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:12.040
Eventually, at 10:39 on the 27th of May, the Bismarck went under the waves.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.400
A little more than a hundred of her sailors were rescued,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.960
while the majority that managed to abandon the sinking Bismarck were left to the mercy of the water,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.560
as British ships left the scene after the U-boat alarm.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.360
More than 2,000 German sailors shared the fate of the iconic battleship.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.180
The loss of the Bismarck was a heavy blow for the Kriegsmarine,

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.820
and also became a turning point in the war on Allied commerce convoys,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:47.700
as from that point on, German Naval Command abandoned the idea of using capital ships for raiding in favour of U-boats,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.800
which wreaked havoc on the Northern Atlantic for the next two years.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:59.080
Still the famous eight-day long voyage of the Bismarck became a highlight of the Battle of the Atlantic,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.540
and one of the most popular events of the Second World War in Europe.
