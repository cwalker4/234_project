00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.100
The Bible, comprising both the Old and New
Testaments, is the primary religious text

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.699
for humanityís largest religion.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.250
It is the number one bestselling book of all
time, having been translated into virtually

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.719
every language and distributed to nearly every
culture around the world.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:09.679
It is consulted daily by millions of people
for inspiration, guidance, comfort and instruction.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.880
Many who revere the Bible believe its writings
to have been inspired by an omniscient, omnipotent

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.149
deity, the god of Judaism and Christianity.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.640
The words of the Bible are the words of this
god.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.340
It is without error because the god which
inspired the words of the Bible cannot err.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.690
But, is an inerrant Bible really what we find
when we read its pages?

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.000
Is the claim of biblical inerrancy, a text
completely without error regarding all matters

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.229
upon which it speaks, scientifically, historically
and theologically, clear and accurate?

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.250
Or, when we read the Bible, do we find a text
at odds with expectations created by the assertion

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:13.470
regarding its divine authorship?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.030
God is described by many believers, taking
their clues as to Godís character directly

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.000
from the scriptures, as, among other things,
infinite and perfect , unchanging, almighty,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:42.430
all wise, absolute, working all things according
to His own immutable and most righteous will,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.560
for His own glory, and abundant in truth.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.880
This god has sovereign dominion over his creations,
including human beings, to do by them, for

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.200
them, or upon them whatsoever the god pleases.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.370
The deityís knowledge is infinite and infallible
and thus many believers maintain that the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:28.880
Bible itself, a product of this deity, is
likewise without error.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.880
The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy,
formulated in October 1978 by more than 200

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.239
evangelical leaders, declares on behalf of
a large number of believers: ìHoly Scripture,

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.270
being God's own Word, written by men prepared
and superintended by His Spirit, is of infallible

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.910
divine authority in all matters upon which
it touches: it is to be believed, as God's

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.200
instruction, in all that it affirms, obeyed,
as God's command, in all that it requires;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.060
embraced, as God's pledge, in all that it
promises.î Furthermore, ìBeing wholly and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.040
verbally God-given, Scripture is without error
or fault in all its teaching, no less in what

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.680
it states about God's acts in creation, about
the events of world history, and about its

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.860
own literary origins under GodÖî This Protestant
affirmation of the Bibleís inerrant nature

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.520
is reflected in Catholicism.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.940
The Catholic Church also states, the ìÖholy
mother Church, relying on the belief of the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.060
Apostles, holds that the books of both the
Old and New Testaments in their entirety,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.180
with all their parts, are sacred and canonical
because written under the inspiration of the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.830
Holy Spirit, they have God as their author
and have been handed on as such to the Church

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.319
herself.î Furthermore, ìIn composing the
sacred books, God chose men and while employed

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.879
by Him they made use of their powers and abilities,
so that with Him acting in them and through

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:04.629
them, they, as true authors, consigned to
writing everything and only those things which

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:05.919
He wanted.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.629
Therefore, since everything asserted by the
inspired authors or sacred writers must be

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.330
held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it
follows that the books of Scripture must be

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.719
acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully
and without error that truth which God wanted

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:29.550
put into sacred writingsÖî
The conclusion about the inerrancy of the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.180
Bible across Christendom seems self-evident
if the nature of the god which is believed

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.960
to have inspired the writing of the Scriptures
is accepted.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.650
If God is all-powerful, all-knowing, incapable
of error, committed to the truth in all matters,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.680
then surely his book ñthe only words this
deity bothered to have put into printóis

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:10.009
equally without error.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.590
The divine inspiration of the Bible is foundational
to the belief that it is without error ìin

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.699
all matters that it touches.î It is the nature
of god as an omniscient, omnipotent and infallible

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:28.259
character himself which drives the faith of
those who profess biblical inerrancy.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.460
Inspiration means that the diverse authors
who composed the various texts of the Bible

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.809
were each given direct divine knowledge about
God, creation, human history, the future,

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.689
and any other topic on which they wrote.

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:47.240
The authors were given a knowledge that they
could not have had outside divine inspiration.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.490
The deityís inspiration affected the will,
the intelligence and all the executive faculties

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.999
of the writer.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:00.080
And while inspiration did not render the authors
as merely instruments which moved pen and

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.639
turned pages for god, their own personality
and experiences were allowed to come through

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:10.759
in what they wrote, nonetheless they wrote
exactly what came from the mind of God, recorded

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:27.919
without error.

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:34.960
The Bible is also thought of as a manifestation
of God; a God who is perfect and without blemish.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.839
In the Old Testament God is revealed personally
to various individuals.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:44.270
Adam, Abraham, and Moses are all said to have
spoken with God.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.039
When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with
the stone tablets bearing the 10 commandments,

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:57.919
his very skin and hair shone because he had
been talking to God.

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:03.039
God is also believed to have come in the flesh,
in the person of Jesus, and as such was a

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.830
perfect, sinless human being.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:11.929
The Bible, a manifestation of God in the written
word, is itself perfect and without error

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:35.190
as were his other manifestations.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.610
Belief in the divine inspiration of the Bible
and biblical inerrancy has a long history.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.570
Augustine, one of the early Church theologians,
declared:

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:49.170
ìOf [the canonical books of Scripture] alone
do I most firmly believe that their authors

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.810
were completely free from error.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.940
And if in these writings I am perplexed by
anything which appears to me opposed to the

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.709
truth, I do not hesitate to suppose that either
the manuscript is faulty, or the translator

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:08.360
has not caught the meaning of what was said,
or I myself have failed to understand it...î

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.670
Echoing this belief in the Middle Ages, Anselm
wrote,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.750
ëFor I am sure that if I say anything which
is undoubtedly contradictory to holy Scripture,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.530
it is wrong; and if I become aware of such
a contradiction, I do not wish to hold to

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.850
that opinion.í
And, similarly, Thomas Aquinas affirmed, ëIt

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:33.210
is plain that nothing false can ever underlie
the literal sense of Holy Scripture.í For

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:40.310
Aquinas the Word of God, the Bible, never
errs but is instead ëinfallible truthí

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.930
And this belief in the inerrancy of the Bible
held through the Reformation as well.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:50.700
Martin Luther asserted that not only had the
Scriptures ìnever erred,î they ìcannot

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.780
err.î The reasons Luther gave were many,
but mainly, he believed, the Bible was the

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.940
very mouth of God and God cannot lie.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.810
So, if God inspired authors to write the words
of the Bible, the authors themselves could

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.940
not have erred, thus the Bible is inerrant.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.820
John Calvin, too, maintained inerrancy of
the biblical texts.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:32.160
For Calvin, the Bible was ìthe eternal and
inviolable truth of God.î

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.930
The character of God as explained by those
who believe in him, and the claim of inerrancy

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:42.910
of the biblical text which this god caused
to be produced, create a sort of hypothesis

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.080
which can be checked for validity.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:51.040
If such a god exists, and he is responsible
for the inspiration of a text without error,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.220
what might we expect ñor not expectóto find
in the pages of this document?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.010
Should there be an expectation not to encounter
conflict between what the Bible records as

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.350
Godís activity in the creation of the universe,
the solar system, planet earth and life upon

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.840
it and what modern science has discovered?

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.020
Should there be an expectation to find a historically
accurate account of how the nation of Israel

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.780
came to occupy the land upon which their nation
was built?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.650
Do the discoveries of archaeology support
these stories?

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.910
What if the Bible has stories most readers
would consider better suited for children

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:33.320
including things like magically talking animals,
people made of sand or salt and magicians

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.470
doing all sorts of fantastic tricks?

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.920
Would such stories conform to, or be at odds
with expectations for the Bibleís content

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:56.530
based upon what has been said about the nature
of the Bibleís authorship and divine inspiration?

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.800
Consider a leisurely walk across a field.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.680
In crossing the field, suppose a person comes
across a stone and then wonders how the stone

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.450
came to be in the field.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.260
They might answer that the stone arrived there
after millions of years under the earthís

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.120
surface, having been subjected to enormous
geological events.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.230
Certainly the person would not conclude that
this stone was somehow unique in the sense

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.060
of its origins.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.440
It wasnít constructed in a factory and shipped
to its current location in the field.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.910
The stone is like many others the hiker has
discovered on walks in many different fields.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:37.590
It is not exactly the same as other rocks,
but it is unmistakably a rock.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.220
But suppose this person finds instead a watch
in the field.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:48.490
Would this person, given what is told of watchmakers
and watches, conclude that it, too, was the

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.790
product of natural forces?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:56.430
A watch is distinct from stones because it
has within it the clues of an intelligent

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.430
designer.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.180
It sits apart from the multitude of stones
scattered upon the ground and meets the expectations

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:09.550
of someone familiar with watchmakers who comprehended
the watchís construction and designed its

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.550
use.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.540
It isnít a stone which bears its own marks
of origin.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:20.870
It is a watch which origins are with a watchmaker.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.870
But before opening the cover of the Bible,
many who promote belief in the divine inspiration

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:31.920
of its books say expectations CANNOT be brought
to a reading of the biblical texts the way

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.170
a person uses knowledge of watches to conclude
that a watch was manufactured by a watchmaker.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.120
How can anyone predict what god can or will
do, they ask?

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.240
Why would god fulfill human expectations?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:54.150
Itís not that anyone is asking this god to
perform a certain way IN ORDER to fulfill

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.900
certain expectations.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.300
Thatís backwards.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.080
The expectations brought to a reading of the
Bible were created by the definition of what

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.960
and who God is, and that the Bible inspired
by this deity is without error.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:15.560
Just as there is an expectation for watchmakers
to make watches and not stones, descriptions

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.810
of Godís nature as an all-knowing, all-powerful
being and his involvement with the creation

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:26.950
of an inerrant biblical text create an expectation
that the Bible really be without error and

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.090
not riddled with problems.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:36.130
It is impossible to approach the Bible neutrally
if it is provisionally granted that there

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:42.500
is a god, and that this god is all-knowing,
all-powerful, incapable of producing error

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.680
and is ultimately responsible for what was
recorded in the pages of the Bible.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.950
Expecting to find inerrancy, some readers
are disappointed by what they find when reading

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.950
the Bible.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.900
Far from an inerrant document, some readers
are faced from the very first pages with errors

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:06.360
of scientific fact, historical incongruities
and archaic, difficult passages.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.950
It doesnít seem at all like the work of an
omniscient, omnipotent deity.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.960
What is it that some readers find in these
supposedly sacred scriptures which have turned

00:15:15.960 --> 00:16:18.190
them not into Bible Believers, but Bible Skeptics?

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:23.360
While the claim is that the Bible was authored
by an omnipotent, omniscient God and, as a

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.700
result, is without error, historically, scientifically,
and in every other conceivable way, actually

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.460
opening the cover the Bible and reading it
reveals a great number of problems which give

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.630
rise to doubts about its supposed divine authorship.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:44.540
For example,
Internal Contradictions

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:50.120
How many officers did Solomon employ for the
construction of his famous Temple?

00:16:50.120 --> 00:17:22.690
Was it 3,300 as stated in 1 Kings 5:16 or
3,600 as recorded in 2 Chronicles 2:2?

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.059
Who purchased the field with the money given
to Judas for his betrayal of Jesus?

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:44.280
Did Judas himself buy the field as reported
in Acts 1:18?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.730
Or did the chief priests pick up the money
that Judas threw at their feet and use it

00:17:48.730 --> 00:18:09.480
to buy the field as given in Matthew 27:6-7?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.700
Absurdities
Occasionally, the Bible reads more like a

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.269
childrenís story than it does a sober record
of human history and Godís interaction with

00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:19.610
humankind.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.730
Many readers have problems taking the Bible
seriously when they read within the first

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:29.149
few pages of the book a story about a talking
snake.

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:43.980
A little further and readers encounter a talking
donkey and then a talking bush.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.039
Historical Errors
The biblical story of the Hebrew escape from

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:54.440
Egyptian bondage is fraught with numerous
historical errors and absurdities not the

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.799
least of which is the number of people leaving
under Mosesís leadership.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:05.700
The Bible reports that 600,000 men of military
age ñupwards of 20 years of ageñleft Egypt

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.289
in the exodus.

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:12.220
If women of the same age, children and the
elderly are figured in, the population of

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:18.610
Hebrews leaving northern Egypt numbered nearly
2 Ω million; virtually the entire population

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.480
of Egypt at the time according to historical
research!

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.240
And this population supposedly grew from a
scant 70 persons in a mere 400 years!

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.260
The biblical tale of the fall of Jericho also
offers historical errors.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.650
Depending on the dates given by interpreters
of the text for the exodus from Egypt and

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.909
the subsequent conquest of Canaan, archaeological
research has discovered the city of Jericho

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:48.539
either did not have a wall for the Hebrew
army to topple or it was not populated at

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:53.090
all!

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:58.141
Scientific Errors
From the first chapter of the Bible, readers

00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:03.379
encounter a story of creation that is wrong
in nearly every assertion it makes about the

00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:12.740
formation of the universe, our galaxy, solar
system, earth and the life upon it.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.869
The story mentions the creation of a solid
canopy that acts as our sky, a barrier separating

00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:23.889
waters below the dome ñthe rivers, lakes
and seasófrom a vast collection of water

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.220
above it.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:30.299
The entire creative process is said, not to
have covered billions of years, but instead

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:32.330
a mere six days.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.090
The Bible tells the story of a worldwide flood.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:43.809
In the tale, all life except those aboard
a large ark is snuffed out in a global deluge.

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:56.539
And yet, no evidence exists in the geological
record to support such a fantastic story.

00:20:56.539 --> 00:21:02.700
Failed prophecies and Questionable Ethics
Readers of the biblical text also encounter

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.590
failed prophecies.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.571
For example, Ezekiel 29 states that Egypt
in the not-to-distant future of the writing

00:21:09.571 --> 00:21:15.799
of the text ñsometime in the 6th century
BCE and heavily edited thereafterówould become

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:19.809
so desolate that no foot would walk across
its cursed soil.

00:21:19.809 --> 00:21:38.999
And yet, Egypt is one of the longest continuously
inhabited nations in the world.

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:43.249
Problems also arise when readers encounter
questionable ethics in some of the biblical

00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:44.249
tales.

00:21:44.249 --> 00:21:50.220
When a bunch of rowdy boys outside the city
of Bethel in 2 Kings fail to show proper respect

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.461
toward a prophet of the god Yahweh, teasing
the man for having a bald head, the prophet

00:21:55.461 --> 00:22:01.249
calls down a curse upon the children and God
obliges, sending two she bears out of the

00:22:01.249 --> 00:22:06.159
nearby woods to tear the boys limb from limb.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:14.559
Surely an all-loving God wouldnít participate
in such an abhorrent actionÖwould he?

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:20.530
Any and most of these problems with the biblical
text exist in all human literature, from ancient

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.700
Greek myths to a randomly selected Stephen
King novel, and when encountered in these

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.889
other forms most readers think nothing of
them.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:32.639
So why is the Bible held to a higher standard?

00:22:32.639 --> 00:22:35.269
Might that be considered unfair?

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:39.710
The Bible is held to a higher standard not
because readers are unnecessarily critical

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:46.320
or prejudiced, but precisely because the expectations
for the biblical text created by the assertions

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.830
regarding its divine origins and claims of
inerrancy made by its adherents have themselves

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.700
created this higher standard.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:00.059
Watchmakers are expected to make watches;
expert watchmakers are expected to make expert

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.269
watches.

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:07.230
The Bible, so its advocates state, is NOT
just another ancient book of myths and religio-political

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.190
propagandistic exaggerations or a dime store
novel.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.270
It is the inerrant, unchanging, sacred Word
of God.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.960
But if the Bible was divinely inspired, its
inspiration was clumsy and unconcerned with

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.169
the readerís understanding or comprehension
of the text.

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:29.360
Faced with the reality of contradictions,
absurdities, historical and scientific errors,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.260
failed prophecies and questionable ethics
found in the biblical text, how DO advocates

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.700
of perfect, divine inspiration maintain belief
in the Bible as a holy book?

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.889
They do so by employing apologetics.

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:49.239
And the ones who engage in apologetics are
known asÖapologists.

00:23:49.239 --> 00:23:53.450
Given the sheer number of problems with the
biblical text, the apologists certainly have

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.869
their work cut out for them.

00:23:54.869 --> 00:24:02.619
But theyíve had centuries to refine their
craft and design arguments to answer the skeptics.

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:14.260
How good are those arguments?

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:29.159
Apologetics, specifically biblical apologetics,
are concerned with the defense of the Bible

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:33.509
as the inerrant and supernaturally inspired
Word of God.

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:40.049
The word Apologetics comes from the Greek,
apologia, meaning "defensible," and takes

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:42.049
its lead from the Bible itself.

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:48.750
1 Peter 3:15 states, But sanctify the Lord
God in your hearts: and be ready always to

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:54.129
give an answer to every man that asketh you
a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness

00:24:54.129 --> 00:24:56.480
and fear.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.210
Meekness and fear arenít always found in
apologetics, as defense of the Bible is a

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.429
contentious and highly personal affair.

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:07.700
Challenges to the Bibleís authority as Godís
Word is a challenge to a personís worldview

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.240
and sense of values.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.590
Biblical apologetics respond to objections
raised by those skeptical of the claim of

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:21.549
divine authorship and inerrancy in a way which
attempts, at least ideally, to establish the

00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:26.759
objective truth of biblical inerrancy and
the exclusivity of the Bible as a divinely

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:35.480
inspired collection of literature.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:42.100
All apologists work under an agenda which
includes belief in the scriptures as god given

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.850
and with a particular religious view in mind.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:49.929
The Bible supplies, for them, instruction
and direction which guides their lives and

00:25:49.929 --> 00:25:53.369
they see skepticism as an attack on their
worldview.

00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:58.559
If their worldview is rendered false by such
criticism, apologists may fear a loss of hope,

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:01.270
direction or purpose for their lives.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.879
For some, it may also mean a loss of income.

00:26:04.879 --> 00:26:09.190
Because they have invested belief in the Bible
and its claims, they are driven by the command

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.220
in 1 Peter to defend these views.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:23.359
And defend them they do, at whatever cost.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:36.950
If the claims of the apologists are true,
and the Bible was authored by a divine being

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:42.710
with absolute knowledge and power, why are
apologetics even necessary?

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:48.269
The fact that apologetics exist itself undermines
the very claims of divine authorship of the

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:50.580
Bible and inerrancy.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.100
If the Bible needs defense, it is precisely
because it is not clear in what it states

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.980
which requires clarification, is in error
over matters of history and science which

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:07.950
need repair, and raises questions of authenticity,
morality, and accuracy which beg for answers.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:13.539
Can and would a perfect god with the character
of infinite and perfect knowledge, all wise,

00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:18.730
and abundant in truth be able to author or
inspire a work which is not clear in what

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:25.499
it states, is in error over matters of history
and science, and raises questions of authenticity,

00:27:25.499 --> 00:27:29.480
morality, and accuracy?

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.440
If such issues are found in the Bible and
require human intervention to explain them

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.760
away, the Bible seems much less a work of
divine influence.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.850
Apologetics seem to admit that the Bible does
have numerous faults and cannot be trusted

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.450
to be read alone.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:49.340
God may have chosen the very words of scripture
but he did so poorly and requires the intervention

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.029
of the apologist.

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:57.179
The apologist then must edit, augment, alter
and put correct what they believe God really

00:27:57.179 --> 00:28:05.639
meant to say!

00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:10.570
The problem of apologetics is exacerbated
by the fact that rarely does there exist a

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.889
single apologetic for any given problem found
in the Bible.

00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:19.999
One apologist admits, ìIn some casesÖthere
are two or more separate comments on similar

00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:25.950
Bible passagesÖThis is due to the multiple
[apologists commenting on the same passage]

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:31.320
and the fact that [apologists] do not always
agree on the best solution to certain difficulties.î

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.830
For this apologist, they assert it is actually
a good thing to have ìa variety of solutionsî

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:42.499
to biblical problems so that those seeking
clarification of difficult biblical passages

00:28:42.499 --> 00:28:50.399
will then be ìable to think through for themselves
which solutions best satisfy their questions.î

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:55.220
But if two opposing apologetics exist for
a single problem found in the Bible, how is

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.340
anyone to decide which apologetic solution
is the correct one?

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.130
Is it really simply a matter of personal choice?

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:07.399
Is interpreting the Bible a democratic affair
where the majority rules?

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:16.100
And why would a perfect god inspire a Bible
which produces such a quagmire of apologetics?

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:22.820
Was the flood of Noah a local affair, or global
in scope?

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.610
The answer varies by apologist.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:32.059
Do the mismatched numbers of Solomonís officers
in 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles reflect one author

00:29:32.059 --> 00:29:37.490
including reserve officers or different standards
in officer rankings?

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:44.539
That will again vary by apologist.

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:49.610
The fact that various contradictory apologetics
exist for problems uncovered in the biblical

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:54.230
text is evidence that apologists cannot agree
on how to interpret the Bible.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:59.330
They only thing that can agree on is that
a plain reading of the narrative is itself

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.400
absurd and in need of explanation.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:08.429
Each apologist operates under a personal religiously
driven agenda to remove obvious and embarrassing

00:30:08.429 --> 00:30:13.659
problems from the Bible.

00:30:13.659 --> 00:30:17.460
Apologists are nothing if not inventive in
their efforts to interpret the Bible for their

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:42.000
own specific purposes.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.159
Faced with the reality of competing apologetics,
the apologist may argue that they are but

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:49.220
mere mortals.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.149
Apologists are bound to make mistakes.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:55.389
If there are conflicting interpretations of
biblical passages, the fault is not in the

00:30:55.389 --> 00:31:01.200
Bible but in the all-too-human, all-too-fallible
apologist.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.639
But if the fault were not in the scriptures
themselves, why then did the text produce

00:31:05.639 --> 00:31:10.129
conditions which gave rise to apologetics
in the first place?

00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:15.820
The very fact that the Bible is not clear,
is not infallible, is the reason apologists

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.340
exist at all.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:23.269
And yet, they produce as muddled, as fallible
explanations for the Bible as the Bible does

00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:28.399
with a straight reading.

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:33.619
Some apologists, however, see themselves as,
in a modern sense, fulfilling the role of

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:39.610
an Old Testament prophet; speaking and interpreting,
correctly of course, the Word of God.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:44.009
They acknowledge competing apologetics but
reject them, if they do not agree with their

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:50.190
own, as misguided at best, demonic attempts
to confuse the faithful at worst.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:58.049
In other words, while the Bible may appear
to be fallible, these apologists are not!

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:02.619
Such arrogance, however, doesnít negate the
fact that competing apologetics nonetheless

00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:08.070
exist and each is supported by its inventor
as the true interpretation of the text.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:13.450
Again, the fact that the text needs to be
explained by any mortal should give one doubts

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.849
as to its divine nature.

00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:22.220
So, who are we to believe?

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.259
A Catholic apologist?

00:32:24.259 --> 00:32:26.630
An Evangelical Protestant apologist?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.649
A Liberal Christian Apologist?

00:32:28.649 --> 00:32:31.570
A Mormon apologist?

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.259
Or should we let the Bible speak for itself?

00:32:34.259 --> 00:32:39.080
For the believer in the divine inspiration
and infallibility of the biblical text, this

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.570
is no small matter.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:45.539
But even for the skeptic the choice is important.

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:50.529
Does one hand over the interpretation of the
Bible to an apologist who clearly has an agenda

00:32:50.529 --> 00:32:55.149
and a vested interest in how those texts are
understood?

00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:58.880
One should exercise great caution when encountering
apologists.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.299
What drives them to interpret the text the
way they do?

00:33:02.299 --> 00:33:06.979
What tools do they bring to an understanding
of the text and how are those tools being

00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:11.259
used?

00:33:11.259 --> 00:33:15.159
Do apologists allow the sciences to help them
interpret the text?

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:17.869
Do they consult with the social sciences?

00:33:17.869 --> 00:33:20.320
With cultural anthropological studies?

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.130
With geology?

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.440
Astronomy?

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.750
Biology?

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.059
Linguistics?

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:27.379
Archaeology?

00:33:27.379 --> 00:33:30.179
Do they represent these fields fairly?

00:33:30.179 --> 00:33:36.860
Or does the apologist merely employ such fields
of studies to support a specific agenda, manipulating

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:42.989
the data so that a desired outcome is achieved?

00:33:42.989 --> 00:33:47.730
Even when the Bible is clearly in error, do
the apologists acknowledge this error, or

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.700
craftily spin another magical tale to make
the Bible say what they want it to, creating

00:33:52.700 --> 00:34:16.139
the illusion of inerrancy at the Bibleís
own expense?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:21.250
Many apologists have tried to explain the
existence of errors found in the Bible by

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:26.580
claiming there were no errors in the ORIGINAL
manuscripts, even though some errors may have

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.470
crept in over time.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:32.860
What they mean is that the originally penned
versions of each of the Bibleís books were

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:38.190
completely without error but that, over the
centuries, men who copied these books introduced

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:45.620
minor mistakes into the text.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.360
But what gives apologists reason to assume
this original version of the Bible was itself

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.060
inerrant other than their belief that it was?

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.110
No original Bible exists to check for inerrancy!

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:02.670
And apologists canít explain why the original
version of the Bible was without error but

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:08.750
that subsequent copies contain them.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:15.690
It simply makes no logical sense.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:21.690
If human error was not allowed to mar the
perfect originals of Godís script, why was

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.071
it allowed to deface the copies?

00:35:23.071 --> 00:35:24.071
Some apologists may appeal to a different
set of ìoriginalsî than the ones produced

00:35:24.071 --> 00:35:25.071
by the authors of the first scrolls.

00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:26.071
Such an apologist may refer to the originals
as pre-existent and currently existingÖin

00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:27.071
the heavenly realm.

00:35:27.071 --> 00:35:28.071
This set of ìoriginalsî would indeed be
without error and remain so because they are

00:35:28.071 --> 00:35:29.071
with God in some sort of ethereal sense.

00:35:29.071 --> 00:35:30.071
Of course, making such an appeal is as equally
without evidence as claiming the first earthly

00:35:30.071 --> 00:35:31.071
copies of the Bible were without error, but
it also puts any chance of verifying the assertion

00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:32.071
completely out of reach.

00:35:32.071 --> 00:35:33.071
The claim is on par with other fantastical
stories like Joseph Smithís mysterious Golden

00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:34.071
Plates or the New Ageís Akashic Records.

00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:35.071
The Bible then becomes some sort of fourth-wheel
in the Christian Trinity ñGod, the Father,

00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:36.071
God, the Son, God, the Holy Spirit, and God,
the Bible.

00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:37.071
For the True Believer, one not interested
in actual evidence or factual claims, making

00:35:37.071 --> 00:35:38.071
the only inerrant copies of the Bible as mysterious
and out of reach as the God which inspired

00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:39.071
them is extremely comforting.

00:35:39.071 --> 00:35:40.071
The assertion cannot be proved, but it can
be disproven either.

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.071
As such, however, it is completely useless
to one not already convinced of the Bibleís

00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:42.071
inerrancy and divine inspiration.

00:35:42.071 --> 00:35:43.071
An original inerrant Bible is exactly what
one would expect were the Bible inspired by

00:35:43.071 --> 00:35:44.071
an omniscient, omnipotent God and just such
an inerrant original is what is claimed to

00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:45.071
have existed by biblical apologists.

00:35:45.071 --> 00:35:49.940
However, if a god were interested in inspiring
an inerrant original Bible it follows that

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.890
this god would be as equally interested in
assuring inerrant copies of the text.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.630
But this is not what is found.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:02.620
Errant copies are, however, what would be
expected for texts not under divine stewardship.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:07.730
Without an original Bible to verify the claim
of inerrancy, the only Bibles currently available

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.570
for examination are the errant copies.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:16.420
Errant copies, then, evidence not divine authorship
or inspiration, but an all-too fallible human

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.530
production.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:23.410
Deferring to an inaccessible original version
of the Bible does not help support the claim

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:35.900
of biblical inerrancy.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:40.670
While going through the biblical text, readers
cannot help but notice strange descriptions

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:46.330
of natural phenomena which are at variance
with modern scientific understandings of our

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.330
world.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:37:00.100
Referring to the sky as a solid dome, for
example, or to the sun as moving over the

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:17.880
earth as a runner runs a race, is unexpected
if these texts were authored by an omniscient

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:25.380
being who mustíve known the sky was a permeable
atmosphere and that the sun was stationary

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:32.710
in relation to the earth.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:38.230
Such ìlanguage of appearanceî is known as
phenomenological language and is, in and of

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.770
itself, not in error strictly speaking.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:47.160
From a human perspective, the sky does appear
as a dome covering overhead and the sun does

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:53.260
appear to move across the sky ñas opposed
to the observer moving beneath the sun.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:38:00.180
Apologists assert that God allowed such phenomenological
language to be used in the biblical text becauseÖwell,

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.070
there never really is a reason given for why
God allowed such language to be used in the

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:11.730
Bible other than the self-affirming reason
that God allowed it!

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.770
Some apologists will point out that even today
people who know better, like weather forecasters

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:23.190
on TV, use phenomenological language like
ìsunriseî and ìsunset.î Are we to assume

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:31.100
scientific inaccuracy when the TV forecaster
uses such words and phrases?

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.400
Yes.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.320
Because the sun does not rise and the sun
does not set.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.150
These are terms of convenience and are in
our language largely because they exist in

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.060
such ancient, scientifically ignorant literature
like the Bible.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.630
If people knew, 3000 years ago, that the sun
does not really rise and set but that the

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:58.630
earth turns underneath it, they might have
invented different words to describe the phenomena.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.620
This seems especially true for those inspired
by an omniscient god.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.620
It certainly is not absurd to expect that
the Hebrew authors of the Bible would have

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:12.050
invented new words to describe what God inspired
them to write if phenomenological language

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:20.070
would cause future confusion or doubt over
the divine inspiration of the text.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.680
Was the Bible only inspired so the Hebrews
alone could easily understand it?

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.020
The Hebrews are described as the only tribe
of humans whom God favored with his presence

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.610
and his knowledge.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.960
To evidence this special designation, it certainly
would have been helpful if this God had inspired

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.810
unique and scientifically accurate descriptions
of natural phenomena instead of merely allowing

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:47.410
the Hebrews to blend in with their less-favored
neighbors, merely describing things the way

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:53.110
everyone else was doing at the time.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.180
But the Bible, the apologists say, is not
a science textbook.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.870
It neednít have been so precise that it ignores
the plain speaking and observations of the

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.590
human beings writing it.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:07.800
The authors were allowed to write things from
their perspective, not from the perspective

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.820
of God.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:14.150
However, the same is true of every other,
non-divinely-inspired ancient (and even many

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.780
modern) documents.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.040
If the biblical text was allowed to reflect
the inaccurate perspective of human beings

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:26.610
ñand not that of Godís overarching perspective--
how can the apologistóor anyone!-- tell the

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:31.300
difference between a biblical author writing
something phenomenologically because he simply

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:36.560
didnít know any better and a biblical author
writing something phenomenologically because

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:44.510
God allowed him to do so during divine inspiration?

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:50.000
The text, written either way, would look identical
so the appeal to phenomenological language

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.610
as something God simply allowed to happen
but was nonetheless responsible for during

00:40:54.610 --> 00:41:02.790
the process of divine inspiration is an empty,
unsupported and self-serving assertion.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:08.080
How can we know when God allowed, under divine
inspiration, an author to use phenomenological

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.050
language, the apologist may be asked?

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:16.391
When the author used phenomenological language,
will come the reply.

00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:19.240
The assertion gets us nowhere.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:25.170
The use of phenomenological language certainly
doesnít support the claim of divine inspiration

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.320
or biblical inerrancy.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.030
How does one distinguish between the divine
inspiration of phenomenological language when

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:50.780
its use is perfectly natural for un-inspired
works of literature?

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.080
Some apologists will argue that what looks
on the surface to be errors of scientific

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.990
fact found in the Bible, are instead instances
of the use of equivocal language.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:05.220
Matters which were simply too complicated
for the biblical authors to comprehend, but

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:11.030
not for the creator of the universe to understand,
were inspired to be written in equivocal language

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.492
so that the ancient writers could get as close
to the truth without having to actually face

00:42:15.492 --> 00:42:17.680
it head on.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.480
Terms were inspired to be left undefined and
vague for the ancient audience until future

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.370
minds encountered the text with sufficiently
advanced knowledge to understand what God

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.270
was really trying to say.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:34.750
So, for example, the description of the sky
in Genesis 1 gives the impression of a solid,

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:40.020
domed canopy which rests above the earth,
separating the seas, rivers and lakes below

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.040
the canopy from a vast, extraterrestrial reserve
of water above.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040
And God made the firmament, and divided the
waters which [were] under the firmament from

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.400
the waters which [were] above the firmament:
and it was so.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.340
And God called the firmament Heaven.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:59.620
However, according to the apologist who invokes
the inspiration of equivocal language the

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.960
Hebrew term raqiya, used in the biblical text
to name the sky dome and which has its etymological

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.490
roots in objects which are solid, like tin
or gold, and hammered or stretched out to

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:16.510
cover another object, is actually equivocal
enough to allow for a later audience, educated

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:22.110
in the discoveries of modern science, to understand
the term to really be referring to a permeable,

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:36.210
multi-layered atmosphere or even to outer
space itself!

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:41.160
What such an apologetic assumes, of course,
is that the ancient authors and their audience

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.320
were too unintelligent or naÔve to understand
the reality of Godís revelation and so he

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.560
condescended to them, like children, tucking
a deeper meaning into the text that these

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.040
more simple-minded people apparently couldnít
possibly comprehend.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:01.540
However, it is not at all true that the ancients
had less intellectual capacity than do modern

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.540
humans.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.560
Itís simply a fact of history that they didnít
have access to the knowledge that we have

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.560
today.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.700
It is not the case that ancient people were
too mentally challenged to grasp and comprehend

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.070
more complicated ideas.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.360
Certainly they had as much intelligence to
understand and articulate accurately basic

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:28.160
scientific facts as can most high school students
today.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.540
The apologist insults these ancient authors
by treating them as a sort of sub-species

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:39.210
of human, without the intelligence to understand
the basic science of the 21st century.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.770
But this simply is not true.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.760
While the ancients may have never seen a modern
automobile, they certainly had the mental

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:56.610
capacity to be taught the basics about the
vehicle and, more, how to drive one.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:01.710
Additionally, if God had inspired the texts
in language merely appropriate for a more

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.640
naÔve people, with the proper anticipation
such an omniscient being would possess for

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:12.010
a more intellectually sophisticated audience
in the future, why do we not find clear markers

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.440
in the Bible to such an affect?

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.640
In other words, why do we not find such phrases
as ìThis is written not as it is, but only

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.040
so that you will understandî or some other
such marker in the text?

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.130
These phrases would certainly give evidence
to support the apologistís assertion that

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:33.810
certain words or ideas were inspired to be
equivocal in the text for ancient audiences

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:38.960
in anticipation of future readers with the
intellectual capacity to understand Godís

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.410
greater meaning.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:46.550
Lacking such phrases the apologistís assertion
looks rather vacant.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.090
Apologists are right about one thing, however.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.550
Equivocal language does exist in the biblical
text.

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.590
But it exists not because it was inspired
to be there.

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.900
Vague and undefined terms are used because
the authors themselves did not have a clear

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.870
and precise understanding of the nature of
reality.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:09.600
They were driven, not by a lack of intellectual
capacity, but merely by scientific ignorance.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.210
When the sky, for example, was given a descriptive
name which evoked an image of a solid dome,

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:19.730
stretched to cover the earth like an overturned
tea-cup, it was because the ancient authors

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.510
clearly thought this was the nature of reality.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:27.280
The use of equivocal language was not done
for a later generationís benefit, for modern

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.120
apologists to stuff their own meaning into
the text.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.720
Literature produced purely under the limitations
of human knowledge certainly would use equivocal

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:41.671
language when writers did not understand the
deeper nature of a scientific reality, when

00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:47.630
knowledge was guided by superstition, myths
and legends.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:53.680
However, equivocal language is not something
one would expect to find in a text inspired

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.050
by an omniscient deity.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:47:01.300
As one apologetic source puts it: ìFalse
religious systems often use equivocation to

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:08.370
twist scripture to make it say what they want
it to say.î But not only the so-called false

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:19.700
religious systems, but even biblical apologists
use this technique.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:33.650
A number of apologists attempt to remove problems
found in the Bible by redefining words.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.860
Many words in the Bible have multiple meanings.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:41.420
For example, the Hebrew ìnaíarî can mean
ìa boy,î ìa youth,î ìa young man,î or

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:46.010
even more broadly, ìchildren.î Most of the
time, words with multiple meanings can be

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:50.810
understood in the context in which they are
found, and often by helping words.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:56.420
So, for example, ìboyî is clearly the definition
of naíar in the story of Elisha and the Bears

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.010
in 2 Kings.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:04.010
Here, ìnaíarî is defined by being paired
with another word, ìqatan.î ìQatanî can

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:09.710
mean ìyoung,î ìsmall,î or ìinsignificant.î
When qualifying ìnaíar,î however, qatan

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:14.490
always means ìsmallî as in ìyoungî and
so the qatan naíar in the story of Elisha

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:19.360
are ìlittle boysî or ìyoung children.î
However, the apologist who is embarrassed

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.860
by the story of Elishaís curse in 2 Kings,
in which God sends two bears to maul the qatan

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:29.580
naíar, the little boys or young children,
because of an insult they leveled against

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:35.270
Godís prophet, is motivated to change the
meaning of qatan and naíar so that the story

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.270
is no longer as horrific for modern ears.

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:44.220
The apologist removes the words from their
context of 2 Kings and imposes upon them alternate

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.840
but improbable definitions in order to rewrite
the tale.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.830
So, for example, ìnaíarî is said to indicate
an older male instead of a boy or child, and

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:59.190
ìqatanî is defined as ìinsignificant.î
In the hands of the apologist, the term ìqatan

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:03.890
naíarî no longer means ìlittle boyî or
ìyoung childrenî as the context of 2 Kings

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:09.320
clearly implies, but ìinsignificant male.î
The little boys in the story of 2 Kings are

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:15.220
then transformed into a marauding band of
homeless, dangerous highwayman in the throes

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.620
of the apologetic frenzy so that the curse
from Elisha and the ensuing bear attack become

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:27.350
a reasonable and palatable outcome for such
a vicious gang of outlaws.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:32.020
There certainly is nothing wrong with assigning
the proper definitions to difficult words

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.520
or phrases in the biblical text.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.480
The problem with this approach comes when
the goal is not to educate the reader but

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:46.580
to obscure a Bible difficulty, cover up an
embarrassing passage, and promote a specific

00:49:46.580 --> 00:50:02.270
apologetic agenda.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.550
Difficult passages in the Bible, even those
which appear to be in historical or scientific

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:11.880
error, are claimed by some apologists to have
been woven into the text through inspiration

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:20.540
of God in order to persuade readers to become
more attentive and engaged with the text.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:25.870
Difficult passages in the Bible, especially
those which reflect an alien time and culture,

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:30.510
cause readers to spend more time studying
the scriptures to grasp their meaning which

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:34.370
has a therapeutic effect, some apologists
will assert.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:39.670
The Greek word for disciple used in the New
Testament literally means ìpupilî or ìlearnerî

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:44.520
and those who freely choose to immerse themselves
in a deep study of the Bible mark themselves

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.840
as true disciples of God.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:51.660
God certainly isnít interested in coercing
people to come to belief in him by inspiring

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.020
a clear and accurate text.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:59.620
But how is having the best available evidence
for the existence of God and his inspiration

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:05.150
of the biblical text--a text clear and unambiguous--
considered coercion?

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:10.840
In the sense some biblical apologetics may
be using the word, coercion can be defined

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:16.830
as ìcompelling to an act or choice.î Using
this definition, perhaps a clear and unambiguous

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:22.241
biblical text could be considered a form of
mild coercion into belief in GodÖbut how

00:51:22.241 --> 00:51:26.770
can that be considered a bad thing by biblical
apologists and Christian theists?

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:29.770
Isnít this exactly the goal they have in
mind?

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:35.250
Isnít the practice of apologetics itself
a form of coercion if it clears confusion

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:41.520
about the text and offers evidence for Godís
inspiration of the narratives and his existence?

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:47.360
How is making the text clear through apologetics
not coercion but a clear text from divine

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.250
inspiration is?

00:51:52.250 --> 00:52:09.320
It isnít that thereís a request for God
to write his text across the sky, on the moon,

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:22.110
in rock formations on Mars or to ìzapî perfect
personal understanding of the Bible into everyoneís

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.860
heads.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:30.220
A science textbook, for example, may be difficult
to comprehend because of the subject matter,

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:35.850
but the authors of such texts strive to write
them as clearly and as free from error as

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.960
humanly possible.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.390
Certainly they are not trying to coerce anyone
into learning from their textbooks but merely

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:48.900
making the subject matter as accessible and
understandable to as many readers as possible.

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.670
Translators, too, will work extremely hard
to translate texts from one language into

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:58.920
another so that the meaning of the original
text is retained in the copies.

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.940
Humans work on their own literature to these
degrees when the text is important enough

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:08.610
to warrant such pain-staking precision and
often achieve remarkable results.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:13.030
Students read their texts and understand the
subject matter without encountering unnecessarily

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:17.000
cumbersome chapters or obvious errors of fact.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.630
And this is accomplished solely through human
effort.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:25.600
So the question is: why isnít the divinely
inspired book of an omniscient, omnipotent

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:33.070
God similarly as accessible as supernaturally
possible?

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:36.950
Even though it might be expected that a book
authored by an omniscient being should be

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:42.380
easier to understand and not require advanced
degrees in multiple languages, the social

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:47.300
sciences, archaeology and the like, the fact
is the Bible does require its readers to dig

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:50.910
down deeper than what is plainly on the surface
of the text.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:56.170
And this is to be expected, not from a book
authored by an all-powerful God, but one authored

00:53:56.170 --> 00:54:01.940
by very real, very earth-bound people who
didnít have the advantage of omniscience,

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:06.240
who were not careful to understand their words
would carry across centuries to people of

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.480
other places and other times, but instead
were prisoners of their own time and place,

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:16.730
their own culture, unable to break free of
these constraints precisely because they were

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:22.790
not liberated by a powerful deity inspiring
a timeless document intended for all humankind.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:27.520
The Bible shows all the features of literature
produced out of specific ages and cultures

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.680
and thus must be approached as such, without
the expectations of divine inspiration forced

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.230
upon it by its apologists.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:42.130
But beyond the failure of the text to meet
the simple expectation of clarity if it were

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:47.200
indeed inspired by an omniscient, omnipotent
being, objective study of the Bible often

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.300
has the opposite effect of what the apologists
intend.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:55.560
Many who read the Bible and study it in depth
come to the conclusion that the scriptures

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:00.540
certainly are NOT inerrant and in fact are
far from what one would expect from a document

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.290
inspired by a timeless deity.

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:08.050
To be sure, such a study helps place the Bible
in its historical context.

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:12.530
Understanding the political, social and religious
structures out of which the Bible was produced

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:18.170
helps explain some of the peculiarities of
the text.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:24.770
However, apologists who claim a more rigorous
study of the Bible leads one to a better understanding

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:29.600
of the Bible as Godís inerrant Word start
with that conclusion already in mind and then

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.730
tailor their ìstudyî to conform to this
belief.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:37.750
If a student is not willing to go where studies
lead, and is only interested in gathering

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:43.450
carefully selected data to support a preconceived
conclusion ñnamely that the Bible is the

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:48.210
inerrant word of Godóthen why bother being
a student of the text at all?

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:53.530
Such a person might as well simply announce,
ìGod said it, I believe it, that settles

00:55:53.530 --> 00:56:07.880
itî and not waste time with the pretense
of being a student of the biblical text.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:12.760
Some apologists note that to have a truly
inerrant copy of the Bible in todayís world

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.950
would create enormous logistical problems
for God.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:23.200
Each of these problems has to do with the
transmission of Godís inerrant Word as given

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.000
in the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek of the originals
into the variety of human language alive in

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.380
the world today.

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:49.670
According to virtually every apologist for
the inerrancy of the biblical text, the original

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.150
scrolls and parchments of the biblical books
were inspired inerrant.

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:59.370
However, they say, errors can be misunderstood
to exist in the text due to translation.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:04.280
Because every language has its own unique
idioms, archaic terminology, puns, euphemisms,

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:09.610
and other forms of speech, these often do
not translate well into other languages and

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:13.480
thus, certain sections of the Bible can seem
confusing.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.600
Problems can arise from translating these
unique forms of speech into modern languages

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.290
and these problems can cause some readers
to perceive errors in the text when the error

00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.460
is actually in the translation.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.990
Thus, the perceived error does not exist in
the ìoriginalî version of the Bible, the

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.400
apologist will argue, but only in the translations.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:40.550
However, apologists seem to forget that unique
idioms, archaic terminology, puns, euphemisms

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.680
and other forms of speech are present in all
human literature.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.230
They are markers which place such literature
firmly in the time and culture out of which

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:51.360
they were produced.

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.310
Apologists cannot explain how the presence
of such unique but confusing speech argues

00:57:55.310 --> 00:58:00.680
for a divinely inspired document meant to
transcend such limiting use of language.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.510
Clearer language is certainly something one
would expect from an omniscient, omnipotent

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.060
being.

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.970
Apologists cannot seem to explain why, if
a god is responsible for inspiring his divine

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:15.920
intentions clearly into Hebrew, Aramaic and
Greek, he is not also capable of inspiring

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:21.680
equal clarity into translations of English,
Spanish and Chinese other than to assert it

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.200
somehow causes logistical problems for the
deity.

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:46.180
Are translators somehow closed to divine inspiration
whereas the original authors were not?

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:51.210
Nearly all apologists acknowledge that current
copies of the Bible contain errors, even if

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:57.100
that acknowledgement is only for the minor
copyist errors that exist in the texts.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:02.750
For example, in 2 Chronicles 9:25 the author
states Solomon had four thousand stalls for

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:09.780
horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen
which seems to contradict 1 Kings 4:26 which

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.850
states Solomon had forty thousand stalls of
horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:16.040
horsemen.

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.350
Which is correct?

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:24.480
Apologists will claim that the ORIGINAL manuscripts
only had one number, probably the FOUR thousand

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:31.410
figure, and the apparent contradiction introduced
by 1 Kings 4:26 is merely a copyist slip of

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:34.140
the pen.

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:38.150
Is it possible the two verses did, at an earlier
time, agree?

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:43.080
Itís of course possible; and, moreso, itís
probable.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.880
And if they did agree on the figure for the
number of Solomonís stalls, wouldnít a copyistís

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.830
error explain the contradiction?

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:51.340
It certainly would.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:56.230
Certainly this is the actual reason why we
find these sorts of errors in the Bible and

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:59.310
in most other works of ancient literature.

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:03.630
Before the creation of the printing press,
copies of ancient documents were done by hand

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.790
by very fallible human beings.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:11.570
Monks, sitting in damp quarters lit only by
natural light or candles, put quill to parchment

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:17.390
while looking back and forth between original
scroll and the copy they were producing.

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:21.890
Clearly minor errors like the number of horse
stalls Solomon kept could easily creep in

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:25.830
from even the best and most attentive copyist.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:29.510
They were only human, after all, and given
the number of centuries that separate the

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:35.020
original versions of these books and the most
recent copies, itís virtually guaranteed

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:42.060
that such errors would enter the text.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.790
But this isnít just any ancient manuscript.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:50.330
This is not even one of Homerís epics, or
an account of the deeds of Alexander the Great.

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:56.920
This is a book, originally authored by a powerful,
careful, painstaking God who took the trouble

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:03.790
to inspire his words perfectly when first
written, according to the apologists.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:10.770
However, this God then, by the very fact that
such errors exist, must have suddenly went

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:16.970
inattentive and allowed these originally perfectly
inspired words to diverge into contradiction

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:19.220
in the copies.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:33.560
But why?

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.920
Apologists complain that if God were to inspire
every copy of his Bible to be as inerrant

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.060
as the original he would be turned into a
micromanager.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:48.910
This complaint doesnít travel far because,
among other things, it assumes micromanaging

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:53.950
the inerrant copying of the worldís most
important and only divinely inspired book

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:57.520
is somehow a waste of GodísÖtime.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:09.780
That, in order to have as perfect copies as
the original, God would need to work miracles.

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:14.870
The apologistsí complaint ignores the fact
that God ñaccording to the assertionóthought

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:19.910
it important enough to intervene in human
history and the lives of certain human beings

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:25.460
to have his book produced but then assumes
the maintenance of its reproduction was somehow

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.450
less important.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:31.880
If it was not defiling the will of the original
human authors to have them write the exact

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:37.780
words God intended, why is it violating a
copyistís will to have him pay strict attention

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.470
to the reproduction of this most sacred text?

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:46.150
Indeed, a simple error which found its way
into an early printing of the Bible was quickly

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:50.390
discovered by non-omniscient humans and corrected
by them.

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:55.869
The so-called ìImmoral Bibleî was published
in the 16th century with Exodus 20:14 reading,

01:02:55.869 --> 01:02:59.650
ìThou SHALT commit adultery,î leaving out
the ìnotî!

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:09.670
If humans catch and correct such errors of
transmission, why not God?

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:15.540
While some apologists acknowledge these copyist
errors in the biblical text but claim that

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.990
they are minor and unimportant to the overall
message of the Scriptures.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:24.250
They point out that while copyists may have
confused the number of stalls Solomon may

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:30.340
have had, they did not confuse the much greater
message being communicated through such stories.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:36.140
Indeed, the apologists will boast that only
by a supernatural act could God have preserved

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:40.990
this message of Scripture through the centuries
and this consistent message is proof that

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:44.380
God divinely inspired the biblical texts.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.590
Such apologists who so readily claim Godís
miraculous intervention in preserving the

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:54.560
message of the Bible are the same apologists
who claim it would have been an act of coercion,

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.981
or micromanagement, for God to have miraculously
intervened to keep the very words of Scripture

01:03:59.981 --> 01:04:02.470
inerrant.

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:22.940
Apologists are often found wanting to not
only have their cake, but eat it, too.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:27.020
Apologists may state that having inerrant
translations of the Bible into every known

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:32.350
language of the world would be logistically
impossible for mankind to handle.

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:37.510
And yet, the Bible today is the most widely
translated book in human history.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:41.560
Without a doubt allowances by the translators
are made for the wide variety of languages

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.530
and cultures in which these bibles are produced
but nearly everyone has opportunity to read

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.490
the Bible in their own native tongue.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:53.920
So far, the logistics involved in producing
the Bible into all these languages has not

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:59.710
been a problem for humankind so assuring inerrancy
in these translations surely shouldnít be

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:04.240
a problem for an omnipotent God.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.580
Error or inerrancy can exist in any language.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:12.260
The stories of the Bible are the same no matter
what a person's worldview or assumptions.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:16.400
Either the walls of Jericho fell to Joshuaís
trumpets or they did not.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.190
The story is either historically inerrant
or it is not.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:26.680
The story's inerrancy does not rely upon a
person's language.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.570
However and again, some apologists view inerrant
Bibles appearing in every language, in every

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:35.320
corner of the world as an act of coercion.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:40.550
They envision God manipulating the hands of
every scribe copying every version of the

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:45.280
Bible, interfering with printing presses to
assure an inerrant delivery.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.940
But the reproduction of the text to reflect
exactly the words God wanted would no more

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:54.600
be an act of coercion than was the original
inspiration of the text.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.730
If God was careful enough to assure the inerrant
delivery of his original texts, there is no

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:18.970
logical (or logistical) reason why he could
not do the same with the copies.

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:24.200
Some apologists want to redefine what an error
is by stating that what may be considered

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.920
an error in the mind of a 21st century reader
of the biblical text may not have been an

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.690
error in the mind of the original author.

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:36.650
We should judge the inerrancy of the Bible
by the standards of those who wrote it.

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:40.830
For example:
In the 11th Chapter of Leviticus, verses 13

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.400
and 19 we read of a very odd classification
of animals.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.960
Odd, of course, to 21st century ears:
And these are they which ye shall have in

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:57.250
abomination among the fowls...and the stork,
the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.760
and the bat.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:05.869
The modern reader will immediately recognize
the apparent error: Bats are not birds!

01:07:05.869 --> 01:07:11.150
However, in this verse, bats are included
not in a modern biological classification

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:13.970
system, but in an ancient one.

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:19.559
For the biblical authors, bats and birds were
classified together as ìwinged animals.î

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:24.540
The Hebrew word translated ìfowlî in the
King James Version of this verse is owph.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:29.810
In more modern translations, the word is rendered
ìbird.î The ancient Hebrews did not classify

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:35.200
animals the way modern biologists do; there
was no classification for mammals and so the

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.220
bat merely belonged to the group of animals
with wings.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:43.950
While the modern classification system may
be a more scientifically accurate way to group

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:48.900
animals, grouping together animals because
they have winged appendages isnít necessarily

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:54.770
an ìerror.î
However, an ancient classification system

01:07:54.770 --> 01:08:01.890
which lumps bats together with birds, clearly
is reflective of human invention, not divine.

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:06.350
These sorts of markers are the fingerprints
of human authors, exactly what one would expect

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:09.369
if the text was not of divine origin.

01:08:09.369 --> 01:08:14.560
While such writing might not necessarily be
in error, it certainly reflects its very human

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:30.839
authorship.

01:08:30.839 --> 01:08:35.790
Some apologists lay blame for biblical errors
at the feet of the Bible's critics.

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:40.560
They acknowledge that the Bible isn't perfect,
but it isn't perfect insofar as it obviously

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.089
wasn't written with a modern audience in mind.

01:08:44.089 --> 01:08:48.799
Skeptics raising objections to the claim of
biblical inerrancy are sometimes labeled fundamentalist

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:55.290
atheists who simply donít know how read the
Bible properly.

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:59.520
Apologists will insist that God inspired the
authors of the biblical books but that doesn't

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.359
mean God inspired the writings so that they
would be understood by everyone.

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:09.020
These so-called errors in the Bible highlighted
by skeptics are created by a misunderstanding

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.540
of the Bible; of not reading it properly.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:16.560
The question is then raised, who CAN understand
the Bible?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.310
The apologist will answer, of course, that
they understand the Bible best and offer their

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:25.400
services in guiding readers through the difficult
passages of the Bible.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:30.670
Never mind that apologists often disagree
amongst themselves on the best paths through

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:33.730
these treacherous pages!

01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:38.290
Despite the apologistís self-serving function
of accusing critics of the Bible of not understanding

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:44.339
it in its proper contexts, the Bible is indeed
a product of its own age and as such is difficult

01:09:44.339 --> 01:09:45.900
to understand.

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:52.310
It must be approached in its own contexts:
literary, historical, cultural and so on.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:56.780
Of course this is as true for the Bible as
it is for any other work of ancient literature

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.900
so itís difficult to understand how an acknowledgement
of these contexts does not undermine the assertion

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.840
of divine authorship.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.480
The Bible isn't easy to understand precisely
because it wasn't the product of a supernatural

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480
being.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.790
The Bible is difficult to understand for the
same reasons most ancient literature is difficult

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:15.400
to understand.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.500
It is the product not of a god but of human
beings.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:23.060
A product of human beings not inspired to
write the thoughts of a divine entity but

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:28.130
inspired by their own imaginations, inspired
by the peculiarities of their own times and

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:33.820
cultures, written within the confines and
structures of their own worlds, separated

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:45.610
from modern readers by thousands of years.

01:10:45.610 --> 01:11:08.190
For example, the ancient Near Eastern authors
of the biblical text did not possess the concept

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.650
of a world created from nothingness.

01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:14.250
They did not possess concepts of quantum physics
or string theory.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:20.020
They invented stories from their immediate
surroundings, circumstances and experiences.

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:27.610
Theirs was a world of finite resources, struggle,
nature and chaos.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:33.060
In the creation story of Genesis 1, the author
did not, could not, imagine his god magically

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:38.040
conjuring a planet ñmuch less an entire universeófrom
nothing.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.500
Instead, formless water pre-exists everything.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:51.110
It was from this watery chaos that God moved
and brought order, and from this water the

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:52.460
earth arose.

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:57.020
In turn, from the earth, God formed the world
familiar to the Genesis author.

01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.660
In this story, God is more a manager, less
an artist.

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:06.460
Linear, logical, abstract ideas which permeate
our Western world did not exist for the ancient

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.050
authors writing the biblical narratives.

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:14.190
Additionally, from the overall structure of
Genesis 1, it is clear that this story is

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:18.270
giving an explanation for the Jewish institution
of the Sabbath.

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:23.310
The authors, already aware that their religion
dictated rest on the seventh day of the week,

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:28.630
crafted a creation story to explain, in part,
where this practice originated.

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:34.650
Many such origin stories, known as etiologies,
exist in a variety of ancient literature.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:39.250
Study of the cultural and historical contexts
from which these stories arose helps bring

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:42.300
these facts into focus.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.730
But this is precisely true of any ancient
literature.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:48.190
The Bible certainly is not unique.

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:49.880
And that is the point.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.480
For many, a deeper understanding of not just
the biblical texts but discoveries of history

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.560
and modern science actually lead them away
from belief in the Bible as the inerrant word

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.810
of God.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:05.690
How is understanding the opening chapter of
Genesis as depicting God as an administrator

01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:11.290
of chaos in the context of ancient Near Eastern
mythology, or as an etiological story regarding

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:16.520
the institution of the Jewish Sabbath day,
rather than a historical account of creation

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.940
supportive of biblical inerrancy?

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.500
Understanding the character of god or the
institution of a religious practice in this

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:29.140
historical context does not make the creation
story of Genesis any more accurate.

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:33.670
But if Genesis was never intended to give
an accurate description of creation, and was

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:37.840
merely meant to describe what the authors
believed about their god and why no one in

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.480
their culture was supposed to work on the
seventh day of the week, how is that any more

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.140
evidence of ìinspirationî or ìinfallibilityî
than a contextual understanding of the Egyptian

01:13:48.140 --> 01:14:05.930
creation myth, or the Babylonian?

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:11.030
An apologist may object that if copies of
the Bible were maintained as inerrant as the

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.870
original, such copies would become the focus
of worship.

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:20.150
This would then take focus away from worshipping
the true creator and turn human beings into

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:24.310
idolaters, worshipping a book instead of God.

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:29.070
However, such an apologist does not explain
how inerrant originals did not create this

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:35.390
idolatry so it is unclear how inerrant copies
would.

01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:40.290
An apologist making such a claim may draw
a parallel between inerrant copies of the

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:44.340
Bible and some other highly revered historical
document.

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.720
The original United States Declaration of
Independence is just such a document.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.390
It is painstakingly preserved, held on display
at the National Archives Rotunda in Washington,

01:14:54.390 --> 01:15:00.980
D.C., in encasements made of titanium and
aluminum, filled with inert argon gas.

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:05.080
Long lines wait to view the Declaration with
patrons passing through metal detectors and

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.010
under the watchful eyes of armed security
guards and electronic cameras.

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:14.410
The Declaration is indeed held apart from
many other works of literature available in

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:19.780
the United States and doubtless an original
Bible, should it ever have existed, would

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:23.200
be similarly treated.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.510
More to the apologistís point, however, even
exact copies of the Declaration, made around

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:32.090
the time of the original, are held in high
regard.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:37.380
These rare copies are found in various collections,
meticulously preserved, highly prized and

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.150
carefully guarded.

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:45.550
Occasionally these exact, some might say inerrant,
copies of the original Declaration go on public

01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:46.600
tour.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.160
These tours are an example of modern security
practices.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.230
Metal detectors, armed guards, special viewing
containers and electronic surveillance are

01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:51.230
in abundance at these displays.

01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:55.750
The apologist will claim that this reverence
for even a copy of the Declaration is what

01:15:55.750 --> 01:16:00.070
is feared would follow exact, inerrant copies
of the Bible.

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:05.350
The attention is drawn to the document instead
of the author and misguided reverence is exactly

01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:12.080
what God wants to avoid and so he allows errors
to mar his otherwise perfect text.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.300
However, what the apologist fails to realize
in this extravagant, imaginative scenario

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:23.160
which he invents erupting around inerrant
copies of the Bible, is that such caution

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.489
is taken with the Declaration of Independence
and its few surviving contemporary copies

01:16:28.489 --> 01:16:32.510
not because they are inerrant, but because
they are rare.

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:36.520
The reason the Declaration of Independence
on display at the National Archives is preserved

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:42.230
and protected by such extraordinary measures
is because it IS the original Declaration

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:46.570
of Independence!

01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:51.420
Doubtless an original Bible would be held
somewhere similar ñperhaps in the Vaticanóunder

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.440
similar cautionary measures.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.690
And why not?

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.320
The original Bible would be rare, indeed!

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.860
The reason the few copies of the Declaration
are similarly held in high regard is because

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:04.520
only a relatively few exist.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.820
If only a few inerrant copies of the Bible
existed, they too would likely be highly prized.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:15.440
However, anyone with access to a computer
can read the Declaration, word for word, copied

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.860
exactly from the original without copyist
error or translation difficulties, from the

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:25.860
National Archives website.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.990
Users can download an exact, inerrant copy
of the Declaration of Independence from a

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:37.920
multitude of sites, or purchase a precise
duplicate from many retail stores.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.620
All of these exact, inerrant copies of the
Declaration of Independence have not caused

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.350
a frenzy of attention over their existence.

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:49.490
There are not throngs of security-checked
patrons lining up to get their error-free

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:53.380
copy of the Declaration at local bookstores.

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.500
Purchasers online do not have their personal
information cross referenced by the Department

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.750
of Homeland Security when downloading an inerrant
copy.

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:05.980
While the original Declaration of Independence
can be said to be revered, almost to the point

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:12.020
of worship, by many Americans, the same cannot
be said of these exact copies printed from

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.290
PDF files on cheap computer paper.

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:20.100
And the same would be true of inerrant copies
of the Bible.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.660
The focus would not be on the fact that there
were copies of an inerrant Bible, but on the

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.840
fact of the inerrancy itself.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:32.450
In other words, having a copy of an inerrant
Bible would not cause anyone any surprise.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:37.200
It would be the inerrancy itself, sustained
through centuries of copying, which would

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.200
be astonishing.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.610
But, isnít that what the apologists already
claim about the Bible?

01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:48.670
That it IS already inerrantÖonce the supposed
errors are explained away through apologetics.

01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:52.210
The only thing which could have maintained
inerrancy in the Bible from the originals

01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:56.120
down through all the copies would have been
divine intervention.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.810
But apologists already claim divine intervention
in the originals so why would divine intervention

01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:04.410
in the copies be any greater a problem?

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:09.000
Inerrancy in the copies would simply support
the apologists claim of divine inspiration

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.360
and biblical inerrancy!

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.150
The only thing truly inerrant copies of the
Bible would do is perhaps put apologists out

01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:21.480
of a job!

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.800
The fact that numerous errors exist in the
Bible ñeven simple ones caused by copyistsóis

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.460
evidence that even if inerrancy existed in
the original Bible, it was not maintained

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.610
in the subsequent copies.

01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:39.980
And this is to be expected of a Bible not
under the stewardship of an omnipotent being,

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:45.760
but is evidence, instead, of the very human
production and reproduction of the biblical

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.650
texts.

01:19:52.650 --> 01:20:04.770
Most apologists insist that the Bible was
inspired by God.

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:09.100
But some acknowledge that it was written by
fallible human beings and assert these human

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:15.190
authors are the ones responsible for introducing
error into the text simply because they were

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:16.190
human.

01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:21.900
In other words, when men wrote the Bible,
they included historical and scientific error

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:25.000
because they simply did not have the knowledge
we have today.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.880
God is not responsible for this sort of error.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.820
For instance, the author of Isaiah was like
many other ancient people of his age, sharing

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.630
belief in the world as a flat, disc-shaped
object.

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:42.820
This author had no idea the earth was a sphere
and so when he wrote Isaiah 40:22,

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.460
It is he who sits above the circle of the
earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:52.790
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
and spreads them like a tent to live in;

01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:56.420
it was under this erroneous impression that
the earth was flat.

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.350
Nonetheless, the author of Isaiah was writing
under the inspiration of God, writing of Godís

01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:04.250
magnificence and awesome power.

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:08.980
God was not inspiring the author to write
scientifically accurate prose, but merely

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.150
was the inspiration for the writing itself.

01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:17.450
In a similar manner, a man may write a poem,
inspired by the love he feels for a woman.

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:22.330
While the woman and his love for her inspired
his writing, the writing itself belongs solely

01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:24.160
to the man.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:30.840
If this is true of the Bible, the very words
of Scripture can no longer be considered divinely

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:36.290
inspired and the doctrine of inerrancy is
irretrievably lost.

01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:43.870
Clearly, passages like Isaiah 40:22 which
describe the earth as a circle, a flat, disc-shaped

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:46.410
object, are in error scientifically.

01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:50.730
Few supporters of the Bibleís divine inspiration
would say that God inspired the author of

01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:56.550
Isaiah to write a scientifically inaccurate
description of the earth.

01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:03.270
However, such supporters may agree that Isaiahís
love and respect for God inspired him to write

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:09.020
this passage, in the context of the scientific
naivety of his day, merely in order to express

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:12.410
this love and respect.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:17.520
What is important is the love and respect,
not the descriptions of the earth as a circle

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:23.150
or the sky as a tent.

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:27.480
The question is raised, then, of how this
makes the Bible any different from any other

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.610
inspired literature, like a poem written from
a manís love for a woman.

01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:36.780
Such inspiration may indeed explain some of
the errors in the Bible but it does nothing

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:40.330
to evidence the Bibleís inerrancy or the
existence of God.

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:50.080
God neednít exist in order to explain someoneís
inspiration caused by BELIEF in god.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:55.780
The Bible, then, is no different from any
other religiously inspired literature.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:00.790
And if error is merely a product of the authorís
time, Jesus is recorded as having made certain

01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:02.630
errors himself.

01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:09.380
In Matthew 19, Jesus refers both to Adam and
Eve as well as to Moses as if these were historical

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:53.170
persons.

01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:58.460
The science of biological evolution negates
the statement Jesus made that God created

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:04.980
human beings, male and female, ìat the beginning,î
just as science negates the statement in Isaiah

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:06.820
that the earth is a circle.

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:12.290
Also, since there is no historical reference
to the exodus outside of the Bible, and centuries

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:16.480
of archaeological research has failed to turn
up evidence of the Hebrewís massive escape

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.880
from bondage in Egypt, Moses was, in all likelihood,
merely a legendary figure.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.710
If such errors in the Bible are the result
of human fallibility, then were these errors

01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:32.360
by Jesus due to his own scientific and historical
ignorance?

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:42.480
But as Jesus is believed to have been God
incarnate, few evangelical apologists take

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.170
this approach.

01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:51.440
More conservative apologists use a variation
of this theme.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.960
While they also acknowledge that men wrote
the Bible, they still maintain that it was

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.540
through direct inspiration of God.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.170
However, God had to work through these men
who were typically fallible and bound by their

01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:03.970
own time and cultures.

01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:09.090
So, passages like Isaiah which give an inaccurate
description of the earth were indeed inspired

01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:14.960
by God directly to reveal his magnificence
and sovereignty over creation, but the inaccuracy

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.960
itself was a by-product of having this writing
done through human beings.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:25.020
In other words, God could not, or would not,
over-ride human fallibility and so errors

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:31.650
of scientific and historical fact were unfortunately,
and unavoidably, woven into the text.

01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:36.250
How such limitations could have bound an omnipotent
beingís hand is rarely discussed.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:41.570
When it is, apologists prefer to weakly assert
that God simply did not wish to coerce the

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:47.690
writers into writing exactly what he wanted,
but settled for a close approximation.

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:51.920
How this argues for divine inspiration or
inerrancy, however, is lost.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.280
The Bible, with such human fallibilities woven
into the text, looks exactly like literature

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:14.239
written exclusively by human beings.

01:26:14.239 --> 01:26:19.500
Some apologists will try to rescue the inerrancy
of the bible by referring to a symbolic or

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:24.239
metaphoric interpretation of certain, troublesome
passages.

01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:29.730
For example, the Genesis 1 story of creation
is obviously at odds with the discoveries

01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:31.570
of modern science.

01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:37.220
Some apologists will abandon a literal reading
of the chapter in favor of one that, admittedly,

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:41.460
is probably more faithful to the original
context of the tale.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:45.900
These apologists will note that the author
of Genesis 1 was not writing a scientific

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:52.350
textbook on the origins of the universe, but
was instead authoring a polemic against neighboring

01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:58.000
ancient Near Eastern polytheistic mythologies
which competed with the strict monotheism

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.190
of the Yahwehist cult.

01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:05.960
These apologists will stress that the creation
story of Genesis was written poetically, and,

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:11.200
as 1 century Christian apologist and theologian
Augustine asserted, ìNo Christian will dare

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.710
say that the narrative must not be taken in
a figurative senseÖî

01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:22.090
The error with this sort of apologetic is
that it settles on ONE type of literature

01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:27.190
that these passages may demonstrate while
ignoring other types of literature into which

01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:29.820
these biblical stories may fall.

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:34.660
For the apologist defending the creation story
of Genesis 1, it is obvious how stressing

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.600
the poetic nature of the writing can help
deflect criticism of the tale if it is read

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.710
literally.

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:46.420
In light of modern scientific discoveries,
the creation story of Genesis 1 is absurd.

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:51.980
However, to simply conclude the entire chapter
is poetry, noting that Genesis 1 contains

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:59.070
certain poetic structures, is jumping too
hastily to a desired but erroneous conclusion.

01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:04.070
While some passages of the Bible are clearly
metaphors, meant to be read figuratively,

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:09.110
they nonetheless give clues about the Hebrew
worldview, which is frequently not a worldview

01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:14.860
consistent with modern views and certainly
not a worldview one would expect from an omniscient

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.219
God.

01:28:16.219 --> 01:28:21.531
Genesis 1, while containing metaphor and symbolism,
still contains elements of ancient Hebrew

01:28:21.531 --> 01:28:25.610
cosmology which is scientifically inaccurate.

01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:32.180
Genesis 1 is an ancient cosmology, attempting
to explain the origin of the sky, the earth,

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:39.719
plants, animals and heavenly bodies; in this
sense it is an origins myth.

01:28:39.719 --> 01:28:45.110
An apologist may try to divert attention away
from the chapterís scientific errors by claiming

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:51.070
the story was not intended to be read as proto-science,
but nonetheless, Hebrew proto-scientific ideas

01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:53.370
are embedded in the text.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:57.750
This simply cannot be glossed over by claiming
Genesis is poetry.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:02.800
The imagery used in the poem of Genesis 1
is still the imagery of a scientifically ignorant

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:09.800
ancient culture and not what one would expect
to have been inspired by an omniscient God.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.840
Certainly, if the text was divinely inspired,
this deity could have coated its message in

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:22.150
a more accurate cosmology, satisfying both
ancient and modern audiences, providing evidence

01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:25.110
of the supernatural origin of the narrative.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:30.430
As it stands, the text has all the appearances
of having originated in the scientifically

01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:37.489
ignorant mind of an all-too fallible human
author without benefit of divine aid.

01:29:37.489 --> 01:29:43.030
Genesis 1 is also a narrative, with characters,
tension, plot and conclusion.

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:48.160
It serves as religious propaganda carefully
designed to stand in opposition to other ancient

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:54.489
Near Eastern creation stories and legitimize
Hebrew religious, political, and social values.

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:59.469
The author of Genesis 1 has taken an older,
rival mythology from Mesopotamia, and has

01:29:59.469 --> 01:30:02.320
recast it in a Yahweist mold.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.900
Fragments of this older Mesopotamian myth
can be found in other books of the Bible including

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.160
Psalms, Job, and Isaiah.

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:18.090
And, if Genesis 1 was originally meant merely
as metaphor and not to be taken at all literally

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:23.190
by anyone who read the narrative, was this
important insight missed by the author of

01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:24.190
Exodus?

01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:29.820
Exodus 20:11,
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth,

01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:35.700
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested
the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.340
the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:42.910
It would seem this author wasnít aware of
modern apologetics which steer away from a

01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:47.100
literal reading of Genesis 1.

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:52.770
Many apologists using this technique however
fail to apply this symbolic or metaphoric

01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:58.400
reading to passages which hit much closer
to home, especially for the Christian.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:03.570
The empty tomb, for example, may not have
been a historical reality, but a figurative

01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:08.400
answer to critics of the early Christian movement
regarding the reality of Jesusí resurrection.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.540
Itís a rare apologist who explores to possibility
of the New Testament gospel stories of the

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:16.739
empty tomb as potential metaphor.

01:31:16.739 --> 01:31:21.660
And when they do respond, they are as foaming
at the mouth fundamentalist about the literalism

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:30.420
of the empty tomb as any creationist is about
the historicity of Genesis 1.

01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:35.680
In the end, referring to the Bible's symbolic
or metaphoric meanings does nothing to elevate

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:41.320
it to that of a divinely inspired text any
more than any other ancient OR modern metaphoric

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.489
literature can be considered divine based
on a figurative reading.

01:31:45.489 --> 01:31:52.090
It certainly does nothing to argue for infallibility,
either, at least not objectively, as the apologist

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:57.239
can assign almost whatever meaning they wish
to a figurative text and claim this is what

01:31:57.239 --> 01:31:59.110
was originally intended.

01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:04.930
The creation story of Genesis 1 for example,
an ancient Hebrew monotheistic cosmology,

01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:09.930
can be interpreted symbolically to support
any number of ideas, including a reference

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:16.530
to the Christian trinity: with God, the father,
as the center of the story, the creator, Jesus,

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:21.900
the son, as the Word through which everything
was brought into existence, and the Holy Spirit,

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.820
that which hovered over the primordial waters.

01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:30.180
For the apologist, deciding which biblical
passages are figurative and which are literal

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:49.870
is a highly subjective, and individualistic,
exercise.

01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:56.060
Some apologists will claim that reading and
understanding the Bible cannot be done alone.

01:32:56.060 --> 01:33:01.580
Reading the Bible properly requires reading
it with the assistance of the Holy Spirit.

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:07.540
As part of the trinity, the Holy Spirit is
that manifestation of God which some Christians

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.390
claim helps to illuminate their minds as they
read the Bible.

01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:14.700
The Holy Spirit leads readers to the Bibleís
truth.

01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:18.250
In the same way that the Holy Spirit inspired
the writing of the Bible by working through

01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:22.470
the minds of the authors who wrote it, the
Holy Spirit works through a readerís careful

01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:24.310
study of the Scriptures.

01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:28.860
As God spoke directly to the hearts of those
writing the Bible, through the Holy Spirit

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:33.430
he speaks to the hearts of those reading it.

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:38.410
This all sounds good to those who already
believe, but what does it really mean?

01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:42.750
How can one test whether or not they are reading
the Bible with the Holy Spirit?

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:49.630
How does reading the Bible with the Holy Spirit
independently support biblical inerrancy?

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:54.820
The Bible, so the claim goes, was already
divinely inspired during its production.

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:58.480
Apparently this wasnít sufficient enough
to get the message through and so the book

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.100
must be read with the authorís help.

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:06.510
If the Spirit had done such a poor job inspiring
the original manuscripts to be free from scientific

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:11.710
and historical error and clear enough that
most people could read the Bible plainly,

01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:16.040
what confidence is there that the Spirit can
do any better of a job inspiring understanding

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.960
of the cumbersome, defective text for individual
readers today?

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:28.660
Itís a proposal thatís virtually irrelevant
to anyone who hasnít already decided the

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:29.700
Bible is inerrant.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:33.550
Not to mention the circularity of stating
that the truth of the Bible is hidden from

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:38.219
those who donít believe in the truth of the
Bible but not from those who believe in that

01:34:38.219 --> 01:34:39.219
truth.

01:34:39.219 --> 01:34:43.340
And, thereís the fact that different people
claiming to have read the Bible under direction

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:48.489
of the Holy Spirit come to different conclusions
about the parts that cause doubt about inerrancy

01:34:48.489 --> 01:34:52.070
in the first place.

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:56.239
Does one know theyíve properly read the Bible
with the Holy Spirit if they understand the

01:34:56.239 --> 01:35:02.340
days of the creation story in Genesis 1 refer
to literal 24 hour periods or if they understand

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:07.570
the days of the creation story to be eras
of indeterminate length?

01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:12.070
Does one know theyíve properly read the Bible
with the Holy Spirit if they understand Noahís

01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:18.739
flood was merely a local affair or if they
understand Noahís flood was global?

01:35:18.739 --> 01:35:23.699
Referring to the Holy Spirit as a guide which
dissolves problems found in the biblical text

01:35:23.699 --> 01:35:41.510
is a useless suggestion for supporting the
claim of inerrancy.

01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.300
Errors exist in the Bible.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:46.780
This fact is undeniable, even for the apologist.

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:52.550
But, a number of apologists will argue, while
the Bible does contain error, these errors

01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:57.719
do not obstruct Godís inspired truth from
coming through the pages of Scripture.

01:35:57.719 --> 01:36:03.120
In other words, the Bible as we have it today
may not be a perfect re-creation of the original,

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:10.430
inerrant scripts, but it is sufficiently accurate
enough for readers to understand Godís meaning.

01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:12.570
But what meaning is that?

01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:16.760
When Jesus was asked in the New Testament
gospel of Matthew what he considered the greatest

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:20.800
commandment he answered,
ìYou shall love the Lord your God with all

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.110
your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind.

01:36:25.110 --> 01:36:28.390
This is the greatest and first commandment.

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:31.989
And a second is like it: You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.

01:36:31.989 --> 01:36:38.610
On these two commandments hang all the law
and the prophets.î

01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:43.570
The Law and the Prophets referred to in the
passage from Matthew are the Jewish scriptures

01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:46.440
as they existed in the 1st century CE.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:51.660
So, if we are to trust what Jesus said was
the inspired core message of the Bible, it

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.680
was merely to love God and each other.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:58.030
Do we really need 66 books to tell us that?

01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:03.340
It seems a terrible waste of time, energy,
paper, ink and space.

01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:08.219
If the Bible is to be sifted through merely
for this sufficient message, what use is the

01:37:08.219 --> 01:37:09.590
remaining material?

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:15.360
Itís very difficult to imagine why, in addition
to the brief, inspired truth of Matthew 22,

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:19.890
God needed to include a story about a man
sacrificing his daughter to Yahweh after a

01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:21.890
rash vow.

01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:25.320
How does that story contribute to Godís inspired
truth?

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.850
Or does it?

01:37:26.850 --> 01:37:30.950
Why include the story of Elishaís calling
down a curse upon a group of little boys?

01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:34.370
Or the number of stalls in Solomonís stables?

01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:39.150
Or God coming to kill Moses for not cutting
off his sonís foreskin?

01:37:39.150 --> 01:37:43.130
What do these superfluous anecdotes do to
further Godís inspired truth?

01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:46.390
And if they donít, why are they in the Bible?

01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:55.699
They seem more like stumbling blocks rather
than stepping stones to this ultimate message.

01:37:55.699 --> 01:38:01.270
But perhaps the inspired truth of the Bible
is a bit more than what Jesus said.

01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:06.700
Perhaps the inspired truth is more like what
is recorded in Romans 5:18,

01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:12.510
Therefore just as one manís trespass led
to condemnation for all, so one manís act

01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:17.360
of righteousness leads to justification and
life for all.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.510
This is the Christian message of salvation,
anchored in the belief that sin entered the

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:25.510
world with Adamís disobedience in the book
of Genesis.

01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:29.699
While minor errors or problems in the text
may not be too large of a distraction for

01:38:29.699 --> 01:38:35.470
the message of this inspired truth to come
through the text, historical and scientific

01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:40.740
errors of the Bible are a considerable drain
on its sufficiency.

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:45.880
If the authors of the Bible could not accurately
describe the nature of the sky, or the shape

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.830
of the earth, how are readers to trust what
these authors had to say about how one manís

01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:55.050
trespass led to the condemnation of all?

01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:59.380
If the authors of the Bible were wrong in
their description of the fall of Jericho,

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:04.449
or about a prophecy concerning Egypt, how
are readers to trust what they say about one

01:39:04.449 --> 01:39:09.030
manís act of righteousness leading to justification
and life for all?

01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:15.690
If there is no truth to the story of a worldwide
flood, what confidence is built about there

01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:19.180
being inspired truth elsewhere?

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:24.250
And if modern biological science is right,
and humanity as a species arose from common

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:30.530
ancestry, what room is there for the Genesis
story of human creation, the trespass of one

01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:36.610
man leading to the condemnation of all, and
the necessity for another manís righteousness

01:39:36.610 --> 01:39:39.870
to lead to justification and life for all?

01:39:39.870 --> 01:40:03.090
Or, perhaps we just uncovered the motivation
for apologetics.

01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:05.920
The Bible IS difficult to understand.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:12.400
It is at times unclear, contradictory and
prone to both scientific and historical error.

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:18.480
A tremendous amount of dedicated and focused
study of ancient customs, cultures and beliefs

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:23.930
is absolutely required if one is to understand
the Bible on its own terms and that is exactly

01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:29.239
what is to be expected if the Bible is the
work of numerous authors and editors working

01:40:29.239 --> 01:40:34.860
with various religious and political agendas
over centuries of time; a product of a collection

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:39.610
of books, all in turn products of their own
times and places.

01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:44.930
The Bible we encounter free of the manipulative
tethers of the apologist is the exact opposite

01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:49.500
of the Bible these same apologists claim it
to be.

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:54.160
Some may object, ìWhy canít the Bible be
both the inspired Word of God AND a product

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.710
of its own time and place?

01:40:55.710 --> 01:41:00.780
The answer, of course, is embedded in the
assertion that the words of the Bible were

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:05.910
of such critical importance that they needed
to be crafted and woven into the text by an

01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:08.000
omniscient deity.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.480
Remember what the believers have asserted
regarding the inspiration of the Bible: that

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.180
the authors working under Godís direction
were ìconsigned to writing everything and

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:22.821
only those things which He wanted.î God is
not confined to a culture or a time, according

01:41:22.821 --> 01:41:24.710
to those who believe in him.

01:41:24.710 --> 01:41:27.680
He is timeless, existing everywhere.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.900
Thus, the expectation is set that such a god
would inspire his collection of books with

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:38.460
words accessible to everyone, regardless of
place and time.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:42.820
Apologists may scoff at this idea but they
do so only because they realize the Bible

01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:50.660
simply does not fulfill this expectation.

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:55.860
Apologists provide excuses, not explanations,
for why their god did not successfully create

01:41:55.860 --> 01:42:04.390
a book ña manual, for all humankindówhich
everyone, everywhere could understand easily.

01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:09.260
The apologists will say inspiring such a Bible
would have amounted to nothing more than coercion

01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:13.870
on the part of God, not allowing humankind
to freely choose whether or not to accept

01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:16.520
the Bible as Godís Word.

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:21.699
But they fail to explain why they do not consider
the originals to have been a form of coercion

01:42:21.699 --> 01:42:24.100
for those who first heard or read them.

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:28.390
The people who wrote the first editions of
the biblical books surely did not need instruction

01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:30.560
in the language in which the Bible was written.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.670
They didnít need lessons in cultural anthropology
to understand the context of their own society.

01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:52.550
They didnít need anyone to explain strange
idioms or sly euphemisms found in the text.

01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:57.800
If an inerrant and clear biblical text amounts
to coercion, why did God allow coercion of

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:21.680
this first audience but none thereafter?

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.140
Or the apologist may argue that the Bible
could not possibly have been written for all

01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.510
humanity to understand.

01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:31.630
Doing so would be logistically impossible.

01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:35.390
It would amount to everyone having their own
private version of the Bible.

01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:38.370
But, again, why is this so?

01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:43.110
The complaint seems to be that God is limited
in his power to inspire a book that could

01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:46.840
be read and understood by virtually everyone.

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:59.210
This is the same god, so the apologists claim,
who created the universe, who breathed life

01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:12.950
into the first man, who flooded the entire
world, who rescued millions from captivity

01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:21.350
in Egypt with great miracles and who came
to earth in the form of a man, died on a cross

01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:26.750
and then came back to life three days later
to save humankind from ultimate destruction.

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:29.000
Yes, THAT god.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:34.300
It is THAT god whom the apologists suddenly
claim would not be able to inspire the kind

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:43.830
of text which would be accessible to all people.

01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:48.500
It was mentioned that some advocates for Godís
existence and the divine authorship of the

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:53.500
Bible think that expectations cannot be brought
to a reading of the Bible.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:58.500
Bringing expectations puts human constraints
on God and that simply cannot be done with

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.830
an omnipotent, omniscient being.

01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:06.320
However, these same apologists also say that
God cannot, or will not, produce an error

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:12.440
free and clear copy of his inspired text and
claim to know why.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.580
The apologists fetter their god with all sorts
of limitations saying he cannot be expected

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:23.540
to do this thing or another to assure true
inerrancy and clarity of the biblical text.

01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:27.930
God was forced to work within restraints.

01:45:27.930 --> 01:45:32.940
Apologists find the Bible the way everyone
else finds it: full of scientific and historical

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.989
errors, contradictions, and discrepancies.

01:45:35.989 --> 01:45:41.320
But because the apologist comes to the Bible
with a preloaded belief in a God which inspired

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:47.050
the text, they then craft a God around these
scientific and historical errors, contradictions,

01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:48.910
and discrepancies.

01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:53.940
The god invented by the apologist is then
used to explain why such problems with the

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.340
text exist.

01:45:55.340 --> 01:46:00.199
The claim is God is all-knowing; so why does
the Bible say the earth is a circle when even

01:46:00.199 --> 01:46:01.760
a child today knows itís a sphere?

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:07.320
Because, the apologist will say, God inspires
the use of equivocal terms in the text to

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.420
accommodate the scientific ignorance of the
original authors.

01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:16.380
The god crafted by the apologist could not
have inspired the use of a more accurate term,

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:21.430
or inspired his authorís scientific curiosity
to explore the true shape of the earth the

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:23.940
way the Greeks did.

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:29.469
Instead, the apologist claims God merely molded
his inspired word to the ignorance of the

01:46:29.469 --> 01:46:32.910
authors he was using to write his text.

01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:37.780
The apologists read Godís mind and explain
how and why he allowed the authors of his

01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:42.719
book to write the way they did, even though
at times these inspired authors introduced

01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:46.020
errors and unnecessary ambiguity into the
text.

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:49.690
But the apologists simply cannot have it both
ways.

01:46:49.690 --> 01:46:55.000
Either the Bible can and should be approached
with certain expectations created by definitions

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.530
of the god that inspired the text and of the
text itself or it cannot, and the Bible must

01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:07.910
be allowed to speak on its own very human
authored terms, including its errors, contradictions

01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:12.239
and discrepancies.

01:47:12.239 --> 01:47:14.219
Is the Bible inerrant?

01:47:14.219 --> 01:47:15.260
No.

01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:17.050
Was it ever inerrant?

01:47:17.050 --> 01:47:19.910
No one knows nor will anyone likely ever know.

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:25.170
But one thing is for certain: The best way
to approach and read the Bible is by first

01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:38.870
silencing the incessant, distractive voices
of the apologists.

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:41.340
Apologists approach the Bible in a very specific
way.

01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.969
They come to the Bible with beliefs about
it they want validated and they will validate

01:47:45.969 --> 01:47:50.000
those beliefs by any means necessary.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.800
How do apologists obscure understanding the
Bible?

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:58.040
First, it cannot be understood properly if
it is burdened with the belief of infallibility.

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:02.860
Twisting the plain words of the Bible to make
it conform with the discoveries of modern

01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:09.460
science, or by obscuring the simplest thoughts
of the biblical authors by turning them into

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:16.320
poetry or metaphor, is another way apologists
do violence and dishonor to the text of the

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.760
Bible.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.610
Postulating something for which there is no
evidence or need is certain to be a waste

01:48:21.610 --> 01:48:22.989
of time.

01:48:22.989 --> 01:48:29.250
There is absolutely no evidence that the Bible
was divinely inspired, or is, or was, inerrant.

01:48:29.250 --> 01:48:34.330
There is no need to postulate supernatural
reasons for why errors exist in the text--whether

01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:40.630
a god allowed the use of phenomenological
language, inspired equivocal terms, let copyist

01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:46.600
slips of the pen to enter the textówhen naturalistic
explanations ñwhich are successful in explaining

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:53.390
similar features in other works of literatureówork
quite well.

01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:58.270
Driven by belief in the inerrancy of the Bible,
apologists forget that the authors and audience

01:48:58.270 --> 01:49:03.510
of the early narratives were just people,
the same as anyone today, struggling to make

01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:06.199
sense of the world and their part in it.

01:49:06.199 --> 01:49:10.240
The proper way to understand the Bible is
to leave it in the space and time in which

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:11.469
it was composed.

01:49:11.469 --> 01:49:16.790
It cannot be dragged from its original contexts
into a 21st century context.

01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:20.940
Certainly, the Bible can speak to us in our
own day, whispering to us questions which

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:26.470
ran through our ancestors minds; questions
which still continue to puzzle us today.

01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:32.300
But the answers the biblical authors composed
for these questions are not what are important.

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:36.630
Indeed, many of those answers were undeniably
wrong.

01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:42.790
The universe did not take 6 days to form;
there was not a single man and woman in a

01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:47.100
garden somewhere in the ancient Near East
who gave birth to all humanity; there was

01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:52.790
no garden; there was no original sin; there
was no global flood, or mass exodus from Egypt

01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:56.340
or conquest of Jericho and the list goes on.

01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:00.100
What is important is to connect with the questions
the biblical authors asked.

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.380
Where did we come from?

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.860
How did we get here?

01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:05.390
Why is there suffering?

01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:06.980
How can we eliminate it?

01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:10.760
What does our future hold?

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.370
These questions are what link todayís readers
with the Bible; the answers the Bible gives

01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:20.010
are sometimes simply wrong but they give us
insight into the thoughts of those who came

01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:21.570
before us.

01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:25.989
We do not properly respect the biblical authors
if we assign them a secondary role in the

01:50:25.989 --> 01:50:27.719
creation of the text.

01:50:27.719 --> 01:50:33.640
The Bible exists as a bridge to another place
and time and we need to realize just how extraordinarily

01:50:33.640 --> 01:52:23.570
fortunate we are to have it.
