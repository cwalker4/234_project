00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:17.402
We've got, uh...

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:19.171
Stupid is on the move.

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.240
[ Laughter ]

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.944
I'd say he's lumbering.
You got some time.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.645
So after The President
openly took the side

00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:28.614
of a foreign adversary
in its attempt to undermine

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.750
American democracy, Republicans
see no need to either subpoena

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.253
his tax returns
or protect our election systems.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.188
So what's their solution
instead?

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:38.390
According to Texas Congressman
Kevin Brady,

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.792
who met with Trump this week,

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.494
the solution to Russian
aggression is to make the GOP's

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:44.530
corporate tax cuts,
which are set to expire

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.298
in 2025, permanent.

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:48.200
-Peace through strength

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.802
is foreign policy that works,

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.771
and it works best when America

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:54.907
has a strong economy
and a strong military.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:58.910
Under your leadership,
House and Senate Republicans

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.712
are delivering on both of them.

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:02.381
Today is about how we can

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.317
strengthen America's economy
even more,

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.285
and we think the best place

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.153
to start is with America's

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:09.521
middle class families

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.190
and our small businesses.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.558
So today, we're here to talk

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.660
to you about making permanent

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.328
this tax relief.

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:17.897
-Oh, my God, they really think

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.065
tax cuts are the solution
to everything.

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:23.669
Republicans use tax cuts
the way Guy Fieri uses butter.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.970
[ Laughter ]

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.106
And obviously, this is insane
for a number of reasons.

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.475
Not only will corporate tax cuts
do absolutely nothing

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:30.776
to deter Russian aggression,

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:32.578
they don't even do anything
to help the economy

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.747
or specifically,
worker's wages --

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:38.083
as we've already seen
with these GOP tax cuts.

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:40.852
-The financial website PayScale
has released its data

00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:44.690
for the second quarter of 2018
and found that the average wage

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.528
paid to U.S. workers is down for
the first time since early 2015.

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:52.231
Accounting for inflation,
the wages of American workers

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:55.133
have dropped 1.4%
in the past year.

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:58.537
That's despite one-time bonuses
paid by some businesses

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:00.806
in the wake of the GOP tax cuts.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.874
-That's right.
Wages have actually gone down

00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:04.610
since the tax cuts passed.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.879
Trump said the tax cuts
would raise wages.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.748
How do you explain that,
Mr. President?

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.216
-I said the word would
instead of wouldn't.

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:12.384
-Oh.

00:09:12.384 --> 00:09:13.853
[ Laughter, cheers,
and applause ]

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:16.755
That tracks. Totally tracks.

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:20.259
This is one of the keys

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.694
to understanding what's
happening right now.

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.896
The GOP establishment
and donor class are fine

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.531
with Trump's attacks
on democracy

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.966
as long as they can
enrich themselves.

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.333
They're hostile to democracy

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.603
because democracy is hostile
to their agenda.

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.638
And they think passing
another tax cut bill

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.172
and pleasing
their wealthy donors

00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:35.741
will protect Trump politically.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.343
But if there's one thing we've
learned this week, it's that...

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:40.012
-You can't protect stupid.

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.947
This has been "A Closer Look."
