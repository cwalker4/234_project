And finally, new rule,

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.671 line:0%
and I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.707 line:0%
this country needs to treat
children better.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.575 line:0%
(CHUCKLES) I know,
it's crazy, right?

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.344 line:0%
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Me sticking up for kids?

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.813 line:0%
It's like Mike Pence
fighting for gay adoption.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.249 line:0%
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.817 line:0%
Even when I was a kid,

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.320 line:0%
-I didn't like kids.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.588 line:0%
I remember being
in kindergarten, thinking,

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.457 line:0%
"These people are
such children."

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.758 line:0%
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.594 line:0%
"Why am I even here? We're--
We're drinking milk and napping,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.096 line:0%
I could be doing this at home."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.766
But a few weeks ago, I saw

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.969
that a second-grade teacher
in Arizona

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.038
had posted her pay stub,
and it went viral.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.607
Probably because she is one
of the people

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.276
we trust to care for
and educate our children.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:48.047
-And she makes 320 bucks a week.
-LOUIE: Jesus.

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.249
We pay such lip service
to kids,

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.818
"They're the future,"
"our greatest
natural ressource,"

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.286
"We'll do anything for them."

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.223
And then, we nickel-and-dime
their teachers?

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.859
If you really think children
are our future,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.428
shouldn't the people who mold
their minds make more

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:04.664
than the night manager
at Game Stop?

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:08.601
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-LOUIE: Yeah.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:14.039
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
CONTINUE)

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:18.644
There is a revolt brewing,
in the teachers' lounge...

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.048
these days, in schools
all across this country,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.482
and it's long overdue.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.985
Time's Up, meet Pencils Down.

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:27.820

(CHUCKLES)

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.963
Teachers are tired of being told
what Sarah Palin

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:40.099 line:0%
once said of a teacher,
that, "Her reward's in Heaven."

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.234 line:0%
(HEATHER CHUCKLES)

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.403 line:0%
Maybe, but the rent's
due here on Earth.

Elizabeth Milich, the teacher
who posted her pay stub,

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:58.084 line:0%
wrote: "I buy every roll of tape
I use, every paper clip I use,

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:01.454 line:0%
every Sharpie I grade with,
every snack I feed kids

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.788 line:0%
who don't have them."

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:06.993 line:0%
How do people,
even the burdened tax-payer,

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.795
justify this?
We were all kids once.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:13.066
We remember our teachers,
you have those moments
of early learning,

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.200
imprinted in your brain,
the teacher

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.837
was your first mentor,
your first role model.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.406
If you grew up in Florida,
your first lay.

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:24.477
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.313

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.353
(CHUCKLES) In West Virginia,
where the revolt started,

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:37.556
teachers were just asking
for a five percent pay raise.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.791
Not a lot.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.461
But it helps when you have
to pay for your own paper,

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:42.561
your own pencils,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.064
and now... your own bullets.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.166
(SMACKS LIPS)
Here's an idea,

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:50.169
don't give the teachers guns,
give them a living wage.

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.705
-They're--
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.574
(WHISTLING)

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.476
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:01.247
They're not asking
for the world,
just enough of a raise

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.882
so they don't have
to drive an Uber,

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.450
-three nights a week.
-(HEATHER GASPS)

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.019
Teachers, it turns out,
to drive Ubers.

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:10.189
And work as cashiers at Hardy's
on weekends,

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.859
and sell their blood plasma
to make ends meet.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.029
It isn't supposed to be
a side hustle, teaching.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.131
In Kentucky,
teachers are protesting

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.569
Governor Matt Bevin's attempt
to reduce their pension fund.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:26.438 line:0%
Bevin said the teachers have
a, quote, "thug mentality."

(AUDIENCE GASPS)

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.343 line:0%
He said, "It's about just
straight up wanting more

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.544 line:0%
than your fair share."

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.347 line:0%
So true, you know,
when I think "greedy,"

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.315
-the first thing
that comes to mind...
-(PANEL LAUGHS)

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:39.885
is a public-school teacher,
who takes the bus to work...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.388
...and spends her tax-free fund
on crayons.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.722
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.358
If we really cared about kids,

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.093
would be giving them an
education secretary who needs...

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.561
(SADLY)
...to stay after class.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.230
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-LOUIE: Yeah.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.832
If we really cared about kids,

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.933
it wouldn't be so hard
for states...

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.770
to pass laws against
marrying them.

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:00.173
That's right, fun fact,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.276 line:0%
child marriage is legal
in every state.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.110 line:0%
What?

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.279 line:0%
Yes. True.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:09.014 line:0%
In America, you don't even have
to start your own crazy religion

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:11.683 line:0%
to have sex with children,
you can just marry them.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.053 line:0%
And that's every state, not just
the waffle house states.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.857 line:0%
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:18.958 line:0%
LOUIE: Wow.

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:22.262 line:0%
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.899 line:0%
More than 200,000 children
were married in America

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.102
over the past 15 years,
some as young as ten.

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:32.137
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
-In 24 states,

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:35.007
there is no minimum age
to marry.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:38.310
It's "Me Too" for Hollywood,
but we're okay with this?

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.813
And again,
this is coming from me.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.448
Me!

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.684
Someone who has no use
for children.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.018
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.087
And don't even get me started
on babies,

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.491
no I don't want to hold
your little Roswell alien.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:54.093
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:59.331
-(PANEL CHUCKLES)
-Some people call kids,
"Gifts from God,"

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.734
I call them,
"Reasons for earplugs."

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.337
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:07.273
I don't like seeing kids,
I don't like hearing kids.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:09.241
-I do not like kids on a plane.
-(WOMAN LAUGHS)

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.643
-I do not like kids on a train.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.616
(LAUGHS) But as much
as I patently can't stand
to be around them,

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:23.122
I would rather American children
being well-educated, productive,
contributing citizens,

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:26.459
as opposed to what
they otherwise might become,

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.128
-useless burdens on society.
-(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
