00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:12.140
Time is flying by on this busy, crowded planet
as life changes and evolves from second to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.560
second.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.520
At the same time, the arc of the human lifespan
is getting longer: 67 years is the global

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.369
average, up from just 20 years in the Stone
Age.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.190
Modern science provides a humbling perspective.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.999
Our lives, indeed even that of the human species,
are just a blip compared to the Earth, at

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:49.049
4.5 billion years and counting, and the universe,
at 13.7 billion years.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:55.300
It now appears the entire cosmos is living
on borrowed time.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.100
It may be a blip within a much grander sweep
of time.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:14.330
When, we now ask, will time end?

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:25.410
Our lives are governed by cycles of waking
and sleeping, the seasons, birth and death.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.690
Understanding time in cyclical terms connects
us to the natural world, but it does not answer

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.350
the questions of science.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.720
What explains Earth’s past, its geological
eras and its ancient creatures?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.010
And where did our world come from?

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.960
How and when will it end?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.710
In the revolutions spawned by Copernicus and
Darwin, we began to see time as an arrow,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.150
in a universe that’s always changing.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.950
The 19th century physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann,
found a law he believed governed the flight

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.929
of Time’s arrow.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:19.659
Entropy, based on the 2nd law of thermodynamics,
holds that states of disorder tend to increase.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:32.219
From neat, orderly starting points, the elements,
living things, the earth, the sun, the galaxy.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:39.590
are all headed eventually to states of high
entropy or disorder.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.749
Nature fights this inevitable disintegration
by constantly reassembling matter and energy

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:52.879
into lower states of entropy in cycles of
death and rebirth.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.670
Will entropy someday win the battle and put
the breaks on time’s arrow?

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.099
Or will time, stubbornly, keep moving forward?

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.700
We are observers, and pawns, in this cosmic
conflict.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.180
We seek mastery of time’s workings, even
as the clock ticks down to our own certain

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.430
end.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.709
Our windows into the nature of time are the
mechanisms we use to chart and measure a changing

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:34.430
universe, from the mechanical clocks of old,
to the decay of radioactive elements, or telescopes

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.309
that measure the speed of distant objects.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:47.099
Our lives move in sync with the 24-hour day,
the time it takes the Earth to rotate once.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:55.049
Well, it’s actually 23 hours, 56 minutes
and 4.1 seconds if you’re judging by the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.819
stars, not the sun.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.069
Earth got its spin at the time of its birth,
from the bombardment of rocks and dust that

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.269
formed it.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.569
But it’s gradually losing it to drag from
the moon’s gravity.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:21.160
That’s why, in the time of the dinosaurs,
a year was 370 days, and why we have to add

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.220
a leap second to our clocks about every 18
months.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:37.120
In a few hundred million years, we’ll gain
a whole hour.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.280
The day-night cycle is so reliable that it
has come to regulate our internal chemistry.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.700
The fading rays of the sun, picked up by our
retinas, set our so-called “circadian rhythms”

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.450
in motion.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.910
That’s when our brains begin to secrete
melatonin, a hormone that tells our bodies

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.030
to get ready for sleep.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.480
Finally, in the light of morning, the flow
of melatonin stops.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.390
Our blood pressure spikes… body temperature
and heart rate rise as we move out into the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.560
world.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.620
Our days, and our lives, are short in cosmic
terms.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.100
But with our minds, we have learned to follow
time’s trail out to longer and longer intervals.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:41.900
We know from precise measurements that the
Earth goes around the sun every 365.256366

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.190
days.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.610
Much of the solar energy that hits our planet
is reflected back to space or absorbed by

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.250
dust and clouds.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.320
The rest sets our planet in motion.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.700
You can see it in the ebb and flow of heat
in the tropical oceans, the annual melting

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:16.280
and refreezing of ice at the poles, or seasonal
cycles of chlorophyll production in plants

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.160
on land and at sea.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.040
These cycles are embedded in still longer
Earth cycles.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.110
Ocean currents, for example, are thought to
make complete cycles ranging from four to

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.620
around sixteen centuries.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.530
Moving out in time, as the Earth rotates on
its axis, it makes a series of interlocking

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.880
wobbles called Milankovich cycles.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.490
They have been blamed for the onset of ice
ages about every one hundred thousand years.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.440
Then there’s the carbon cycle.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.550
Plants capture it from the air or the sea.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.780
It finds its way into soils or ocean sediments
as plants decay, or as waste passes out of

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.680
the food chain.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.860
It can take a volcanic explosion, or a dramatic
lowering of sea levels, to release this carbon

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.650
back into the air, often after millions of
years.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.430
The processes that shape a planet like ours
play only the smallest of roles in the evolution

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.330
of the universe.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:42.490
So to glimpse time’s broader arcs, we must
look to cycles that govern the larger cosmos.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:54.650
The reigning theory is that the universe began
in a sudden expansion of space, the big bang.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.870
With entropy uniformly low, this was the time
of the tiny, subatomic particles like quarks

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.760
and leptons stirred into a hot soup.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:13.200
Within microseconds, they combined into atoms,
setting in motion the primordial era.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.860
The universe cooled as it ballooned, growing
dim and falling into what’s known as the

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.160
cosmic dark ages.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.280
All the while, though, gravity pulled particles
together, fighting the expansion.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.610
After several hundred million years, larger
clumps of matter had drawn together.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:35.740
These isolated pockets of gas became dense
enough to heat up and ignite.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:42.890
So began the era of stars.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:53.510
In this glorious age, the universe seeded
the rich cosmic landscapes we see in our telescopes.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:01.200
Trillions upon trillions of stars lit up galaxies
all across the cosmos.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.200
The arc of this era is defined by the life
cycles of stars, which vary according to their

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.340
sizes.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.890
Stars shine because gravity crushes matter
into their cores.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:21.720
The energy released pushes outward and balances
the inward force of gravity.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:29.520
This battle between energy and gravity is
raging in stars all around the universe.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.690
But in large stars, about ten million years
after their birth, gravity begins to gain

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.610
the edge and tips the balance.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.870
When the mass concentrating in the core of
the star reaches a critical threshold, the

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.490
core collapses in on itself.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.930
The energy released in the collapse causes
the star to explode in a blast of light and

00:09:52.930 --> 00:10:07.500
debris that’s visible across the cosmos.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.220
In the wake of this supernova, shock waves
can cause nearby clouds of dust and gas to

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:20.740
collapse and ignite, to form generations of
smaller stars like our Sun.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.830
A byproduct of star formation, solar systems
form in the collapse of the surrounding solar

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.580
nebula.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.820
The life cycle of planets, especially those
in close, is tied to that of their parent

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.010
stars.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:46.250
As stars like our sun age, they grow hotter
and more luminous.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:53.589
Billions of years from now, that will spell
the beginning of the end for our home planet.

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:59.750
As raging solar winds begin to blast away
at our atmosphere, surface water will gradually

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.530
disappear, rendering Earth uninhabitable.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:13.570
Finally, the sun will begin to swell, growing
so large that it actually envelops the Earth.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:19.260
Friction with the Sun’s outer edges will
cause this once blue world to gradually spiral

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.850
inward.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.630
Unless they are large enough to go supernova,
most stars end their lives in more of a whimper

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:37.680
than a bang, as shown in this gallery of dying
stars captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:47.240
In time, solar winds push their outer layers
so far out that they blossom in spectacular

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.230
displays.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:57.110
That’s just what happened about 12,000 years
ago to the star that spawned the famed Helix

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.110
Nebula.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.160
A vast glowing ring is the dying star’s
outer layers.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:07.900
On the inside, spokes of denser gas stubbornly
resist the star’s relentless winds.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.610
The star itself is now a dim, cooling remnant
called a white dwarf.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:19.399
It’s the size of Earth, but about two hundred
thousand times more dense.

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:21.560
This is likely what’s in store for our sun.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:32.149
A distant civilization may scan it for planets,
but by then they won’t see Earth.

00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:39.180
This battle between energy and gravity repeats
in every corner of a galaxy like ours, with

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:45.589
gravity drawing gas clouds into stars, and
stars burning themselves out on a variety

00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:48.620
of time scales, depending on their size.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:55.280
In time though, as the mass of the galaxy
collects in successive generations of small

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.490
stars, it will grow dimmer and dimmer.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:07.050
Some galaxies will see a temporary rebirth,
if their mass gets stirred up and combined

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.050
with another.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.790
That’s what’s destined to happen to our
Milky Way.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:19.160
At just about the time our sun begins to swallow
our planet, any remaining Earthlings will

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:27.390
see the stars of the Andromeda galaxy looming
above the plane of our Milky Way.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:33.250
As shown in this simulation, the two are likely
to tear each other apart.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.970
If it’s a direct hit, the stars in both
galaxies will gradually join together in a

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:46.339
gigantic galactic puffball known as an elliptical
galaxy.

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:55.709
All the turbulence of the merger could stimulate
a wave of new stars being born, reinvigorating

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:01.110
the new larger galaxy.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:07.580
Dust-ups like this, in which galactic neighbors
merge, will be common as the era of stars

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.630
moves into its later stages.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:17.700
But a wholesale thinning out of the universe
is inevitable.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.780
On a grand scale, recent studies of the cosmic
expansion rate show that the universe as a

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:30.340
whole is in no danger of succumbing to gravity,
or of ending in a Big Crunch.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:39.660
In fact, over the last 6 billion years, the
universe has begun to accelerate outward.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.940
Gravity is losing its grip to an unseen force
called dark energy.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:53.120
You can see evidence of this now, out in the
huge voids of space between filaments of galaxies.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.080
These voids are like ever-expanding bubbles.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.110
Where the bubble walls touch you can see filaments
of galaxies.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.830
As the bubbles grow, the filaments will stretch
and break.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:15.870
The distance between galaxies will widen at
a faster and faster pace.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:22.200
Eventually, no matter where you are in the
universe, you will see only a few isolated

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:28.790
clusters of galaxies huddled together, with
little connection to anything else, and few

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:38.740
clues to how they got there.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:45.560
At more distant reaches of time, tens of billions
of years from now, the sky will grow darker

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.561
and darker as everything recedes away from
everything else.

00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:56.960
A good place to be, in those long twilight
years of the stellar era, is a place where

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.519
gravity and energy have forged an extended
truce.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:09.900
Perhaps a place like this: not much larger
than our planet Jupiter, a Red Dwarf is one

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.800
of the smallest and dimmest stars in our universe.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.300
They have been shown to harbor planets close
enough that their dim rays can sustain liquid

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.190
water, and life.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:31.290
Brown dwarfs and red dwarfs form the vast
majority of stars in our galaxy.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:38.380
In fact, combined, their mass exceeds that
of all the large stars.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:44.960
Because they burn so slowly, they’ll be
the final beacons of the majestic age of stars,

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:53.089
an era that will extend out to one hundred
trillion years.

00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:59.230
Even as their host galaxies grow dim, another
process will begin to transform these small

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.620
outposts.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.959
Over time, chance encounters between objects
will perturb their orbits, sending some toward

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:16.809
the center of the galaxy, and others out into
the void.

00:17:16.809 --> 00:17:23.510
In this way, galaxies may gradually evaporate,
with ever-denser concentrations of matter

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.400
accumulating in their cores.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:35.350
As that happens, the universe begins to take
on a new character.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:42.710
Welcome to the degenerate era, in which the
universe is populated by red and white dwarf

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:53.090
stars, steadily cooling, and by the charred
remains of supernova explosions: neutron stars.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.340
Even though these dead stars have used up
their nuclear fuels, they continue to produce

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.090
small amounts of energy.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:08.790
They scoop up and annihilate dark matter particles
that manage to stray into their grasp.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.549
Here is where cosmic evolution slows to a
crawl.

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:19.960
It’s expected that protons, the building
blocks of all atoms, will slowly degrade,

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:27.250
turning into sub-atomic particles that then
decay into photons.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:33.490
All the protons in existence date back to
the early moments of the universe.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:41.700
Their eventual decay will mark the end of
the degenerate era, around a billion, billion,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.880
billion, billion years after the big bang.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:51.160
That’s a one followed by 40 zeros.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.740
Our picture of what happens after that depends
on what we learn in the coming years beneath

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:04.000
the border of France and Switzerland, in one
of the largest physics experiments ever undertaken.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.360
100 meters underground, the Large Hadron Collider
was built to accelerate particles in opposite

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:18.160
directions through a giant ring 27 kilometers
around.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.860
When they reach nearly the speed of light,
scientists will bring them into ferocious

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.640
collisions.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:33.320
One goal: to define the final time horizons
of our universe, as well as the final moments

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.250
of its most persistent objects.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:43.990
Black holes, ranging from million to tens
of billions of times the mass of our sun,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.930
occupy the centers of large galaxies today.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:56.970
As those galaxies age, over trillions of years
of time, much of their mass will spiral towards

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:03.080
the center and into the jaws of ever more
ravenous black holes.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:10.179
Conceivably, these black holes could end up
weighing as much as a galaxy.

00:20:10.179 --> 00:20:18.050
But when they finally stop growing, will they
too be subject to the ravages of time?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:23.180
According to the physicist Stephen Hawking,
the answer is yes.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:29.690
He proposed a theoretical process of decay
that scientists are hoping to test in high-energy

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.950
particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:40.419
The idea is that, throughout our universe,
particles of opposite charge constantly well

00:20:40.419 --> 00:20:42.950
up in the vacuum of space.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.170
They normally destroy each other.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:51.210
But when this happens at the event horizon
of a black hole, one particle can be pulled

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.220
in while the other escapes.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:01.400
That has the effect of slowly siphoning energy
and mass from the hole.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:09.110
If this is true, then even black holes are
eventually doomed.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:13.510
But finding out for sure is not easy.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:19.260
Creating a micro black hole, it seems, will
take more energy than any Earth-bound collider

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.040
can pack.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.179
That is, unless there’s more to nature and
to gravity than we’ve thought.

00:21:28.179 --> 00:21:34.620
The key lies in whether the universe we know
is part of a more complex cosmic reality,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.540
beyond the three spatial dimensions - plus
time - that we experience in our everyday

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.410
lives.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:50.390
We may be like an insect living on the two-dimensional
surface of a pond, unaware of the deep and

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:55.980
complex reality below it.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.470
It may be possible that an unseen extra dimension
could intersect our world on an extremely

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.150
tiny scale.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:12.780
According to some scientists, when particles
collide at very high energies, the additional

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:20.610
gravity needed to create a micro black hole
could come from the extra dimension.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:27.480
They’ll know a black hole is there when
they see the shower of particles predicted

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.040
by Hawking’s theory.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:36.169
Its presence will open a brief window to a
deeper cosmic reality, while shedding light

00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:41.900
on the ultimate future of our universe.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:47.870
Based on Hawking’s theory, a black hole
observed today will take it last gasp when

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:57.169
the clock strikes 10 to the hundredth years
from now, a number known as a googol.

00:22:57.169 --> 00:23:02.610
That’s the end of the universe as we know
it.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:08.610
But look beyond that to, say, 10 to the googol,
a googolplex, years?

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:15.910
If you wrote all the zeroes in that number
in tiny 1-point font, it would stretch beyond

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.809
the observable universe.

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:25.049
Will the great arrow of time have come to
rest by then?

00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:27.840
Not if modern theories are correct.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:34.251
They hold that our universe is part of a much
larger cosmic cycle of birth and death, with

00:23:34.251 --> 00:23:40.900
whole new universes coming into being in the
space beyond our own.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:51.440
The time horizons of our universe may well
be a blip in this grander scheme of things.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.260
Back to Earth now.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:01.929
We are products of the great era of stars,
and witnesses to its great spectacles of gravity

00:24:01.929 --> 00:24:05.370
and energy.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.150
No doubt there are other beings somewhere
out there who are attempting to comprehend

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.510
the universe.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:19.070
They too may invent the idea of “time”
and develop their own theories on where it’s

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.660
all leading.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:29.280
Their discoveries - and ours – will not
survive the entropy at work in the universe,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.200
as we all go the way of the stars, and as
they give way to grand new eras in the life

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200
of the universe.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.620
And as our universe gives way to grand new
eras in the life of the cosmos.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:38.760
