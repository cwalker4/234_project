00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.800
[music playing]

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.100
- This vehicle is driving
around kind of weird,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.930
not really going in any
particular directions.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.600
So they're trying to not
be seen, avoiding me.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.300
See what's going on with them.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.470
Hey, I'm Deputy Baker
with the sheriff's office.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.770
Are you lost?

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.100
- Yeah.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.230
I was trying to
get to McDonald's.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.030
- All right, where are
you trying to get to?

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.070
- I was going to go
to go to McDonald's.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.330
But I had to go this way.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.200
- Sir, do you have ID on you?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.130
You don't have any ID?

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.070
Hold on.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.330
I'm going to go
to the other side.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.230
All right.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.670
What's your-- what's
your name, sir?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.370
- [bleep].

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.800
- All right, I'll be right back.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.100
Just hang tight for me.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.900
I don't think this guy's giving
me the right information.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.100
He may be, but he seems
a little bit too nervous.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.230
And something is just--

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.800
not-- something's
not right with this.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.930
Hey, Tracy.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.270
Step back here, and let
me talk to you real quick.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.330
I want you to be honest with me.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.170
- OK.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.100
- And just tell me the truth.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.230
- OK.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.930
- Who is the gentleman
in the passenger's seat?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.970
- What's his name?

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.830
- Tracy.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.270
- How long have you known him?

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.130
Stand over here.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.730
- Just wait right here, OK?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.100
Step out of the car, sir.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.070
- [inaudible], man.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.700
- Step out of the car.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.400
- [bleep].

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.430
- Face the car.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.930
- I need the ID of
everybody in the car

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.700
when I'm talking to them, OK?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.330
What the heck was that?

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.630
Get down on the ground.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.300
Drop the phone, and get down
on the ground, right now.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.370
Don't even pick up that phone.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.200
- Let go.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.270
- I'm going to get my taser out.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.200
- [inaudible]

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.670
- Ow.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.930
- Give up your hands, or you're
going to get tased, right now.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.730
- Ow!

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.570
Ow!

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.970
[groan]
- Put your right--

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.100
- Put your hands
behind your back.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.530
- Put your left hand
behind your back.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.970
- Tase him.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.000
- Put your left hand
behind your back.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.100
- [bleep].

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.370
- Put your left hand
behind your back.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.700
- [groan]

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.100
Stop!

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.670
- Stand up.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.700
Stay against that push
bumper, and don't move.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.900
OK, you're under
arrest for obstruction.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.270
We can get the ambulance here to
check you out, get you cleared,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.930
and then you're going
to the county jail.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.970
Do you have any questions?

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.700
Do you understand why
you're being arrested?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.400
All right.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.170
Now, I'm just thinking about
whether I'm going to arrest

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.930
your girlfriend or not.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.000
Who is she to you?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.070
- Nobody?

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.230
Don't care about her?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.030
Girlfriend?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.300
How long you been dating?

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.270
- Two weeks?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.630
How long have you known her?

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.470
- Four years.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.400
- We're not even
in a relationship.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.370
He's my friend's ex.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.800
That's how I know him period.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800
- Well, obviously, you
don't know him because you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.630
don't even know his name.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.930
She knew who he was.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.230
She just didn't want to say.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.630
She's lucky she's not
going to jail tonight.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.270
I called one of the
other guys over who

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.430
had a fingerprint scanner.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.600
It came back as wanted
for probation violation

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.370
for traffic warrants.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.700
If he had just submitted
to what it was,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.570
he would have been out
in less than a week.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.700
But now he's going to go,
and he's going to have

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.830
that warrant plus three more.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.930
- So senseless,
and you could see
