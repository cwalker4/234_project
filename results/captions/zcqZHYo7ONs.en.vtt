00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.920
Henry: &nbsp;If you have polarized sunglasses,
you have a quantum measurement device.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.639
Grant: Each of these pieces of glass is what's
called a "polarizing filter", which means

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.800
when a photon of light reaches the glass,
it either passes through, or it doesn’t.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.880
And whether or not it passes through is effectively
a measurement of whether that photon is polarized

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880
in a given direction.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.749
Henry: &nbsp;Try this: Find yourself several sets
of polarized sunglasses.

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.439
Look through one set of sunglasses at some
light source, like a lamp, then hold a second

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.529
polarizing filter, between you and the light.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.030
As you rotate that second filter, the lamp
will look lighter and darker.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.300
It should look darkest when the second filter
is oriented 90 degrees off from the first.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.320
What you're observing is that the photons
with polarization that allows them to pass

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.990
through a filter along one axis have a much
lower probability of passing through a second

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.350
filter along a perpendicular axis – in principle
0%.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.600
Grant: Here's where things get quantum-ly
bizarre.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.190
All these filters do is remove light – they
“filter” it out.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.960
But if you take a third filter, orient it
45 degrees off from the first filter, and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.329
put it between the two, the lamp will actually
look brighter.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.320
This is not the middle filter generating more
light – somehow introducing another filter

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.140
actually lets more light through.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.470
With perfect filters, if you keep adding
more and more in between at in-between angles,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.740
this trend continues –&nbsp;more light!

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.220
Henry: &nbsp;This feels super weird.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.860
But it’s not just weird that more light
comes through; when you dig in quantitatively

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.650
to exactly how much more comes through, the
numbers don’t just seem too high, they seem

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.910
impossibly high.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.620
And when we tug at this thread, it leads to
an experiment a little more sophisticated

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.630
than this sunglasses demo that forces us to
question some very basic assumptions we have

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.330
about the way the universe works – like,
that the results of experiments describe properties

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.520
of the thing you’re experimenting on, and
that cause and effect don’t travel faster

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.770
than the speed of light.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.660
Grant: &nbsp;Where we're headed is Bell’s theorem:
one of the most thought-provoking discoveries

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.810
in modern physics.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.370
To appreciate it, it’s worth understanding
a little of the math used to represent quantum

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.690
states, like the polarization of a photon.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.340
We actually made a second video showing
more of the details for how this works, which

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.799
you can find on 3blue1brown, but for now let’s
just hit the main points.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.830
First, photons are waves in a thing called
the electromagnetic field, and polarization

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.690
just means the direction in which that wave
is wiggling.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.690
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.740
Grant: Polarizing filters absorb this wiggling
energy in one direction, so the wave coming

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.920
out the other side is wiggling purely in the
direction perpendicular to the one where energy

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.209
absorption is happening.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.470
But unlike a water or sound wave, photons
are quantum objects, and as such they either

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.430
pass through a polarizer completely, or not
at all, and this is apparently probabilistic,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.349
like how we don’t know whether or not Schrodinger’s
Cat will be alive or dead until we look in

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.349
the box.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.170
Henry: For anyone uncomfortable with the nondeterminism
of quantum mechanics, it’s tempting to imagine

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.090
that a probabilistic event like this might
have some deeper cause that we just don’t

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
know yet.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.950
That there is some “hidden variable”
describing the photon’s state that would

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.330
tell us with certainty whether it should pass
through a given filter or not, and maybe that

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.920
variable is just too subtle for us to probe
without deeper theories and better measuring

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920
devices.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.690
Or maybe it’s somehow fundamentally unknowable,
but still there.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.110
Henry: &nbsp;The possibility of such a hidden
variable seems beyond the scope of experiment.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.590
I mean, what measurements could possibly
probe at a deeper explanation that might or

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.730
might not exist?

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.700
And yet, we can do just that.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.150
Grant:...With sunglasses and polarization
of light.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.200
Grant: Let’s lay down some numbers here.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.400
When light passes through a polarizing filter
oriented vertically, then comes to another

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.750
polarizing filter oriented the same way, experiments
show that it’s essentially guaranteed to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.280
make it through the second filter.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.560
If that second filter is tilted 90 degrees
from the first, then each photon has a 0%

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.060
chance of passing through.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.090
And at 45 degrees, there’s a 50/50 chance.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.870
Henry: What’s more, these probabilities
seem to only depend on the angle between the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.819
two filters in question, and nothing else
that happened to the photon before, including

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.970
potentially having passed through a different
filter.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.680
Grant: But the real numerical weirdness happens
with filters oriented less than 45° apart.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.959
For example, at 22.5 degrees, any photon which
passes through the first filter has an 85%

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.690
chance of passing through the second filter.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.959
To see where all these numbers come from,
by the way, check out the second video.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:09.959
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.120
Henry: What’s strange about that last number
is that you might expect it to be more like

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.280
halfway between 50% and 100% since 22.5°
is halfway between 0° and 45° – but it’s

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280
significantly higher.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.160
Henry: To see concretely how strange this
is, let’s look at a particular arrangement

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.060
of our three filters: &nbsp;A, oriented vertically,
B, oriented 22.5 degrees from vertical, and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.020
C, oriented 45 degrees from vertical.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.280
We’re going to compare just how many photons
get blocked when B isn’t there with how

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.190
many get blocked when B is there.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.410
When B is not there, half of those passing
through A get blocked at C. &nbsp;That is, filter

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.650
C makes the lamp look half as bright as it
would with just filter A.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.610
Henry: But once you insert B, like we said,
85% of those passing through A pass through

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.220
B, which means 15% are blocked at B. &nbsp;And
15% of those that pass through B are blocked

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.150
at C. But how on earth does blocking 15% twice
add up to the 50% blocked if B isn’t there?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.500
Well, it doesn’t, which is why the lamp
looks brighter when you insert filter B, but

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.690
it really makes you wonder how the universe
is deciding which photons to let through and

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.840
which ones to block.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.840
Grant: In fact, these numbers suggest that
it’s impossible for there to be some hidden

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.690
variable determining each photon’s state
with respect to each filter.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.080
That is, if each one has some definite answers
to the three questions “Would it pass through

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.400
A”, “Would it pass through B” and “Would
it pass through C”, even before those measurements

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
are made.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.759
Grant: We’ll do a proof by contradiction,
where we imagine 100 photons who do have some

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.390
hidden variable which, through whatever crazy
underlying mechanism you might imagine, determines

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.770
their answers to these questions.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.040
And let’s say all of these will definitely
pass through A, which I’ll show by putting

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.990
all 100 inside this circle representing photons
that pass through A.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.022
Grant: To produce the results we see in experiments,
about 85 of these photons would have to have

00:05:57.022 --> 00:06:01.590
a hidden variable determining that they pass
through B, so let’s put 85 of these guys

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.320
in the intersection of A and B, leaving 15
in this crescent moon section representing

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.720
photons that pass A but not B. Similarly,
among those 85 that would pass through B,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.500
about 15% would get blocked by C, which is
represented in this little section inside

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.560
the A and B circles, but outside the C circle.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.590
So the actual number whose hidden variable
has them passing through both A and B but

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.860
not C is certainly no more than 15.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.510
Grant: But think of what Henry was just saying,
what was weird was that when you remove filter

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:42.080
B, never asking the photons what they think
about 22.5 degree angles, the number that

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.310
get blocked at C seems much too high.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.419
So look back at our Venn diagram, what does
it mean if a photon has some hidden variable

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.530
determining that it passes A but is blocked
at C?

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.139
It means it’s somewhere in this crescent
moon region inside circle A and outside circle

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:01.139
C.

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.759
Grant: Now, experiments show that a full 50
of these 100 photons that pass through A should

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:12.650
get blocked at C, but if we take into account
how these photons would behave with B there,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.580
that seems impossible.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.580
Either those photons would have passed through
B, meaning they’re somewhere in this region

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.680
we talked about of passing both A and B but
getting blocked at C, which includes fewer

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.540
than 15 photons.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.300
Or they would have been blocked by B, which
puts them in a subset of this other crescent

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.660
moon region representing those passing A and
getting blocked at B, which has 15 photons.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.600
So the number passing A and getting blocked
at C should be strictly smaller than 15 +

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.979
15...but at the same time it’s supposed
to be 50?

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:48.639
How does that work?

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.210
Grant: Remember, that number 50 is coming
from the case where the photon is never measured

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.250
at B, and all we’re doing is asking what
would have happened if it was measured at

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:04.000
B, assuming that it has some definite state
even when we don’t make the measurement,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.360
and that gives this numerical contradiction.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.080
Grant: For comparison, think of any other,
non-quantum questions you might ask.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.021
Like, take a hundred people, and ask them
if they like minutephysics, if they have a

00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:17.250
beard, and if they wear glasses.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.430
Well, obviously everyone likes minutephysics.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.350
Then among those, take the number that don’t
have beards, plus the number who do have a

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.900
beard but not glasses.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.580
That should greater than or equal to the
number who don’t have glasses.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.860
I mean, one is a superset of the other.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.029
But as absurdly reasonable as that is, some
questions about quantum states seem to violate

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:42.919
this inequality, which contradicts the premise
that these questions could have definite answers,

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.919
right?

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.699
Henry: &nbsp;Well...Unfortunately, there’s a
hole in that argument.

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:51.850
Drawing those Venn diagrams assumes that
the answer to each question is static and

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.850
unchanging.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.160
But what if the act of passing through one
filter changes how the photon will later interact

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.230
with other filters?

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.459
Then you could easily explain the results
of the experiment, so we haven’t proved

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.790
hidden variable theories are impossible; just
that any hidden variable theory would have

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.920
to have the interaction of the particle with
one filter affect the interaction of the particle

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.009
with other filters.

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:12.709
Henry: &nbsp;We can, however, rig up an experiment
where the interactions cannot affect each

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:17.100
other without faster than light communication,
but where the same impossible numerical weirdness

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.100
persists.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.829
The key is to make photons pass not through
filters at different points in time, but at

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:24.089
different points in space at the same time.

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:25.540
And for this, you need entanglement.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.040
Henry: For this video, what we'll mean when
we say two photons are "entangled" is that

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.829
if you were to pass each one of them through
filters oriented the same way, either both

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:34.550
pass through, or both get blocked.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.749
That is, they behave the same way when measured
along the same axis.

00:09:37.749 --> 00:09:42.009
And this correlated behavior persists no matter
how far away the photons and filters are from

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:45.230
each other, even if there's no way for one
photon to influence the other.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.920
Unless, somehow, it did so faster than the
speed of light.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.029
But that would be crazy.

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.579
Grant: &nbsp;So now here’s what you do for the
entangled version of our photon-filter experiment.

00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:58.189
Instead of sending one photon through multiple
polarizing filters, you’ll send entangled

00:09:58.189 --> 00:10:03.440
pairs of photons to two far away locations,
and simultaneously at each location, randomly

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.639
choose one filter to put in the path of that
photon.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:11.010
Doing this many times, you’ll collect a
lot of data about how often both photons in

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.339
an entangled pair pass through the different
combinations of filters.

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:17.589
Henry: &nbsp;But the thing is, you still see all
the same numbers as before.

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:22.059
When you use filter A at one site and filter
B at the other, among all those that pass

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:26.810
through filter A, about 15% have an entangled
partner that gets blocked at B. &nbsp;Likewise,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.470
if they’re set to B and C, about 15% of
those that do pass through B have an entangled

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.819
partner that gets blocked by C. &nbsp;And with
settings A and C, half of those that through

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:37.239
A get blocked at C.

00:10:37.239 --> 00:10:40.850
Grant: Again, if you think carefully about
these numbers, they seem to contradict the

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.529
idea that there can be some hidden variable
determining the photon’s states.

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:49.709
Here, draw the same Venn Diagram as before,
which assumes that each photon actually does

00:10:49.709 --> 00:10:53.410
have some definite answers to the questions
“Would it pass through A”, “Would it

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.610
pass through B” and “Would it pass through
C”.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.089
Grant: If, as Henry said, 15% of those that
pass through A get blocked at B, we should

00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:06.059
nudge these circles a bit so that only 15%
of the area of circle A is outside circle

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:12.009
B. &nbsp;Likewise, based on the data from entangled
pairs measured at B and C, only 15% of the

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:17.019
photons which pass through B would get blocked
at C, so this region here inside B and outside

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:19.110
C needs to be sufficiently small.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.900
Grant: But that really limits the number of
photons that would pass through A and get

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.350
blocked by C. &nbsp;Why?

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:32.259
Well the region representing photons passing
A and blocked at C is entirely contained inside

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:33.259
the previous two.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:37.449
And yet, what quantum mechanics predicts,
and what these entanglement experiments verify,

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:42.720
is that a full 50% of those measured to pass
through A should have an entangled partner

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.029
getting blocked at C.

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:48.749
Grant: If you assume that all these circles
have the same size, which means any previously

00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:52.889
unmeasured photon has no preference for one
of these filters over the others, there is

00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:57.879
literally no way to accurately represent all
three of these proportions in a diagram like

00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:01.569
this, so it’s not looking good for hidden
variable theories.

00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:06.069
Henry: &nbsp;Again, for a hidden variable theory
to survive, this can only be explained if

00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:09.709
the photons are able to influence each other
based on which filters they passed through.

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:13.959
But now we have a much stronger result,
because in the case of entangled photons,

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:16.359
this influence would have to be faster than
light.

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:20.220
Henry: The assumption that there is some deeper
underlying state to a particle even if it’s

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.459
not being probed is called “realism”.

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:27.220
And the assumption that faster than light
influence is not possible is called “locality”.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.480
What this experiment shows is that either
realism is not how the universe works, or

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.060
locality is not how the universe works, or
some combination (whatever that means).

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.749
Henry: Specifically, it’s not that quantum
entanglement appears to violate realism or

00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:45.089
the speed of light while actually being locally
real at some underlying level - it the contradictions

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:48.179
in this experiment show it CANNOT be locally
real, period.

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:52.290
Grant: What we’ve described here is one
example of what's called a Bell inequality.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.170
It's a simple counting relationship that
must be obeyed by a set of questions with

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.170
definite answers, but which quantum states
seem to disobey.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.569
Grant: In fact, the mathematics of quantum
theory predicts that entangled quantum states

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:07.769
should violate Bell inequalities in exactly
this way.

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:11.959
John Bell originally put out the inequalities
and the observation that quantum mechanics

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.709
would violate them in 1964.

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:17.790
Henry: Since then, numerous experiments have
put it into practice, but it turns out it’s

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.269
quite difficult to get all your entangled
particles and detectors to behave just right,

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:24.959
which can mean observed violations of this
inequality might end with certain “loopholes”

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:28.369
that might leave room for locality and realism
to both be true.

00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:31.359
The first loophole-free test happened only
in 2015.

00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:35.730
Grant: There have also been numerous theoretical
developments in the intervening years, strengthening

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.689
Bell’s and other similar results (that is,
strengthening the case against local realism).

00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:45.299
Henry: In the end, here’s what I find crazy:
Bell’s Theorem is an incredibly deep result

00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:48.879
upending what we know about how our universe
works that humanity has only just recently

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:52.939
come to know, and yet the math at its heart
is a simple counting argument, and the underlying

00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:56.209
physical principles can be seen in action
with a cheap home demo!

00:13:56.209 --> 00:14:01.000
It’s frankly surprising more people don’t know about it
