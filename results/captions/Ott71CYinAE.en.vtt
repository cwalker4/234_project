00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.740
With over 14,000 votes casted on our poll
two weeks ago, you guys have decided who the

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.759
top ten clone troopers are based on their
popularity.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.099
At number 10, with 356 votes, is ARC Trooper
Fordo.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.220
Making his first appearance in the 2003 clone
wars cartoon, he was one of the first clones

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.440
to gain the spotlight among fans.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.580
Leading his men on Muunilinst behind enemy
lines and successfully destroying a massive

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.710
separatist cannon, rescuing the surviving
Jedi from General Grievous on Hypori, and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.860
fighting in the frontlines in the battle of
Coruscant, Fordo was truly one of the most

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.750
talented clones we’ve ever seen on screen.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.570
Basing on your guys’ comments, it seems
most of you voted for him simply because he

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.100
was the original, duel wielding clone BAMF.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.760
And for S.C.S 11, he voted for him from just
one scene alone, which is where we see Fordo

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.260
fighting off an overwhelming force of droids
while keeping his cool and still commanding

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.600
his troops despite being under fire.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.860
He really is one of the most talented clones
ever produced.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.839
At ninth place, with 431 votes, is ARC Trooper
Echo.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.030
Being apart of Domino Squad, we saw Echo’s
journey from his training on Kamino, to becoming

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.110
a shiney, and to finally being promoted to
a full fledged ARC trooper.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.600
He was most distinguishable by his by the
book personality, and by Rex’s hand imprint

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.649
on his chest plate.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.880
Reading your comments, many of you voted for
him due to him being a true soldier who sacrificed

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.149
himself in order to save the other clones
and Jedi who were with him on the Citadel.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.670
For Adam, he picked Echo because he feels
he’s the most relatable to him, and hopes

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.299
to see him return back in star wars Rebels.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.750
Which may actually be a possibility, as what
many people may not know, is that Echo actually

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.200
survived, and was taken by the Separatists
where he was used in experiments by the Techno

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.200
Union.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.580
He was later rescued by the Bad Batch crew
along with Rex and Anakin in the unfinished

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.869
clone wars episodes, known as the Bad Batch
story arc.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.890
After being brought back to a Republic base,
he then proceeded to lead a covert mission

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.749
to destroy Admiral Trench’s forces on Anaxes,
doing all this even in his weakened state

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.479
and with missing an arm, showing that he fought
no matter what disadvantages he faced.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.170
Characteristics of a true soldier indeed.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.390
At number 8, with 575 votes, is Clone Commando
Sev.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.190
He was apart of Delta squad, serving as their
sniper.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.330
He and his team fought in many battles, including
their mission on Geonosis where they assassinated

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.130
a high ranking Geonosian leader named Sun
Fac, and their mission on Kashyyyk where they

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.880
rescued the captured wookiee chief known as
Tarfful.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.870
Though, during this mission on Kashyyyk, Sev
was left behind and was labeled missing in

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.870
action.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.080
His abandonment was a huge emotional strain
on the rest of Delta squad.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.420
Sev’s sniping skills must have impressed
everyone, as that was one of the only things

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.030
always mentioned in your guys’ comments
about him.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.150
That, and also for his sarcastic personality
and ruthlessness.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.180
At number 7, with 578 votes, is 99.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.540
Probably one of the most unique clones ever
shown in star wars, 99 was severely deformed

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.630
from birth, and because of this, couldn’t
serve in the army and was instead left to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.350
do menial tasks.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.160
Despite his physical setback, he still had
the heart of a soldier, going beyond the call

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.351
of duty, for even a normal soldier, and sacrificing
himself to save his comrades during the battle

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.770
of Kamino.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.030
Such a heroic sacrifice seemed to resonate
among many of you, with most of you stating

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.770
that you voted for him due to his heroic death
and because he proved that anything can be

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.630
done as long as you put your mind and soul
into it.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.470
And for Noah, 99’s courage and will to fight
despite his disadvantage made him one of the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.770
characters he had the most sympathy for, who
was extremely saddened to see him get killed

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.360
on screen.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.620
At sixth place, with 628 votes, is Clone Commander
Wolffe.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.620
He served under Jedi Master Plo Koon, and
was the leader of the wolfpack squad.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.530
Despite losing his eye in a fight against
Asajj Ventress, Wolffe still continued his

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.570
service in the army, obtaining an awesome
scar and cybernetic eye after his injury.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.720
He was one of the very few clones to remove
their inhibitor chip, and he later joined

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.410
up with Rex and Gregor, where he lived within
a modified AT TE walker on Seelos.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.760
Wolffe is probably the only clone on this
list that got most of his votes from his looks

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.770
alone, as almost every comment we read that
voted for him talked about how cool he looked

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.190
with his scar and how they love his armor
and helmet design.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.849
And we don’t blame you, his phase 2 armor
is probably the coolest looking clone armor

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.290
there is.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.389
At number 5, with 690 votes, is Clone Commando
Gregor.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.560
Being one of the few to survive the brutal
battle of Sarrish, Gregor suffered amnesia

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.349
as a result, and worked as a dishwasher on
the Outer Rim world Abafar.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.340
He eventually regained his memory with the
help of D-Squad, before sacrificing himself

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.910
to save D-squad from an army of battle droids.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.659
But just like with Echo, Gregor survived the
explosion.

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.710
But instead of suffering physical damage,
it seems Gregor suffered some mental damage

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.870
from the explosion, making him a bit crazy.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.259
Just like with Wolffe, Gregor eventually removed
his inhibitor chip and went on to live on

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.710
Seelos with Rex and Wolffe.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.470
In fourth place, with 727 votes, is Clone
Commander Cody.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.189
He served under Jedi General Obi Wan Kenobi,
and commanded the 212th battalion in many

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.889
battles during the clone wars.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.629
He became well known as a very skilled strategist
during the war, and even became good friends

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.020
with Captain Rex.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.039
Unlike rex, who disobeyed order 66, Cody actually
obeyed it and ordered the execution of Obi

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.039
Wan Kenobi.

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.509
Later, when the Empire was created, Cody remained
as a commander before later adopting the new

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.419
position as an instructor on Kamino for regular
Human recruits.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.270
To whom he became disgruntled towards, viewing
regular human stormtroopers to be far inferior

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.449
to clones.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.180
Oddly enough, many of the people who voted
for Cody gave very different reasons as to

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.479
why they did.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.790
People voted for him for various of reasons,
including because they simply liked his name,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.939
because he had a hologram of Palpatine in
his hand, and because they had an action figure

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.240
of him when they were little.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.460
Its interesting how Cody had the most unique
and differentiated reasons for his votes,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.059
while every other clone on this list had a
common reason as to why people voted for them.

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.740
At number 3, with 826 votes, is Clone Commando
Boss.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.309
He was the leader of Delta Squad, the same
squad that Sev served.

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:08.009
He, along with his team, made a brief appearance
in The Clone Wars tv show, where they retrieved

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.090
the dead bodies of the Jedi killed by Savage
Opress, and informed the Jedi that there were

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.779
no other survivors.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:18.600
As we mentioned with Sev, Delta Squad that
Boss was apart of participated in many missions

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.860
and battles during the clone wars.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.159
After the formation of the Empire, Boss served
as an Imperial Commando, where he was tasked

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.659
in hunting down surviving Jedi and clone deserters.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.180
Many of you voted for him due to his leadership
skills and for simply being a boss.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.289
Also Ybok voted for him because he rarely
talked, which is an interesting reason to

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.909
vote for someone.

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:43.530
At number 2, with 1,687 votes, is ARC trooper
Fives.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.960
Just like with Echo, we saw Five’s journey
as a clone from his initial training days,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.470
to becoming a shiney stationed on the Rishi
Moon, and finally becoming an ARC trooper.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.059
He fought in many battles side by side with
Captain rex, including in the Battle of Umbara

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.270
and in the Battle of Ringo Vinda.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.550
During the battle of Umbara, Fives was prominent
in voicing against Pong Krell’s reckless

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.389
tactics, showing that despite being a clone,
he wasn’t a mindless soldier who only followed

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:09.389
orders.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.039
This independance in him later came up again
when he discovered the true purpose of the

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.379
inhibitor chips, to which he tried to tell
the Jedi but was killed shortly before he

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.159
got the chance to do so.

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:22.990
Him discovering the true purpose of the inhibitor
chips and his effort in exposing the truth

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.099
seemed to be one of the main reasons you guys
voted for him.

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:30.529
On top of that, you guys also liked him due
to seeing his entire journey as a clone and

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.999
for him standing up to Pong Krell.

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:38.080
And before we reveal the obvious first place
winner, we do have some honorable mentions.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.710
First is Kix, gaining the most votes in the
“other” option.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.379
Then we have clone commander Thorn, who almost
got on the list in tenth place, but was only

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.069
short of 8 votes.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:52.470
And finally, probably our favorite option
in the other list, is “that one guy who

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.590
died after punching a droid”.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.339
If you don’t know who they’re talking
about, it was this guy.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:05.340
We’re actually impressed how literally 10
people wrote, word for word, that exact same

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.340
phrase.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.439
And also this guy who gave an even more detailed
explanation on this clone.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:16.219
Alright, so now at number 1, with 3,480 votes,
is Captain Rex.

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:20.279
Although this is probably unsurprising to
most people watching, we were surprised to

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:25.860
see at how large of a percentage of the vote
he gained, getting over 25% of the vote.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.390
Captain Rex served under Anakin Skywalker,
and lead the 501st Legion during the Clone

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.390
Wars.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.420
Having the most screen time of any clone,
he appeared in over 60 episodes of the clone

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.450
wars, and in over 15 episodes of star wars
rebels, quickly becoming a favorite among

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.070
many fans.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.720
Being one of the few clones to disobey order
66, he helped Ahsoka Tano escape from the

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.261
gunsights of other clones, before faking their
own deaths and later splitting up to go on

00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:52.790
their own separate paths.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.579
Rex eventually met up with Wolffe and Gregor
and lived on Seelos, before joining the Ghost

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.000
Crew and helping them fight the empire.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.810
He also reunited with Ahsoka after so many
years.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.760
Although it isn’t currently confirmed, it’s
rumored that Lucasfilms will at some point

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.270
retcon Rex into being the rebel soldier on
Endor with the long white beard, bringing

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.820
him, in a way, into the live action movies.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.110
Based off of your guys comments, many of you
voted for Rex mainly because he disobeyed

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.290
Order 66 and was the clone many of you guys
grew up with.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.800
Also Zachary probably gave the best reason
for his vote for Rex.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.940
So that’s it, a top ten list based completely
off of your guys’ votes and comments.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.980
Let us know if you enjoyed this video and
wish to see more like it, with other subjects

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.110
and categories concerning star wars.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:45.720
Maybe a top ten Jedi list, or top ten star
wars planets list, and so on.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.019
Feel free to comment below what you want to
see in the future, and upvote the comments

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:51.500
that you agree with.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.680
Also let us know what you want us to change
in our format for these videos, and if there’s

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.910
anything we should add or remove.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:08.500
All feedback will be greatly appreciated.
