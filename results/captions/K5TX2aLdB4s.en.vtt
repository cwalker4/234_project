00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.210
In Season 6 of the Game of Thrones show, Olenna
Tyrell wonders if Cersei is “the worst person

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.899
[she’s] ever met” . Cersei does do a lot
of terrible things.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.039
While the wife of King Robert, she has a secret
incestuous relationship with her twin brother

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.449
Jaime, passing off their illegitimate kids
as Robert’s rightful heirs – undermining

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.210
the political system of Westeros and leading
to war.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.559
When Arya Stark tangles with Cersei’s son
Joffrey, Cersei has the innocent direwolf

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.239
Lady executed , and tries to get Arya “maimed”
or killed . Cersei kills King Robert by getting

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.480
him drunk during a hunt . Then she ignores
the king’s will to have Ned Stark serve

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.120
as regent , and instead has Ned imprisoned.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.470
That’s all in Book 1.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.680
In Book 2, Cersei has Robert’s baby bastard
Barra murdered along with her mother . Cersei

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.480
has an innocent woman, Alayaya – Ros in
the show – brutally beaten in an attempt

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.511
to hurt Cersei’s brother Tyrion . She may
also be responsible for Ser Mandon’s attempt

00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:35.579
on Tyrion’s life . In Book 3, Cersei wrongfully
accuses Tyrion of killing Joffrey , which

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.240
gets Tyrion sentenced to death.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.630
In Book 4, Cersei really goes to town – she
has the High Septon killed , has some innocent

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.560
dwarfs killed , has some innocent guards killed
, and tries to have Bronn and Trystane Martell

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.939
and Jon Snow killed.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.990
She just loves killin’ . She also sends
a bunch of women to Qyburn to be “used”

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.479
in horrific experiments , and brutally tortures
an innocent bard . She tries to frame Margery

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.880
Tyrell and others for crimes that they didn’t
commit , and makes a bunch of bad political

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.289
decisions – she stops paying the crown’s
debts , gives an expensive fleet of ships

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.200
to an unqualified pretty boy who steals them
and becomes a pirate , and she lets the Faith

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.840
Militant arm themselves , leading to the rise
of the High Sparrow.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.730
After this farce and disaster, Cersei’s
crimes catch up with her – she’s imprisoned

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.370
by the Faith, and takes a walk of shame.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.510
That’s as far as the books go so far – but
in Season 6 of the show, Cersei wreaks revenge.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.709
She blows up the sparrows and Tyrells with
wildfire, and crowns herself Queen of Westeros

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.360
– in her final form as a sort of Maleficent,
Evil Queen type.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.180
So Cersei kind of is… “the worst” . She
hurts and kills innocent people, destabilises

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.540
the country, and contributes to war.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.810
Should we call her… a villain?

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.550
A “monster” ? Is she just cruel and selfish
and stupid, a “vile … evil bitch”, in

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.620
Margaery’s words ? Or could there be more
to Cersei Lannister?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.760
In the first three books of Thrones, we only
see Cersei through the eyes of other characters

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.250
– but starting in the fourth book, we get
chapters from Cersei’s point of view.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.570
We read her thoughts and feelings, her hopes
and dreams, her past, and glimpses of her

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.879
future – so we can start to understand,
and maybe sympathise with this complex character.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.680
We can even predict how Cersei might die.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.720
Her story basically comes down to three main
themes – power, love, and prophecy.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.990
The first line of Cersei’s first chapter
says that she dreams of sitting the Iron Throne,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.000
“high above them all” . “Cersei wants
to rule” – she “lusts for power with

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.299
every waking breath” . And it’s a particular
kind of power that she wants.

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.750
People like Stannis and Robert Baratheon and
Robb Stark have power that you can see – they

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.670
wear crowns and swing swords and lead armies,
and everyone knows that they’re in charge

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.129
. In contrast, people like Varys and Littlefinger
and Olenna have a more subtle kind of power

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.220
. They don’t wear crowns or swing swords
or lead armies – instead, they have secrets,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.349
spies and schemes . Their influence is invisible
– but very significant.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.470
Varys runs a conspiracy, Littlefinger causes
war, and Olenna kills King Joffrey and grows

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.490
the power of her house.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.610
Without anyone even knowing it, these three
are some of the most powerful people in Westeros

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.100
. But Cersei isn’t interested in this subtle
kind of power.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.590
In the show, Littlefinger tells Cersei that
“Knowledge is power” – but then Cersei

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.210
demonstrates, in her words, that “Power
is power” . She doesn’t want to influence

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.180
events from the shadows, she wants people
to know she’s in charge.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800
She wants to sit the Throne, and for “Great
lords and proud ladies” to kneel before

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
her.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.250
These ideas about visible power and pride
are at the core of Cersei’s personality,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.820
and they seem to have mostly come from Cersei’s
father, Tywin.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.910
Tywin was Cersei’s only parent growing up
– after her mother Joanna died giving birth

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.180
to Tyrion.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.110
And Tywin is obsessed with family legacy – with
Lannister power and pride . He says “We

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.550
must demonstrate the power … of Casterly
Rock for all the realm to see” . These ideas

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.510
had a big impact on Cersei . She often thinks
on the lessons Tywin taught her . And after

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.650
Tywin dies – killed by Tyrion – Cersei
thinks of herself as Tywin’s heir . She

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.630
wants to be seen as the inheritor of his legacy
, and she tries to act as he would . Thing

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.630
is, Tywin was brutal.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.500
He’s responsible for some of the worst atrocities
in Westeros – the extermination of the Reynes

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.800
of Castamere , the sack of King’s Landing
, Clegane’s raids in the riverlands , the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.500
Red Wedding – not to mention his cruel treatment
of Tyrion, and Tysha, and others.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.210
The lessons Tywin taught are barbaric – stuff
like “Never wound a foe when you can kill

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.930
him” , and “The only way to keep your
people loyal is to make [them] fear you”

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.290
– that people are tools to be used , and
that love is worthless . Cersei follows Tywin’s

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.650
cruel example, and in some of her darkest
moments, like when she tortures an innocent

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.410
bard, or thinks about wiping out all the ironborn,
she tells herself that these things are okay,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.950
because it’s “what [Tywin] would have
done” . So a lot of Cersei’s brutality

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.380
in her pursuit of power and pride comes from
the lessons Tywin taught her.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.130
But there’s a deeper conflict behind all
this.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.870
Cersei thinks of herself as Tywin’s “only
true son” , “as Lord Tywin with teats”

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.350
. There’s a tension here – because Cersei
Lannister is a woman.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.590
There are powerful women in Westeros.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.430
Look at Olenna Tyrell, Asha, Catelyn, Sansa,
Arya, Daenerys, Visenya and Rhaenys.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.180
But Westeros is a patriarchal medieval society,
which means unless you’ve got dragons, women

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.670
usually aren’t allowed to hold direct power
in their own right.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.130
Some women hold subtler kinds of power like
Olenna – but Cersei isn’t allowed to be

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.860
powerful in the direct, visible way that Tywin
is powerful.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.060
She can’t sit the Throne as Hand of the
King like Tywin.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.080
She can’t hold a war council like Tywin,
or lead an army like Tywin.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.060
When Tywin speaks, “men obey” – but
when Cersei speaks, people often contradict

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.930
her, or refuse her, they “push her aside”
– because, Cersei says, she’s a woman

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.700
. And this deeply frustrates Cersei.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.530
She is desperate to be the heir Tywin wanted,
but she “lack[s] the cock” . Cersei constantly

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.541
broods on the injustice of being “excluded
from power on account of her sex” . She

00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:44.180
recounts how when she was a child, Cersei
and her twin Jaime looked so alike that no

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.250
one could tell them apart.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.400
But they were treated “so differently”
– Jaime was trained “to fight with sword

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.530
and lance”, while Cersei was taught to smile
and please.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.340
Jaime was “heir to Casterly Rock”, while
Cersei was to be married off to some lord.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.460
Jaime’s fate was “glory and power”,
while Cersei’s was just marriage and childbirth

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.210
. Cersei often wishes that she was born a
man , because if she was a man, she “could

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.210
rule [the] realm in [her] own name” , and
fight her enemies with a sword.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.430
But, she says, “the gods in their blind
malice had given her the feeble body of a

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.400
woman” . Cersei does use her sex to her
advantage sometimes – she uses seduction

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.230
to influence people like Jaime and Lancel
and Osney . But she never really works out

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.669
the kind of subtle power that makes women
like Olenna so influential.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:38.760
In fact, Cersei hates Olenna – calls her
a “disgusting old crone” , calls Margaery a "whore",

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.760
and murders her in the show.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.460
And Brienne,
another powerful woman, Cersei calls “a

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.730
huge, ugly, shambling … creature” “dressed
in man’s mail”.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.830
She calls Princess Elia Martell “feeble
… with black eyes and a flat chest” , calls

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:58.560
Lady Lysa Arryn “a cow” , and calls septas
“wrinkled cunts” who “are probably praying

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.640
for a good raping” . Cersei not only fails
to emulate other powerful women – she hates

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.990
them, and is cruelly critical of their female
bodies.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:14.320
Cersei’s like, a self-hating woman, a female
misogynist – and this is one of many contradictions

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.280
in Cersei’s personality.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.920
She is desperate for power and pride like
her father, but she’s deeply frustrated

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.980
by the limitations imposed on her as a woman.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.180
Cersei is also frustrated in her attempts
to love.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.070
Her mother died when she was young, and her
father Tywin was often “away in King’s

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.190
Landing” . She never had many friends – there
were “bedmaids and companions”, but “few

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.481
lasted very long” . Cersei’s closest relationship
was with her brother Jaime – they’d play

00:09:43.481 --> 00:09:49.150
in Casterly Rock as children, and from a young
age they started to experiment sexually . When

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.290
a maid “caught them at it”, the twins
were separated and chastised – because,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.590
y’know, incest.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:59.100
But the message to Cersei here was that her
most intimate relationship was something seen

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.770
as shameful and wrong, something she had to
hide . For a while, there was hope that Cersei

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.680
might have a more socially acceptable relationship
– cause Tywin promised that Cersei would

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.540
marry Prince Rhaegar , the son of King Aerys
Targaryen.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:19.100
For years, Cersei was happy and excited about
the prospect of marrying Rhaegar – he was

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.720
“beautiful” and sensitive and strong,
a dragon prince . Cersei dreamed of being

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.220
his queen . But on the day Cersei was promised
she’d be betrothed to Rhaegar, Aerys refused

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.780
the match – and Cersei didn’t get to marry
the prince.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.920
She felt heartbroken and betrayed – a memory
that still hurts all these years later . Cersei

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.810
was then told she’d marry someone “better”
instead , but the man she ended up with was

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:47.300
Robert Baratheon – the man who killed Prince
Rhaegar . At first, Cersei was optimistic

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.070
about this new husband – but on their wedding
night, when they first had sex, Robert drunkenly

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:58.180
called Cersei “Lyanna” . Lyanna Stark
was the sister of Ned, and died giving birth

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.730
to Jon Snow.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.320
Robert loved Lyanna – and never could let
go after she died.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.650
As Cersei says in the show, Lyanna “was
a corpse” and Cersei “was a living girl”

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:14.010
but Robert loved Lyanna more than her . Cersei
came to hate Robert . She hated his drinking

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.750
, and his infidelity , and his irresponsibility
, and that he’d hurt her sometimes . And

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.940
so Cersei secretly continued her relationship
with Jaime.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.810
Cersei says that she and Jaime “are more
than brother and sister”.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.800
They “are one person in two bodies”.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.920
They “shared a womb together” and when
he is in her, she feels “whole” . The

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.220
incest aspect is pretty icky here, and their
relationship is messed up in other ways too.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.130
Cersei lies and manipulates Jaime , and cheats
on Jaime , and apparently only loves him to

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:50.040
the extent that he looks like her – does
Cersei really love Jaime, or does Cersei just

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040
love Cersei?

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.320
It’s a dysfunctional relationship – but
it’s the realest love that Cersei’s ever

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320
had.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.120
Jaime is there for Cersei , fights for Cersei,
and is the father of her three children.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:07.040
Cersei dreams of loving Jaime openly, of living
with him as husband and wife, with their kids

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.850
. But, because of the incest, and because
of Cersei’s marriage to the king, she can

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.130
never openly be with the person she loves.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.210
Her whole relationship history is a series
of frustrations and denials – she wants

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.750
Jaime, she can’t have him.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.170
She wants Rhaegar, she ends up with Robert.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.330
In the same way that Cersei’s denied the
power and pride she desires, Cersei’s also

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.110
denied love.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.430
And these frustrations feed much of her cruelty
throughout the series.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.200
But there’s one more important theme to
cover – prophecy.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.130
When Cersei was ten years old, on the same
day she hoped to be betrothed to Prince Rhaegar,

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.800
she and some friends entered the tent of Maggy
the Frog.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.630
Maggy was a witch, a fortune-teller, so Cersei
marched in and demanded to hear her future.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.700
Maggy granted three questions.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.100
So Cersei asked when she’d marry Prince
Rhaegar, and Maggy said “Never” – that

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.720
Cersei would marry “the king” . Cersei
asked if she’d be queen, and Maggy said

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:09.400
Cersei will be queen – “until there comes
another, younger and more beautiful, to cast

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.890
[Cersei] down and take all that [she] hold[s]
dear” . Cersei asked if she and “the king”

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.450
would have children, and Maggy said the king
will have sixteen children, and Cersei will

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:25.260
have three . “Gold shall be their crowns
and gold their shrouds,” Maggy said.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.230
That’s as far as the show goes, but in the
books, Maggy continued, and added that when

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.510
Cersei’s “tears have drowned [her], the
valonqar shall wrap his hands about [her]

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.850
pale white throat and choke the life from
[her]” . Maggy also prophesied the death

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.970
of Cersei’s friend Melara . Then the girls
left.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.450
So what does all this mean?

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.589
Well, Maggy said that Cersei won’t marry
“the prince”, she’ll marry “the king”,

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:53.060
and at first, Cersei thought this meant she’ll
marry Prince Rhaegar after he becomes King

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.150
Rhaegar . But that never happens – Rhaegar
is killed, and “the king” Cersei marries

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.150
is Robert.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:04.080
Maggy’s also correct about Cersei’s children
– Robert has sixteen bastards, including

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.460
Gendry and Barra and Mya Stone, while Cersei
has Joffrey Myrcella and Tommen with Jaime.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.980
And Cersei’s friend Melara does die – after
Maggy’s prophecy, Melara drowns in a well

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:21.530
. In fact, it’s strongly implied that Cersei
pushed Melara , killed her young friend – partly

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.279
because she thought Maggy’s prophecy wouldn’t
come true if no one talked about it . So at

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:32.120
ten years old, this was Cersei’s first murder
– and it was motivated in part by fear of

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.780
Maggy’s prophecy.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.130
Cersei is haunted by Maggy’s words for the
rest of her life.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:43.300
Maggy accurately predicted Cersei’s husband
and children, and the death of Melara , so

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.570
Cersei’s afraid the other parts of the prophecy
will also come true – the gold shrouds,

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.660
the younger more beautiful, and the valonqar.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.480
The gold shrouds suggest that Cersei’s children
will die.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.610
The younger more beautiful bit suggests that
another woman will cast Cersei down.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.500
As for the “valonqar” that will “choke
the life from [her]”, valonqar means “little

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:11.380
brother” , so Cersei believes that her younger
brother Tyrion will try to kill her . Maggy’s

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.810
prophecy threatens everything that Cersei
cares about most – her children, her power,

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.230
and her life.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.520
So she tries desperately to avert the prophecy
. She thinks Tyrion is the valonqar, so she

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.110
tries to have him killed . She believes Margaery
is the younger more beautiful one, so she

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.050
tries to get her killed by framing her for
adultery . And she does everything she possibly

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.010
can to protect her children – but it’s
never enough.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.390
Joffrey is murdered with poison and dies at
his own wedding.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.930
Her daughter Myrcella is sent to Dorne by
Tyrion, and is attacked in the books, dead

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.180
in the show.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.520
Tommen is married to Margaery, who Cersei
feels is taking him away from her – and

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.920
he ends up committing suicide in the show
– he’s still alive in the books, but probably

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.390
not for long.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.880
So despite Cersei’s best efforts, her children
are taken from her, one by one, in golden

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:07.029
shrouds like Maggy predicted . Despite all
her power, she’s unable to protect the ones

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:12.420
she loves . Her attempts to protect herself
by killing Tyrion also fail, and her attempts

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:19.060
to protect her power by framing Margaery totally
backfire, getting Cersei locked up and humiliated.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.130
The more she fights, the worse things get,
and in Feast, Cersei spirals into fear and

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:30.820
paranoia , desperation and delusion , violence
and cruelty . She sees “dwarfs in every

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.440
shadow”, and makes “foes of friends”
. She convinces herself that Tyrion and Margaery

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:41.550
are evil schemers out to get her . She declares
she’d kill all the common people in Westeros

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.680
“if that was what it took to keep [Tommen]
safe”.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.320
She’s a terrible ruler.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.600
Cersei becomes everything she hated about
Robert.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.330
She drinks too much, and cheats on Jaime,
and makes dumb decisions – Cersei even has

00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.500
sex with a woman and hurts her in bed, only
to pretend the next morning it “never happened”

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.970
, exactly like Robert . In her desperation
to protect her power and her children and

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:11.199
her life, Cersei’s choices get more extreme
until she “destroy[s] herself” politically

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:17.429
. Ironically it isn’t Maggy’s prophecy,
so much as Cersei’s fear of the prophecy

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:19.530
that causes her downfall.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.760
And prophecies are often like that in Thrones
– “The more you try to avoid them, the

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.390
more you [make] them true” . And the truth
of Maggy’s prophecy is not what Cersei thinks.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.870
Maggy said that Cersei will be queen “until
there comes another, younger and more beautiful,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.840
to cast [Cersei] down and take all that [she
holds] dear”.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.440
Cersei thinks this is Margaery, who is younger,
and arguably more beautiful . But Margaery

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.850
probably won’t be the one to cast Cersei
down – she’s dead in the show after all.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:55.600
A more likely queen to cast Cersei down is
Daenerys, now sailing to take Cersei’s throne.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.450
Dany is younger and said to be more beautiful
– so she could perfectly fit Maggy’s prophecy.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.910
But there’s also another cool possibility
in Brienne, the one who takes Cersei’s dear

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.550
Jaime from her.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.350
Brienne is younger than Cersei.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:13.870
But she isn’t more beautiful – in fact
in the books, Brienne is very ugly – so

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:19.120
ugly that she’s called “the Beauty”
as a cruel sarcastic joke . But some fans

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.160
argue that Brienne has a metaphorical inner
beauty – her heroism, loyalty and kindness.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.059
Which does sound a bit lame and cliché, but
it could make sense for Maggy the Frog.

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:35.000
Maggy in the show looks like a sexy Halloween
witch, but Maggy in the books is very ugly

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.020
. Maybe she’d want to teach vain young Cersei
a lesson by referring to a woman’s inner

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.200
beauty . Also, Catelyn thinks that Brienne’s
eyes are “beautiful”, and she thinks that

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.750
just after saying she’d like to wrap her
hands around Cersei’s “white throat”

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:56.270
and choke her – almost the exact wording
of Maggy’s valonqar prediction.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.910
So there’s definitely some connection here
between Brienne and Maggy’s prophecy.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.990
But Daenerys might still be a better fit for
the person to cast Cersei down.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:10.030
Either way, all of Cersei’s efforts against
Margaery were probably pointless, and only

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.650
served for Cersei to screw herself over.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:18.240
Cersei is also probably wrong about the valonqar
– the “little brother” who will kill

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240
her.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.880
It’s true that Tyrion threatens Cersei – and
thinks he would like to strangle her . But

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.820
there’s a different possibility that could
be way more dramatic and cool – many readers

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.530
believe that the “little brother” who
will strangle Cersei is Jaime.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.580
Jaime is Cersei’s other younger brother
– he came out of the womb right after Cersei

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.280
did . They’ve been lovers almost all their
lives, but while Cersei grows ever more cruel

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.620
and crazy , Jaime in the books takes a different
path.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.850
After losing his hand, Jaime questions his
identity , and starts to change , from the

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.580
arrogant selfish Kingslayer, a man with “shit
for honor” , into someone nobler, someone

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.240
beginning to seek redemption . He questions
his relationship with Cersei until finally,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.650
at the end of Feast, he rejects her entirely,
burning a letter Cersei sent begging for help

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:15.000
. Maybe Jaime will finally realise that his
twin has become a monster.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.660
Maybe it’ll be up to him to end her reign
of terror.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.580
In Season 6 of the show, Cersei destroys the
Sept of Baelor with wildfire.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.540
And there are a lot of hints that she’ll
do something similar in the books – Cersei’s

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.820
often associated with wildfire , and she knows
how to use it . But in the books, she probably

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.470
won’t just blow up the Sept like she does
in the show – in Book 2, we’re specifically

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:43.730
told that wildfire is removed from beneath
the Sept . So book-Cersei will do something

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.650
else with wildfire – something far more
dramatic.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:53.500
Cersei’s interest in wildfire reminds Jaime
of the Mad King Aerys . Aerys was a cruel

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.350
and unpredictable ruler, and towards the end
of his reign, with Robert’s Rebellion about

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:03.870
to usurp him, Aerys had caches of wildfire
placed “all over King’s Landing” – planning

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.640
to burn down the whole city and everyone in
it, leaving only ashes for Robert to rule

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.610
over . He would have got away with it too
if it weren’t for Jaime, who killed the

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.690
Mad King and his pyromancers – earning him
the name Kingslayer.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:23.440
But thing is, a lot of Aerys’ wildfire is
still down there beneath King’s Landing.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:29.340
Maybe Cersei will use this wildfire to do
what Aerys attempted years ago – to destroy

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.090
King’s Landing and everyone in it.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.960
This could go down when Daenerys Targaryen
– or maybe Aegon in the books – attacks

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.050
the city.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.840
Cersei’ll realise she can’t beat the invaders,
but she won’t want to surrender.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.179
As we saw at the Battle of the Blackwater,
Cersei would rather die than be captured by

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:53.130
enemies . And with her back against the wall
and her defeat at hand, all her fury and frustration

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:59.020
will come to boil – all the slights on her
pride and power, her exclusion due to her

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.370
sex, the denial of her loves, her fear over
prophecy, her grief for her children, all

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.040
that pain will light a fire.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.009
In Book 1, Cersei asks “what of my wrath,
Lord Stark?”

00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:17.860
. Game of Thrones is full of characters who
fight and bleed for what they believe in – Robb

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.890
Stark wars to avenge his father, Daenerys
conquers for her throne, Jon Snow fights to

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.030
protect the realm.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:29.540
But Cersei has never gotten the chance to
fight, to express her desires with action.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:34.910
She’s always had to wait, to play a role
– “the dutiful daughter”, the “bride”,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.910
the “wife”.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.420
She’s “suffered Robert’s drunken groping,
Jaime’s jealousy, Renly’s mockery”.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.880
She’s “contended with Jon Arryn, Ned Stark,
and [Tyrion], all the while promising herself

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.020
that one day it would be her turn” . But
her turn never comes.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.460
She never gets a firm grasp on power.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.840
She never gets to openly love.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.620
And of all her children die.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:05.100
So in the end, maybe Cersei will finally express
“[her] wrath”, her rage from all these

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.080
years, in full, the only way she can.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.470
She will set off Aerys’ wildfire to burn
down King’s Landing, to destroy everyone

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.820
who’s ever defied her.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.700
And it’ll be up to her twin Jaime to intervene.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.620
Just as he killed Aerys to save King’s Landing
before, he’ll be forced to kill his twin

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.870
Cersei.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:31.770
He will “wrap his hands about [her] pale
white throat and choke the life from [her]”.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.480
One of Jaime’s hands is gold so he might
strangle her with the Hand of the King necklace

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:42.440
that Tyrion used to kill Shae – the links
of the chain are hands, and we know Cersei

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:47.730
has the necklace in Feast , and Jaime has
thought about strangling a woman with a necklace

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:54.150
before . And in a Season 7 trailer, Cersei
stands on a part of Westeros called the Neck,

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.720
while Jaime stands near a region called the
Fingers.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.790
So the hints are all here for Jaime to strangle
Cersei to death.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:09.050
Jaime will kill his lifelong lover, his other
darker half – in an attempt to save the

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.270
city from wildfire again.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.980
But this time, he’ll be too late.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.070
Cersei and Jaime “came into this world together”
– and both of them believe that they’ll

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:26.830
die together . So as Jaime chokes his twin
to death, the wildfire will rise around them,

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:32.200
killing them both, leaving only the ashes
and burned-out throne room we’ve seen in

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:40.010
visions . In her desperate greed for power
and love , Cersei will destroy her Throne,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:46.960
and her love, and herself .
Thanks for watching.
