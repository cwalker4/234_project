Dino had one older brother William Alfonso born in Nineteen and 16

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
They called [Bill]

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.899
Now this is a picture of dean Martin and his parents years later

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.059
the coach antes only spoke Italian at home and

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.260
Young Dino

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.879
Didn't learn to speak English until he started elementary school

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.559
he said that the kids often made fun of his broken English and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.310
He was self-conscious for years of the way he spoke

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.159
The in once said that he was very proud of his Italian heritage

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.579
That's who I am he said

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.579
Dino and Bill attended Grant Elementary School

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:34.859
They were always neatly dressed and well cared for as their dead made a good living as a barber

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.569
the Brothers attended Steubenville High school and

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.520
by the tenth grade

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.589
Dino had decided that he knew as much as his teachers did

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.350
So he quit school to go to work

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.859
He tried several menial jobs before becoming a stock boy and a tobacco store

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.140
Now the store turned out to be a front for illegal gambling

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.909
activities in the rear

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.468
Dino quickly became involved in the backroom activities

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.289
Anything to make money?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.288
He even tried boxing as a welterweight

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.340
making anywhere from ten to [tWenty-Five] dollars about

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.589
He was so poor. He said that he couldn't even afford the tape to wrap his hands in and busted up [his] knuckles

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.599
Dean said he fought 12 bouts and won all of them

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.569
Except 11 in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.590
Reality of course he actually won more fights, and he lost

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.950
But telling the truth was not near as funny

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.309
While hanging around Matt clubs with friends he discovered that he [could] sing

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.569
His friends would encourage him to sing for them after [hours]

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.040
And he soon [began] saying with local bands that were close to home

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.000
at

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.500
17 he [was] singing with their ernie [Mackay] orchestra?

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.810
But he was soon spotted by Cleveland Orchestra leader Sammy watkins

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.709
while toured with the Sammy Watkins ban

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.269
Deer in 1938 through 1940 he was going by the name of [Dino] Martini

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.289
[his] been said that it was sammy watkins that suggested the name Dean Martin

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.870
while singing with the Sammy Watkins Orchestra Dean meets

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.540
Elizabeth and McDonald

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120
Everybody called her bit

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.858
They soon fell in love and made on the 2nd of October

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.359
1941

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:50.009
Soon after their marriage dean received his draft noticed. He served a year stateside

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.839
before being assigned 4f because of a double hernia

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.229
He received believed as a child

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.749
He immediately went back on the road with the sammy watkins fan

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.900
Dean was hardly ever at home

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.780
always on the Road and

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.409
Spent most of his money that he made party

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.349
on June the 29th

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.388
1942 a year after their match their first child

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.269
Stephen Craig Martin was born

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.079
the next year in 1943

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.719
dean got an offer to play the famous real bumble room in May and

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.938
He was replacing frank sinatra who had canceled his engagement

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.079
Now this was the first time that dean had met his lifelong friend to be frank Sinatra

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.150
Martin was now making good money and sent for beatty and his son craig to come and join him in New York

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.599
the next year March 16th

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.449
1944 Beatty and Dean Had a daughter Claudia Dean Martin

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:11.158
That same year then we'll meet a new comic by the name of Joey levites who?

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.369
was going by the name of Jerry Lewis

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.500
They having to meet in a coffee shop at the Belmont Plaza hotel and liked each other immediately

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.279
and they actually become [friends], but they never even thought about

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.240
performing together

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.079
One was a singer and the other was a comic

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.109
two years later both by Coincidence

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.629
Was playing at the Havana?

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.969
Madrid Club in New York

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.839
It was the first time that they had tried a routine together

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.839
Dean would sing and Jerry would heckle him the audience loved it

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.680
but still they continued performing separately a

00:05:53.379 --> 00:06:00.119
few months later Jerry persuaded skinny D'Amato who [ran] the 500 Club in Atlantic City

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.848
To give his friend dean a change

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.789
Together they were great

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.279
[19-Year] Old Jerry Lewis said of the 29 year old Dean Martin

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.719
That he was the spine and strength of what Martin and Lewis was

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.559
Even though he said I got all the credit

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.199
Now by this time dean invade his third child Barbara Gayle was born on April 11th

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.699
1945

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.119
Even though Dean was making money. He was still spending most of it party

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.609
Betty had finally had enough of New York and dean never being at home

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.399
She had already moved back to her parents and then later on to his as home

She was one year old when dean and betty divorced after [eight] years of marriage

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:21.629
Betty had learned that dean was involved with 22 year old, Orange Bowl queen and Model [dorothea] jean Vickers

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240

Jerry will say years later that Jeannie was the best thing that ever happened to dean Martin except for me of course

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:48.479
after Betty's divorce from Dean the once beautiful high school athlete

numerous television appearances and nightclub acts

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.699
the money that dean was sending beatty each month for her and their children she was going through and

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.819
moving place to place she became so

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:36.390
unstable that Martin filed for custody and the three girls moved in with Dean and Jeanie

Martin Lewis called it quits at the Copacabana nightclub in New York City

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.350
There are lots of reasons for the [breakup]

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:59.019
For one g and his wife [patty] were very close friends with Dean's first wife betty that didn't help

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.769
Whatever the reasons for the [to] party they both left with hard feelings

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:09.789
It's been said the two will not speak for 20 years

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:14.079
however in 1960 four Years after the breakup

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:19.809
Both were performing their separate acts at the sands hotel in Las Vegas

00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:23.049
When Jerry caught the tail end of Dean's act?

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:28.929
Dean invited him on stage, and they joked around for about 15 minutes in

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.939
1976 Martin made a surprise appearance set up by Frank Sinatra on

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.959

Lewis said they had more money donated that day and they ever had and

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:52.179
They've renewed their friendship

00:10:52.939 --> 00:11:00.189
after the Martin and Lewis breakup dean began recording with capitol records and in 1958 he

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:04.748
started with Marlon Brando [hogue] lang and Montgomery clift

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.629
Now cliff tried to help dean during the making of the young lines

00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:17.719
So much, so that he never forgot and when Martin was [theming] the matt helm series in

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.879
1966 he insisted there be a part per [Montgomery] clift

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.709
when no producer wanted cliff because of his drug habits

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.110
unfortunately Montgomery clift passed away before filming started

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:36.199
after [Young] [lions]

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.320
Martin starred with friend John Wayne and Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo in

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:44.940

1960 it was ocean's Eleven filmed in Las Vegas

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:57.019
That started his association with the rat pack Frank sinatra Sammy Davis, Jr.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.300
Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.050
the Rat pack hit Las Vegas by storm

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:10.760
Their nightclub act was sold out every night and their wild partying would usually continue until dawn

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.560
Dean would usually

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.959
Excuse himself to his bedroom as he loved golf so much

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.649
He had to get to the golf course early

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.969
the Vegas Rat Pack Act will last until

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
1965 in

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:34.129

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.760
1974

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.229
His theme song was Martin's hit record in

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:47.639
1964

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.818
Everybody loves somebody sometime

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.110
Initially dean didn't want to do the show

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:58.789
He wanted [to] continue making movies and doing nightclub acts

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:04.609
He requested an outrageous fee, and he said he didn't want to rehearse

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.549
To his surprise they accepted

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:13.578
He never knew who his guest star was going to be until he opened the door

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:18.679
it was as much of surprise to dean as it was to his audience the

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.350
[show] was a major hit

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.938
Although dean pretended to be intoxicated on each show

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.459
Most of the time it was apple juice and not whiskey

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:36.629
Although he was at the top of his career at [that] time things were not going. Well at home as

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.209
His daughter Deena said in her book memories are made of this

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:46.049
That dean Martin was not a very good father

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.570
But he was a good man, and in his world. That's what counted

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.289
Now this is a picture of dino on the left

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.029

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:30.299
However, it will be 1972 before the 23 year marriage will officially end

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:37.829
