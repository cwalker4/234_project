00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.450
One of our biggest problems we face when travelling
in space, is the atrophy our bodies endure

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.769
while in microgravity. The astronauts on the
international space station have to exercise

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.220
several times a day to maintain their bone
and muscle strength. But is there an alternative?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.810
Can we create Artificial Gravity?
I’m sure you have seen the idea before in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.250
movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey where the
entire space station spins to create an artificial

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.820
gravity. The people inside can now walk comfortably
just like just on earth. It does this by exploiting

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.050
centrifugal force.
Now it seems that whenever someone mentions

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.219
centrifugal force, angry mobs will show up
in the comment section. Declaring it isn’t

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.190
real. Which just isn’t the case. Let’s
see why

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.750
NASA developed this huge centrifuge to test
the possibility of simulated gravity back

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.440
in the 1960s. Here we are looking from inertial
frame of reference, that just means we are

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.109
looking from outside perspective and we can
clearly see that there is no force pulling

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.260
this guy outwards. It is just his inertia
carrying him forward, and the floor he is

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.269
walking on provides the centripetal force
to prevent him from flying off.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.840
But what happens if our reference frame moves
with the astronaut. This is called a rotating

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.659
reference frame, or a non-inertial reference
frame. To him, the rest of the world is moving,

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.000
and he is standing stationary. In this reference
frame centrifugal force is absolutely a real

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.490
and measurable force, pushing him downwards
just like gravity. The only thing that is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.670
fictitious is his perception of what is causing
it.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.150
This occurs because in physics and engineering,
we must balance forces. The system has to

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.920
be in equilibrium. Newton’s third law states
for every action there is an equal and opposite

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.939
reaction.
So if centripetal force exists in this reference

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.240
frame there has to be a force pushing him
outwards. That is centrifugal force. And the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.869
moment the rotation stops it vanishes again.
So if this works so well, why haven’t we

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.680
seen a spinning space station yet? Well one
problem is size. To make this practical we

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.090
need a massive ship, which would be incredibly
expensive to get into orbit.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.289
The acceleration your body will experience
is directly proportional to speed and radius

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.380
of the space station. We can calculate the
gravity Space Station V from 2001: A Space

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.280
Odyssey would generate with some pretty simple
math. The space station V had a diameter of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.040
300 meters and spun on it’s axis once every
60 seconds.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.769
That would put its gravity at about the same
as the moons. For it to have a gravity similar

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.540
to earths it would need to spin once every
24 seconds.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.780
If were to make this a realistic size, let’s
say the same size as the international space

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.419
station. It would need to spin once every
10 seconds. This would probably be pretty

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.620
disorientating, just ask Sandra bullock.
Another problem we face on smaller stations

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.650
like this, is the gradient in acceleration
you would experience. Because the acceleration

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.840
is directly proportional to the distance to
the rotational center, your head will experience

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.859
less artificial gravity than your feet. This
would force the blood to your feet, just like

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.480
when you spin a bucket of water around. This
effect will diminish with a larger stations.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.400
So to make a practical space station with
artificial gravity the station would have

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.630
to be huge, which is simply too expensive.
Besides, the ISS is most valuable to us as

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.530
a laboratory to test the effects of microgravity.
But what if money was not an issue. What would

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.620
it take to get a space ship like Elysium,
built for the mega rich as an escape from

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.220
turmoil on earth, into orbit?
Elysium dwarves Space Station V measuring

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.410
in at 60 kilometers wide and it is estimated
to weigh about a million metric tons. Space

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.150
x can currently launch a kilogram into space
for about 2720 dollars, with their falcon

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.470
9 rocket. This will be reduced to about 1650
dollars per kilo when they launch their falcon

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.760
heavy variant at the end of the year. But
it would take over 18 thousand launches to

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.630
bring the one million metric tonnes to low
earth orbit, that’s 1.65 trillion dollars

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.699
to just get the materials of Elysium into
space with current technologies. Then we have

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.090
to worry about the costs of materials and
engineering that would go into building something

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.250
of this magnitude.
That is far more difficult to calculate, but

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.229
we can take some clues from the ISS. It is
estimated to have cost about 150 billion in

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:59.530
total. It took 36 shuttle flights at a cost
of 1.4 billion each to bring the materials

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.810
to space. That’s a total of 50.4 billion
dollars. So the launch costs were just 33%

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.660
of the total cost. A conservative estimate
for the costs of Elysium could be put at 5

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.370
trillion dollars. That’s 62.3 Bill Gates,
but there are half a million people on board

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.759
Elysium, so if the cost was split between
everyone that would be about 10 million each.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.690
That isn’t so far-fetched and the price
of space travel is destined to reduce in the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.690
future.
We do have materials strong enough to build

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.260
a structure like this. The forces on Elysium
would be similar to the ISS, other than the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.650
additional stress created by centripetal and
centrifugal force. It’s interesting to note

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.630
that the designers of Elysium took note of
this. The stress in a spinning structure like

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.780
this would decrease as you move away from
the rotational center. This means it would

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.010
need a stronger structure the closer you get
to the center. This clearly influenced their

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.570
design with these tapering spokes. But we
run into some problems when we realize there

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.730
isn’t enough aluminum in the world to build
this thing. It would take at least 10 years’

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.340
worth of the world’s total aluminum production
just to build the structure. This would cause

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.400
a huge surge in the cost of the material.
An alternative method could be sourcing the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.400
materials from space. This could reduce the
launch costs and there is plenty of metallic

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.910
material available on the moon and on near
earth asteroids.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.070
So this technology is definitely possible,
our only barriers are launch costs and material

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.630
availability. Something on the scale of Space
Station V would be easily achievable, who

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.470
knows maybe we’ll be travelling to space
as tourists in the near future.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.540
Once again thanks for watching, I have a little
bonus for you at the end of this outro, you

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.650
can skip ahead or wait to watch it. I’d
like to thank my Patreon supporters Bastien,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.020
Nick and FG for helping me revise this video.
Your support is really appreciated. Thank

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.710
you. If you would like to see more content
or support Real Engineering. The links for

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.560
my Patreon, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter
accounts are below.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.110
So I promised to include this in my last video,
but I couldn’t figure out how to include

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.030
it in this video in a seamless way. The centrifugal
governor was used in the industrial revolution

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.990
to control the amount of steam entering the
steam piston. Which was essential as the supply

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.240
and demand can vary with fuel and load.
For example if the engineer puts more coal

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.710
into the boiler, the pressure will rise and
these masses spin faster, which increases

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.800
the centrifugal force and pushes them outwards.
This raises this sleeve up which in turn closes

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.200
the valve to reduce the amount of steam entering
the engine. So the centrifugal governor acts

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.960
as a sensor to provide direct mechanical feedback
to control the speed of the engine. It is

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.670
one of my favorite inventions of the industrial
revolution. Thanks for watching till the end

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.690
everyone. Hope you liked the video and feel
free to ask me any questions on twitter.
