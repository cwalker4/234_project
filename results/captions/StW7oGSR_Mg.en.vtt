00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.340
I'm in China, but
it certainly feels like I'm in Great Britain.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.020
Hong Kong, under British rule, has grown a
modern western city in an eastern setting.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.600
And right in the center of downtown Hong
Kong are the British Cricket Club grounds.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.980
Cricket has been played on these grounds
since 1880.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.860
Hong Kong is a peculiar place.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.800
It's a British colony until just 1997 and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.320
because of that the British culture here
is so visible.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.000
This ferry was set up by

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.380
the British in  1888.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.860
Day and night the 5 star ferry comes and
goes,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.260
providing core harbor transportation.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.600
These trams, brought over by the British in the early 1900s.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.300
If you go to London you'll see double-decker buses
that actually look exactly like the buses here.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.880
Do you notice what side of the road they're driving on?

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.280
So many of the street names,
road names, are British.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.700
The famous Happy Valley racetrack, reputedly the
most beautiful in the east.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.560
Rolling through this park and I stumbled
upon a legit bowling green,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.340
a place where they play bowls.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.420
Old, old, old, British sport.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.509
That is just right

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.160
here in the middle of Hong Kong.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.800
The British brought good administration and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.180
a gracious way of living.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.140
Typified by these homes and apartments on Victoria Peak.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.400
Around the late 1600s, early 1700s,
Britain started trading with China.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.160
China had all sorts of stuff that
the West wanted; porcelain, silk.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.520
But there was one thing that Britain loved more
than anything else: the herb called tea.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.620
China was really the only place on earth
that was producing tea on a massive

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.780
scale and the people back in Britain
became totally hooked on it.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.780
But there was one snag for the British government when
it came to the tea trade, which is that

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.310
the Chinese emperor would only take pure
silver bullion, basically coins and like

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.360
bars of silver, in exchange for tea. That
was the deal and the British were fine

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.740
with that, they were like whatever man,
we'll pay for this, it's such a valuable thing.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.220
Eventually britain's treasury ran really
low on silver and it became a national

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.930
crisis so Britain came up with a
horribly unethical solution to their tea

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.220
silver problem.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.280
They started smuggling in opium, the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.500
highly addictive narcotic that was
illegal in China.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.980
Britain would sell

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.400
this opium in exchange for Chinese
silver, which they then used to buy tea

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.820
and this was the solution to their
problem: an illegal drug trade, which is

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.620
just mind-blowing to me.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.380
Eventually, the Chinese government
caught on to this illegal drug trade and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.160
they cracked down.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.310
They seized all the
opium and threw twenty thousand chests

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.040
of opium into the sea.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.510
Britain wasn't happy about China

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.989
seizing all of its opium, so it showed up
with its big gunboats

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.000
and started a war, the Opium Wars.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.900
They eventually negotiated a series of peace

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.520
deals and a part of those deals was that
China was going to give this rocky

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.960
island that didn't really have many
people living on it, to Britain.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.840
In the text of the treaty they put that the
British will have Hong Kong for 99 years,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.840
but the diplomat who negotiated the
treaty said later that in his mind

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.740
ninety-nine years was quote "as good as
forever."

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.280
Meaning no intention of ever giving
it back.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.580
So Britain's thirst for tea

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.380
brought them into a war with China that
eventually gave them a new colony: Hong Kong, here in Asia.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.100
Hong Kong a British
colony, a tourist paradise for duty-free

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.560
shoppers.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.100
China, communist China, lies only
a few miles away just across the border.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.899
Just walked into the grocery store to
meet Billy, who's a historian here and we're

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.020
just looking at a bunch of maps, which is
like my kind of activity.

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.599
So one of the things the British did as
soon as they got here, is they started

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.140
drawing their own borders in the city to
divide them from the local Chinese.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.520
Now let's talk about tea again.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.800
It remains a symbol as to the different

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.720
cultures that exist here in Hong Kong.
British influence versus the Chinese influence.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.620
The British prefer milk in their tea
with crumpets and scones and little cakes.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.640
Whereas the Chinese will tell you
they do not pervert their tea with milk

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.840
and they drink tea with dim sum, little
buns and cakes.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.720
A British tea situation looks very
different.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720
These two traditions played

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.260
out side-by-side in the city for many
years.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.960
in a divided way with the Chinese

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.980
down in their crowded slums drinking
their tea in their tea houses and the

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.160
British up on the hills in their
aristocratic homes

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.680
sipping their milk tea, but eventually
over time those boundaries dissolved and

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.580
the two cultures started to blend and
fuse together.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.660
To where today, the tea

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.160
culture has cropped up that is a perfect
fusion of the two.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.119
But I hate to break it to you Britain, 99
years is not forever like the British

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:02.440
diplomat thought it was going to be.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.980
The actual handover ceremony is about to start.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.909
British role officially comes to an end

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:09.540
with a handover ceremony just before
midnight.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.060
A five star flag of China, soon

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.040
to be sovereign over Hong Kong again.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.919
I should like on behalf of Her Majesty

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:25.019
the Queen and of the entire British
people to express our thanks, admiration,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.760
affection, and good wishes to all the
people of Hong Kong.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.220
The stroke of midnight, the red star flag of China will
go up.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.500
For me, it was pure betrayal.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.960
We're, like, being abandoned by the Brits.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.639
There was pride in this mix of like the Chinese values

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:51.460
and I guess are the western values.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.410
An identity of a citizen is not, like,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.640
determined by your passport
something.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.949
It's something that you treasure,

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:59.820
the culture we are living in.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.110
We feel lost in our identity.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.880
Our generation has very complicated identities.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.920
Britain giving Hong Kong back to China
is the beginning of a new chapter for

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.250
the city and so next week I'm going to
explain what happens when China tries to

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.990
erase this border between Hong Kong and
Mainland China and how the people here

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.380
are resisting.
