00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.680
This is a vision of our future

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.250
The fateful day in a far-flung corner of the universe when a probe from Earth

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.570
Initiates the first descent onto an alien world

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.339
Looking for proof of life beyond our solar system

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.979
There are no witnesses, no cheering crowds in the control room a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.460
Decade or more will pass before news finally reaches us back across the dark oceans of space

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.979
But the seeds of this mission are already being sold today

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.969
By the first generation of scientists bold enough to believe it could be possible

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.250
When I look up in the sky and I see not stars. I see planetary systems

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.559
Fidel we must understand that the journey to ISO planet is not limited by the laws of physics

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.299
They look two planets orbiting distant stars

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.329
Searching for an answer to the oldest human question. Are we alone?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.769
Is there life on other worlds and if not, why not and if so how?

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.879
This is the first generation in human history where we have the technological ability text to go and answer that great question

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.339
This is the story of humanity

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.940
Launched into the final frontier by a new breed of adventurers the planet hunters

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.959
engineers

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.079
explorers and dreamers taking the first steps on an interstellar journey

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.690
they will not complete that a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.989
journey of like years and lifetimes to another earth around another

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.310
we could not possibly have been forged in the dying throes of stars and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.919
Created in that tremendous explosion and now turn our back on

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.569
Looking for other creatures that were formed the same way

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.310
I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.310
am Artemis

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.530
autonomous robotic exploration

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.039
mothership for interstellar space I

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.679
Am in the final phase of construction in the International cooperative zone of Earth orbit

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:01.658
I am born of man and woman and I am both

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.189
But I am neither

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.620
I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.359
Am the first search for life on a planet outside our solar system

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.170
I am home

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.440
There's been life on earth for the best part of four billion years

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.960
The marvelous complex biosphere

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.529
Created shaped and reformed by the ever shifting forces of our planet

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.460
Since the dawn of science, we've sought out life and studied its remarkable diversity on every inch of the globe

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.710
The technology of the 20th century took our search into space as we scoured our

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.979
neighboring planets the signs of a second Genesis

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.210
And came back empty-handed

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.450
But what about beyond our solar system

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.139
Could life in all its complexity exist out there on a planet among the stars

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.939
Get away what would win the development of human thought if one had not been able to see the stars so

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.809
This is an area that inspires dreams

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.129
For as long as we've had eyes to see and minds to wonder we've marveled at the bright lights in the sky

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.119
But it was only on the eve of the 21st century that a handful of eccentric thinkers

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.420
Dared to gaze into the gloom between the stars

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.859
Believing planets like our own world could be found there

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.770
Michelle Maya was one of them

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.760
It says it's all it's very strange in the first half of the 20th century the Astronomy community

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.539
The astronomers were convinced that there were few or no planetary systems in the galaxy apart from the solar system

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.049
When you went to astronomy meetings or conferences you couldn't tell people which you're working on

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.030
If you said you were looking for extrasolar planets

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.099
They did snicker and they'd move away like you smelled bad or like you were trying to sell some New Age religion

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.628
You know you might have been looking for a little green men at that point

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:09.439
In the 1990s astronomer our Paul Butler was another young radical who gambled his career on the hunt for exoplanets

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.460
planets

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.210
orbiting stars other than our Sun I

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.129
Was working on the problem like 80 or 100 hours a week I I would work on the problem

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.769
So intensely that I would have dreams

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.179
About the work and you know, it's totally all-consuming

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.220
At the heart of the challenge was one fundamental problem

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.550
even if there were

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.240
exoplanets out there

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:48.099
Scientists knew they'd be impossible to see directly because the brightness of the star would overwhelm the planet

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.459
The planets are very small and weak in terms of brightness compared to the star

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.920
Therefore getting a direct picture of a planet. Well, that's the great difficulty

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.740
One is dazzled by the Stars

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:13.170
To overcome this obstacle astronomers developed an ingenious method of hunting exoplanets by stealth

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.800
To detect planet orbiting a star you have to rely on tricks and one of the trick we have been using is

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.869
If there is a planet going around the star the star will moved a little bit

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.279
Tiny motion and that's the motion you want to detects

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.200
In

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.179
1994 junior planet hunter didier queloz was michelle

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.530
Maya's PhD student on the brink of a breakthrough discovery

00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:57.099
Well in 94, we we started this program that was looking about hundred stars with a brand new equipment

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.230
I had spent almost four years before building it and designing the software to treat the data

00:09:02.749 --> 00:09:06.519
we're serving with the telescope's to get the speed of the star and

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.959
Trying to see the tiny change in the speed with time

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.910
Kind of wobbling. I would tell us that there is something orbiting that star

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.499
Growls day under Montaigne in a way alone because Michelle would in sabbatical

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.720
Practically gave me the key of the house because he was not expecting any detection

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:42.939
You can imagine my surprise after just a couple of observations we see that something was a bit strange on that style

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.989
It took me six months practically to be convinced that I was real and then I send this message to Michel

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.810
I was in a wire see Michel. I think I found a planet

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.040
It may not look like it but this little curve is a planet

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:07.809
How my or and colas detected it is a tale of remarkable scientific creativity

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.650
New subjects we are here in the Dome of the observed terrible lost

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.449
It is here that the discovery of exoplanets began

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.330
So decode the planets our bodies that do not emit light by themselves

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.579
they only reflect the light received from their star and so we will have to find an

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.040
Indirect method to detect the planet. We made an ID effect of our detected a planet

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.870
To understand the simple idea behind this

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:59.219
Imagine you're in the back row of the stadium at the Olympics of watching an extremely muscular athlete with arms outstretched

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.130
Yaya

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:09.749
Imagine the hammer is the planet the athlete it's down over the chain between them their gravitational bond

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.610
The star pulls hard on the planet, but it's not all one way

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:23.849
The planet also pulls on the star in fact was every revolution it's pulling it a little off balance

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:32.279
Using a prism like instrument called a spectrograph this wobble effect can be detected by observing

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.459
changes in the color of the light emitted by the star

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.589
Shifting towards blue as the star moves closer and red as it moves away

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:49.979
Measuring this oscillation allowed koalas and my or to infer the existence of a planet to calculate its mass the

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.590
distance from its star and

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.780
the duration of its orbit

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.969
It's moving to be here with this instruments which allowed us more than 20 years ago to discover the first exoplanet

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:11.269
I think by detecting the first planet you'd break a psychological frontier in

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.660
Science it's is very rare. You cannot change a paradigm and we've changed the paradigm on

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:24.680
The 6th of October 1995 my or and koalas announced their discovery

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.210
The first ever exoplanet

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.510
Bellerophon

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:42.290
Although they could not see it directly. It's mass suggested. It was a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:49.879
But the distance from its star and the period of its orbit seemed to defy the laws of our solar system

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.300
People thought well, this is really bizarre. This must be a total freak because it didn't look like the solar system

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.829
It's a big planet like Jupiter, but it orbits a star in four days

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:14.829
Delfy the theory was the formation of giant planets predicted that they would only orbit their star over

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.170
extremely long periods of time

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:25.419
It's ten years or more and so it seems completely at odds with the theory of time

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:35.470
In our own solar system giant gas planets exist only in the colder outer orbits whereas

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.309
Bellerophon appeared to be tucked in tight against the heat of its star

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.210
Much closer, even than mercury is to our Sun

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.030
Because it's so close to its star it's really really hard

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:56.829
it's probably something like a word or 2,000 degrees centigrade and there is no solid surface because it's a gas giant so it's not or

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.170
Not a good place for life

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.210
It's not a place you'd want to visit

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:10.088
Bellerophon was no second earth

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:17.500
But its discovery had opened the window on a new vision of the universe where anything is possible

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.099
The exoplanets Miniver B was chosen as the target of my mission

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.219
By astronomers who are long since dead

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.289
They died believing they had found four

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:50.619
14.7 light-years from Earth a world like ours with liquid water bearing life

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.050
I hope that I will prove them, right

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.129
When the first exoplanets were found by the wobble method

00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:14.348
There was a debate in the Astronomy community some astronomers said this is fantastic a new kind of world

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.379
Completely unforeseen in terms of our understanding of planet formation

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.528
But another group of astronomers said hold on a minute

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:23.468
We don't think that these are actually planets

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.260
In 1999

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.580
professor of astronomy

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:37.020
David Charbonneau was just a young grad student at Harvard trying to make his mark in the brand new field of planet-hunting

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.340
What he encountered was a minefield

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:47.009
While artists had rushed to bring these new worlds to life

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.270
skeptics questioned the astronomers interpretation of their data

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:59.549
What they said was we were being fooled there was in fact a new kind of stellar pulsation and so as the star

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.060
expanded and contracted

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.270
we were looking at one side of that star and so it appeared that the star was coming towards us and away from us the

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:12.479
Very signal that would be the telltale motion due to an orbiting planet, but in fact had nothing to do with planet at all

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:17.609
What I decided to do was to try to go and resolve this debate

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.149
First by looking for the light reflected off of one of these worlds

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.510
We tried very hard for a couple years and unfortunately we did not succeed

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:35.490
But then as a second idea what we decided to do was instead of looking for the light bouncing off a planet

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.870
Wait for the planet to pass in front of its star and look for that transit

00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:44.499
Charbonneau

00:16:44.499 --> 00:16:46.499
relocated to Boulder, Colorado

00:16:46.569 --> 00:16:54.089
To a small shed in a car park where a basic four inch telescope had been set up by fellow researcher Tim Brown

00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:59.608
But I had never done this kind of project before so as a first attempt

00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:06.719
I thought what we should do is look at one star where we knew that there was a planet due to the wobble method

00:17:07.269 --> 00:17:13.409
But which we hadn't yet looked for to see if in fact the planet passed in front of a star making a transit

00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:19.799
Where the wobble method allowed one to infer the mass of an orbiting exoplanet

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:27.059
Charbonneau was attempting to observe the planets shape as it passed across its star in the manner of a partial eclipse

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.278
The problem was he knew the odds were stacked against him

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.750
Of all the planets that are out there orbiting their stars

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.750
We only get to see a tiny fraction

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:45.509
By this transit method the idea is that our line of sight has to be exactly aligned with a planetary orbit

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.949
So that each time the planet swings around it'll pass in front of some part of the star

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.980
Blocking some of the light and that's the signal we can detect

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:10.648
Tipped off that another so-called hot jupiter-like Bellerophon had been detected by the wobble method

00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:19.259
Charbonneau trained his telescope on star HD 2 0 9 4 5 8 and waited praying for a transit

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:24.209
There had been about 10 hot Jupiters discovered at that point

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:31.709
So it seemed like if there really were planets if we weren't being fooled and sooner or later or one of these transits should occur

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:40.719
And right when we predicted based on the Wobble data that a transit would occur that's when we saw this event

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:50.988
Shabba knows transit method was a game-changer

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.399
confirming the pioneering discoveries using the wobble method and

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:58.279
silencing the skeptics

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:05.509
The discovery of the transits of HD tour nine four five eight was a big deal in the astronomical community

00:19:09.989 --> 00:19:16.159
For the first time we knew the actual mass of the planet we knew its size and we could calculate the density

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:19.919
And

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:26.299
We could compare it to the density of planets in the solar system. So it confirmed that these worlds really were hot Jupiters

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:30.918
They were big gassy planets inflated due to their proximity to their stars

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:41.839
The new-look universe was populating fast inspiring an eager generation of young scientists to join the hunt

00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:53.669
Timing is everything

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.500
When I was in graduate school

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.919
Mid-1990s looking for a project to work on for my PhD thesis

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:07.799
amazingly enough the first reports of planets orbiting sun-like stars were coming around at that time and my

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.939
thesis advisor suggested that I work on exoplanets

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.140
MIT professor of astrophysics

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.569
Sara Seager arrived in the field after the paradigm had already shifted

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:30.720
To her the question was no longer simply are there exoplanets out there? It was could there be one like Earth?

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:38.549
when I want to think I come here to the great lake and you look out on the water and I just think about how

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.489
How wonderful life is how fragile life is?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.159
It gives me hope that there's another planet out there where life could really thrive

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.949
But what makes our world so special what physical characteristics define our planet

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.130
We're looking for a planet that has a solid surface predominantly rocky planet, but we're not expecting another planet to be exactly like Earth

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:12.070
When we talk about the planets we want to find it's one that would be able to host life

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.290
Even in the most extreme environments

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.040
like here amidst the glaciers of volcanoes of Iceland

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:31.880
The conditions that make organic life possible on earth can be found if you know where to look

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.379
Life needs water and we think water is almost everywhere in the universe

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:51.530
However, we find it mainly on the formulas and that's not what we need life as we know it and how will recognize it

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:58.760
Really needs liquid water and that's not obvious because it requires the right conditions of temperature and pressure

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.990
Based on everything we know of life on Earth

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.100
scientists like Francois fouché, believe that for an

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.309
Exoplanet to host liquid water like Earth

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.880
It needs to lie within a certain distance from its star the region called the habitable zone

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.010
They own

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:31.329
We calculate that if we move the earth just a few percent closer to the Sun the climate would go into overdrive

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.789
Because there would be more solar energy

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:43.569
The oceans would be warmer more water vapor more greenhouse effect and very quickly the oceans would totally boil and evaporate

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.079
On the other hand if we move the earth a few percent away from the signal it will be colder

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:10.099
There would be more snow more ice and that snow will reflect the sunlight which makes it colder and colder and that

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.660
Continues until all the earth gets covered in ice. We call it a snowball earth

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.780
The reason earth is suitable for life is not only that it's covered with liquid water and oceans today

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:34.769
But it has been throughout its existence for 4 billion years which allowed life to be born and evolved

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.900
The first mathematical model of planet habitability produced in

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.970
1979 placed extremely narrow limits on the habitable zone

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:56.329
But recent advances in geological science have broadened at the horizon

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:10.739
Other than being at approximately the right distance from the Sun that the main thing that keeps our Taba table is the carbon cycle

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.620
Penn State professor of Geoscience

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:26.150
Jim caste is a world leader in the study of planet habitability and the vital role played by Carlin

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:34.309
On earth carbon in the form of co2

00:24:35.129 --> 00:24:42.559
Traps the sun's heat in our atmosphere without it temperatures would plummet to below what life needs to survive

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.079
But co2 doesn't just stay in the atmosphere

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.730
The trees around us are

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.870
photosynthesizing and they're XE

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.000
Exchanging every co2 molecule in the atmosphere every 10 or 12 years

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.320
but on long timescales

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:11.419
it's what we call the carbonate silicate cycle where co2 in the combined atmosphere ocean system is exchanging with

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.730
carbonate rocks

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:23.299
Co2 rich sediment washes into the ocean and is drawn into the Earth's crust at underwater fault lines

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.649
Where a final?

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:26.940
geological mechanism

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.940
completes the cycle

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.759
To have a habitable planet like the earth you really need

00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:38.048
A long-term carbon cycle and that has to be driven by

00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:42.909
Some process like plate tectonics on the earth that keeps the carbon moving around

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:53.839
When our planet enters an ice age this tectonic feedback restores a habitable climate as

00:25:55.019 --> 00:26:01.429
oceans freeze the uptake side of the carbon cycle slows while volcanic activity continues

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.939
pumping co2 and heat back into the atmosphere

00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:15.009
When you put in the feedback you find out that the habitable zone instead of being very narrow it's actually quite wide and

00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:18.159
wide enough that there's a good chance that

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.699
Planets around other stars at least one or one or more of them could be within the habitable zone

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.740
Costings research had a momentous impact

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.139
By expanding the boundaries of the habitable zone the carbon feedback loop

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.439
vastly improved the odds of finding an earthlike exoplanet

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.260
Where life might be possible?

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.330
But the fundamental challenge of identifying an earth-like planet remain

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:57.629
There tiny and therefore much harder to detect compared to the gas giants that our instruments had observed so far

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:05.640
To see these earth sized world's a giant leap forward in technology was required

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.360
I

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.020
Was a graduate student when the very first planet was discovered

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.830
In fact I was at the conference where Michelle mayor made that announcement

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:30.119
NASA astrophysicist, Natalie batalha graduated with a dream

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:39.059
I would say my biggest. Hope was that we find an earth-sized planet orbiting a star very much like our own Sun

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:44.159
In a similar orbit where the conditions for life might be just right

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.200
Five

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.760
four three

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.840
two

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.659
Engine start one zero and liftoff of the Delta two rocket with Kepler

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.529
On a search for planets in some way like our own

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:14.520
In 2009 scientists launched a formidable new weapon in the hunt for life beyond our solar system

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.390
The first dedicated planet hunting telescope Kepler

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:30.099
At the time it was the world's largest digital camera using an array of 95

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:37.209
megapixel sensors to detect the infant Tessa mode dimming of starlight pierced by transiting planets

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:44.168
So powerful that if turned towards earth it could detect a single porch light turning off

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.250
More importantly. It was the first instrument capable of detecting rocky earth sized planets

00:28:54.010 --> 00:29:01.059
The first two decades of exoplanets was kind of like postage stamp collecting Kepler really changed that

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.799
Kepler monitored a select region of our galaxy over a four-year period

00:29:11.409 --> 00:29:16.829
By taking a snapshot every 30 minutes like an epic time-lapse photograph

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:27.739
And from that data, we identified over 4,000

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.390
periodic transit events that look like viable planets

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:38.300
And in fact, we have confirmed through other follow-up observations that over half of them are indeed

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:41.059
bonafide planets

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.759
Kepler delivered not only the first rocky

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.620
exoplanets, it revealed brand new kinds of rocky planets like

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.850
Kepler 10b

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.459
Our first encounter with what scientists would christen lava world

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:09.849
These are rocky worlds same kind of density as Earth's but they're orbiting so close to their star

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:16.329
That the surface temperatures are in excess of that required to melt not just rock but iron

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:28.480
So you've got an entire hemisphere, you know something the size of the Pacific Ocean even larger that is an ocean

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.629
But it's not an ocean of water. It's an ocean of molten rock

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.900
Kepler was the first celestial census

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.850
Extrapolating the data for the surveyed region it gave astronomers a catalog of the exoplanet population

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.959
We've learned I think three important things

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:05.850
First we've learned that every star that you see when you look up into the sky at night has at least one planet

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:17.590
The other thing that we have learned is that nature makes small planets more efficiently than large planets

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.040
The third thing we've learned

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:25.869
Has to do with the fraction of stars that Harbor Earth's size

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:33.910
potentially habitable planets and we can make the bias corrections to determine that number and what we find is that it's about

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.220
22 to 25 percent

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.319
At least one planet for every star in the sky

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:51.980
And as many as a quarter of them earth-sized and orbiting within the habitable zone

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:59.238
Kepler revolutionized the way we see the stars

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:05.659
Kepler was the pioneer Kepler

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:09.199
looked for planets transiting sun-like stars and

00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:15.889
Kepler looked at a very distant field of stars for four years to try to find a planet like Earth that has a 1 year

00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:17.889
orbit

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.389
Inspired by the success of Kepler in

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.019
2013 NASA joined forces with MIT

00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:29.839
Lincoln labs to develop an instrument that could deliver a more detailed survey of nearby

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:32.359
earth-like worlds

00:32:32.879 --> 00:32:38.299
The entire field of exoplanets is funneling towards the search for another earth a rocky world

00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:42.498
Orbiting a small star preferably in a habitable zone of That star

00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:49.248
As the project advanced MIT professor Sara Seager was named deputy

00:32:49.529 --> 00:32:51.799
science director of the transiting

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.350
exoplanet survey satellite

00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:56.359
Aka Tess

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.758
Tess wants to find stars that are closer right in our neighborhood actually

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.850
the camera has

00:33:05.369 --> 00:33:09.949
Lens assembly of seven lens elements that were fracks starlight

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:13.398
Onto a detector then together they make a giant strip

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:19.699
When you think of the sky as a sphere from the bottom of one hemisphere all the way up to the pole?

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.989
after one year of doing that tests will flip to the next SEM asphere and

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:29.959
It will then do the same thing. And so over two years test. Aims to study the entire sky

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.839
By scanning nearby star systems Tess aims to identify

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.570
50 earth-sized exoplanet

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.389
candidates for further investigation

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:51.799
But would finding a planet like our earth also mean finding a star like our Sun

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:05.930
All we know of the stars we know from afar all we know of Minerva B is this

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.560
It is a rocky planet

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.590
1.6 times the size of Earth hosted by a red dwarf star

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.450
It's orbital period is 39 earth days

00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:26.919
It lies within the habitable zone

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:37.260
It's atmosphere contains carbon dioxide methane water and ozone

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800
It will be full of surprises

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:09.109
After the explosion of discoveries a new question emerged

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:20.629
Could finding the right star be just as crucial as finding the right planet

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:34.099
I think the biggest lie that I was told when I was in school was that the Sun is an average star?

00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:40.729
The Sun is not an average star the Sun is much bigger much more luminous much more massive than most stars

00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:51.909
Most stars in the galaxy are about a quarter the size of the Sun record of the mass and they only put out one one

00:35:52.009 --> 00:35:54.009
thousandth the energy

00:35:56.269 --> 00:36:02.169
These are small cool stars burning not yellow like our Sun but red

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:11.870
They're classified as m-type stars or M dwarfs, but most people call them red dwarfs

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:19.500
One of Kepler's earth-sized discoveries planet kepler 186f

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.530
Was found to be orbiting such a star

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.530
500 light-years from Earth

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.990
It's about the same size of the earth and our observations

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.659
Tell us that planets the size of Earth are more likely to have a rocky composition

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:42.419
So we imagine this planet as being a rocky planet with a surface a solid surface

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.399
It's receiving about the right amount of energy for liquid water to pull on the surface

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.459
But it's orbiting a star that's very different than our Sun

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:59.189
Because red dwarfs burn less hot than our Sun the habitable zone tends to be much closer in

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.079
But this closeness could spell disaster for life on the planet

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:13.649
The red dwarfs their habitable zones are so close in that the planets have a strong chance of becoming tidally locked and

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:21.569
Synchronously rotating where they show the same face to the star all the time just as the moon shows the same face to the earth

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:26.520
So that that poses problems for habitability, which may be difficult to overcome

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:34.799
When a planet is close to its star the gravitational or tidal force becomes greater

00:37:34.799 --> 00:37:38.788
And this can have the effect of locking the rotation of the planet

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:45.180
Meaning one side is always lit by its star while the other remains shrouded in darkness

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.790
As well as producing one hot side and one cold

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:58.840
By spinning so slowly the planet may fail to generate an electromagnetic shield which like on earth

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.540
protects the planet from radiation

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:10.639
These stars at the same time, you know is supplied they're very much dimmer than the Sun but they're more magnetically active

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:18.170
They give lots off lots of high-energy radiation that may strip the atmosphere off a planet particularly if it's not

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.690
protected by a magnetic field

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:23.839
But in 2015

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:29.420
casting and other researchers found reason to hope for life on a tidally locked planet

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.210
orbiting a red dwarf

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.000
Using sophisticated

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.099
climate modeling they proposed that if the planet had the right kind of

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:47.300
Atmosphere then heat could be transferred from the light side to the dark like a reverse cycle air conditioning system

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:55.580
Planet hunters embraced the discovery if life could thrive on a planet around a red dwarf or

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.530
M-type star the odds of finding a second earth were vastly improved

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.899
M-type stars are the most numerous star in the galaxy?

00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:14.169
70% of the stars in our galaxy are these m-type stars? So if

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:22.389
Life can seed itself and get started on these planets then life is going to be ubiquitous in the galaxy

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.509
For four months at the beginning of 2016

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:35.309
The SIA telescope in Chile set its sights on the m-type star Proxima Centuri

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.190
Ahmir 4.25 light-years from Earth, it's our nearest stellar neighbor

00:39:53.710 --> 00:40:00.520
In a machine room deep beneath a telescope light from the star was split by the harps spectrum eater

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:03.730
And

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:11.399
Instruments, so sensitive it picked up the feeblest of wobbles in the dwarf star caused by a tiny earth-sized

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.500
planet

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.500
próxima be

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.760
The discovery came as a revelation

00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:31.999
The very closest alien star to earth posts a tidally locked earth-like world and

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:39.109
Calculations reveal that Proxima B is orbiting within the habitable zone

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.150
It's an amazing

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:47.590
triumph to discover a planet around our nearest star

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:52.989
Just think about that for thousands of features. People have been wondering are there any planets around other stars?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.509
And there is one around our very nearest star

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.170
But what about its atmosphere

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.620
Could this planet sustain life?

00:41:19.339 --> 00:41:24.759
My last sell of helium-3 propellant is delivered from moon base

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.660
My preparations are complete

00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:41.609
On earth the world

00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:48.089
Astronomical Union is throwing a party for me on the eve of my historic launch

00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:57.568
And I am honored and I am alone

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.210
Tomorrow I am gone to me Nova

00:42:12.869 --> 00:42:14.250
As

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.939
the exoplanet goldrush gathered pace

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:25.640
Planet-hunting prospectors sought ever more refined methods of sifting their discoveries in an effort to give a future

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:32.359
Interstellar mission the best possible chance of targeting a world that might actually host life

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:43.788
Having identified a rich new vein of distant planets the next crucial piece of the puzzle was yet to fall into place

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:49.160
How could a telescope be used to sample the atmosphere?

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.570
Looking at a planet's atmosphere far away is the best way we have to find signs of life on another world

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:03.439
because the gases that life produces here on earth actually imprint in our atmosphere in a very significant way and

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.490
So it's just amazing to think that on another world we can do the same

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.150
If you were an alien astronomer

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:20.199
Studying the planets of the solar system you would see that there's something very different about the third planet from the Sun

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:27.849
You would see that its atmosphere is full of oxygen even though you would know that the oxygen couldn't possibly be there by geologic processes

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.670
There would be other gases like methane

00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:37.659
Which also shouldn't be present and yet there they are and you would we think as we're trying to do

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:42.909
Ourselves when we look at other stars conclude that life was the only possible explanation

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:53.240
In 2000 David sharpener took control of the aging Hubble telescope

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.129
Charged with a single but daunting objective to make the first-ever

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.069
observation of an exoplanets atmosphere

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:09.459
The transit method of exoplanet detection which Charbonneau had pioneered himself

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.789
Provided a clue for how to solve the puzzle

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.370
Planets orbiting closely to their stars

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.220
Make more frequent transits and the larger the planet the easier it is to detect

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:31.749
so Charbonneau turned the Hubble's gaze towards those Syrus a gas giant the transits every

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.120
3.5 days

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:40.739
We had the idea that when the planet passed in front of its star some of the light from the star would pass through

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:45.870
the outer parts of the planet and then imprinted upon that light would be the

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:49.440
Fingerprints of whatever atoms or molecules were present in the atmosphere

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.469
Different atoms absorb different light frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum and allow others to pass through

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.990
producing a signature in color

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.699
No one had ever discovered an exoplanet atmosphere and

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:10.979
So we needed a guess as to what atom or molecule would be

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.580
Very prominent would be the easiest first thing to see so there were some predictions

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:22.049
Charbonneau put his money on sodium the tell-tale yellow glow of street lamps

00:45:25.219 --> 00:45:31.839
The observations were gathered a few months afterwards and it took more than a year to carefully analyze the data

00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:37.778
No, one had ever made this detection before so we wanted to be absolutely certain that what we were seeing was robust

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.669
After painstakingly probing the data Charbonneau announced his discovery

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.669
The atmosphere around Osiris was indeed rich in sodium

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.810
However, this was no second earth

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.520
Named after the Egyptian god of the dead

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:10.110
The gas giant Osiris doesn't even have a solid surface to land on let alone the climate of the life

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:17.489
What we crave to do is to study the atmosphere of an earth-like planet

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:27.129
Of course earth-like planets are simply much smaller than gas giants. And so it's just much more difficult to detect them and

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:29.650
to study their atmospheres

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.949
It's the hurdle that has thoughted planet hunters from the outset the

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.980
blinding light of the Stars

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.020
completely overwhelms the smaller

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:43.630
exoplanets

00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:50.728
The first instrument to solve that problem will hold the key to the exoplanet

00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:52.359
revolution

00:46:52.359 --> 00:46:56.668
This telescope will allow us to make a leap forward in several fields of astrophysics

00:46:57.549 --> 00:47:03.329
Especially in the field of exoplanets indeed. It will allow us to observe the atmospheres of these exoplanets

00:47:04.209 --> 00:47:10.619
The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to view the heavens like they have never been seen before

00:47:11.289 --> 00:47:13.289
making the invisible visible

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:22.440
Its vast honeycomb like dish of mirrors converges light into the eye of a state-of-the-art

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.200
infrared camera that

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:30.420
astrophysicist Pierre Olivier lagash spent 20 years developing

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.629
And an object emits light in a given wavelength according to its temperature

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.979
For example the Sun emits in the visible range because it's very hot

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.199
If we take a human, it's much cooler and will emit in a different wavelength

00:47:48.869 --> 00:47:50.849
mid infrared

00:47:50.849 --> 00:47:56.719
And that's why with a so-called thermal or infrared camera. You can see people at night

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.869
We don't need lights. We see the heat emitted by a human in the mid infrared

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:13.429
The same is true of exoplanets observe them in the right wavelength and they glow in the dark

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:23.600
But for the infrared vision to work it relies on the truly innovative feature of this telescope

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:32.720
Inside the camera lies James Webb's secret weapon a kind of mask called a coronagraph

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:42.680
It was that this form of masks is very unique the light of the star arrives where it's opaque

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:48.860
On the other hand if you have a small object next to it like an exoplanet

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.570
Well, the light will not have exactly the same path and will shine through so

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:59.270
After that, we'll have the light of the exoplanet without the light of the star

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:05.659
So thanks to this corona graphic method. We'll be able to get a direct image of the exoplanets

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:14.269
The mask of the coronagraph intervenes between the overwhelming light of the star like an eclipse

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.890
Allowing the infrared light of the planet to shine through

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.350
These

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:29.600
Exoplanets have never been seen in this wavelength and yet it's a very interesting field for measuring the temperature of these

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.790
objects their luminosity

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.980
We can also see the composition

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.299
Certain molecules such as ammonia which is in this wavelength range

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.230
so the

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:44.179
Characterization of atmospheres will be one of the great focuses of this instrument

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.290
Crucial in the hunt for earth-like worlds James Webb is ideally suited for detecting ozone

00:49:55.859 --> 00:50:03.018
But why ozone because there's no ozone without oxygen and no oxygen without life

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:10.459
so we think it's really something that is a trace of life and in the middle infrared our telescopes can precisely

00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:12.799
detectors this signature of ozone

00:50:15.299 --> 00:50:20.869
The James Webb promises to be the missing piece in the planet hunters arsenal

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.979
With its breakthrough ability to view an earthlike exoplanet

00:50:26.039 --> 00:50:29.718
directly and to study its atmosphere the odds of

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.759
Identifying a destination for a future landing mission have never been better

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.359
You know I can probably imagine what that would feel like

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.720
better than most people can

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.769
I've been sending robotic missions to other planets

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:56.349
My whole career 40 years of this but I can't imagine what it would feel like. I mean the the the problem of

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:03.309
Getting a spacecraft with that kind of capability to another star is so much harder

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:07.768
The discoveries of the planet hunters

00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:13.679
Transformed the way we see the universe and posed to explorers like Steve Squyres

00:51:14.079 --> 00:51:17.818
lead investigator of the Mars rover missions the next

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.430
tantalizing question

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:28.949
What if we could reach out to a nearby alien star and search for life on a second earth

00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:37.979
What if we could land on another rocky world with running water and a protective earth-like atmosphere

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:46.099
If you can find an earth-like world that has been around for billions of years

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:53.899
Enough time to develop advanced biology. It's had the right conditions all that time. There are all kinds of possibilities

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.839
I

00:51:57.839 --> 00:52:03.078
Can't imagine what it wouldn't feel like it's gonna be I mean, it's gonna be a shared moment for all of humanity when it happens

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:15.519
Five four three two

00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:20.589
One I launch

00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:32.649
No fireworks, no trembling

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.979
For those of you who are watching this, I thank you for entrusting me with

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.060
the greatest adventure in human history

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.040
Wish me luck

00:53:03.859 --> 00:53:07.929
My mission is simple find life

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.769
It was only for graduate students and I was in the undergraduate and I nearly got thrown out of the class the first day

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.060
and

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.040
got to be I

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.010
Don't know three or four weeks into the semester

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:43.640
I think I better start thinking about my term paper and there was this place

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:50.570
Then at the time called the Mars room and it was a place where the pictures from Mars were stored

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:58.309
And I went in and I thought I'll sit down for 15 or 20 minutes and flip through some pictures and see if I can

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.530
Come up with an idea for a term paper

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.740
Like most scientists

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:11.890
Principal investigator of the Mars rover missions. Steve Squyres is a born Explorer a

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:14.300
seeker of truth

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:20.590
Amidst the great unknown, I mean ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by maps. I

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:28.630
Was fascinated by a you know remote corners of Tibet or the deep ocean

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.430
Or the other side of the Moon

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.679
Just the idea that there was a place that we hadn't seen yet and

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.710
then me able to go there and see it for the first time that just

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:44.710
That just had a huge appeal for me

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.800
In

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.560
1977 images of the Viking mission changed the course of Squires life

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:59.199
You know, it's not like today where pictures come down from Mars and bang. They're on the internet an hour. Later

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:03.039
There were only a few dozen people in the world. Who'd seen these I

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:08.890
didn't understand what I was looking at in the pictures nobody did but then I would see and the pictures these little

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.760
Valleys that just looked like they had to obtain carved by liquid water

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:18.340
And I was in that room for four hours and I walked out of there knowing exactly

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.650
What I wanted to do with the rest of my life

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.440
Point I'm beyond Ram

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:40.459
In the early 2000s Squires led NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rover missions to Mars

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:49.869
Successfully landing the two robot geologists in a bid to uncover the hidden history of water

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.660
on the Red Planet

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:59.809
Amid these groundbreaking triumphs an even greater frontier beckons

00:56:01.499 --> 00:56:08.899
The discovery of earth-like worlds outside our solar system has transformed the way we see the universe

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.400
and

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.699
presents an irresistible challenge

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:20.960
Why not reach out even further and search for life on the planet among the stars?

00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:27.639
The thing that has driven

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:34.839
the focus of exploration in this solar system has been the search for other forms of life and

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:38.319
So I think the motivation is gonna be the same thing

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.980
I think the motivation when you go to other star systems is going to be

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.269
habitable worlds and

00:56:44.269 --> 00:56:46.989
Possibly worlds with life. That's the thing that's going to

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.779
Draw you to a specific world

00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:57.579
But the scaleless challenge is unlike anything humankind has attempted before

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:05.980
The closest star that hosts an earth-sized planet Proxima Centauri is

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:08.710
4.3 light years away

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.880
over

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.240
170,000 times further than Mars

00:57:14.359 --> 00:57:18.338
The quest to build a spacecraft that can journey to the Stars

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:22.389
will test the greatest explorers of our generation and

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:25.990
demand of them the ultimate sacrifice to

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:31.449
Give all their craft and vision for a dream. They'll never realize

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:34.210
You're asking people to

00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:42.009
Devote their careers their lives to something they will never see to fruition. Now that has happened

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:44.679
That has happened a few times in human history

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:51.429
Some of the great cathedrals of Europe took longer than a human lifespan to build

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.270
People felt guided by a higher power when they did that

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:02.409
But it takes something extraordinary to motivate people to do that kind of thing

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.010
I enter the shadow of Mars

00:58:21.319 --> 00:58:27.889
So Viking colony winking a final farewell from human time

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:41.630
My transceiver dish receives the message moon voyage

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.340
I fly by the storm of Jupiter

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:04.300
Onward to Pluto and Chiron and into the space between stars

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:16.139
After three months of acceleration, my speed is 12 miles per second

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:25.770
I meet Voyager 1

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:31.540
170 years and 45 billion miles from Earth

00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:35.940
You to shift course

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.650
No power to call home

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.340
I

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:51.949
Have now traveled further than any spacecraft performing I

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:57.950
Retract my transceiver

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:03.970
There will be no more calls

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:10.940
And press arms through the silence to me never

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.160
I

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:24.930
Get up each day

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:31.049
With joy, you know, why because I know that day. I'm going to learn something

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:35.309
I didn't know before and that my picture my overall

01:00:35.559 --> 01:00:41.999
tapestry of who we are who I am what our species is and how we got to be that way will be

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760
lifted up

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:53.369
NASA's chief engineer of planetary flight systems Gentry Lee is a pioneer of exploration

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:59.579
At the age of 75 he's dedicated over 50 years of his life

01:00:59.859 --> 01:01:03.479
to engineering robotic missions to other planets

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:11.759
Someone asked me one time if I had to describe the excursions above the threshold of joy in my life

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.799
Would there be a lot of them are just a few and I said I can give you the two

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:21.749
categories right away the birth of my children and I now have eight and

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:28.770
With a spacecraft that I had a major role in achieved something successfully. There's also been eight of those

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.259
Lee's first mission Viking in 1975

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:44.160
Was humanity's opening shot in our dream of exploring the solar system

01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:48.629
Designed to achieve what many thought impossible

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.449
To make the first ever landing on another planet

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.240
Mars

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.010
We had lived through five years of people trying it's not gonna work

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:06.110
You don't have everything under control and we were scared to death that it wouldn't work

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.570
And the moment that first strip of picture came down from planet Mars on July the 20th of

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.360
1976 there were hundreds of us

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.699
Immediately spontaneously tears burst from our eyes

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:40.909
It was at that moment that we knew the human beings who had always been a category one species

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:47.959
Limited to their own earth and this sphere of influence had reached out and become a category two

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.710
species

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:52.220
Ready to explore the entire solar system

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.429
Over the next five decades Lee oversaw successful missions to Jupiter

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:08.839
Pluto and to the comet Tempel 1

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.750
With Lee and other pioneers at the helm

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:21.520
Humanities exploration of the solar system has been so successful. We have a permanent office in space

01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:24.809
the International Space Station

01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:30.579
But as the new dawn of interstellar exploration lights the horizon

01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:39.299
Even the old Sea Dogs. No, it will be the greatest challenge that humankind has ever faced

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:47.100
it is hubris on our part to imagine that we can sit today and

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:52.469
define all the steps that lead us to this plethora of

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.220
Technology advances that we need in the future to build an interstellar spacecraft

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.670
Rather let us do the following thing

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:05.850
That spacecraft must communicate. It must navigate. It must have propulsion

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:08.939
It must have the ability to take data

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:15.750
It's as if Henry the Navigator as the king of Portugal had said I don't even know yet

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:24.179
What kind of ships I need to build or where they need to go. Let me just start with an idea. What floats?

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.850
And

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:38.339
So the infinitely complex quest to search for life amongst the Stars is reduced to just four problems

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.260
Propulsion

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:45.450
Navigation communication

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:52.049
Intelligence each one of them will demand a revolution

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:09.770
I am nine years into my journey 1.2 light-years from Earth

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:17.389
26% of my acceleration phase completely

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:24.949
My speed is 8,000 miles per second

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:32.270
My fuel usage 19% see I

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.520
Jettison my spent fuel cells

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:46.999
I am or course for rival ed Minerva in 31 years time

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.080
His life await me

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.209
When I was about 10 years old I had one of these department store telescopes learned how to use it

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:09.290
Took it out one night and focused it on what I was told was the planet Saturn

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:12.270
And

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:16.969
When I lined up the viewfinder and held it still and I could see Saturn and its rings

01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:24.050
At that moment. I felt a calling and that calling was to learn about how to get there

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:29.779
T-minus 10 9 8 7 6

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:33.620
Liz Johnson answered that calling

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:38.060
becoming a world leading expert in advanced concepts

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.860
At NASA Marshall Space Flight Center

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.529
In 1999 he led pioneering research into interstellar propulsion

01:06:56.690 --> 01:07:01.000
Nature is kind to us in the regard to what options we're going to have to get to the stars

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:07.000
Nature has said you use smart people. You can figure this out. It's just gonna be really hard

01:07:08.599 --> 01:07:10.510
It was difficult enough to go to the moon

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:15.669
We're sending probes to the different planets in the solar system, but to take that leap to go to the stars

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:21.220
The distance is just so much further and requires so much more energy that it's just gonna take some time

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:32.259
The goal of engineering missions to the Stars confronts explorers with distances they've never even

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:34.930
contemplated before

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:39.670
One light here is five point eight trillion miles

01:07:40.249 --> 01:07:44.859
Which makes our nearest star over 24 trillion miles away?

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.969
That's more than a billion round-the-world flights

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.430
According to the masters of solar system exploration

01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:03.730
The greatest challenge is how to propel a spacecraft fast enough to travel light-years within a lifetime

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.839
In order to get humans to make the enormous effort

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.109
required to fly that kind of mission

01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:22.230
You need to have the period of time between when you launch and when you actually get information back

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:26.430
Be no longer than a typical human lifespan

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.420
Humanity has never launched

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.889
Multi-generational voyages of exploration it simply never been done

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:44.220
The distances are just daunting and so

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.960
They're gonna have the major major breakthrough closely a propulsion

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.780
The chemical fuel Rockets like Saturn fire have been the workhorses of solar system exploration

01:09:09.619 --> 01:09:11.859
They got us to the moon in just three days

01:09:16.839 --> 01:09:20.968
But to reach a planet orbiting our nearest star within a generation

01:09:21.429 --> 01:09:27.779
We'd need to travel at a speed that covers the earth to moon distance in just eight seconds

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.180
That's 17% the speed of light

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:38.129
Chemical rockets are great for getting out of the gravity will

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:42.780
You have the the high thrust overcome Earth's gravity

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:47.669
But they're terribly inefficient and in order to get to the stars in a reasonable amount of time

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.180
You're going to need to get up to some pretty high speeds

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.930
And it's not just the thrust

01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:01.470
Its how efficiently you do that? Because if you're inefficient you have to have a lot more fuel and get to a point

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:04.139
Where you can't carry enough fuel to move your own weight

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:16.129
The capability of any propulsion system is governed by the rocket equation a trade-off between thrust

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:18.950
efficiency and weight

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:25.279
The most powerful chemical rocket in operation Falcon heavy

01:10:26.869 --> 01:10:33.069
First launched in 2018 weighed over three million pounds at takeoff and

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400
95% of it was fuel

01:10:38.579 --> 01:10:42.439
It burned through all that fuel in just ten minutes

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:49.429
In order to create enough thrust to deliver, its unusual payload beyond Earth's gravity

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.449
Wherever Starman is going it is Tesla it isn't the stars

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:17.980
Only one chemical powered spacecraft has ever made the leap beyond our solar system

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.340
in 2013

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.860
36 years after its launch Voyager

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.919
1 entered interstellar space at 10.5 miles per second

01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:34.599
fast enough to travel New York to LA in under five minutes

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:39.690
But at less than

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.569
0.0001 percent the speed of light

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.830
Still painfully slow if you're aiming for the stars

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.439
there well beyond what's considered to be the physical boundary of the solar system and

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:57.000
it's taken over 30-some years to get there at that speed they'll take

01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:02.429
70,000 years just to get to the nearest star. No chemical Rockets aren't going to do it

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:12.210
As the push for interstellar exploration gathers pace

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.599
The workhorses of the old space race are put out to pasture

01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:23.790
Monuments to a bygone era

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.740
But if not chemical rockets

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:33.170
What will deliver the seemingly impossible thrust and fuel efficiency required?

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:36.110
To journey to the stars within a lifetime

01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:44.450
Three potential propulsion solutions are being explored today

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:50.080
Fusion antimatter and plasma

01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:55.930
Imagine we want to go to Proxima Centauri the closest star to our solar system at

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.439
4.3 light years away and imagine we want to get there in a few decades

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.310
If we use a conventional rocket, we can show that the amount of fuel we need is greater than the mass of the known universe

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:15.159
On the other hand if we use a plasma thruster, we would only need tens or hundreds of kilograms of fuel

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.560
So then the mission becomes possible

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:26.330
Physicist Stefan Mizzou is working at the cutting edge of electric propulsion

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:31.520
The whole plasma thruster

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:36.729
We start with a fuel in gas form we will Electrify it

01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:41.380
And these electric particles called ions will be ejected at very very very high speed

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:45.010
It's the ejection of his material that will advance the spacecraft

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:58.420
Since the 1970s plasma thrusters have been used in satellites to make positioning adjustments while in orbit

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.599
Their principal advantage is efficiency

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:17.170
Demanding just a tiny fraction of the mass of fuel required by chemical rockets

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.000
Take the example of Voyager 1 which is currently traveling at 60 1,000 kilometers per hour

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:35.230
with a conventional chemical rocket engine you can reach the speed in a few days but consuming 92 tons of fuel a

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:44.229
Plasma thruster used today on satellites would take two years to achieve the speed but consuming only a few kilograms of fuel

01:14:48.409 --> 01:14:50.559
So if you put in a lot more fuel you

01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:56.199
can use the thruster for a lot longer and ultimately achieve a speed much higher than Voyager 1 or

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.300
Even reach a fraction of the speed of light

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:12.769
Plasma engines offer. Hope of achieving the speed required to reach the Stars

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.019
Still holding them back is how long it would take to achieve that speed

01:15:21.409 --> 01:15:24.458
Dragging the total trip time into thousands of years

01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:30.789
But in the shimmering upper atmosphere of our own planet

01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:38.079
Lies the potential for a kind of propulsion until now only dreamt of in the realm of science fiction

01:15:52.489 --> 01:15:54.678
I am the navigator

01:15:57.179 --> 01:16:00.408
My mind is full of stars and

01:16:01.829 --> 01:16:03.829
every planet and

01:16:04.739 --> 01:16:06.739
Every moon

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.580
Every celestial body that is known I know also

01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:25.489
But the dangers my creators did not know of I must discover for myself

01:16:34.889 --> 01:16:36.889
An asteroid field

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.180
I turn to face it head-on

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:59.299
My titanium shield absorbs the impacts

01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:06.619
But one stray penetrates my mind

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:34.199
Emergency backup command system activates. I am reborn

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:43.730
Gage I journeyed on

01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:01.759
In 1995 at the CERN particle collider in Switzerland for the first time in human history

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:10.100
Scientists succeeded in producing the most efficient source of energy achievable within the laws of physics

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:21.169
As any good Star Trek family though right on the enterprise and that's what powered their warp drive

01:18:22.739 --> 01:18:28.819
Where's warp drive a science-fiction drive, but if you if you think about antimatter it's real

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.449
Just like normal matter is protons electrons

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.300
there are anti protons and

01:18:36.209 --> 01:18:37.889
anti-electron

01:18:37.889 --> 01:18:41.179
When matter and antimatter come in contact with in each other

01:18:41.219 --> 01:18:48.049
they annihilate and it essentially is the perfect equal MC squared moment as released as energy and

01:18:50.639 --> 01:18:57.348
Therefore, it's the most efficient battery we can ever build the most efficient battery that nature will allow us to have

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:07.819
Antimatter is created naturally in space and cosmic rays collide with atoms in the Earth's atmosphere

01:19:10.499 --> 01:19:15.499
Producing it at the CERN was a phenomenal scientific and engineering breakthrough

01:19:16.199 --> 01:19:19.879
That required accelerating particles to the speed of light

01:19:20.639 --> 01:19:22.639
and smashing together

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.600
The challenge now is how to create enough of it to propel a spacecraft

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:40.270
This is where it gets tough if you look at the total amount of antimatter produced globally today, it's on the order of nano grams

01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:43.390
you would need on the order of

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.080
kilograms

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.850
Perhaps up to a ton of antimatter to drive a starship

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.250
That's not something I want to do on the earth

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:55.869
Because the amount of energy released if that ton of antimatter met a ton of matter

01:19:56.630 --> 01:20:02.620
Would be catastrophic and so you're going to have to build the ability to get to make your antimatter in space

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:10.870
Far away from the earth and and use that for your starship construction. So again, it's not practical today, but it's not impossible

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:21.059
The stars themselves suggest another possible solution to the propulsion problem

01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:30.199
The energy released from hydrogen atoms fuse together is what lights the sky across the universe

01:20:38.719 --> 01:20:44.529
Since the 1950s scientists have been developing fusion reactors to harness it

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.400
The Sun does it by brute force?

01:20:48.619 --> 01:20:50.619
Has all that mass

01:20:50.749 --> 01:20:55.449
Squeezes all that hydrogen together to form helium releases energy and that's how the Sun shines

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:01.849
It's the holy grail of energy production

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:08.089
Tame the power of the Sun and furnish humanity with an infinite supply of energy

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:14.990
But to get fusion going on earth. You need to generate the heat of the Sun

01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:24.890
Upwards of 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. Well, we've we've achieved fusion on the ground. It's been done

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:29.570
Fusion happens when a hydrogen bomb is detonated which is not what we want

01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:41.329
In the hydrogen bombs of the mid 20th century

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:49.819
The atomic explosion of a radioactive isotope was used to produce the heat required to achieve fusion

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.079
But that explosion of energy was not contained in a way that it could be harnessed

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:04.310
What you want to do is be able to capture the energy source of the Sun in

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:11.479
Order to heat your propellant or to use as propellant to get your spacecraft going fast enough to go to the Stars

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:17.239
Modern reactors achieve fusion by other means

01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:20.090
by heating plasma

01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:22.190
The problem with this approach so far

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:28.579
Is that the energy required to reach that heat has been greater than the energy produced by fusion?

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:35.029
No reactor on earth yet has even reached breakeven

01:22:38.369 --> 01:22:44.869
But at Princeton satellite systems a team of engineers is on a mission to solve that problem and

01:22:45.869 --> 01:22:49.788
To build a fusion reactor that can take us to the stars

01:22:50.519 --> 01:22:53.748
My brother will tell the story that I'm the only person he knows

01:22:53.999 --> 01:22:57.349
That's actually doing what they thought they wanted to do in high school. I

01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:02.840
Identified aerospace engineering I think colleges for aerospace engineering

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:07.610
I've been doing aerospace engineering ever since because it's really fun and challenging. This space is cool

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:11.510
The exhaust velocity that we have

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:19.549
Is only about a hundred kilometers per second when you you can't get there fast unless you got some meaningful thrust

01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:28.999
Aerospace engineer Stephanie Thomas this principal investigator in a NASA funded program to build the world's first

01:23:29.639 --> 01:23:31.639
direct fusion drive

01:23:31.739 --> 01:23:32.969
an

01:23:32.969 --> 01:23:36.078
integrated reactor and propulsion system in one

01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:43.789
They want to reach a neighboring star in the neighborhood of five light-years distance. We want to bring 10,000 kilograms of payload

01:23:43.789 --> 01:23:49.939
That's 10 metric tons. And we need to do it with an exhaust velocity that we can actually achieve with an engine

01:23:54.250 --> 01:24:00.089
Thomas's first challenge is to achieve a constant flow of plasma to catalyze the reactor

01:24:02.389 --> 01:24:06.189
We're getting pulses so a pulsing current through these antennae

01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:12.819
So every time we're running a five millisecond pulse we heat the plasma we generate current you see a flash

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:22.069
But the reactor would be steady-state so instead of flashing like this it would be bright all the time so that's the goal

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:29.659
Rather than using a heavy and hazardous fuel like uranium

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.759
the direct fusion drive runs on a naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen

01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:40.819
Deuterium found all over the earth in water

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:45.200
The drive unit is compact

01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:51.980
At just three feet diameter and eleven yards long is small enough to mount on a spacecraft

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:57.139
We think that we can build the next generation machine in maybe five years

01:24:57.510 --> 01:25:03.199
It will take at least another five years to build a prototype that you could launch but definitely 15 years at the outside

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.319
We think we could have one and put it in space

01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:11.159
At some point we have to visit the stars

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:17.220
We're never gonna just sit here and be content, you know, even when we're visiting the planets because we want to know what's out there

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.229
Everybody wants to go to the stars someday

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:32.789
In the timeline of propulsion technology that someday is getting closer

01:25:33.819 --> 01:25:36.509
The next challenge in our bid for the stars

01:25:37.329 --> 01:25:39.329
is navigation

01:25:56.150 --> 01:26:02.420
I discard my primary engine 15 years out from my destination

01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:12.500
At 32,000 miles per second. My acceleration phase is now complete

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:21.700
I deploy anterior thrusters and engage reverse propulsion

01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:30.639
I said deceleration at minus 104 miles per second squared

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:41.050
Total ship weight now 46,000 tonnes and decreasing

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:46.059
170 pounds per second of propellant burns

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:59.800
I refine my trajectory and set course for Minerva

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.680
In the realm of space exploration

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:23.379
The solar system is our neighborhood

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:31.269
Since visiting the moon in 69 we've dropped in on almost every body around the Sun

01:27:33.619 --> 01:27:40.759
In 2015 the New Horizons probe completed the first flyby of our most distant neighbor

01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:43.409
Pluto

01:27:43.409 --> 01:27:48.259
He took over nine years to get there, but at every step of the way

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:53.150
The unmanned spacecraft was guided remotely from Earth

01:27:55.679 --> 01:27:59.388
The way we navigate today when we send these probes out

01:27:59.389 --> 01:28:02.179
even the one that went to Pluto is we have a

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:08.719
Combination of data taken by the flying spacecraft and our big computers here on the earth and a processing

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:11.060
radio information that comes from a spacecraft

01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:13.010
when we went by Pluto

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:20.239
We were basically so accurate that we were hitting a golf ball into a hole from Los Angeles to London

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.760
That's how accurate that was done

01:28:25.409 --> 01:28:29.329
Sending directions to probes works for solar system exploration

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:37.549
But as we set our sights on the Stars, the distances are so enormous a new question emerges

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.360
How to navigate a journey of

01:28:41.909 --> 01:28:48.079
Light-years if we were ever to go explore a planet around another star

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:56.690
The distance would be so great that the machine would have to essentially operate on its own we call that autonomy

01:28:57.030 --> 01:29:02.060
We're taking big steps in that direction with curiosity. We did a lot

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.920
Landed on Mars in 2012

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:14.159
Curiosity was the first spacecraft equipped with an autonomous navigation system

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:21.780
Given coordinates by Mission Control the rover could image its surroundings and

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.990
compute a safe path across the Martian landscape

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:33.209
But for an interstellar mission there will be no relay instructions

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:39.390
all the navigation would have to be onboard all the algorithms the

01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:46.290
Computations of the orbit the computations of the maneuvers to get to the right place. What stars to look at is for this year

01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:48.290
What stars to look at for next year?

01:29:49.810 --> 01:29:57.660
What we would have to do is extend our minds to imagine all the possibilities that they might run into and we would spend

01:29:58.030 --> 01:30:04.559
Literally years building this hierarchy of possibilities into this artificial intelligent machine

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:07.530
It would have to know at all times

01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:13.770
how well Holland's critical systems were doing and how to fix them if they weren't working, right and

01:30:14.170 --> 01:30:17.850
how to replace them if they couldn't be fixed what a challenge

01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.100
I

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:42.479
Enter the Minerva star system forty nine point six years since my departure

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:56.510
I reopened my transceiver and prepare to send the message home

01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:07.050
Have arrived

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:16.330
With any mission

01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:18.330
Communication is paramount

01:31:18.489 --> 01:31:20.879
Most spacecraft do not return

01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:24.479
Instead they send their data back to earth

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.969
When great distances in the speed of light

01:31:30.489 --> 01:31:36.239
Get involved. It becomes a very very different sort of experience simple words like now

01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:39.239
take on a kind of a different meaning I

01:31:40.150 --> 01:31:44.730
Remember when we were landing on Mars from when you hit the top of the Martian atmosphere to when you're on the surface takes about?

01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:45.489
six minutes

01:31:45.489 --> 01:31:51.119
At that time the one what we call the one-way light time how long it takes a signal to travel at the speed of light

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.709
From Mars to earth was ten minutes. All systems are go we are currently committed

01:31:56.290 --> 01:31:58.499
Away from hitting the top of party Mountaineer

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:03.239
so we're sitting there in the control room and we're watching the radio signal and we're watching the

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:08.160
Spacecraft begins to slow down and curve down in the Martian atmosphere. It's just at the top of the atmosphere

01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:13.080
The reality is out at Mars. It's been on the surface for four minutes. I

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:14.680
mean of

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:20.069
193 miles per hour weird and it may be a happy healthy Rover or maybe a smoking hole in the ground, and I don't know

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.850
But I'm watching this and I'm not seeing

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.640
reality at that moment and

01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:31.589
Magnify that so instead of 10 minutes is 10 years

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:44.349
Communication with every craft currently in space is conducted via the giant dishes of the deep space network

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:50.800
Each powerful enough to track a signal from Pluto. They're stronger than a CB radio

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:59.440
All of our deep space communications are run through the deep space network, that's an array of very large satellite dishes

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.200
They're set up at three locations around the world

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:08.740
One is in California at Goldstone. One is in Australia Canberra and one is in Spain at Madrid

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.580
we need a

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:15.460
Very large dish area in order to collect all the energy and be able to communicate all the way out at places like Pluto

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.040
where our spacecraft are going

01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:26.970
In 2014 Mathew Abramson was mission manager of a radical new form of communication

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:31.110
Installed on the International Space Station

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.529
designed to overcome the limitation of

01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:37.170
traditional radio transmission

01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:41.640
The limitation is primarily that the distance that were sending the transmission over

01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:46.140
we send out that signal it spreads out over time and over space and so

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.899
As AI spreads out. It dilutes the signal power

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:55.529
the further out you go the lower and lower your data rate is or gets out to the level of something like your

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.900
dial-up modems that we used to have many years ago

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:07.620
When the New Horizons probes sent back pictures from Pluto via radio transmission

01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:14.940
The signal was so weak it took 15 months to downlink the images

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.729
from a 12-hour flyby

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:24.290
But with the technology Abramson launched and tested in 2014

01:34:25.230 --> 01:34:28.969
That download time could be reduced to just one day

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.489
By sending data back to earth on beams of light

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:46.219
The idea is you take a focused laser beam and send the signal same signal over that beam

01:34:46.219 --> 01:34:50.839
But it's much more efficient because you have this focused signal that's not spreading out as much over time

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.830
Laser wavelengths are packed much more densely than sound waves. So

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:06.290
They transmit more information per second and with a stronger signal

01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:12.379
The greater bandwidth allows spacecraft to downlink multiple large packets of data

01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:16.279
simultaneously and in record time

01:35:19.770 --> 01:35:24.560
The reason for that is this we go further out into the universe and we go to a place like Mars and Jupiter

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:29.960
Currently today, we're just getting back single images of the science and in the future

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.299
If you do have a high bandwidth system like an optical system

01:35:32.369 --> 01:35:38.269
You could get back high-definition video and I think getting high-definition video back would be a game-changer for space exploration

01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:54.439
I fly by the gas giants exoplanet Miniver. See I

01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:04.459
Use its atmosphere to create drag and pull me in towards my target

01:36:10.190 --> 01:36:16.160
I trace an elliptical trajectory around the Minerva son

01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:24.449
And emerge to take my first glimpse of my new hog

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.390
I decoupled from my antenna

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.749
My Explorer module holds my mind

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:57.730
I commence entry landing and descent sequence

01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:14.710
Enter orbit, so close now

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.519
I deploy my satellites to map the surface

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:30.830
And scalped potential landing sites

01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:45.170
Is this new world ready to be known

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.270
The part of this that is thrilling to me is

01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:35.150
that our

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:36.810
best

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:38.810
attributes if done correctly

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.440
Exploration at its finest

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:50.210
Have been programmed into an extension of our species it belongs to no single individual

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.080
it is more than anything else a

01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:56.760
symbol of

01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:03.350
Humanity working together to create something whose only purpose is to gather knowledge

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.100
what a

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.100
beautiful thought

01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:12.620
And after a long period of time

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.320
Finally the moment of truth is coming

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.520
and

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.640
More than likely the people that designed it originally are no longer alive

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.650
Welcome to the ops lab francesca

01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:31.700
And they have passed on this thrill this passion to their children and perhaps even to their grandchildren

01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:35.120
Okay, we're gonna walk around on Mars Francesca

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.840
Will it be that they found life

01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:45.789
Will it be that they found a planet where we could someday exist?

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:50.919
Whatever it is, it will be a historical milestone unlike any other

01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:57.760
That

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.140
Moment when something new is revealed that no one's ever seen before

01:40:02.110 --> 01:40:04.380
That's just glorious. That's exploration

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:09.719
And it's gonna happen when we go to other worlds around other stars in a very very very big way

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.590
we'll be sitting back on earth and that downlink will come and

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:20.190
The video or the pictures or the spectra or whatever it is. They're gonna come up on a screen. Everybody's jaws are just gonna drop

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:41.380
This could be the end

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:48.430
I really caPSURE into the unknown

01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:56.180
If I touch down

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:05.119
If I am welcome if I find life

01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:11.179
This could be the beginning

01:41:25.290 --> 01:41:29.410
And I am ready to touchdown I

01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:34.930
Am ready to explore

01:41:39.489 --> 01:41:42.789
And ready to discover life

01:42:00.670 --> 01:42:08.520
Four and a half billion years ago in the nursery of the heavens the star was born

01:42:11.250 --> 01:42:13.799
a giant cloud of dust and gas

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.740
distended and ballooned

01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.000
Until under the burden of its gravity it collapsed upon itself

01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.700
swirled into a disc and

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.580
forged a solar system from the dust that

01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:30.359
Star was our son

01:42:40.249 --> 01:42:47.349
Of the planets that were formed only one that we know of gave rise to life

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:04.640
But could our Sun our solar system our living earth

01:43:06.159 --> 01:43:08.668
Have produced the only Genesis

01:43:10.059 --> 01:43:12.059
among the stars

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.639
My intuition is that the universe is full of life

01:43:28.559 --> 01:43:33.799
There's no reason fundamentally it might not look like Earth with vegetation and animals

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.089
But the question I'm interested is really the start of life

01:43:44.249 --> 01:43:49.969
And on earth we see for a long time life is just microbial with all the essential features of life

01:43:49.969 --> 01:43:54.678
were there nothing new was invented when life became trees and animals it was just

01:43:55.230 --> 01:43:57.230
Morphological that's just window dressing

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.529
To me it's actually not very interesting at all

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:06.769
everything interesting with respect to biology was present when there were no trees and no animals and life was just

01:44:07.139 --> 01:44:13.489
Microscopic the DNA was there. The amino acids was there all the biochemical machinery that makes life life was there

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.369
Life is a miracle and an enigma

01:44:21.570 --> 01:44:25.190
Even to those who spent their own lives trying to crack the code

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.189
NASA planetary scientist Chris. McKay is one of them

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:37.459
Part of a generation of scientists on a quest to find a second genesis

01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:40.110
beyond earth

01:44:40.110 --> 01:44:43.969
The search for life began with a lot of optimism focused on Mars

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.480
Here was a planet that could have had a thick atmosphere

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:58.939
Could have had water in the recent past and in the popular literature at least still had water so the search for life on Mars

01:44:59.610 --> 01:45:01.140
really was

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.140
Fought to be easy

01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:05.460
in

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:10.730
1976 NASA's Viking mission made the first ever landing on the Martian surface

01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:16.579
Looking for the life that had been hoped for well

01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:22.669
Turned out a lot harder nature was guarding her secrets much more closely than we imagined

01:45:24.130 --> 01:45:31.500
So then things basically went quiet in the search for life, and I think they were sparked again. Not on Mars

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500
But in the outer solar system

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.130
Three two one

01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:44.889
Liftoff of the Cassini spacecraft on a Trek to Saturn

01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:49.130
In the final decades of the 20th century

01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:53.180
humanity launched a series of ambitious missions

01:45:53.910 --> 01:46:00.499
To explore the outer solar system standing by for solid rocket boosters all systems go at this time

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.709
The discovery of liquid water on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and

01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:17.709
The misty plumes of Enceladus and the subterranean oceans of Europa and Ganymede has

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.429
Opened a thrilling new chapter in the search for a second Genesis

01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:31.449
The impact of identifying a separate origin of life on one of these worlds

01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:36.190
Would extend far beyond our solar system?

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:43.090
Finding life that's distinctly different that truly represents the second genesis of life

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:46.479
Well, that would tell us that the answer is not one

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.790
It's two in terms of life in the universe and going from one to two is huge

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:57.429
Because on the scale of the universe the only numbers that make sense are 0 1 and infinity

01:46:59.210 --> 01:47:05.260
And what we learn in our solar system will then guide how we search for life beyond

01:47:15.469 --> 01:47:22.989
The renewed optimism in the search for life within our solar system emerged alongside a discovery that

01:47:23.599 --> 01:47:25.599
Transformed the way we see the universe

01:47:28.610 --> 01:47:32.380
In the early 2000s nasa's kepler telescope

01:47:32.989 --> 01:47:37.779
reveal that every star in the galaxy just like our Sun is

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.659
orbited by at least one planet

01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:51.630
And up to a quarter of these so-called exoplanets are believed to be suitable for life

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:01.780
In the Milky Way alone

01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:09.509
That means roughly 400 billion solar systems and 80 billion potentially habitable worlds

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:17.189
The odds of finding a second Genesis have never been better

01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:36.750
The way I like to think of this is that life will arise anywhere where the conditions are

01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:41.370
Right and the trick in that is what constitutes the right conditions?

01:48:43.570 --> 01:48:49.890
Planetary scientist Jonathan, Lennon is another veteran in the hunt of a life beyond Earth

01:48:54.280 --> 01:49:00.149
But what exactly is life and how does one search for it

01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:08.700
The basic essentials for life to begin and to exist are liquid water

01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.860
Organic molecules because carbon is really the essential

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:20.190
Versatile element that can combine with other elements in many different ways to make the structures of life

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.040
free energy and

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:30.960
Minerals and nitrogen to provide the other elements that are required to keep the chemistry going

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.130
to generate

01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:40.139
Catalysts that generate more catalysts and more structures until we get to the complexity of a primitive cell

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:49.729
Liquid water carbon molecules energy minerals

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.500
And the secret formula that animates it all into a living cell

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.249
These ingredients this recipe for life

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.120
Is what our scientists are hunting for or other worlds

01:50:28.449 --> 01:50:30.449
I

01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:35.050
Deploy my spider BOTS on to the main event surface

01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:43.659
I've 3d print a fleet of drones and I let them fly

01:50:52.799 --> 01:50:58.889
With these eyes and these instruments I would taste and touch

01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:04.309
This new world for the first time

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:11.370
Will I find all that is hopeful

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:27.809
Exoplanets of a new frontier in the search for life beyond Earth

01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:36.030
but the prospect of exploring distant worlds presents an expanding universe of rivers to cross and

01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:38.430
mountains to climb

01:51:41.499 --> 01:51:47.009
How on earth can we prepare to explore planets we know so little about

01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:55.709
Exoplanets presents a real challenge because there's so much uncertainty

01:51:57.070 --> 01:52:03.929
So knowing whether or not you're going to find a cliff face versus a desert versus an ocean versus an ice tundra

01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:07.130
We may not know when we launched

01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:14.659
So you've got to design your system to survive and operate in all of those possible conditions

01:52:17.739 --> 01:52:20.879
At NASA's robotics headquarters in Pasadena, California

01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:28.920
Around 100 young engineers are busy reinventing the wheels of the Rovers evolved

01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:34.949
With planetary exploration we started with a large robot

01:52:34.949 --> 01:52:41.159
That was very stable very safe. And now we're beginning to take more risk. We're trying to get to new places

01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:45.719
Trying to shrink down the size of the platform do more with less

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:50.909
It's a pretty perfect ledge over there. Yeah, sort of thing other Rovers can't fit into

01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:03.640
Some of our robots are designed to climb up different surfaces

01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:06.949
So we have a claw

01:53:06.949 --> 01:53:10.269
inspired robot that uses sharp hooks to grab on to the

01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:14.289
Rough surface kind of like an insect or a rock climber would scale up a cliff

01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:19.360
We also use electrostatics to stick to surfaces

01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:24.160
So this is like rubbing the balloon on your head and it sticks to the wall

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:36.550
One of the key innovations in the new breed of Robotics is biomimicry

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:42.219
using biological systems processes as the model for design

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:47.100
To look for life behave like life

01:53:48.370 --> 01:53:52.769
We have created a material that has mechanical properties similar to that

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:58.529
You see in biological tissues we have already with this system developed swimming robots

01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:08.699
There is a lot of work today in robots that can go between dry surfaces and water like surfaces

01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:16.439
Wherever we find water on earth we find life. So we have a strategy that we've used on Mars called follow the water

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:20.399
I think we're going to use that same strategy when we visit an exoplanet

01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:35.149
I follow the Louvre you of a retreating glacier

01:54:38.010 --> 01:54:41.370
My hygrometers detect increasing humidity

01:54:47.309 --> 01:54:52.018
I am on the scent of fresh water

01:54:54.879 --> 01:54:56.879
Tracing its inevitable course

01:54:59.239 --> 01:55:02.799
It's branching channels over wide floodplains

01:55:07.369 --> 01:55:09.369
Consuming rock and mineral

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.600
Now growing brackish perhaps estuary

01:55:23.239 --> 01:55:29.268
Fresh water and sediments meeting the insistent flow of an incoming tide

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:36.059
There is a river ocean system or may never be

01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:42.510
An ideal breeding ground for life

01:55:56.269 --> 01:55:59.799
This is a place where there's life but stout life is we're familiar with

01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:11.369
Here life is painted living and saturated soft. It's not the kind of green things. We normally think of his life

01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:17.489
The salt palms of San Francisco Bay are naturally occurring wetland

01:56:18.969 --> 01:56:21.209
reshaped by human industry and

01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:26.040
colonized by trillions of colored micro organisms

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.449
These are type of hail philic archaea, it's a particularly unusual type of microorganism

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.480
It's extrema file

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:42.539
it requires high salt and it lives in an environment where only it can survive so it

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:46.860
Dominates so where it grows it grows well and and it's the king

01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:55.679
What these salty bugs have in common with everything from oak trees to humans is access to liquid water

01:56:58.790 --> 01:57:05.259
All life on Earth in some sense is fragile, it's all tied to the availability in the chemistry of water

01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:13.739
We tend to think while life on earth has expanded to all the corners of the earth and it is really it's everywhere

01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:17.850
That's because water is everywhere in this planet. This is a water planet

01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:24.419
When we look beyond the earth we realized that water is in fact rare

01:57:24.489 --> 01:57:28.709
The liquid state of water is rare and life is not the all-conquering

01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:34.739
Capability a life is only can squeeze itself into those environments where there's liquid water

01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:49.640
Waters interesting in that if we look at carbon, which is the next part of the recipe for life

01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:57.379
where water is liquid carbon can be a solid a dissolved ion or a gas all

01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:59.870
coexisting in the same place

01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:05.299
Carbon is an unusual element in that it is capable of making

01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:11.929
Many many different kinds of molecules. There are literally millions of organic molecules now

01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:21.750
And water then becomes the milieu in which all of the chemistry of carbon that leads to us is going to take place

01:58:25.349 --> 01:58:30.919
Carbon-based organic molecules, like amino acids are the building blocks of life

01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:37.520
Combining in liquid water to form the structures of every living cell

01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:45.810
On earth today these complex molecules are everywhere but where did they come from?

01:58:52.439 --> 01:58:56.389
On earth the problem we have in the scenario of the origin of life

01:58:56.389 --> 01:59:03.049
Is that when the earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago, it had a turbulent period in its infancy

01:59:03.689 --> 01:59:07.279
With very intense meteor bombardment. It has an awesome

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:19.260
It was an extremely hot environment which is not conducive to the emergence of complex organic molecules

01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:30.539
One of the ideas that emerged around this is could some of this organic matter have come from space

01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:42.490
In March 2004 the European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft

01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:48.159
on a hunt for the building blocks of life beyond Earth

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.920
its destination was

01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:58.089
250 million miles away and Counting the moving target hurtling through space at

01:59:59.270 --> 02:00:01.270
37,000 miles per hour a

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:05.470
lump of ice and dust the size of Mount Fuji the

02:00:06.170 --> 02:00:08.170
Comet 67p

02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:14.559
Rosetta's mission was to land on it and find out that it's made of

02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:23.230
From 2011 onwards Nikola Altobelli was Rosetta project scientist

02:00:25.610 --> 02:00:32.350
We think that comets when they were formed remain somewhat frozen in a state that has not changed for billions of years

02:00:34.190 --> 02:00:40.690
So the idea is maybe they've incorporated the organic material that was already present in the molecular cloud

02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:43.390
from which the solar system evolved resistance

02:00:47.999 --> 02:00:55.609
Because comets formed in the icy outer regions they hold a frozen record of the solar system's birth

02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:02.760
And as the young earth cooled and oceans formed around four billion years ago

02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:05.490
some of those same comments

02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:07.950
Came crashing down to earth

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:13.260
So, could it have been comments

02:01:13.810 --> 02:01:20.490
Bearing the carbon-based organic molecules from our solar system's birth that seeded life on earth

02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:27.119
It was the task of Rosetta's landing module fillet to find out

02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:38.550
The landing was a time of very strong emotions and it took place over a full day

02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:41.340
It was the 12th of November 2014

02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:54.750
In the morning there was confirmation of the separation

02:02:01.210 --> 02:02:06.060
The first image arrived taken by the lander when it was separating from Rosetta

02:02:08.590 --> 02:02:10.860
Then there were seven hours of waiting

02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:18.969
Around 4:00 p.m. Came the confirmation of touchdown

02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:28.230
But the follow up signals suggested something wasn't right

02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:39.119
The first panoramic images that were taken of the surface showed an orientation of the lander which was not as it should have been

02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:44.639
And as the hours passed we realized that the anchor had failed

02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:52.490
Filet had bounced back into space

02:02:53.700 --> 02:03:00.139
Then bounced a second time before finally coming to rest several hundred meters away. I

02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:11.449
Remember someone saying filet dances a little Samba but we perform most of the scientific experiments that were planned

02:03:14.730 --> 02:03:21.649
One could even say because it bounced in several places it allowed us to obtain data from different areas of the comet

02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:25.610
And the orbiter perfectly fulfilled its mission

02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:32.430
The results were remarkable

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.030
Fillet detected 16 organic molecules in

02:03:38.370 --> 02:03:42.799
Just a tiny sample of dust kicked up by the initial touchdown

02:03:43.770 --> 02:03:47.870
Among them some of the key building blocks of life on earth

02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:56.510
50 percent by mass of the dust particles ejected by the comet is organic a carbon-based material

02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:03.199
This organic material came from the molecular cloud from which the solar system was formed

02:04:09.519 --> 02:04:13.209
And thus may have seated earth with all this organic material

02:04:13.730 --> 02:04:20.079
The organic molecules necessary for the emergence of life on Earth were already present in space

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:32.999
Rosetta demonstrated that the building blocks of life on earth were created during the birth of our solar system

02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:41.530
But what about beyond

02:04:42.889 --> 02:04:48.338
Could these same vital ingredients be part of the birth of all stars?

02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:58.690
Looking back at our own earth and why we have this which you know biosphere

02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:06.279
Well, I think it all started with having all this organic material that we are made up of but that was delivered from space

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.800
from comets and from asteroids

02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:17.500
So we were thinking about the likelihood of life elsewhere. We're pretty much thinking about the likelihood of having that same scenario taking place

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.600
In 2015

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:26.650
Hi, honey, arid mountains of the Atacama Desert

02:05:27.710 --> 02:05:31.629
Professor Karen Oberg set out on a hunt for the building blocks of life

02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:39.279
In the birth cloud of an alien star system for the help of a new telescope called Alma

02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:41.570
Alma

02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:45.429
Consists of 66 individual telescopes that's all working together

02:05:46.610 --> 02:05:49.809
it operates at millimetre wavelengths and

02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:56.829
Millimeter wavelengths is where we can detect molecules tell these organic molecules that we are so interested in

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:06.409
Obert turned Alma's gaze towards the Taurus system and found the young star

02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:09.950
MWC 480 in the throes of labor

02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:18.979
Girdled by a disc of gas and dust from which planets were being born

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:24.979
We see this dust and gas surrounding these dis young stars and

02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:32.029
What's even more exciting we see that they often have little lanes or tracks in them where it looks like?

02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:34.460
Confirmation is going on right now

02:06:38.159 --> 02:06:40.909
After months of collecting and analyzing the data

02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:43.820
Oberg announced a discovery that

02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:49.489
bluesy odds wide open of finding a second Genesis on other worlds

02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:53.929
In the disk of this alien solar system

02:06:54.449 --> 02:07:00.469
Alma had detected some of the same organic molecules that helped give rise to life on Earth

02:07:02.489 --> 02:07:08.209
We found three kinds of cyanides three molecules and the same chemical family and

02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:13.219
Those three kinds of molecules have also been found in our own solar system in comets

02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:19.370
The same organic molecules

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:22.020
with the same molecular

02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:26.120
Spacial to create life are out there among the stars

02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:34.029
Chemistry is awesome is the reason that we are alive and that we're here in the first place

02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:40.329
So far is only, you know one system apart from our solar system where we have this chemical information

02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:48.519
But my intuition would be that it's going to be very common. This kind of chemistry is gonna be

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.100
almost universal

02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:08.359
I scan for sites or geochemical activity

02:08:12.579 --> 02:08:17.619
I find a hydrothermal field of fuel's and hot springs

02:08:23.170 --> 02:08:29.009
On earth such conditions are rich in carbon chemistry and minerals

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:39.179
I find another mineral-rich water source upstream

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:48.889
I identify complex molecular structure in solution

02:08:53.949 --> 02:08:57.699
I extract a sample for analysis

02:09:05.409 --> 02:09:07.569
And return it to the lander module

02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:17.849
Could this be evidence of life?

02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:31.359
Let's get the samples yet ya

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.960
Can take another measurement

02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:40.479
The laws of chemistry and physics are universal so

02:09:41.179 --> 02:09:47.199
It's a given that when we go to another earth-like planet with water

02:09:47.690 --> 02:09:52.209
with the sorts of minerals that we have here in the iron core and

02:09:52.969 --> 02:09:54.969
atmosphere is

02:09:55.159 --> 02:09:58.989
Inevitable that this kind of simple chemistry would have been present

02:10:00.679 --> 02:10:06.768
Okay, it's 15 degrees up here, let's see what this little guy has for us

02:10:08.789 --> 02:10:16.279
As long as there's a chance for energy to interact with that mixture things will happen Wow, look at that

02:10:17.070 --> 02:10:19.099
One degree. Keep going up the

02:10:19.889 --> 02:10:26.328
Question that we are heading for right now how certain can we be that that mix of simple chemistry?

02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:31.009
Could take the next step in complexity so life could begin

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:40.130
In the hydrothermal fields of thumpers Hill California, all the ingredients of life are brought together

02:10:41.610 --> 02:10:45.830
water carbon molecules energy minerals

02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:53.029
Biologists David Deamer and Bruce Damer believe

02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:57.949
This is the kind of environment where life could get started on another world

02:10:59.699 --> 02:11:01.699
Bubbling pools

02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:03.800
strange colored rocks

02:11:04.170 --> 02:11:06.170
water of different PHS

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:12.859
All kinds of flows and dynamics steam rising. It. Looks like nature's chemistry set and

02:11:14.070 --> 02:11:19.400
It's an engine an actual engine for the beginning of a living system

02:11:24.469 --> 02:11:27.308
Conditions like this define the early Earth

02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:34.199
Evidence of similar environments has been found on Mars and

02:11:35.199 --> 02:11:40.408
Researchers expect hydrothermal fields to be a common feature of earth-like exoplanets

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:47.520
But how might nature's chemistry set cook up the recipe of life

02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:57.519
Everything that's alive is in fact based on polymers. Everybody knows the name DNA nucleic acid

02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:00.520
That's one of the polymers proteins. These are

02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:06.819
Amino acid polymers and that's basically the start of all life. Are those two polymers?

02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:20.299
So what we're doing is taking small molecules the pieces of a polymer called monomers in fact

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:25.940
And we're exposing them to energy such as you see here at bumpass. Hell and

02:12:26.250 --> 02:12:32.629
Seeing where that energy is sufficient to make those monomers link up one after another after another

02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:37.729
To make a polymer and in fact if we can make big protein like molecule

02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:43.370
And a nucleic acid like molecule and put it into a little wrapper a compartment

02:12:43.650 --> 02:12:46.430
We were on the way we call those protocells

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:52.779
Each sample contains organic molecules or monomers

02:12:53.450 --> 02:13:00.340
Exposed to the mineral-rich steam and heat energy of the fumarole in an attempt to form a protocell

02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:06.640
We think that drying out such as you see all around us here at la pucelle water

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:10.719
Coming in then drying out coming in drying out. That's a cycle

02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:16.929
We think that that cycle is very important to drive the process by which polymers are

02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.370
synthesized and then

02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:21.110
accumulate

02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:23.110
Let's go for it

02:13:26.179 --> 02:13:28.509
Failure you sure yes

02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:35.960
The first experiment fails just as it would do many times on an earthlike exoplanet

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:47.280
But if all the elements were present in conditions such as this this experiment in life would repeat again and again

02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:52.599
But some of them got a lot of liquid in one last try

02:13:53.570 --> 02:13:58.150
given enough time and keep in mind we have an entire planet with

02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:04.780
Lots of volcanic land masses coming up with lots of puddles like this trying to learn how to become a life

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:08.979
Mostly its failures, but it would only take a few successful

02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:15.010
Protocells that happen to be able to survive and had learned how to make more of themselves

02:14:18.610 --> 02:14:21.119
So go ahead and get them into the boxes

02:14:31.309 --> 02:14:34.248
Is the universe made to make life

02:14:37.319 --> 02:14:44.299
This is a huge question that sort of beyond the scope of perhaps humans to be able to answer

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:55.360
But what we can observe is everything comes down to cycling it comes to rhythms and

02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:58.030
overlapping rhythms and patterns

02:14:58.550 --> 02:15:03.910
And it's almost as though if you get the right cycling and patterning in a system

02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:09.279
It learns how to do that itself and how to lift itself into being

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:15.190
And so perhaps that's the closest metaphor that we know

02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:21.910
That the geology gave us that ability the moon going around the earth gave us tides

02:15:22.730 --> 02:15:25.959
The rotation of the earth gives us days and nights

02:15:27.110 --> 02:15:34.989
Rainfall into these hydrothermal fields gives us geysers that are periodic and life still follows rhythmic patterns

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:52.150
That's the clue we have so perhaps it's the universal harmonic that creates life

02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:10.150
Most of us tend to think of things are either alive or dead

02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:18.240
But the transition from not alive the inanimate states the animate state

02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:24.929
Is that transition only possible as a single step or is it possible as a series of steps?

02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:33.290
If it's possible as a series of steps then the intermediate States would be partially alive

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:37.310
Now you might say well come on

02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:39.979
It's either alive or it's not and I would say well

02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.440
The live means it's got sounds the cells are replicating. The cells are doing this that and the other

02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:48.079
You need all of that to be fully alive

02:16:49.770 --> 02:16:55.159
But the chance of getting that all in one go seems a little bit remote so maybe we got one of the attributes

02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:02.509
On and then it acquires another attribute and another and eventually it reaches the point where it is fully alive

02:17:10.530 --> 02:17:15.350
Professor John Sutherland is trying to retrace the steps in the origins of life

02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:20.359
in search of the processes that animate a cell into being

02:17:23.139 --> 02:17:24.300
Of course

02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:26.460
The cell is more than just the chemicals that comprise it

02:17:26.559 --> 02:17:33.149
Because her cell has just died is still the chemicals that are there. So there's something that energizes it that coordinates it and

02:17:33.849 --> 02:17:37.349
We don't know how to get that but that's fast goal

02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:50.879
So what we're doing here is putting the sample into an apparatus in which it will be irradiated by ultraviolet light

02:17:53.889 --> 02:17:58.949
In a series of experiments that simulated the conditions of a young rocky planet

02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:05.490
Sutherland successfully achieved stage 1 in producing the basic components of a cell

02:18:06.219 --> 02:18:07.750
lipids proteins

02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:09.340
sugars and

02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:11.340
nucleic acids

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:16.770
What we found is that you can make all of the components for life under slightly different conditions

02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:24.900
When you first see it happen, it's like magic but it isn't magic it it's not as hard to make as we originally thought

02:18:31.229 --> 02:18:38.238
All the hardware of a cell can be created from a single base molecule that's widespread among the stars

02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:43.950
But what about the next step

02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:50.249
How is that hardware organized and energized into life?

02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:58.049
If the conditions are the same elsewhere what are the chance that you can give them building blocks to life

02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:05.920
The chemistry of cells is unique and self-organized

02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:14.979
So one part of chemistry is actually controlling another and yet somehow that's controlling the first one

02:19:15.979 --> 02:19:22.749
Chemists are used to controlling the chemistry themselves and the idea of letting things run and go off of their own accord

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:29.080
Is something that goes slightly against your chemical education? How can chemistry take place if you like with the experiment - just

02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:32.319
Setting the system up and then letting it go over zone record

02:19:43.550 --> 02:19:46.389
Life is information that can reproduce itself

02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:55.059
Not hardware. It's genetic information. That's the key to life is the information and the DNA and the ability of the DNA to

02:19:55.819 --> 02:19:57.939
express that information in proteins and

02:19:58.939 --> 02:20:00.939
propagate the information that way

02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:06.580
DNA is the blueprint for all of life on earth an

02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:11.739
instruction book for how to make and maintain all living organisms

02:20:14.869 --> 02:20:19.479
Encoded in the twin coiling lines of a double helix is the genetic information

02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:24.819
That tells life to build a rose or a leopard or a blue whale

02:20:28.159 --> 02:20:34.329
If we find DNA on other worlds, there's no doubt that there's been life there the

02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:44.949
Characteristic molecules of life makes genetic molecules that contain information like DNA these molecules do not arise

02:20:46.369 --> 02:20:51.639
Non-biologically, they have to be built the surest as if we find a skyscraper on Mars

02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:55.510
We know that it was built and it's not just a random assemblage of rocks

02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:59.290
That's how we'll find evidence of life

02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:17.609
My lander module prepares to uplink the sample data from the hydrothermal field

02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:28.899
My optical communication transmitted via hybrid silicon laser at 12 gigabits per second

02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:36.639
I received the signal and ingest the data for analysis

02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:44.829
Organic polymeric triple helix structure

02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:52.420
Some consistency with terrestrial forms and

02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:54.440
Yet

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:57.220
unlike anything I've seen before a

02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:01.720
bio molecule of alien life

02:22:15.890 --> 02:22:19.119
We've come to a place deep in the outback of Australia

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:25.089
Looking for what we think is evidence for the oldest life on earth

02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:34.350
Astrobiologist martin van cran donk is travelling back in time

02:22:35.890 --> 02:22:40.140
To the dawn of life on earth of the three and a half billion years ago

02:22:42.729 --> 02:22:47.669
Conveniently recorded in the ancient rocks of australia's remote northwest

02:22:50.619 --> 02:22:54.479
At this time in early Earth there was a very different planet to what we have today

02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:03.649
We would have had some shallow seas but those seas would have been green because they were rich in iron

02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:11.139
And if we looked up at the sky the sky wouldn't have been the beautiful blue that we see behind us here on

02:23:11.989 --> 02:23:15.339
Early Earth without oxygen the sky would have been orange

02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:21.189
we receive black continents of fresh basaltic lava that

02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:32.439
Would have been very active so there have been faults and earthquakes there would have been bubbling geysers that were going off

02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:36.870
It was actually a very alien

02:23:40.829 --> 02:23:43.579
Yet this alien earth was already inhabited

02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:51.419
Colonizing the shores of the crater lakes and the Seas that wash the ancient Pilbara landmass

02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:54.989
Was a living skin of slime

02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:04.989
But the bacterial communities that left the clearest fossil calling card built up their homes

02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:07.839
in high-rise mounds

02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:15.940
so the really wonderful thing about this outcrop is that you can look down and see the seafloor so long ago and

02:24:16.430 --> 02:24:23.590
Really you get this incredible view of the gentle undulations of the water moving across the surface

02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:31.450
But then popping up through our these domes and cone shapes all irregular different sizes different shapes

02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:39.880
These distinctive bumps of a fossilized dwellings of the oldest living organisms on earth

02:24:42.650 --> 02:24:47.319
It was here over three and a half billion years ago that stromatolites

02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:51.610
First raised their heads above the water of an ancient Shaw

02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:58.740
They can start to get a feel for life grabbing a foothold in

02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:01.620
the geological record

02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:06.329
And so this currently still is the oldest evidence for life on Earth. It's our

02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:13.110
Great-great-great great-great, great-great, grandmother's and grandfathers. That's really the the precursor to everything that came later

02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:17.849
All the green bushes and the trees it all started here

02:25:25.170 --> 02:25:26.670
The prehistoric

02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:33.799
Organisms that built stromatolites was so successful. They ruled the earth for up to 3 billion years

02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:40.300
Life finds a way

02:25:41.149 --> 02:25:47.139
And somehow these crafty architects found a way to organize water

02:25:48.170 --> 02:25:52.479
carbon molecules minerals and energy into a living cell

02:25:57.199 --> 02:26:00.849
Is this what we should be looking for on alien worlds

02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:23.059
My drone survey the dried-up basin of an inland sea

02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.020
But what's this

02:26:31.570 --> 02:26:34.270
a lone survivor on the airplane

02:26:37.370 --> 02:26:40.209
Zero fight succulents ten

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.899
FICO Berlin like pigment to absorb the red twelve son

02:26:49.271 --> 02:26:52.780
a hybrid of terrestrial and aquatic species

02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:11.749
Around 500 million years ago long since stromatolite s-- first took root in the shallows

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:16.070
Earth's oceans bloomed with animal life

02:27:24.971 --> 02:27:29.221
It was a very different world to the one that had made way for microbes

02:27:31.050 --> 02:27:36.560
With air to breathe now and a protective atmosphere under a gentler Sun

02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:44.240
We think microbial life is gonna be very common that the conditions to produce microbial life

02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:47.630
Happen over and over and over and many many different planets

02:27:47.730 --> 02:27:53.510
But that animal life is only gonna be able to evolve and then stick around for any length of time

02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:55.790
When you have really stable conditions

02:28:00.330 --> 02:28:05.060
Professor Peter Ward is one of the originators of the rare earth hypothesis

02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:13.220
The theory that the long term habitability of Earth for animal life may be rare in the galaxy

02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:25.940
Habitability is really the ability of a planet to have conditions that can allow life first to originate but secondly to stay alive

02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:37.689
Habitable worlds can be just a short instant in time and then it changes and it gets nasty

02:28:42.149 --> 02:28:47.479
So what to us made earth rare is the long-term habitability the planet

02:28:49.170 --> 02:28:52.290
The fact that it has remained constant and temperature

02:28:53.859 --> 02:28:55.859
With the oxygen values we have

02:28:56.470 --> 02:29:00.420
That we don't have these extremes in climate that we've got this

02:29:01.239 --> 02:29:03.658
Constancy, that's the rarity of it

02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:25.219
My drones detect a disturbance in the electromagnetic field a

02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.439
Network of forged metallic structures

02:29:32.729 --> 02:29:34.999
Bearing the mark of Industry

02:29:35.970 --> 02:29:37.970
This is not a glance

02:29:38.460 --> 02:29:40.460
This is not animal

02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:43.020
but this is

02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:45.020
evidence of life

02:29:46.601 --> 02:29:48.601
I

02:30:08.181 --> 02:30:13.091
Am the mind of the mothership alone among the stars

02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:22.630
50 years ago from a planet far away the planets you call home. I launched a

02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:30.040
Journey of 28 trillion miles

02:30:31.011 --> 02:30:36.850
across the yawning time of space to the exoplanets Minerva be

02:30:38.311 --> 02:30:45.360
A small rocky planet much like Earth, but orbiting another Sun

02:30:48.041 --> 02:30:50.100
Here I have found water

02:30:50.771 --> 02:30:54.660
Organic molecules and micro organisms. I

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.780
Have found life

02:31:01.729 --> 02:31:08.969
When the news of my discovery reaches earth years from now some of you would be amazed

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:13.279
But others who remain unsatisfied

02:31:14.069 --> 02:31:19.158
And you will ask have I not found animals or birds?

02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.840
Have I not met?

02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:24.590
intelligent life like us and

02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:28.159
So my search continues

02:31:39.899 --> 02:31:46.159
The great Marvel and the paradox of wide open spaces is that they make us look inwards

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:52.130
Confronted with the infinite we reflect upon the self

02:31:53.290 --> 02:31:55.290
Where do we come from?

02:31:55.569 --> 02:31:57.569
Why are we here?

02:31:57.819 --> 02:31:59.819
Are we alone?

02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:08.970
As a young child I was mostly interested in philosophy and I used to wander

02:32:09.490 --> 02:32:14.430
Into the hills of the village where I was born. I was interested in

02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:16.840
questions about our existence

02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:18.700
involving also the big

02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:24.360
Picture which is us being in the universe the question is how did we come to be?

02:32:24.971 --> 02:32:26.830
inhabiting this

02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:31.440
Two-dimensional surface on a piece of rock that we call our home the earth

02:32:32.290 --> 02:32:38.129
Near a star like the Sun that is one of tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy

02:32:38.650 --> 02:32:41.459
That is one of trillions of galaxies in the universe

02:32:42.090 --> 02:32:44.490
how did this all come about and

02:32:45.221 --> 02:32:47.221
Are we alone in particular?

02:32:47.681 --> 02:32:54.660
Professor avi love grew up, but he never grew out of his obsession with the fundamental mysteries of life

02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:04.169
Today as chair of astronomy at Harvard University lobe is part of a generation of elite scientists

02:33:04.660 --> 02:33:09.089
Riding a revolution in the quest to understand our place in the universe

02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:13.199
We are living at a very special time

02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:17.820
Over the past two decades thousands of planets were discovered

02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:24.570
Around other stars, and we realized that our solar system is not rare

02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:32.910
There are planets around almost every star and moreover about a quarter of all stars

02:33:33.311 --> 02:33:35.400
have an earth-mass planet

02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:42.930
Orbiting just the right distance for liquid water to exist on its surface and for the chemistry of life to develop

02:33:45.450 --> 02:33:50.060
The odds of finding life among the stars have never been better

02:33:53.970 --> 02:34:00.769
Following the detection in 2016 of organic molecules on the moons of Saturn on the comet 67p

02:34:01.829 --> 02:34:04.699
And in the disk of an emerging star system

02:34:05.489 --> 02:34:11.838
Scientists now believe that the building blocks for simple life are common throughout the universe in my view

02:34:11.839 --> 02:34:16.999
it is very likely that the life primitive life exists on many other planets the

02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:22.159
question of whether intelligent life exists is more difficult to answer because

02:34:22.709 --> 02:34:29.989
We don't fully understand what led to our existence and moreover intelligent life existed on earth

02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:34.459
Just relatively recently in cosmological terms

02:34:34.979 --> 02:34:41.088
But I'm agnostic about whether the answer is yes or no. I think we should explore rather than have a prejudice

02:34:41.669 --> 02:34:43.260
just like

02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:49.039
Columbus went out to discover the new worlds the answer lies in space

02:34:55.551 --> 02:35:01.281
I am in a stable orbit around the eggs or planets Miniver be

02:35:03.811 --> 02:35:10.400
My solar panels are configured to harness the full spectrum of its muted red

02:35:10.621 --> 02:35:12.621
dwarf Sun I

02:35:14.581 --> 02:35:20.390
Keep a watchful eye over my swarm of Explorer robots below I

02:35:22.381 --> 02:35:29.510
Scan the radio and optical wavelengths hoping for a whisper of alien technology

02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:33.770
But Minerva bee is silent

02:35:47.130 --> 02:35:52.309
What would it take to calculate the odds of finding intelligent life among the stars

02:35:55.471 --> 02:36:00.110
In the early 1960s one audacious astronomer Frank Drake

02:36:00.721 --> 02:36:03.920
Devised an equation to answer that question

02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:10.640
the Drake Equation essentially is a statement of our ignorance about

02:36:11.431 --> 02:36:18.410
Life in the universe in the first meeting held in the United States about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence

02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:24.589
Frank Drake and a number of other researchers got together and Drake needed a way to organize how the

02:36:24.931 --> 02:36:28.011
Discussion at the meeting would go when you sat down and fucked like well, what do I need?

02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:34.640
to know in order to know how many intelligent civilizations there might be out there in the galaxy for us to communicate with

02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:39.440
Drake listed seven variables

02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:46.819
He believed would need to be worked out in order to determine the number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:52.479
With six of those seven variables unknown at the time

02:36:53.149 --> 02:36:56.979
Drake did not foresee the ready solution, but according to

02:36:57.529 --> 02:36:58.550
computational

02:36:58.550 --> 02:37:01.540
Astrophysicist Adam Frank, that's all changing

02:37:04.570 --> 02:37:08.489
We are in fact going through quite a bit of a revolution in this

02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:12.630
this idea in this equation in particular what it comes from is

02:37:13.091 --> 02:37:17.730
The the fact that we have man old two of the terms

02:37:17.730 --> 02:37:24.000
Right. So in when in 1962 when Drake wrote down this equation only one of the terms was known ah

02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:27.780
Stands for the rate of star formation

02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:32.789
or the number of Sun mass stars born each year in

02:37:33.761 --> 02:37:36.660
1962 Drake put the figure at 10

02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:44.340
But it wasn't until 2011 that NASA's Kepler space telescope

02:37:44.921 --> 02:37:49.501
Gave us the answers to the second and third variables in Drake's equation

02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:58.470
The fraction of stars that have planets and the number of those planets with the right conditions for life to form

02:37:58.931 --> 02:38:03.240
it turns out that the fraction of stars with planets is

02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:11.070
Approximately 1 every star you see in the sky when you walk out at night and look at a random star in the sky

02:38:11.230 --> 02:38:13.350
It has a planet at least one

02:38:14.819 --> 02:38:20.969
and then the number of planets in the habitable zone turns out to be you know on the order of

02:38:22.270 --> 02:38:25.260
0.2. Okay. So this is like saying, you know

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:30.659
if you look at between four and five stars, one of those is going to have a

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:34.589
It's gonna have a planet in the right place for life to form

02:38:36.010 --> 02:38:40.319
Remember that the galaxy contains four hundred billion stars

02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:48.059
Just the galaxy alone four hundred billion stars, right? So when you think about all those stars in the galaxy, that's an amazing number

02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:56.849
Up to 80 billion exoplanets in our galaxy have the right conditions for life

02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:04.950
When you consider that at the time Drake formulated his equation no one knew if there was even one

02:39:05.890 --> 02:39:10.590
Exoplanet out there. This truly is a revolution of our understanding

02:39:13.341 --> 02:39:16.150
But what about the other unknowns in the Drake Equation

02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:25.870
Inspired by Kepler's game-changing discoveries a new generation of scientists has made it their mission to

02:39:26.091 --> 02:39:28.091
fill in the blanks

02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:41.190
Of all the habitable exoplanets out there how many of them actually host life

02:39:42.430 --> 02:39:49.650
This is the next unknown in the Drake Equation and the challenge it presents for scientists is immense

02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:54.900
How does one detect life from light-years away

02:39:58.510 --> 02:40:02.340
One approach that shows promise is to study the gases around

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:10.380
Exoplanets in search of a so-called bio signature the evidence of life imprinted in the atmosphere. I

02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:17.580
Think one of the things that's most exciting for exoplanet atmospheres right now is that we can actually measure

02:40:18.130 --> 02:40:24.240
Gases with telescopes from Earth remote sensing is a very powerful technique. It's how we first study into the solar system

02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:32.100
Planetary scientist Sarah Horst is a leading investigator of atmospheric chemistry a

02:40:32.771 --> 02:40:40.320
Field that took off in a radical new direction in 2001 with the first ever detection of an exoplanets atmosphere

02:40:46.851 --> 02:40:54.820
There's a very small number of gases that were pretty sure we've been able to see an exoplanet atmospheres, so water is one of the

02:40:55.341 --> 02:40:57.820
gases that people claim that they've detected

02:40:58.190 --> 02:41:04.029
Some other things that you don't tend to think of as gases have also been detected things like sodium for example

02:41:04.490 --> 02:41:08.949
The main challenge with exoplanets is just that they're very far away. And so you need a bigger telescope

02:41:11.171 --> 02:41:13.621
That's telescope is soon to be launched

02:41:20.871 --> 02:41:27.911
While atmospheric observations so far have been limited to a narrow range of gases the James Webb Space Telescope

02:41:28.491 --> 02:41:32.741
Will be the first instrument capable of sampling a broad spectrum

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:41.779
The challenge now for researchers like Horst is to define a set of bio signatures

02:41:42.210 --> 02:41:46.669
gasses that indicate the presence of life for the James Webb to go looking for

02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:53.760
One of the gases on on earth that is most, you know

02:41:53.761 --> 02:41:59.790
Most significant in terms of the fact that there's life on Earth is oxygen, you know, the oxygen on earth is produced by life

02:42:00.011 --> 02:42:02.011
That's why it's here

02:42:02.110 --> 02:42:08.220
But oxygen isn't necessarily a bio signature if you saw oxygen around another world

02:42:08.221 --> 02:42:11.131
You wouldn't necessarily say. Oh that's life

02:42:12.431 --> 02:42:13.931
Europa is main

02:42:13.931 --> 02:42:21.301
Atmospheric constituent is o2 and it's not from life. It's from breaking up water. So it's difficult to point to

02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:28.079
One gas or even a small set of gases that you would say if I see that I know there's life there

02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.350
that said solar system exploration tells us that we will always be surprised and so

02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:35.490
You know

02:42:35.490 --> 02:42:42.119
it's quite possible that there is going to be a planet where we get the data from James Webb and it is going to be

02:42:42.370 --> 02:42:45.810
Glaringly obvious from the data that there is life on that planet

02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:56.090
Horst's generation may well be the first to put a number on the fraction of habitable exoplanets that hosts life

02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.410
But the next unknown in the Drake Equation

02:43:01.141 --> 02:43:03.860
Could prove much more challenging to resolve

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:09.980
How many of those life-bearing planets go on to develop intelligence?

02:43:12.439 --> 02:43:13.729
Even if we

02:43:13.729 --> 02:43:16.568
understand that other planets have simple

02:43:16.569 --> 02:43:22.059
I fought them and indeed we might be able to make astronomical observations to test that in the next 10 20 years

02:43:22.279 --> 02:43:28.059
Then of course, there's another big uncertainty which is how likely it. Is that simple life

02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:34.389
Evolves as it did on earth into a marvelous complex biosphere

02:43:34.939 --> 02:43:42.129
Containing even creatures like ourselves. We don't know what the chances are of getting from simple life to

02:43:42.890 --> 02:43:46.479
Advanced life of the kind. We recognize as intelligence

02:43:54.491 --> 02:44:01.170
After 47 days of expiration I have found no trace of extant animal life and

02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:04.200
So I searched into the past

02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:14.880
I scan the strata of an exposed defamation for fossil evidence

02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:24.229
I apply the data to my orbiter for analysis

02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:40.190
There's something here

02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:45.780
Reptilian

02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:47.780
Approximately 1 million years old

02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:51.890
to rest your compatibility detected an

02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:55.280
armored Commodore like species

02:44:59.851 --> 02:45:07.400
Marine compatibility also found a possible transitional species from sea to land

02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:14.240
The complex life failed to establish itself on the surface of maneuverable

02:45:14.910 --> 02:45:16.910
or is this evidence of

02:45:17.311 --> 02:45:19.311
extinction

02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:34.950
To solve the next unknown in the Drake Equation

02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:39.780
The fraction of worlds where simple life evolves to intelligence

02:45:39.970 --> 02:45:44.790
We need to understand the evolutionary pathway to advanced life on earth

02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:55.039
Just over 540 million years ago evolution on our planet took a giant leap forward

02:45:57.490 --> 02:46:02.220
There's no better place to understand that process than here in the Canadian Rockies

02:46:02.771 --> 02:46:06.421
In the rich fossil deposits of the Burgess Shale

02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:13.740
For well over a century the fossils hidden in these mountains have helped generations of scientists

02:46:14.081 --> 02:46:18.240
retrace the evolutionary pathway to complex life on earth

02:46:24.749 --> 02:46:30.859
Professor Robert Gamez and dr. Jean-bernard Curran a leading the excavation of a recently identified

02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:33.560
deposit in marble canyon

02:46:34.739 --> 02:46:39.139
Battling the icy wind and snow for the prospect of a new discovery

02:46:42.419 --> 02:46:46.549
Something to show you here that would collect it the other day. It's a big slab

02:46:47.069 --> 02:46:52.908
Wow this fall so here Wow. Yeah, it's quite extraordinary, isn't it? I've never seen anything like it

02:46:52.909 --> 02:46:56.149
That's the exciting part of our commercial and or something new coming up

02:46:56.850 --> 02:46:59.959
these rocks contains some of the first evidence of

02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:02.600
multicellular organisms on our planet

02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:07.520
The first eyes

02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:12.429
The first hard body parts pose and exoskeletons

02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:18.610
The first lateral symmetry the first efficient guts

02:47:20.330 --> 02:47:22.360
Even the first brains

02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:31.329
Sculpted in the finally packed sediment of an ancient ocean is the turning point in the evolution of advanced life on earth

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:33.880
the Cambrian explosion

02:47:36.670 --> 02:47:40.200
Very good have a very nice slap and some Dahlia on it

02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:45.480
Wow, that's quite spectacular

02:47:46.061 --> 02:47:48.061
So to put things into perspective

02:47:48.610 --> 02:47:56.489
Today we know life is widespread. It's all our owners in the oceans in the mountains and so on so forth and

02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:04.409
we can trace the root of all these life forms to pretty much the Cambrian period

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:16.800
As far as we know life dates back at least at that three point four billion years ago and it wasn't until about

02:48:17.681 --> 02:48:21.420
540 million years ago that we have the Cambrian explosion and that

02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:27.930
fundamentally changes the planet it goes from a microbial world to one that is literally teeming with animals and not just

02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:34.380
Small and simple animals as we would have originally imagined but instead we have a whole array of complex life

02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:39.450
Still only in Earth's oceans at that time, but all of the major groups of animals appear

02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:42.120
geologically instantaneously

02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:52.540
Among the species found here is one of the ancestral roots on the tree of intelligent life

02:48:55.340 --> 02:49:00.730
So one of the most important fossils that we find here in this area is Metis Prague

02:49:00.730 --> 02:49:07.359
I know it's hard to pronounce but it's actually very very important fossil for the understanding of all

02:49:08.391 --> 02:49:10.391
the vertebrates and

02:49:10.490 --> 02:49:12.759
This is an animal that looks like a fish

02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:19.300
he has a pair of eyes in the front and the structure which we call a notochord which

02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:23.199
part of it will eventually become our spine and

02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:27.520
meta Springer doesn't have any evidence of

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:35.049
Structures that could help him to protect itself. So I tend to think that perhaps he was smart

02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:40.540
In the fact that we find them clustering which shows evidence of schooling

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:46.660
is very much reminiscent to what we know in modern fish who have

02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:49.690
Evolved us such behavior to avoid predation

02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:59.770
Predation is a very key factor in in driving the evolution of animals and we see evidence of that here in the burgess shale

02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:05.799
As organisms began to develop both a weaponry to capture one another as well as defenses

02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:14.980
Eyes closed camouflage armor

02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:25.640
All these new tools required coordination by a nervous system the stuff from which the brain is made

02:50:28.689 --> 02:50:33.179
So could intelligence be the product of an evolutionary arms race

02:50:35.529 --> 02:50:39.869
We certainly see on earth a connection between predation and mobility

02:50:41.590 --> 02:50:46.049
Organisms that can just sit in the Sun and soak up the Rays they don't need to move

02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:49.710
their food comes to them but organisms that

02:50:50.380 --> 02:50:56.549
Prey on vegetation need to be able to move around and organisms that prey on the prayers need to move even faster

02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:03.090
They need to be really strong and fast and you could argue that that dynamic of predation and motion

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:11.099
Causes the development of intelligence and maybe somehow it leads the sort of overwhelming intelligence that humans have expressed

02:51:13.210 --> 02:51:18.509
Is this the inevitable progression of evolution from simple life via

02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:21.719
diversification and predation into intelligence

02:51:22.270 --> 02:51:24.779
Or is an event like the Cambrian explosion

02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:30.779
So rare that life on other planets might never get the chance to pass first base

02:51:34.039 --> 02:51:37.939
I think that wherever we find life in the universe

02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:43.489
that life will change through time in a way that's consistent with

02:51:44.129 --> 02:51:48.949
What we've learned about evolution on this planet, I think that is a general feature of life

02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:52.520
To Professor Andy no

02:51:52.559 --> 02:51:57.109
Similar environmental conditions or biomes will give rise to similar

02:51:57.599 --> 02:52:01.429
Evolutionary solutions no matter where in the universe that takes place

02:52:02.579 --> 02:52:04.579
it's a theory known as

02:52:04.770 --> 02:52:06.770
convergence

02:52:06.809 --> 02:52:14.719
If you look at a bat for example and a bird they both fly using wings and yet they don't have a common ancestor

02:52:15.239 --> 02:52:21.649
That flew and had wings. They have evolved that capacity from separate origins

02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:24.469
but to a similar functional hand

02:52:26.159 --> 02:52:33.649
In advanced animal life some convergent biological structures are so common as to be almost universal

02:52:35.819 --> 02:52:38.418
Well, the eye is a terrific example of

02:52:39.089 --> 02:52:41.009
convergence because

02:52:41.009 --> 02:52:44.869
And we all understand what the eye. Does that your eyes are this sophisticated?

02:52:45.449 --> 02:52:52.069
Sensory apparatus that allows you to engage and engage with the world around you

02:52:52.759 --> 02:52:56.689
interestingly if you look at squids and octopus

02:52:57.149 --> 02:53:04.878
They have a visual system that is every bit as acute as ours but evolves from a separate source there again

02:53:04.879 --> 02:53:06.179
There's no

02:53:06.179 --> 02:53:10.789
Common ancestor of squids and mammals that had an eye

02:53:16.170 --> 02:53:20.629
Is convergence a magic funnel that guides life on any planet

02:53:21.030 --> 02:53:26.359
Inexorably towards intelligence or could there be other more powerful forces at play?

02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:42.790
The absence of terrestrial animals Oh Minerva bee could indicate an extinction event

02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:51.280
Or that life has not successfully transitioned as it did on earth from sea to land. I

02:53:55.250 --> 02:53:59.530
Deploy my submarine exposure module into the Minerva sea

02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:07.019
In the shelter of the ocean life should strive

02:54:11.780 --> 02:54:13.780
Extensive macroalgae and

02:54:14.330 --> 02:54:15.530
peripheral

02:54:15.530 --> 02:54:20.230
suggests high water oxygenation and shallow UV penetration

02:54:23.061 --> 02:54:26.200
Ideal conditions for advanced life to evolve

02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:38.069
a giant trilobite like species

02:54:40.709 --> 02:54:44.119
Take mater body plan and dorsal exoskeleton

02:54:47.439 --> 02:54:50.519
Comparable with late Cambrian arthropods on earth

02:54:57.010 --> 02:55:03.210
Complex mobility and behavior a school swimming information

02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:12.759
Perhaps a strategy to avoid predation

02:55:14.130 --> 02:55:19.040
strength in numbers or a kind of camouflage

02:55:45.051 --> 02:55:51.190
The force variable in the Drake Equation the fraction of life-bearing worlds that evolve intelligence

02:55:51.771 --> 02:55:53.331
still eludes

02:55:53.331 --> 02:55:54.741
scientists today

02:55:54.741 --> 02:56:02.650
On earth the great burst of life during the Cambrian explosion was an integral step on the path to intelligence

02:56:03.471 --> 02:56:07.270
But could widespread death have been just as important

02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:12.060
Einstein said God doesn't play dice with the universe

02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:16.619
Well, it seems that he does and there's a whole lot of dice going on in the evolution of life

02:56:18.311 --> 02:56:25.650
Paleontologist Peter Ward is an expert on mass extinctions. The catastrophic change is a fortune in the game of life

02:56:26.410 --> 02:56:31.079
When the majority of animals lose and just a few inherit the earth

02:56:33.970 --> 02:56:36.210
This is a mammal-like reptile

02:56:36.851 --> 02:56:44.640
Actually called a glorg an OPS Ian or a Gorgon. It was the biggest and baddest carnivore of the late. Permian

02:56:45.220 --> 02:56:52.230
252 million years ago and this is a baby. The big ones were three metres to 4 metres long very large skulls

02:56:52.990 --> 02:56:54.990
crossed between a lion and

02:56:55.061 --> 02:57:00.960
A big saltwater crocodile if you will half reptilian half mammal all nightmare

02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:03.480
these guys all died out in the

02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:09.570
Permian extinction 252 million years ago this entire group gone

02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:18.090
The Permian extinction was the most devastating of the five mass extinction events in Earth's history

02:57:20.950 --> 02:57:27.179
Experts believe an intense surge of volcanic activity led to dropping sea levels acid rain and

02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:29.640
poisoning of the atmosphere

02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:39.260
More than 95% of marine life and over two-thirds of terrestrial animals were completely wiped out

02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:44.059
we setting the stage for the evolution of life on our planet the

02:57:46.170 --> 02:57:52.099
Permian extinction did far more than just the top carnivore it took out the herbivores that took out most of the

02:57:52.170 --> 02:57:57.740
Plants it took out the insects the amphibians, but what did get through were a couple small?

02:57:58.290 --> 02:58:00.530
reptilian groups real small size

02:58:03.570 --> 02:58:09.440
Like pruning a rose cutting back the Tree of Life gives rise to rapid growth as

02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:12.830
New branches reach out their leaves to the light

02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:16.249
with little competition or threat from predators

02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:21.079
surviving species adapt quickly to fill the gaps left behind

02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:31.340
The tiny reptiles that survived the Permian extinction drooled to hundreds of different species including dinosaurs

02:58:31.801 --> 02:58:33.801
Who ruled the earth for over?

02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:36.001
100 million years

02:58:36.001 --> 02:58:38.810
until their own date with disaster arrived

02:58:48.811 --> 02:58:54.870
I mean that was a very rapid and hideous death probably every dinosaur dead within three to six months max

02:58:55.301 --> 02:58:58.110
That was a line in the sand who wins?

02:58:58.541 --> 02:59:00.541
Well who won are the small creatures?

02:59:00.580 --> 02:59:04.650
the T Rexes died out and tiny mammals get through and then they

02:59:04.751 --> 02:59:11.220
developed into all of the kinds of mammals we see today and they did so really fast the size of the skull of the

02:59:11.561 --> 02:59:16.561
Animal that gave rise to us was the size of a robin egg or smaller

02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:26.840
Might the evolutionary branch that led to us never have grown had it not been for the random impact of an asteroid

02:59:27.150 --> 02:59:28.260
65

02:59:28.260 --> 02:59:30.260
million years ago, I

02:59:33.690 --> 02:59:39.979
Would support the idea that in fact if we still had not had the impact something else might be running around as intelligent

02:59:39.979 --> 02:59:45.589
But I doubt it would be in this form and the set of behaviors that we humans have

02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:51.950
If our own existence is the outcome of a random cosmic disaster

02:59:52.710 --> 02:59:57.379
Then might the fraction of worlds that evolve intelligence be equally unpredictable

03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:08.340
But if we could go looking for alien intelligence on another planet, how would we recognize it

03:00:16.530 --> 03:00:24.320
Well, I think the method of looking for complex behavior in a different planet is to do what behavioral scientists do you look you

03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:32.029
Observe you see how animals move how they respond to stimuli how they act as a biologist. Who does this?

03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:38.120
Regularly, I find that extremely exciting because the discovery quotient would be very high

03:00:38.370 --> 03:00:43.520
But it would also be weird and alien, I sort of like weird in aliens. So I think that would be a lot of fun

03:00:48.190 --> 03:00:53.190
Professor Roger Hanlon is an expert on the closest thing to a lien intelligence on earth

03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:58.259
Cephalopods squid octopus and cuttlefish

03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:04.019
the undisputed masters of disguise because they have to be

03:01:12.141 --> 03:01:13.641
Cephalopods are soft-bodied

03:01:13.641 --> 03:01:21.190
All their armor was given away through evolutionary time to their cousins the oysters and the clams and they are soft body

03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:26.109
They're extremely vulnerable. So they have to get on by their wit's they have to do something different

03:01:30.310 --> 03:01:32.310
They're making that decision in

03:01:32.859 --> 03:01:40.078
Far less than one second and about one. Third of one second. They're assessing that visual scene now, they're orchestrating in their skin

03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:45.659
30 million Carano for pigment organs in the skin that create the pattern and iridescent

03:01:45.909 --> 03:01:52.769
Reflective cells and even the skin Capelli in the bumps. There are several thousand of those so that takes a lot of cognitive

03:01:53.290 --> 03:01:55.290
processing a lot of brain power

03:01:57.729 --> 03:02:04.528
Cephalopods have the highest brain to body mass ratio of all invertebrates and their brains are decentralized

03:02:05.199 --> 03:02:08.549
Meaning neural tissue is distributed throughout their body

03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:15.869
Having split from our only group of vertebrates well before the Cambrian explosion

03:02:16.569 --> 03:02:21.539
They are the product of an entirely separate experiment in the evolution of intelligence

03:02:22.449 --> 03:02:26.039
If you look at the evolutionary history of complex behavior

03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:30.719
We know about vertebrates and humans and primates and all the rest but through evolutionary time

03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:36.899
There's only one group that is branched off to produce really complex behavior. And it's these animals the squid octopus and cuttlefish

03:02:38.590 --> 03:02:44.219
So what we expect is for the white square to show up in the white head bar the white head bar is already there

03:02:45.931 --> 03:02:48.301
And now it's changing its pattern a little more

03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:57.600
It's blanched a little bit. You can see these two markings down here, but we're looking for that white square to appear. I

03:02:58.990 --> 03:03:01.590
think the correlation you might make for looking for

03:03:02.351 --> 03:03:04.351
extraterrestrial intelligence would be

03:03:04.450 --> 03:03:11.310
Don't expect anything like humans or dogs and cats and all the things we're used to hear underwater. You have this weird

03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:16.650
Octopus with its head on its feet and distributer brain, but they're doing complex things

03:03:16.650 --> 03:03:19.260
We might find something very similar in a different planet

03:03:19.391 --> 03:03:24.540
It might be a different size a different shape and it's form of intelligence may be different as well

03:03:24.851 --> 03:03:31.591
So I think we have to open our minds and recognize the diversity on this planet to set the stage in the framework for going

03:03:31.591 --> 03:03:34.381
To other planets to look for life-forms and intelligence

03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:48.549
Night falls I may never be

03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.410
and

03:03:51.410 --> 03:03:54.129
A secret wealth is revealed

03:03:57.770 --> 03:04:00.670
Bioluminescent organisms rise from the earth

03:04:08.270 --> 03:04:11.170
Winged insects resembling lampyridae

03:04:13.729 --> 03:04:19.148
Complex life exists on land but hidden from the Sun a

03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:26.380
Predator breaks, its camouflage and reveals a nocturnal hunting ground

03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:46.010
Since the 1960s when Frank Drake drafted his equation the search for extraterrestrial intelligence

03:04:46.499 --> 03:04:49.339
has been defined in terms of the search for a

03:04:49.890 --> 03:04:51.890
technological civilization

03:04:53.069 --> 03:04:59.538
Being unable to travel to the Stars Drake's solution was to scan for signals that our earthbound

03:05:00.029 --> 03:05:01.979
technology could detect

03:05:01.979 --> 03:05:09.708
Hence, the penultimate unknown in his equation the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develops technology

03:05:10.949 --> 03:05:15.259
The key here is the ability for that civilization to be detected by us

03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:21.319
And so that is really going to require some kind of world girdling industrial civilization, right?

03:05:21.319 --> 03:05:24.918
so, you know if there was a Roman Empire on this distant planet

03:05:24.919 --> 03:05:31.099
We really would have a very hard time seeing it but once they start generating and or start deploying

03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:37.519
Industrial-scale technologies on a global scale then we think that there is going to be ways we would be able to see that

03:05:41.640 --> 03:05:46.339
The new technology when the Drake Equation was formulated was the radio

03:05:46.560 --> 03:05:50.329
Telescope and those who search for extraterrestrial life today

03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:56.359
still believe an alien radio signal is what we're most likely to detect I

03:05:57.209 --> 03:06:01.579
Think I get comments at every party I go to not that I go to a lot of parties

03:06:01.619 --> 03:06:07.248
However, people say oh you're looking for radio waves from et. I mean that's pretty old-school, isn't it? They won't be using radio

03:06:07.289 --> 03:06:08.749
Well, tell me what's better

03:06:08.749 --> 03:06:14.689
I mean as far as we know there really isn't anything better because radio waves can traverse the distances between the stars

03:06:14.850 --> 03:06:16.800
so the signals can get here and

03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:22.759
Radio goes right through the gas and dust that hangs between the stars so you can send radio signals as far away as you want

03:06:28.859 --> 03:06:32.568
Seth Shostak has spent his life listening to the stars

03:06:34.890 --> 03:06:36.089
As

03:06:36.089 --> 03:06:39.619
senior astronomer at the Institute for the search for extraterrestrial

03:06:40.470 --> 03:06:41.909
Intelligence or SETI?

03:06:41.909 --> 03:06:45.559
It's his job to scan the heavens for alien technology

03:06:46.709 --> 03:06:49.249
We try anything we can to pick up some

03:06:49.890 --> 03:06:52.819
Information some sort of signal that would tell us, you know

03:06:52.819 --> 03:06:56.328
We don't know what they're like or what their taste in music. Is there anything like that?

03:06:56.329 --> 03:07:00.918
But what we do know is that they're smart enough to build a radio transmitter, for example

03:07:03.880 --> 03:07:11.189
With limitations on technology time and resources the dilemma for SETI has always been where to listen

03:07:13.359 --> 03:07:17.459
We haven't heard anything, I mean this would be straight up about that and some people think

03:07:18.279 --> 03:07:23.279
Yeah, the reason you haven't found on anything is because there's nothing to find. We're the smartest things in the universe

03:07:23.409 --> 03:07:24.989
Well, I don't think it's true

03:07:24.989 --> 03:07:31.439
I think the reason that we haven't heard anything is simply because we have only looked at a very small number of star systems

03:07:31.659 --> 03:07:36.118
but that's changing because of the improvements in technology instead of looking at a

03:07:36.460 --> 03:07:42.509
Couple of hundred star systems every year you'll be able to look at a couple of thousand and then five years down the road

03:07:42.579 --> 03:07:45.538
It'll be tens of thousands and in the next two thousand years

03:07:45.539 --> 03:07:48.509
We'll be able to look at on the order of a million star systems

03:07:49.270 --> 03:07:53.579
Now if you look at a million star systems the chances of finding something are not so small

03:07:53.800 --> 03:07:58.409
So I bet everybody a cup of coffee will find et within two dozen years. I could be out a lot of coffee

03:08:03.430 --> 03:08:07.949
For almost 50 years since Drake wrote his equation we listened

03:08:08.470 --> 03:08:14.040
but nothing we heard couldn't be explained as interference or a natural phenomenon until

03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:16.210
one day in

03:08:16.210 --> 03:08:18.210
2007 in rural, Australia

03:08:18.909 --> 03:08:25.859
Astronomers picked up the first in a series of mysterious signals that still puzzled the science community today

03:08:27.460 --> 03:08:29.759
But first we didn't dare believe they were real

03:08:30.399 --> 03:08:35.818
Fortunately, I've seen them with my own eyes. I saw the very first sweep of the first one could sleep that night

03:08:35.819 --> 03:08:38.999
it was like could this possibly be real this is amazing and

03:08:40.510 --> 03:08:44.099
We've been able to work out how far away they are in the universe and they're

03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:50.759
Impossibly far away, they they're billions of light-years away. So the process that creates them is so energetic

03:08:51.159 --> 03:08:53.879
That is great mystery as to what causes them

03:08:55.720 --> 03:08:59.729
The strange signals have been dubbed fast radio bursts

03:09:00.250 --> 03:09:04.139
Blasts of radiation so powerful. They emit the energy of

03:09:04.779 --> 03:09:06.779
500 million suns

03:09:08.830 --> 03:09:14.519
Professor Matthew bales leads an international effort to study the phenomenon here at the Milan low

03:09:14.739 --> 03:09:17.189
Observatory fast radio bursts are these mysterious

03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:25.319
Bursts of radiation that only happened for a few milliseconds the sky lights up and then they go away again

03:09:25.390 --> 03:09:28.140
they're about a million times more luminous than

03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:31.439
Anything we've known about in our own galaxy

03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:41.269
Since the first detection in 2007 there have been more than 40 fast radio bursts detected worldwide

03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:46.460
Five in just the last year were detected here by bales

03:09:47.430 --> 03:09:51.380
One of the Holy Grails is to find a repeating fast radio bursts

03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:56.030
And is there any pattern to the fast radio bursts do they come in?

03:09:57.510 --> 03:10:03.530
Special gaps or they regular if they're very regular we might associate that with a rotating neutron star

03:10:03.530 --> 03:10:08.299
Where a sort of death Ray's going past the earth, you know once every 20 seconds or something

03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:15.229
if they come at irregular intervals, or if they came separated by a code that

03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:18.170
showed us that there was some higher

03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:21.979
Intelligence behind it. You might think there's an intelligent

03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:25.490
Civilization that's actually transmitting this signal

03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:28.160
That would be Nobel prize-winning stuff

03:10:30.970 --> 03:10:37.119
Of course the next question then is could we or should we send a message back

03:10:39.050 --> 03:10:41.259
If we took our biggest radio telescope

03:10:41.569 --> 03:10:47.559
We could actually mimic what a fast radio bursts would look like and if we were trying to communicate with other

03:10:47.779 --> 03:10:51.908
Intelligent beings we might imagine that they go through a stage of their evolution

03:10:52.189 --> 03:10:56.318
Where they're searching for fast radio bursts in the same way. I am here and

03:10:56.959 --> 03:11:01.779
Then if you could find one that repeats and find a pattern that might be a way of

03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:04.809
doing into civilization

03:11:05.539 --> 03:11:07.539
Communications which is a fascinating

03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:10.720
think

03:11:14.939 --> 03:11:22.339
But we're really interested is a civilization like ours an industrial civilization that show signs that in building tools

03:11:22.590 --> 03:11:25.189
You know of whatever kind they have

03:11:26.220 --> 03:11:31.220
Gotten to the point where they clearly have a kind of

03:11:31.739 --> 03:11:37.189
Reasoning rational intelligence a culture that we might be able to talk to them

03:11:37.189 --> 03:11:38.720
Right because that's really what we want to know

03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:43.340
We want to know like what's it like to be them because all we know is what's it like to be us?

03:11:47.370 --> 03:11:53.160
If I received a signal from outer space, how could I tell it was language as opposed to anything else?

03:11:55.030 --> 03:11:59.789
To put a figure on the fraction of civilizations that develops communication

03:12:01.470 --> 03:12:06.650
We need a way to decipher if an alien signal is actually trying to tell us anything

03:12:11.940 --> 03:12:13.940
I analyzed

03:12:14.051 --> 03:12:16.051
over 60 different languages

03:12:16.991 --> 03:12:21.930
Human languages plus languages like dolphin Jim the birdsong

03:12:23.921 --> 03:12:28.171
So on the left here you've got Neil Armstrong speaking from the moon

03:12:36.461 --> 03:12:39.031
On the right here we put a dolphin communicating

03:12:42.461 --> 03:12:47.400
You can see here quite easily the rhythms going on the sounds we're making

03:12:48.551 --> 03:12:55.951
How similar those constructs are it's picking up those rhythms in those interrelationship patterns that I think are

03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:01.530
fundamental to any communication whether it's on this planet or in another planet and

03:13:01.781 --> 03:13:07.080
Looking at the complexity of all those patterns into relay. You can actually tell how intelligent the author is

03:13:09.940 --> 03:13:14.580
When the signal arrives it's first checked against known sources of interference

03:13:16.841 --> 03:13:18.841
It's a pulsar

03:13:20.351 --> 03:13:22.351
That repetitive

03:13:23.711 --> 03:13:29.041
Sound going on listening to that we were at that's not little green man. That's too simple

03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:38.090
Algorithms then scan for the telltale patterns of communication whether its source, maybe an audio recording

03:13:38.670 --> 03:13:40.820
or an intergalactic email

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.990
It's an awfully big sky, we're getting more and more

03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:48.080
Capability online the hardware to do it

03:13:49.170 --> 03:13:54.620
But I suspect unless we eavesdrop on something. It may be a while before we hear anything

03:13:54.620 --> 03:13:56.929
We want to be ready for it. It says no point just

03:13:57.450 --> 03:14:00.769
Sitting back and saying oh well do saying when it happens is doing all this

03:14:01.290 --> 03:14:03.290
Ahead of time. So we're prepared for

03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:06.259
Again, it could happen tomorrow. We just don't know

03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:18.229
Recent advances in the remote observation of planetary atmospheres have opened up a new method of determining whether an

03:14:18.540 --> 03:14:21.709
exoplanet hosts or has previously hosted a

03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:24.090
technological civilization

03:14:24.090 --> 03:14:28.009
the composition of the atmosphere can provide us with a hint about the

03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:32.570
Intelligent or perhaps not so intelligent life that pollutes the atmosphere

03:14:33.420 --> 03:14:34.859
with

03:14:34.859 --> 03:14:36.859
industrially produced molecules

03:14:38.609 --> 03:14:46.519
Pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons are released into Earth's atmosphere by industrial processes and do not occur naturally

03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:55.479
Detecting them in an alien atmosphere would therefore be a clear footprint of technological life?

03:14:57.859 --> 03:15:01.988
Some of these molecules exist for tens of thousands of years

03:15:02.359 --> 03:15:05.528
After they were introduced to the atmosphere in principle

03:15:05.529 --> 03:15:11.439
We can find evidence for a civilization that is no longer in existence on the surface of that planet

03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:15.189
We can find graveyards of other civilizations

03:15:25.601 --> 03:15:30.391
My drones have picked up a disturbance in the communications field a

03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:33.990
Sporadic interruption to the network

03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:42.630
Is this what caused it

03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:49.839
Some geometrical formation metallic magnetically charged

03:15:52.529 --> 03:15:57.469
Part of a larger configuration which seems to bear the mark of design

03:16:04.641 --> 03:16:07.960
Could these be the ruins of Amina?

03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:09.649
realization

03:16:09.649 --> 03:16:12.939
the tombstone of an alien intelligence

03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:34.809
The final factor in the Drake Equation is El the average lifetime of a civilization and

03:16:35.330 --> 03:16:37.929
In some sense. This is the most difficult

03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:44.139
Term to even think about because we've got, you know only one example and we don't even know what our own future is

03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:47.469
when Drake conceived his equation in

03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:54.789
1962 our own global civilization was on the brink of disaster as the powers of East and West

03:16:55.100 --> 03:16:57.760
faced off in the Cuban Missile Crisis

03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:04.419
The group that came up with the Drake Equation at that first workshop for them in 1962

03:17:04.420 --> 03:17:07.660
The great fear was nuclear war and at the end of the conference

03:17:08.660 --> 03:17:10.749
Otto Struga, who was the head of

03:17:11.479 --> 03:17:17.949
The Observatory where the conference is being held made a toast and said, you know 2l may it be very long?

03:17:22.270 --> 03:17:24.540
The Cold War did eventually thaw

03:17:25.660 --> 03:17:30.389
But while the nuclear threat is diminished today, we have created for ourselves

03:17:31.060 --> 03:17:33.060
new dangers

03:17:34.240 --> 03:17:39.719
The question is how long are we gonna last do we only have another two hundred years before we collapse do we have you know?

03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:45.269
200 million years in front of us. So this is you know, it's really a fundamental question and it's a fundamental question

03:17:45.820 --> 03:17:48.809
For human beings because right now with climate change and sustainability

03:17:48.850 --> 03:17:54.660
We really face this existential crisis about really are we going to be able to make it through to more than another?

03:17:54.850 --> 03:17:56.850
100 or 200 years

03:17:58.359 --> 03:18:02.219
Could this be the ultimate limiting factor in the Drake Equation

03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:09.389
That before technological civilizations work out how to search for life among the stars

03:18:10.390 --> 03:18:12.390
They destroy themselves

03:18:12.550 --> 03:18:18.899
In order to become a truly a spacefaring race that takes a lot of time to be able to really have settlements on Mars

03:18:19.060 --> 03:18:22.500
To really start to begin to have a human presence in the solar system

03:18:22.570 --> 03:18:27.599
Will take hundreds of years and you know, if we can't make it more than a couple hundred years clearly you're not

03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:28.770
You know

03:18:28.770 --> 03:18:32.850
We're not gonna develop that kind of society and then to ever really think about getting to the Stars

03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:38.549
Sending probes to the Stars being around for the signals to come back. You have to last a long time. I

03:18:39.970 --> 03:18:44.790
Think those two things are intimately connected and you don't get the stars unless you get the Earth

03:18:56.540 --> 03:19:00.499
I prepare for my final transmission back to earth

03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:09.259
The data I've collected will take five years to arrive longer to download and

03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:13.099
Generations to fully comprehend

03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:20.719
I could provide a summary but what should I say?

03:19:23.570 --> 03:19:30.440
I have found everything you've hoped for and also what you feel

03:19:33.051 --> 03:19:40.881
I have seen life of marvelous complexity and the traces of a devastating loss

03:19:45.641 --> 03:19:49.211
I could say Minerva is your second earth and

03:19:49.851 --> 03:19:51.410
I hope

03:19:51.410 --> 03:19:52.851
one day

03:19:52.851 --> 03:19:54.851
You get to see

03:20:26.420 --> 03:20:28.420
You
