00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.089
This video has been a long time coming. I've hesitated to make this video because I feared that some of you would find it

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.369
so flipping obvious that they wondered why I thought this would be of any interest to anyone. Does anyone really not know this stuff?

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.500
Or others would find it so tremendously obscure that again they would be quite critical of the choice of subject matter.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.389
But in this video, which is sponsored by my friends at the Great Courses Plus (more of that later),

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.660
I'm going to talk to you about muzzle brakes. [Particularly those on tanks.]

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.400
Now I started making little plastic models of armoured fighting vehicles from World War Two when I was pretty tiny.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.200
I couldn't say for certain when I made my first kit, I'm pretty sure it was an Airfix kit.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.899
But I do remember making this kit when I was 8 years old.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.400
So this kit is of a Puma armored car. Now can you see that on the end of the barrel there, there is a thing.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.140
It's got holes in the side of it, so that you can see ... all the way through it.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.279
And it's a big bold thing on the end of the barrel and I didn't know what it was.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.079
I had no idea what it was and my eight-year-old self had that level of curiosity that

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.780
made me think: I wonder what it is? How come some barrels have that on the end?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.920
But on the other hand I just sort of accepted it. ... That's the shape of the end of a barrel.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.619
But as the years went by and I made more and more kits,

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.500
I saw that some had these funny things on the end of the barrels for which I had at the time no name, and others didn't.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.040
And I tried to spot a pattern, tried to understand what it was.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.880
So, is it that the small guns don't have them and big guns do? Well, here is a very small gun.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.279
This is a 37 mm anti-tank gun, which is going to come into focus eventually, there we go.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.769
And you can see that it's got no barrel [muzzle] brake. It's just got a tube with a hole in the end of it.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.250
And take this Jagdtiger for instance, or if you don't, well take this one.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.200
I think I made these when I was about 10 or 11.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.868
Anyway, this is an enormous German tank destroyer, with an enormous gun at the front,

00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:57.539
and as you can see there's no barrel [muzzle] brake.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.060
It's just, again if it comes into focus which it might if I put it in front of my face

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.040
(this camera I think senses my face and ... focuses on faces if it can),

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.540
so yeah, OK. See it's just got no barrel [muzzle] brake. It's just a big long tube.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:22.140
So how come some things like, for example, this Panther tank do have a barrel [muzzle] brake on the front and others don't?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.780
It's a mystery. Well, it was a mystery to me.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:34.280
And then, quite recently, I was talking to a tank commander on the Newcastle town moor where they were doing a military demonstration,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.400
and he was a Challenger tank commander, and I was talking to him and his ... crew (smashing bunch of lads)

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.820
and I brought up the topic of muzzle brakes and he said something very interesting.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.800
He said, 'What's a muzzle brake?', and I thought right, OK, I'm making this video

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.300
because if a tank commander doesn't know what a muzzle brake is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300
then presumably there are quite a few people out there who don't know what the muzzle brake is or what they're for.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.649
And and then, you know, they might find this video interesting. Because I did eventually

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.000
find out what a muzzle brake was. And how did I do this? Well something wonderful came along, and it was called the internet.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.809
I remember I was at university, it was the first time I had access to the internet

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.420
and I thought, right I can ask this anything.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.200
And so I thought, what what's the sort of question I can ask the internet which I wouldn't be able to find out some other way?

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.000
Got it. Is that guy smoking loads of cigarettes in the film Brazil, is that Terry Gilliam? And I found out yes, it is.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.600
So there you go. That was ... the biggest thing had been bothering me for years, and I'd finally ... put that one to rest.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.929
Yes, the guy in the film Brazil (which is excellent by the way you really should see it)

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.999
smoking all the cigarettes on the stairs, that's Terry Gilliam the film's director. But then, shortly after that ... this was before Google

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.500
oh yes, oh yes, I can remember a time before Google, I'm that old ...

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.700
when I was able to eventually (using the power of the internet) to find out what these things are called and what they're for.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.519
It was difficult to search for something that you don't know the name of, but eventually I managed it.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.110
And I sort of solved the mystery. And just ... to point out some more of the depths of this mystery,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.900
think of ... the Sherman tank here for instance.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.900
This is a Sherman, it's an American tank.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:23.440
And it has a 75 mm multipurpose gun with no barrel [muzzle] brake. You see, no barrel [muzzle] brake, just a smooth tube.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.720
And that fired both high explosive and armour-piercing and they had a very good

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.280
high explosive shell, so they thought well let's put a similar gun in the Churchill. So they did, and here is the British equivalent.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.379
It is a Churchill it's got a very similar gun that fired the same ammunition, and it does have a barrel [muzzle] brake with the holes in the side.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.280
So sometimes even the same gun firing the same ammunition can ... have one. But wait a minute, this

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.150
doesn't go by tank either because this is another Churchill. This one is a Churchill with a six pounder gun in the turret. [No muzzle brake!]

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.170
They carried on, the British carried on, putting six pounders in about one in five

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.669
Churchills right the way to the end of the war because the six pounder had an enormously superior

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.420
armour-piercing capability over the American 75. So it was worth having some

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.420
Churchills about the place with that gun. But wait a minute, this is a Churchill [mark] eight and

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.270
this has a short stubby 90 mm [95?] howitzer in the turret.This is for firing smoke and high-explosive principally,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.550
and that's not a barrel [muzzle] brake. No, it may look a bit like a barrel [muzzle] brake,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.020
there's a bulge on the end of the barrel, but that's actually just a counterweight to counterweight the

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.140
weight of the breech to balance the gun out a bit. It doesn't have holes in the side, that's not a barrel [muzzle] brake.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.679
So there you can see, I was mystified. Some guns do, some guns don't, what's it all about?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.640
Right.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.449
So. What are the functions of a barrel [muzzle] brake?

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.139
Muzzle brake, a muzzle brake is a better, more accurate term for them.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.300
So the muzzle is ... the front bit of the gun.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.580
So, a barrel [muzzle] brake has two main functions.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.890
One of them is to do with smoke management. You see when you fire a gun all that smoke,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.800
all the impurities of the propellant that actually shoves the shell out the front of the barrel,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.830
all that then follows the shell and goes out in front of you if you just fire down a straight tube.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.460
So, you see your target, you're ah, there he is, brilliant,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.979
OK put the crosshairs on it and bang, and it disappears, because ... you've just put loads of smoke in front of yourself.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.270
You can't see so well, so you're looking through the sight and checking with the binoculars.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.600
And where's it gone? Where's it gone? And, yeah,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.400
most of the time the smoke wasn't so bad and in tanks you normally could get off a useful second shot.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.399
But sometime it was a problem, and shooting out loads of smoke in front of a gun obscures the target.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:50.909
Whereas, the barrel [muzzle] brake channels the smoke sideways, giving you a much clearer view ahead of you.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.939
So that's one major advantage of the barrel [muzzle] brake (muzzle brake, keep saying barrel brake)

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.949
And if you've got artillery that point their guns straight into the sky, then you might want to manage your smoke

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.699
so it goes sideways so you don't give away your position to the enemy spotters,

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.510
who may be a very, very long way away,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.859
who just see where little puffs of smoke way over there

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.660
against that dark forest or something and they can pick it out. ... So perhaps you might give your position away

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.500
if you've not got a barrel [muzzle] brake. So smoke management is one of the reasons.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.900
The other reason is recoil.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.840
You see, if you've got a tube then everything that goes that way up the tube (the shell and all the blast of the gas)

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.940
creates an equal and opposite reaction (Newtonian physics) and you get recoil.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:46.600
So as you fire the gun it goes "kaboom" back into the turret of ... whatever the vehicle is that you're in.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.209
So if you've got quite a small turret, and you've got quite a powerful gun

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.750
that's got a heck of a kick in it,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.900
then what will happen is that the breech (if you don't have a ... muzzle brake)

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.600
it'll shoot backwards and smack into the back of the turret.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:07.079
Obviously ... before they built the turret they worked out how long the recoil was and then built the turret accordingly.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.729
But imagine you've got a tank of a certain ... size turret, and you can't make the turret any bigger,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.440
if the recoil is too great you won't be able to fit that gun in the turret.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.740
But, if you put a muzzle brake on the end, then that'll lower the recoil,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.900
the breech won't shoot backwards quite so far, and maybe you can fit that gun into the turret of that vehicle.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.849
So, that's another reason. You lower recoil and lowering recoil is good for other reasons.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.100
It's good for the crew comfort for instance. The whole vehicle doesn't rock back onto its ...

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.600
suspension quite so violently.

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:45.028
And perhaps your second shot is a little bit more accurate

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.000
because you haven't shaken up the whole vehicle and thrown out the alignment of the sights quite so much, so you don't have to

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:58.179
compensate and re-lay the gun. So it's good for accuracy and possibly, very slightly, good for for rate of fire.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.070
It's good for vision of the target.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.200
So it makes the gun better.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.949
And here's how it works. The furious riot of expanding gas and smoke that causes the shell to hurtle up the barrel is

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.720
set free just as the back of the shell leaves the end of the barrel,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.369
but is still within the muzzle brake. Then the gas which is set free

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:24.580
which is shooting forward at tremendous speed hits the sides of the muzzle brake and

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.720
pushes against them and is channelled outwards and

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:36.129
transfers huge amount of forwards force on the end of the barrel, counteracting the recoil of the gun.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.309
So, whereas if you have no muzzle brake everything just flies out the front,

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:48.639
with this everything is channelled sideways. The smoke goes sideways and a lot of the force

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.800
pushes forwards on the end of the barrel causing lower recoil.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.400
Well, the amount of recoil is the same, but it's counteracting that recoil.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:04.389
So that means that the gun doesn't fly backwards so violently and you can fit a bigger gun into a smaller turret.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:11.800
And you don't get the violent crash that all the crew has to feel and so that's better then.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.530
Or is it? Right well, I'll talk about whether it's better or not in a moment.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.959
But first I should say something about my kind sponsors.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.239
Yes, the Great Courses Plus. The Great Courses Plus is a huge website. You can visit it and

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.259
there you can see on it loads and loads of lecture courses.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.829
I found a very interesting one for instance that's on palaeontology.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.119
Now I have a degree in archaeology and a lot of people go: 'Oh wow, archaeology.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.429
I find that really interesting, so tell me about the stegosaurus then.' Ah, no, that's palaeontology.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:49.330
I did archaeology which is digging up the remains of the human past. But anyway, I suppose it's related and

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.569
we all like dinosaurs, don't we? Only this course is a bit more serious.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:58.030
It's not all about you know the famous stuff like the brontosaurus and (... did the brontosaurus even exist?)

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.069
and the stegosaurus and the triceratops and the tyrannosaurus rex and all those ones.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.800
Instead, it's a bit more academic (a bit more interesting I think for it)

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.120
in that it looks about how fossils are formed, how they are discovered

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.500
and how they are interpreted and all that sort of thing. It goes through all the important ages, geological ages,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.720
many of which precede the tyrannosaurus rex by quite a lot of millions of years.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.900
Anyway, I'm going to be looking at that one.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:30.360
But you, of course, can pick from loads and loads of courses. And for one month you can do so absolutely for free if

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.380
you type in this address, which is appearing on your screen now.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.790
www.TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/Lindybeige then that will take you to an offer.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.930
It's actually much easier by the way to click on the link which I'll put in the description so short click ...

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.869
Short link and you just click on it and voom you're there. Much easier.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:55.280
And you will find that you can get one free month looking at any of the courses you care to have a look at.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:03.700
Typically there are about 24 lectures in a course, and each one is about half an hour long, so it's 12 hours per course of facts.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.599
And, if you don't like it, at the end of the month you can decide it's not for you,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.680
all you have to do is is cancel and then you won't owe a bean.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:19.200
So there you go. Why not go to the Great Courses Plus, give them a look and ... I hope you like it.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.540
Anyway back to muzzle brakes. Now, you may think: 'Oh well, muzzle brakes are great. They manage the smoke better, and they lower the recoil.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.579
That's just good, good so all guns clearly will have muzzle brakes.'

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.470
Well, no, there are several reasons not to have a muzzle brake. If you look at modern Main Battle Tanks, as

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:42.499
they're sometimes called, the Challengers, the Leopards and the Abrams and so forth, none of them has a muzzle brake.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:49.080
The reason for this is that they use kinds of ammunition that muzzle brakes interfere with.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:56.200
Now, this is actually is a problem that the British had during World War Two with the Firefly. Now, the Firefly was stupendously powerful

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.660
(I've mentioned this before), it had an excellent 17 pounder gun.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:06.900
But the British developed something called discarding sabot ammunition which was

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.210
amazingly powerful, and will put a hole right the way through a Tiger.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:18.969
But the way it worked is it had an outer jacket and an inner core of some ... very, very hard material like tungsten.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:25.680
And because the outer jacket made the whole shell bigger to fit into the barrel,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.220
then you got loads of gas pushing against that large

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.340
cross-sectional area on the back of the shell giving a huge push down the barrel.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.120
And then when it was set free at the end, the jacket on the outside would break away,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.840
lowering the air resistance, and the

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:46.299
the tiny thin shell that was in there would be flying at stupendous speed off

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:52.298
into and perhaps through its target. Great, except that the muzzle brake

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.400
could sometimes interfere, so as the discarding sabot started to break up immediately it left the end of the barrel,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.980
it would sometimes collide with bits of the muzzle brake, which might just knock the the inner

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:10.358
core slightly interfering with its accuracy. At short ranges it wasn't a problem, but at very long ranges sometimes with the discarding sabot

00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:15.699
they had only a 50% chance of hitting, which isn't terribly good by the standards of the day. ...

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:23.500
(They would normally expect something like a 98% shot hit chance, so, yeah, 50% is really bad.)

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.860
But modern tanks use loads of discarding sabot rounds, they also use folding fin.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.980
So you imagine it, you've got the fins which fold into the shell as it's travelling up the barrel,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.640
and then when it's set free at the end, the the fins ... fly out and just like a

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.260
playing dart when you're playing darts in the pub, guide the shell onto its target.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:54.120
And again ... those fins and the modern discarding sabot the ... muzzle brake gets in the way.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.580
So that's one reason you don't want it.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.680
Another one is it makes the gun longer and heavier and more expensive, and they're all bad.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.738
Now why would you want a barrel to be even longer? You see, length of barrel is a problem. Let's go back to the Panther.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.640
The Panthers barrel as you can see sticks out in front of the tank quite a way.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.360
And if you turn it sideways it sticks out an awfully long way.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.819
So if you want to camouflage your ... Panther by sticking it in a wood well, that's great.

00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:27.128
But then when you try to turn your turret in the wood, you're almost certain to hit a tree and so you can't actually point

00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:29.700
the gun the way you want to point it. This was a big problem if you're a Panther.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.700
But if you're a Churchill, not a problem because the Churchill barrel

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.540
didn't actually stick out over the front of the tank. So you could just come ... into the wood,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.520
push over a tree and turn your turret wherever you flipping well want it ... and shoot that way.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.640
Great tanks Churchills, I think I might make a video about just how great they were.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.639
Possibly the best tank of the war, and that's not just because they're my favourite.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:57.649
Now another reason you might ... not want a barrel to be long is that if you're in something like this,

00:15:57.649 --> 00:16:00.700
which can't even turn its turret at all because it has no turret,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:07.800
you need to get to the battlefield. And the battlefield was in 1944, let's say, in rural France and

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:11.599
you need to get across a river which meant that you have to go over the bridge, and the only

00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:17.179
load-bearing bridge in the area would be not in the middle of the country, it would be in a town or in a village.

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:24.500
So if you go into a rural ... village in 1944 France, a village that was laid out

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:30.680
with roads that were wide enough for a cart (because that's what they were using when they laid the village out),

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.100
well when you get to a corner and you try to turn that corner ...

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:38.749
you'll probably find that there's a telegraph pole, a lamppost or indeed a building

00:16:38.819 --> 00:16:42.019
that prevents you from turning the corner because this is a very long

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.659
vehicle with a very long barrel sticking out the front of it.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.459
So you then have to halt and maybe demolish a building before you can get round the corner, delays,

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.589
and that's very inconvenient.

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:54.800
So anything that makes your barrel even longer is not good.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.760
Now you'll notice that this has a very long ... very high velocity

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:01.669
anti-tank gun on the front of it [Panzerjager IV L/70],

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:04.339
and yet it has no barrel [muzzle] brake.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.380
The main reason they didn't have a barrel [muzzle] brake (in fact the early versions of this did have a ...

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:15.438
muzzle brake, but they then removed it) because this is a very low

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:21.318
vehicle and when it's gun is pointing straight forwards, which it is not at the moment because I've modelled it

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.409
with it in transit mode, you can see the little thing ... holding the barrel there.

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:29.749
It was a part in the kit, and I wanted to use it. I was young.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:35.538
But anyway, the barrel is only about three feet off the ground which means that when you fire it,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:43.760
it was so close to the ground that it tended to throw up a huge amount of dust which blinded the crew actually worse than

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.729
having no barrel [muzzle] brake. So they got rid of the barrel [muzzle] brake on that because the gun was so low.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.950
Now this side blast. This side blast could be really quite substantial.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.260
And to give an example, I'm going to read you a bit from a book.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.020
Now, just before I do that, you have to understand something. This is an ordinary Sherman.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.560
Now the narrator of the book that I'm about to read from, Ken Tout, it's called Tank!,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.900
he was in one of these and his tank was called Stoney Stratford. This is an ordinary Sherman, no barrel [muzzle] brake, 75 mm gun.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:22.959
But he called for Charlie tank. Charlie tank was their code name for the Firefly. The Firefly, enormously powerful gun with a

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.459
barrel [muzzle] brake. So, with that in mind, let's see how things went.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:35.109
"The invisible 88s are probably SPs firing hull down from behind the Robertmesnil [Robert Mesnil] ridge.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.530
Only inches of their flat steel turrets need to protrude above the ridge a thousand yards or more away, and

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.480
behind the hedges their shapes merge

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:50.199
so that only the flashes of their guns will betray them. I fire again and again at remembered flash points. Other guns alongside and

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.200
behind me are sending tracer arrows into that same area of confused hedgerows.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.200
Keith [on intercom]: 'Gunner, cease fire.'

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.650
He switches to the A set.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:03.249
'Hello Roger three Baker, can our Charlie move over and lend some weight, scare the nasties if they're still there. Three baker over.'

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.280
'Hello, three Baker. Good idea - over to you.'

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.800
'Hello Roger three Charlie, you heard, take your line from Baker, three Charlie over'

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.600
'Charlie, understood, on my way, off'

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:17.100
Keith: 'Gunner use coax and brass up those hedges to give Charlie his target.'

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:24.820
I fire short bursts into the skyline. A shock blast sends Stoney Stratford keeling over to the left. A breath of torrid air,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.360
a deafening detonation, icy fingers of death claw at my veins.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.360
I start my escape leap.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:37.900
Then I realized that we've not been hit, except for the killer blast from our own Charlie's 17-pounder muzzle.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.550
He's fetched up too near to us and is almost as much of a danger to us as are the Germans.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.789
With the sensations of his first shot still rocking and terrorizing us, his AP shot smashes into the hedgerow,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.239
or something behind it, and opens up a great ragged hole of fire.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.550
He goes on firing as quickly as his loader can load. Half a dozen shots spaced along the offending skyline.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.130
Nothing fires back.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.120
'Roger three Charlie, cease fire. Resume your normal position, three Charlie, over.'

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.340
'Three Charlie, over, okay, off.'"

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:17.679
So, the side blast from a big gun can be horrendous. Now if ... the muzzle of a gun were here,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.950
pointing that way and had a muzzle brake on it and the gun fired,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.140
it would it would just take my head clean off. It would blow my head clean off my shoulders.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.900
I was talking [e-mailing] to a Canadian tanker in the modern army

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:35.949
and he said that he was on an exercise when a largish tank gun that did have a barrel [muzzle] brake fired.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.780
He wasn't standing right next to the tank.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.609
He was standing behind the tank and quite some distance away from it, but he said that even there,

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.469
he felt as though a giant had taken a massive pillow and hit him

00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:53.900
really, really hard backwards. The blast from big guns is very substantial,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.479
and if you've got a muzzle brake then that blast, rather than being directed at your enemies,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:05.200
is directed sideways where a lot of your friends might be. And if you're in the enclosed turret of a tank you can't be completely certain

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.760
where all your friends are. I remember reading an account on the Russian front of

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.319
a German SP that was just about to be overrun by Russians,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.350
they were running at it from the front, and for some reason they couldn't get a

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.030
machine gun to bear on them and so they did the only thing which was left open to them,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.759
they just fired the main armament. They knew they wouldn't hit anyone.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.459
The shell swooshed past all the Russians, hitting none of them.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:33.610
But the blast did the job. They were able to get away because, in the words of the military report written at the time,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.639
'the enemy were in no condition to proceed'. The blast just knocked them all out.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:50.500
So the side blast from a ... substantial thing like this is not something to take lightly.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:56.530
And that's one reason that you don't necessarily put a barrel [muzzle] brake on a gun if you can get away with not doing so.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.559
So, of course the smoke going sideways can of course blind all the guys next to you as well. [The noise as heard by the firer is a lot louder too with a muzzle brake.]

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:09.039
So it's a bit of a mixed bag, a bit of a mixed blessing perhaps the smoke going sideways.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.440
So, ... muzzle brakes are not necessarily...

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:19.180
(muzzle brakes, it sounds like a Jewish congratulation: "Ah! Muzzle brakes!"), anyway, ...

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:25.779
they're not necessarily good. And it seems that if people could get away without putting one on, they did.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.510
Bye.
